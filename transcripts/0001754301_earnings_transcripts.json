Welcome to the Fox Corporation's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Charlie. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2026 first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Steven Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.\nPlease note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, or EBITDA as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We also refer to free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThank you, Gaby, and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our fiscal first quarter earnings.\nFiscal 2026 started strong across our businesses with revenue growth of 5% and EBITDA growth of 2%. Advertising revenue grew 6% during the quarter despite not having last year's political revenue with robust trends at news, sports, entertainment and Tubi. This is supported by a gain in engagement across the portfolio, which distinguishes us from our peers and again underscores the strength of our brands and the leading positions they hold in our ecosystem.\nDistribution revenue grew by 3%, with subscriber declines remaining below 7% for the third consecutive quarter. The momentum in Q1 is continuing into Q2, led by a very healthy advertising market for us, stemming from both the upfront and from a strong scatter market. In fact, we are enjoying the most robust advertising market we have seen for some time.\nAlso in this quarter, we launched FOX One. Though it's only been 2 months, we are encouraged by the enthusiastic response to the product. Subscriber trends have exceeded our expectations with those subscribers coming through direct acquisition and partnerships. We continue to believe that our content is best served as part of a bundle, whether it's in the pay-TV bundle or a direct-to-consumer bundle as it provides value and choice to the consumer.\nAt FOX, we are distribution agnostic. We are committed to ensuring our networks and content reach as many households as possible. With that in mind, we launched 2 FOX One bundled partners earlier this month, ESPN and Verizon. These will build upon the strong momentum we have achieved with our groundbreaking Amazon Prime channels partnership. Kudos to everyone at Amazon from Andrew Jassy down for their tremendous and brilliant support of the service. You all have done just a tremendous job.\nUnsurprisingly, in terms of engagement, we have a balanced mix on FOX One with news driving audience and reach during the week and sports events doing the same over the weekend. Across all forms of distribution, interest and engagement in FOX's portfolio of live sports is increasing. FOX Sports kicked off the fall season with solid momentum. The NFL on FOX is off to a great start, averaging almost 22 million viewers in September, a 12% increase over last season and FOX's best start to an NFL season ever.\nAnd FOX's America's Game of the Week ranked as TV's #1 show through the end of September with an average of 30 million viewers. And our schedule only looks better from here right through to the NFC championship at the end of the season. Interest in college football continues to reach new heights as well. Through the end of September, FOX's Big Noon Saturday window averaged over 6 million viewers, up 22% over last season. The strong start was punctuated by nearly 17 million viewers trading into watch Ohio State versus Texas, the most watched week 1 college football game ever on any network.\nLike with the NFL, we head back -- we head into the back half of the college season with a strong roster of Big Ten and Big 12 matchups, highlighted by the Michigan, Ohio State game and capped off by both the Big Ten and Mountain West Conference championship games.\nAnd while we thought last year's Dodgers-Yankees World Series would be a tough act to follow, Major League Baseball has once again performed well for us. Regular season ratings were up 3%. And as we go into game 6 of a spectacular World Series, our total post-season advertising revenues will likely surpass last year's.\nSpeaking of revenue, Tubi achieved 27% revenue growth in the first quarter, driven by an 18% increase in total view time. This overall engagement trend has continued into Q2. Our expansive content library and our differentiated user base have solidified Tubi's position as the top premium AVOD platform in the U.S. And I'm happy to say Tubi reached profitability this past quarter. It's a great milestone, a credit to the Tubi brand to our viewer experience and to the revenue momentum we are seeing. This will likely lead to a partial moderation in the overall net investment we expected to deploy across our digital initiatives this year.\nFOX News sustained its strong ratings and audience momentum throughout the quarter. FOX News, once again, cemented its status as the most watched cable network in total day and in Primetime. Even more impressive, FOX News is the most viewed network in all television in weekday prime calendar year-to-date. This engagement and share led to the highest first quarter ad revenue in FOX News Media history with higher pricing across both direct response and national advertising during the quarter.\nBreaking news coverage throughout the quarter also drove strong engagement at FOX News Digital, fueling growth in page views and minutes versus last year. FOX News Digital closed the quarter with over 6.5 billion social media video views, its highest total ever. The strong Q1 results we have just reported, coupled with the ongoing trends we are seeing across the company, give me great confidence in the positive outlook for FOX. This is particularly underpinned by the strength of the advertising market, our leadership position across news and sports and by Tubi reaching quarterly profitability earlier than expected.\nComing off a record fiscal 2025, fiscal 2026 will again highlight the uniqueness of our strategy, the quality of our assets, our ability to deliver on screen and financially and the overall strength of our financial position. This confidence is clearly demonstrated by this morning's announcement of a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction. Consistent with our track record, we remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner.\nAnd now let me turn it over to Steve for more on the results.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone.\nFOX has made a strong start to fiscal 2026, highlighted by robust total company revenue growth of 5%. Advertising revenues were up 6% over the prior year, even with the tough comparison to the start of last year's record political cycle, driven by continued momentum at Tubi, strength in pricing at news and pricing and ratings growth at sports.\nDistribution revenues, which now include both affiliate fees for our linear channels as well as subscription fees for our direct-to-consumer streaming services grew 3% over the prior year. Content and other revenues grew 12%, primarily due to higher entertainment content deliveries in the quarter. Total company expenses were up 6% year-over-year, largely due to investments in our digital-led growth initiatives and higher entertainment programming costs. This was partially offset by lower sports programming costs.\nAs a result, quarterly EBITDA grew 2% to $1.07 billion. Net income attributable to stockholders of $599 million or $1.32 per share compares to the $827 million or $1.78 per share reported in the prior year period. Excluding noncore items, adjusted net income was $686 million and adjusted EPS was $1.51, equating to a year-over-year increase of 4%.\nNow turning to our operating segments, where at our Cable Networks, revenue grew 4% over the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were up 7%, driven by robust pricing at FOX News, which more than offset the advertising impact from the absence of Copa America at our cable sports networks. Cable distribution revenues grew 3% in the quarter as pricing growth from our affiliate renewals outpaced the impact from industry subscriber declines, which continue to run at under 7%. Cable content and other revenues increased $13 million, led by higher sports sublicensing revenues.\nCable expenses grew 2%, primarily due to higher sports programming rights and production costs led by international soccer rights. This was partially offset by lower news gathering costs relating to our coverage of last year's presidential election cycle. All in, EBITDA at our Cable segment was $800 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter.\nTurning to our Television segment, where we delivered 5% growth in revenues. Television advertising revenues were up 6%, driven by continued growth at Tubi and strong sports pricing and engagement led by the NFL. This was partially offset by the absence of last year's political advertising revenues. Television distribution revenues grew 2% over the prior year quarter as healthy growth in fees across FOX owned and affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines.\nLooking forward, with stable to improving subscriber erosion trends, we expect continued total company distribution revenue growth for the full year. Reflecting the flow of our commercial terms with distributors in fiscal 2026, we would expect this growth to be driven by our Cable segment. Television content and other revenues increased 17%, primarily a result of higher content revenues tied to our entertainment production studios.\nExpenses at the Television segment grew 4% year-over-year, driven by higher entertainment programming costs and higher content costs at Tubi. This growth was partially offset by lower sports programming costs, primarily from the absence of WWE and last year's broadcast of the UEFA Euros. All in, quarterly EBITDA at our Television segment grew 7% to $399 million.\nNow turning to cash flow. Free cash flow was negative $234 million in the quarter. This is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, where the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year.\nWe remain active with our share buyback program, where we have repurchased a further $300 million so far this fiscal year. In addition, as you will have seen in this morning's release, underscoring our confidence in the outlook for the business and our commitment to create value for shareholders, we will enter into a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction, consisting of $700 million of Class A common stock and $800 million of Class B common stock. This transaction will commence tomorrow, and we anticipate it being completed during the second half of fiscal 2026. This is all supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with approximately $4.4 billion in cash and $6.6 billion in debt.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gaby.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community."

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being ordered.\nI will now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Karli. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal [indiscernible] joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer.\nFirst, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.

Before we start, preemptively apologies from my coughing or cold, which Gabi and Steve are thrilled to be [indiscernible] with me, but I'm -- you guys should all be thankful that your -- this is telephonic. .\nWell, Gabi, thank you very much, and thank you all for joining us this morning as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year earnings results. fiscal 2025 was another outstanding year for Fox, demonstrating the strength operationally and financially across all of our businesses and delivering our best year yet. The year was highlighted by our strong financial performance with revenue growth of 17% to $16 billion, EBITDA growth of 26% to $3.6 billion. Adjusted EPS growth of 39% to $4.78 per share and free cash flow growth of 100% to $3 billion, all records for Fox.\nWe also generated record political advertising revenue of well over $400 million across the FOX platforms. FOX's broadcast of Super Bowl 59 broke viewership and advertising records as the most washed telecast in U.S. history, generating over $800 million of gross advertising revenue. and engagement at FOX News led to record audience share, reaching over 70% of the cable news audience at times during the year.\nOur noteworthy fiscal 2025 results were underpinned by a 26% lift in total advertising revenue to $7 billion. The momentum we have reported over the first 3 quarters of our fiscal year continued unabated during the fourth quarter, with 7% growth over last year despite tougher comparisons from last year's UEFA Euro and Copa America soccer tournaments. As we look to fiscal '26, the overall advertising market for Fox continues to be healthy and robust, as evidenced by our recently concluded upfront where we achieved record-setting double-digit volume growth and strong pricing growth across our portfolio.\nThe power of our brands and our ability to deliver engaged audiences at scale across our platforms is exceptionally strong. Nowhere is that scale and engagement more evident than at FOX News. FOX News ended the fiscal year as it began as the most watched cable network in total day and in prime time. In the fourth quarter, total day audience was up 25% in total viewers and 31% in the demo, while maintaining over 60% share of the cable news audience. And now for the second quarter in a row,\nFOX News was the second most watched network in Monday through Friday Prime in all of television, surpassing all but 1 broadcast network. But it's not only linear news driving that performance. FOX News Digital achieved new records for engagement during the quarter with over 1.5 billion YouTube views and over 3.7 billion social media video views, our highest totals ever. Engagement trends are off to a good start in the first quarter of this new year with FOX News finishing at the highest rated television network in America for the month of July.\nNo doubt, aided by must-watch programming, Jesse Watters Primetime and [indiscernible] the leading late night program on television. Fox Sports once again submitted its position, finishing the year first among all networks in live sports. That engagement was driven by an impressive portfolio of sporting events, including a riveting Major League Baseball post season, the launch of Fox College Football Fridays, the NFL on FOX and, of course, the record-breaking Super Bowl 59. And while our fourth quarter has a lighter sports calendar, Fox's first presentation of the Indianapolis 500 was an unqualified success, averaging over 7 million viewers, a 41% gain over last year and the most watched running of the race in 17 years.\nThe power of live sports remains unmatched, and our sports portfolio is an increasing demand by advertisers and viewers alike. We expect that to continue as we charge ahead to autumn when we welcome back post-season baseball, the NFL and College Football on Fox. FOX's big new [indiscernible] kicks off on August 30 with a highly anticipated rematch of last season's college football playoffs semi-final Texas versus Ohio State.\nBy then, you will be able to watch our entire sports portfolio, along with our news and entertainment programming on FOX One our direct-to-consumer streaming platform. FOX One, the truly innovative digital offering launching across the U.S. on August 21 for $19.99 per month. While FOX One will be marketed to cordless market, current pay TV subscribers will also have access to FOX One an authenticated basis. And yes, we will be offering bundling opportunities that make sense to achieve our target objectives. We have said before that our aspiration for FOX One subscribers are modest and our measured investment toward this initiative will match these long-range goals. Speaking of the cordless market Tubi notched multiple achievements in fiscal 2025, including delivering the most streamed Super Bowl in history, exceeding 100 million monthly active users, generating over $1.1 billion in revenue and reaching an all-time high of 2.2% share of total U.S. television viewing.\nThe sustained momentum we have seen at Tubi throughout this fiscal year continued into the fourth quarter with 17% growth in total view time, along with favorable progress in our direct response and partner channels, combining to drive revenue growth of 32% in the quarter. [indiscernible] hard-to-reach audience resonates with advertisers looking to tap to the cordless market as evidenced by this year's upfront results that saw tube volume grow over 35% year-on-year while holding rates stable in a competitive connected TV market.\nFiscal 2025 was a decent year for FOX and a clear demonstration of the efficacy of our differentiated strategy, and there's more to come. On these calls, we have long said that we aspire to engage with our viewers wherever it suits them best. The traditional cable bundle remains our favorite distribution channel as we believe it continues to provide exceptional value to consumers.\nTubi, with 2/3 of its users cordless and outside of the bundle, serves a massive market hungry for free premium content and soon FOX One will additionally service another important audience segment, those wanting a paid targeted offerings encompassing all FOX brands. These pillars of our distribution strategy provide us access to the largest audience possible and will underpin our growth in the years ahead. We enter fiscal 2026 with solid operational and financial momentum across our company. and we look forward to another exciting year that will see the launch of FOX One in just a few weeks, the renewal of 1/4 of our distribution revenue, a healthy advertising environment and, of course, FOX broadcast of the FIFA Men's World Cup beginning later this fiscal year.\nUnderscoring our confidence in the trajectory of the business, this morning, we are announcing a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization with our balance sheet has never been stronger we expect to continue repurchasing our shares while still accommodating our continued program of organic investment and preserving flexibility to thoughtfully invest in new businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. With a strong fourth quarter, capping [indiscernible] already shaping up to be a strong year. [indiscernible] $6 billion, growing an impressive television and cable network programming segments. This growth was driven by both our banner year events, including record-breaking advertising revenues for both engagement and very healthy advertising demand for our sports programming. We successfully completed renewals with distributors represent [indiscernible]\nrevenues were up 47% year-over-year, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues\n[Audio Gap]\ngrowth in adjusted EBITDA. Our advertising revenues increased 7% and led by continued growth opportunities and strong engagement and pricing at news. Total company affiliate fee revenues grew 3% over the prior year quarter once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and focused portfolio of channels. Other revenues grew 33%, driven by higher content revenues. Net income attributable to SOX stockholders was $717 million or $1.57 per share as compared to the $319 million or $0.68 per share reported in the prior year period. Excluding noncore items, adjusted net income was $581 million and adjusted EPS was $1.27, up 41% compared to the $0.90 per share recorded in the prior year. Now let's turn to the Q4 performance of our operating segments, starting with the Cable Network programming segment, which delivered 7% revenue growth and 6% EBITDA growth. Cable advertising revenues grew 15% over the prior year, driven by the strength in FOX News engagement and supported by healthy national and direct response pricing.\nCable affiliate fee revenues grew 2% over the prior year be as pricing gains from our affiliate renewals outpaced the impact from net subscriber declines, which were consistent with the prior quarter at under 7%. We Cable other revenues grew 39%, led by higher Foxination subscribers. Revenue growth at Cable segment was partially offset by a 7% increase in expenses primarily attributable to an increase in sports rights amortization and production costs. Turning to our Television segment, which delivered 6% revenue growth. Advertising revenues at television grew 3% over the prior year led by continued growth at Tubi, which more than offset the tough comparison against the UA European championships and [indiscernible] or America in the prior year. Television affiliate fee revenues increased 4% in the quarter as healthy growth in fees across both Fox owned and affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines.\nTelevision Other revenues were up 34% year-over-year, primarily due to higher content revenues tied to our entertainment production studios. Expenses at the Television segment decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the absence of the prior year broadcast of the [indiscernible] for euros. All in, EBITDA at our TV segment was $308 million, an increase of over 100% as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to cash flow, where we generated robust quarterly free cash flow of nearly $1.4 billion. This strong quarterly free cash flow delivery is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle where the first half of our fiscal year reflects the concentration of payments for [indiscernible] and buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the half of our fiscal year. [indiscernible] get capital allocation and balance et, it is worth noting some key items for this coming fiscal year. From an affiliate revenue perspective in fiscal 2026, we have another relatively light year of renewals with approximately 1/4 of our total company distribution revenues up for renewal.\nIn fiscal '26, we expect to continue to invest in our digital-led growth initiatives. The excellent progress we have made at Tubi reinforces our confidence in tubes path to profitability, and its obvious asset value underscores the opportunity to drive ROI from our digital investments more broadly. TD delivered moderate improvement in profitability in fiscal '25, in line with the expectations we laid out at the start of the year, and we anticipate a more substantial improvement in TV profitability in 2026 which related towards the second half of the year. This total event will support our initial incremental investment in new opportunities, including LatAm sports or notably the launch of FOX One which will be more citrated in the first half of our fiscal year, we launched this offering this month.\nFrom a cyclical event perspective, we look forward to our broadcast of the 2026 World Cup we will span our [indiscernible] fiscal fourth quarter of '26 and first quarter of '27. We are encouraged by the momentum we are already generating and expect this North American World Cup drive strong results for Fox. And finally, as we look at free cash flow, the strong working capital tailwind from the Super Bowl in fiscal '25 will give way to working capital timing headwinds from World Cup, where rights payments for the tournament will land in fiscal '26 while advertising receivables will be collected early in fiscal '27. In terms of capital allocation, in fiscal '25, we repurchased an additional $1 billion through our share buyback program and made approximate $245 million in dividend payments.\nAs Lachlan mentioned, underscoring our commitment to return capital to shareholders. Today, we announced both an incremental buyback authorizing of $5 billion and an increase in our semiannual dividend to $0.28 per share. With the payment of this dividend and taking into account share repurchase activity since year-end, we will have cumulatively returned $8.5 billion of capital to our shareholders since the skin.\nThis includes $6.65 billion of share repurchases and representing 31% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. This is all supported by the strength of our balance sheet where we ended the quarter with approximately $5.4 billion in cash and $6.6 billion in debt.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabi.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community. ."

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Pauly. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2025 3rd quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer.\nFirst, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.

It's a particularly beautiful spring morning in New York this morning. I hope everyone's had a chance to enjoy it. Our fiscal third quarter underscored the central role FOX plays in informing and entertaining America and our financial performance once again demonstrates the strength of the FOX platform. Whether it be our market-leading coverage, what has been a sustained active news cycle or a record-breaking broadcast of the Super Bowl, we delivered across-the-board milestones during the third quarter.\nTotal company advertising revenue grew 65% in the quarter, including the Super Bowl, which generated over $800 million of gross advertising revenue across our businesses. A record for both our national broadcast network and our local TV stations. This year's matchup between Kansas City and Philadelphia delivered 128 million viewers across FOX platforms making Super Bowl LIX the most washed telecast in U.S. history.\nOur affiliate revenues also had a notable quarter with total revenue growth of 3% on the back of higher rates and improved subscriber declines for the third consecutive quarter. These robust results continue to build upon Fox's noteworthy first half and put us on track to complete a strong fiscal year. Notably, these third quarter results reflected the highest free cash flow in FOX's history.\nWhile we recognize the commentary around the macro environment, we have seen no impact to our business. Our ratings and engagement are strong, national advertising scatter pricing is outpacing last year's upfront rates with solid demand and Tubi continues its top line momentum. We remain confident that our best-in-class assets, disciplined approach and fortress-like balance sheet will continue to set us apart.\nIn fact, in just a few hours, we will host America's top advertisers at this year's upfront presentation here in New York. We approached this upfront cycle on a uniquely strong footing, knowing that our focus on live sports and news programming, combined with Tubi's commanding position in the AVOD segments and our exceptional entertainment offering will continue to offer rare value to our advertising partners. Nowhere is Fox's leadership more evident than FOX News, but once again, the FOX News channel finished the quarter as the most-watched cable network.\nBut even more remarkable is that during the quarter, FOX News was the second most watched network in Monday through Friday Prime in all of television, surpassing all but one broadcast network. This combination of an engaged audience and a dynamic new cycle led to record audience share in the quarter.\nFOX News Channel had one of the highest rated quarters in cable news history, growing total day audience 48% in total viewers and 58% in the demo and reaching our highest quarterly share of cable news audience ever. In fact, since the election, FOX News has delivered the top 1,013 cable news telecasts. This ratings and share momentum has carried into the current quarter with April total ratings up nearly 30%, prime time ratings up over 30% and prime time cable news audience share in the 60% range. I should also highlight our digital consumption trends, which demonstrate our newest content is resonating with an expanded audience beyond the linear world.\nFOX News Digital grew page views 18% year-on-year to a record 11 billion viewers and closed the quarter with the highest number of YouTube views in its history. Engagement at Fox Sports is also unmatched in the industry, especially after a solid NFL post season.\nFor the 2024, 2025 television season to date, FOX Sports ranks as the industry leader in live sports event viewership, accumulating 3.3 billion hours of sports event viewing, 17% better than our closest competitor. While the sports calendar in our fiscal fourth quarter trends tend to be quieter, we see strong audience and advertiser demand for our schedule, including NASCAR, the inaugural season of IndyCar and FOX and the start of the baseball season.\nTurning to digital, Tubi delivered another outstanding quarter with revenue growth of 35% year-on-year. This marks an acceleration compared with the 31% growth we posted in the December quarter, which is even more impressive when considering the last quarter benefited from political revenue.\nAs you know, Tubi played an essential role in extending the reach of the Super Bowl, bringing in over 24 million unique viewers on game day and 16 million peak concurrent viewers during the game. Of those unique viewers, 40% were in the 18 to 34 demo, and half of those were female. Reciprocally, the Super Bowl provided a unique promotional opportunity for Tubi, which attracted over 8 million new registered viewers. While engagement on the platform was certainly helped by the Super Bowl, retention and consumption trends at Tubi post the Super Bowl are also very encouraging with total view time up 24% year-over-year in April.\nTubi has established itself as a leading player in the streaming world, offering premium on-demand entertainment and original content that is 100% free for consumers. We think this, combined with Tubi's large, young and diverse, highly engaged audience of mostly cordless viewers offers advertisers an unrivaled value proposition.\nAlso well positioned for the upfront is Fox Entertainment, which had a strong broadcast season, levering the Super Bowl lead-in to launch the third season of the floor. This, along with other top-rated shows like Doc and Universal Basic Guys helped for -- helped FOX to the top spot in prime time season to date among adults 18 to 49. As we wrap up another successful quarter, it is clear that Fox's differentiated and focused strategy continues to outperform. The reach of our brands and our compelling programming led to impressive annual consumption growth of 34% across the entire FOX portfolio during the third quarter.\nWhen it comes to live events and news, Fox's leadership has never been clear. There's a lot to be excited about as we look ahead. The work of our dedicated team of journalists and staff at FOX News and our local stations across which we make substantial investments in news reporting nationally and locally, a compelling spring sports schedule, taking viewers from the race track to the ballpark and the leverage, the elevated brand awareness of Tubi have to drive increased engagement in homes across America.\nWe're also excited about our direct-to-consumer plans. Since the formation of FOX we have created a unique platform of America's best-known media brands across the key verticals of news, sports and entertainment. These are the brands that resonate with our audiences and that advertisers value so highly. Whether it's the Super Bowl, the election cycle or the upfront, our company is at its best when we work together as one. That key attribute is the basis of our upcoming D2C offering, named FOX 1, where targeted consumers, the cordless market outside of pay-TV can find all the FOX brands they love.\nFOX 1 is on track to launch before the football season this fall, and we look forward to sharing further detail about the service in the coming months.\nWith the risk tailwinds from both our strong operating momentum and financial results, we will continue to focus on execution and remain committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. And with that, I will turn the call over to the thoughtful and disciplined, Steve Tomsic, to take you through the details of the quarter.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThank you, Lachlan. Good morning, everyone. As Lachlan said, Fox delivered another quarter of impressive results, highlighted by a 27% increase in total revenues and record free cash flow. Our advertising revenues increased 65%, led by the combination of a record-breaking Super Bowl, accelerating growth at Tubi and strong engagement and pricing at news. Total company affiliate fee revenues grew 3% over the prior year quarter, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and focused portfolio of channels.\nOther revenues grew 20% year-over-year, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues at our Cable segment. Similar to prior quarters, this growth in revenue was largely offset by a corresponding increase in rights cost with no material impact on year-over-year overall EBITDA growth.\nQuarterly adjusted EBITDA was $856 million, as compared to the $891 million reported in the prior year quarter as these revenue increases were offset by higher expenses. This was primarily due to higher sports rights amortization and production costs associated with our broadcast of the Super Bowl. Net income attributable to FOX stockholders was $346 million or $0.75 per share as compared to the $666 million or $1.40 per share reported in the prior year period. Excluding noncore items, adjusted net income was $507 million, and adjusted EPS was $1.10, up slightly compared to the $1.09 per share recorded in the prior year.\nNow turning to our operating segments, starting with the Cable Network programming segment, which delivered 11% revenue growth and 7% EBITDA growth. Cable advertising revenues grew 26% over the prior year, driven by the strength in FOX News linear ratings and digital engagement and supported by healthy national and direct response pricing. Cable affiliate fee revenues grew 3% over the prior year quarter as pricing gains from our affiliate renewals outpaced the impact from net subscriber declines, which continued to improve to under 7%. Cable Other revenues grew 79% due to the higher sports sublicensing revenues I mentioned earlier.\nRevenue growth at the Cable segment was partially offset by a 16% increase in expenses, primarily attributable to an increase in sports rights amortization and production costs, including amortization corresponding to the incremental sports sublicensing revenues.\nTurning to our Television segment, which delivered 40% revenue growth. Advertising revenues at our Television segment grew 77% over the prior year led by Super Bowl LIX, which generated over $800 million in gross revenues. If we exclude the tremendous revenue contribution from the Super Bowl, we still saw solid underlying growth in our TV segment advertising revenues, led by accelerating growth at Tubi. Television affiliate fee revenues increased 4% in the quarter with healthy growth in fees across both Fox-owned and affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines.\nTelevision Other revenues were up 3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher content revenues tied to our Entertainment production studios. Expenses at the Television segment increased 47%, driven by our broadcast of Super Bowl LIX as well as continued investment at Tubi. All in, EBITDA at our Television segment was $60 million as compared to the $145 million reported in the prior year quarter.\nTurning to cash flow, where we generated a record quarterly free cash flow of over $1.9 billion. This strong quarterly free cash flow delivery is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, where the first half of our fiscal year reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year.\nIn terms of capital allocation, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased an additional $800 million through our share buyback program. This brings the total cumulative amount repurchased to $6.4 billion or approximately 30% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in 2019. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $7 billion. This is supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with approximately $4.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. And since quarter end, we repaid our $600 million debt maturity, which came due in April.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gaby.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThanks, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community."

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.\nPlease note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or [ EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call ]. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThank you, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Just to start, I want to comment on the devastating impact of the Los Angeles wildfires over the past few weeks. At Fox, our top priority has been to support our staff who have been profoundly affected in many ways, including losing their homes and much, if not all, of their belongings. We are one family, and we are truly with you.\nAnd to aid the [ broader ] community, Fox has donated and raised over $5 million across our platforms thanks to the generosity of our audiences and employees. But sadly, as we have learned from past fires, the impact on the community is measured not in days or weeks but in years. Our focus has now shifted to the longer-term recovery for those most affected and to the rebuilding of the community around them. I want to thank our colleagues at [ KT TV ] and Fox News who kept viewers comprehensively informed with their coverage of the tragedy as it unfolded. We are deeply grateful for their work and also for the efforts of firefighters and many other first responders. Thank you.\nNow on to our earnings. As you will have seen in the release this morning, our fiscal second quarter results again demonstrates the continued operating momentum and strong financial performance of Fox. Financially, Fox EBITDA more than doubled year-over-year to a second quarter record of $781 million, driven by revenue growth of 20% to just over $5 billion. These results are underpinned by industry-leading affiliate and advertising revenue growth and reflects strong on-screen delivery through our coverage of the presidential election, both at Fox News and across our local stations, strong NFL, college football and [ Major ] League Baseball postseason viewership and continued audience expansion at Tubi.\nWe are firing on all cylinders. Total affiliate revenue grew by 6% on the back of higher rates with subscriber declines improving for the second consecutive quarter. Notably, we have now successfully completed all affiliate renewals that will impact fiscal 2025. Total company advertising growth of 21% in the quarter was driven in part by record political revenue led by our local stations.\nLooked at more holistically across this year's presidential cycle, our first half fiscal 2025 political revenue of over $400 million was also a record. Tubi was a strong contributor to average advertising revenue growth in the quarter. achieving a 31% increase in ad revenues, showing acceleration even when excluding political revenue. And that advertising strength has continued into our fiscal third quarter where we are seeing very healthy trends across our portfolio.\nSports remains remarkably robust. Our NFL postseason broadcast of the wildcard divisional and NFC Championship saw our highest ever unit pricing and demand for these matches. We are sold out with record pricing for this Sunday, [ Super Bowl 59 ]. We can't wait for the big game. Advertising trends at Fox News are also strong across the direct response in national advertising categories, where there is increased demand from existing blue-chip advertisers as well as new clients coming to the network due to its record share of audience.\nAt Entertainment, scatter pricing is currently tracking at high single digits above upfront levels. and cancellation options are at historical lows with Fox delivering its best series debut in 5 years with the launch of the [ medical drama dock ]. And Tubi continues to monetize its hard-to-reach differentiated audience. Now everyone on this call will know that Tubi's audience is diverse and is young. And it is over 65% cordless made up of [ cord nevers and cord cutters ], not currently in the traditional cable universe. While in past years, we have always unlocked the [ Super Bowl ] for viewers across our digital platform this year, we will focus these cordless viewers on Tubi with Tubi's first-ever Super Bowl livestream and related shoulder programming.\nThis will provide viewers a great service, broaden the reach of the game and deliver Tubi an opportunity to engage a large cohort of new users. After the game, Tubi viewers will have access to our library of over 275,000 movies and TV episodes, including the recently premiered [ Des-suite ], the hit original sideline, the [ QB and me ], and much more. The game, the content and the experience on Tubi will further support its stellar growth.\nThe mission for all of our platforms is delivering unique content to large audiences. Nowhere is that more evident than at Fox News where 4.5 billion hours of content was consumed across its platform during the second quarter. On [ elexonite ], more viewers turn to Fox News Media than any other network with over 13.5 million viewers tuning in the pure and [ primetime ]. FOX News Channel once again ended the quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and prime time growing total day audience by nearly 40% and prime time audience by 45% year-over-year.\nFox News meaningfully outperformed its peers more than doubling the viewing of its closest competitor and posting its highest quarterly share of [ Ponton ] cable news audience in its history at over 60%, which includes a 70% share in December. Momentum in share and ratings has continued through and after the inauguration. On the day, Fox News Media's coverage of the inauguration grew close to 12 million viewers, making it the most watched coverage in all of television. This viewership has contributed to Fox News third quarter-to-date ratings up over 50%. [ Primetime ] ratings up over 40% and delivering FOX News a commanding share of the [ primetime ] cable news audience at 69%.\nAnd Fox News share of the audience was not limited to the cable network. For example, on YouTube, Fox News generated nearly 410 million views in the month of January, beating our closest competitor, NBC, by nearly 2.5x. The continued growth of Fox News Digital underscores that audiences are consuming their news in different ways. We clearly saw this during the past election cycle, where there was an uptick in consumers who either supplemented or solely accessed their news and information from nontraditional media sources. We view these new media markets opportunistically and essential to our growth strategy.\nFox News outstanding achievements underscore our unwavering commitment to outstanding journalism to our insightful coverage of politics and breaking news and to our strong [ primetime ] lineup. Of course, our content leadership also extends to sport. Autumn is traditionally the strongest time of year for Fox Sports and 2024 was no exception. With the thrilling [ Major League Baseball World Series, College Football expanding to Friday nights ] and the NFL remaining the most watched content in all of television, Fox was the leader in consumption of live sports events in the second quarter.\nOur only disappointment in sports is that we will not be moving forward with [ Venue ], our sports streaming joint venture with [ Warner Bruges Discovery ] and Disney. While the Venue team has done a tremendous amount of truly genius work preparing the digital platform for launch in the end, the legal distractions around the business became increasingly difficult to bear. Venue was to be another distribution outlet for our brands to access consumers in the market wherever they are. And that is what we continue to be focused on, maximum distribution of our content, whether that be traditional, digital streaming or our own D2C offering in the near future.\nEncouragingly, the distribution market has made some major strides recently. In the 12 months since we announced venue, we have seen key distributors announced the launch of smaller, lower-cost bundles of sports, news and broadcast networks. [ Three ] distributors have announced new skinny packages in recent months. and we expect this trend to continue. We see this as a positive initiative by both our distribution partners and other content owners.\nThe inclusion of [ our suite ] of channels sports and news in each of these offerings is a real benefit to us, even more so than the sports specific venue and so gives us greater confidence for Fox over the long term. We have had a very solid first half of our fiscal year, and we are excited for what is to come. Consistent with our track record, we remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner, and we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term.\nLet me now turn it over to Steve for his comments on the quarter's financial results.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Underscoring the strong momentum we have seen since the start of the year, Fox delivered standout results in the second quarter, highlighted by a 20% increase in revenues and a 123% increase in EBITDA to $781 million, a record fiscal second quarter for Fox. Our overall revenue growth was led by a 21% increase in advertising revenues with broad-based strength across our portfolio, including significant political ad spend collected at our local stations, strong [ MLB ] ratings and robust pricing across our key sports properties, continued growth at Tubi and strong engagement and news.\nTotal company affiliate fee revenues grew a healthy 6% over the prior year quarter, once again demonstrating the strength of our brands and focused portfolio of channels. As Lachlan mentioned, we have now successfully completed all affiliate renewals that impact our [ fiscal 2, 2025 ]. Other revenues grew 70% year-over-year, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues at our Cable segment. Similar to last quarter, this growth in revenue was largely offset by a corresponding increase in rights costs with no material impact on year-over-year overall EBITDA growth.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of $373 million or $0.81 per share was up versus the $109 million or $0.23 per share reported in the prior year period. Excluding non-core items, -- adjusted net income was $442 million and adjusted EPS was $0.96. This represents a more than 180% increase over the $0.34 per share recorded in the prior year.\nNow let's turn to our operating segments, starting with the Cable Network [ programming segment ], which delivered 31% revenue growth and 16% EBITDA growth. Cable advertising revenues grew 32% [indiscernible] over the prior year, driven by the strength in FOX News linear ratings [indiscernible]. Cable affiliate fee revenues grew 4% over the prior year quarter as pricing gains from our affiliate renewals outpaced the impact from net subscriber declines of approximately 7%, improving from just under 8% last quarter. Cable other revenues grew $350 million due to the higher sports sublicensing revenues I mentioned earlier.\nRevenue growth at the cable segment was partially offset by a 38% increase in expenses, primarily attributable to the increase in sports amortization that correspond to the incremental sports sublicensing revenues, along with modest increases in news and sports production costs.\nNow turning to our Television segment, which delivered 16% revenue growth. Advertising revenues at our television segment grew 19% over the prior year, boosted by political advertising revenues, strong [ MLB ] ratings and pricing strength across our sports schedule and continued growth at Tubi. Television affiliate fee revenues increased 9% in the quarter as healthy growth in fees across Fox owned and affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. Television Other revenues were up 33% year-over-year, primarily due to higher content revenues tied to our entertainment production studios. Partially offsetting the revenue growth at our television segment was a modest 3% increase in expenses, which were driven by our continued investment at Tubi. All in, EBITDA at our Television segment grew by $343 million year-over-year to reach $205 million.\nTurning to free cash flow, where we recorded a deficit of $436 million this quarter. This is entirely consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle where the first half of our fiscal year reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year.\nIn terms of capital allocation, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased an additional $550 million through our share buyback program, bringing the total cumulative amount repurchased to $6.15 billion or approximately 29% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in 2019. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $7 billion. In addition, today, we announced a 27% per share semiannual dividend.\nWith this dividend payout of approximately $120 million, our total cumulative cash returned to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share buybacks will have reached approximately $7.9 billion since the establishment of Fox Corp. These capital return measures are supported by the strength of our balance sheet where we ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community."

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter earnings call.

Fiscal 2024 was another successful year for FOX, in which we delivered nearly $14 billion of revenue and $2.88 billion of EBITDA. The year that just ended and the momentum from the start of our new fiscal year underscore the soundness of our strategy, the consistency of our delivery and the strength of our financial position has never been more clear.\nLooking back, there were clear achievements across our businesses in fiscal '24, including delivering strong total company affiliate revenue growth each quarter from our ongoing renewals, cementing Tubi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the United States and generating reinvigorated ratings and share growth at Fox News. The power of our brands and our ability to deliver engaged audiences at scale across our platforms remains remarkably strong. total time spent viewing all Fox brands increased in fiscal '24 despite the absence of the Super Bowl and FIFA Men's World Cup.\nTubi viewing time, as measured by Nielsen, grew 57% in fiscal '24, with absolute growth in minutes viewing, easily surpassing the growth of leading subscription video-on-demand services. Fox Sports big new Saturday was the #1 ranked window in college football for a third straight year, while America's game with a week in an 8-year viewership high this fiscal year. And FOX News was, again, the most watched network and cable news in fiscal '24, with 52% more minutes of viewing than its closest competitor.\nOur foundation for this coming fiscal year is solid as we carry the momentum from fiscal '24 into another year of major events, particularly for our news and sports businesses. The recent news cycle has been nothing short of extraordinary. And when news breaks, people turn to the news brand they trust. The strength of our news coverage is unmatched and Fox News remains the clear first choice for viewers during the most pivotal moments.\nThe fourth quarter saw audience levels return to growth at the FOX News channel driven by our political coverage and strong primetime lineup. FOX News exited the fiscal year as the most watched network in all of cable in total day and in primetime and gained share amongst cable news networks in both prime and total day versus last year.\nFurthermore, the rating story at FOX News continued to improve into this fiscal year, when in July, total viewers grew nearly 80%, and the 25 to 54 demo grew 120% over last year. FOX News had its highest rated weekend ever in primetime in July with over 5.7 million viewers tuning in to its extended coverage of the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\nIn fact, FOX News had its highest share of the cable news audience across the board in prime time since August 2015. And the FOX News channel rated #1 across all linear television in July for total viewers and weekday prime beating the nearest broadcast competitor by nearly 10%. These positive trends bode well for news as we continue through this extraordinary news cycle. But news is not our only business with great momentum.\nTubi is also enjoying impressive viewership metrics and revenue growth. To be improved upon its status as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the U.S. finishing the fiscal year at a record high of 2% of total TV viewing. Tubi saw continued momentum in viewership during the fourth quarter, reaching an all-time high of 81 million monthly active users and growing total [ viewton ] by 17%, driven by an expansive library that offers something for every consumer.\nNot only is the Tubi library, the largest in the U.S., but it also has unique content that audiences can only find on Tubi. Notwithstanding a complex digital advertising marketplace and a tough year-on-year comparison this viewership drove 7% revenue growth during the quarter. Importantly, however, we ended the month of June with revenue growth in the teens, and that pace has continued into this quarter with steady pricing despite increased inventory in the overall market.\nOver at Fox Sports, the fourth quarter was very active, thanks to Fox's \"Summer of Soccer\", which exceeded all expectations and set viewers of records. The UEFA European Championship averaged 1.7 million viewers across the FOX Broadcast Network and FS1, a 34% gain over the 2021 tournament. And Copa America averaged 1.4 million viewers over a 3x increase above the 2021 tournament. The two finals also broke records and now rank as the most watched soccer matches ever on Fox other than World Cup matches.\nBut it's not just soccer that our audiences are watching the summer. The regular season of Major League Baseball is also trending positively and our special broadcast or the Rickwood game and the Major League Baseball AllStar game each performed well above expectations. And in just a few short weeks, we welcome back the NFL and College Football on FOX.\nOur 2024 NFL schedule will start strong. FOX's first for Americas game of the weak windows includes three Dallas [ cabar ] games and a rematch of last year's Chiefs versus [ nor ] Super Bowl. And of course, our schedule and strong to culminating in Super Bowl 59 this February on FOX. Also debuting this fall will be a new lineup from Fox Entertainment, with a return of popular shows like Health Kitchen and the Mask Singer and the debut of new dramas like Hi-Surf and Murder in a Small Town, which many of you saw a preview of at our successful upfront presentation in May.\nSpeaking of the upfront, we see a much healthier market than the nuance one I referred to 6 months ago. As evidence, our upfront commitments were strong. Our focused portfolio of market-leading properties in sports, news, entertainment and streaming delivered year-over-year growth in both linear and digital advertising commitments as well as growth in the overall portfolio pricing in this year's upfront.\nNotably, we saw double-digit volume growth and stable pricing at Tubi, which is a testament to its incredible momentum in the streaming marketplace. At the local level, we are expecting a very robust election advertising cycle that will be weighted to our second quarter. If anything, as the price -- as the poll in tightens, the election map may be extended to more of the markets in which we operate.\nAs we enter a very exciting fiscal 2025, we will continue to focus on execution with events such as the U.S. election cycle at our local stations and FOX News Super Bowl 59 on Fox, the renewal of 1/4 of our distribution revenue and the launch of the Venue Sports streaming service in the fall. Our strong differentiated position, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, underpin our confidence on continuing to deliver meaningful shareholder returns.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Steve.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. Fox once again delivered financially in fiscal 2024 with total company revenues of almost $14 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2.88 billion. We successfully completed approximately 1/3 of our affiliate renewals this year, with the financial benefits of these renewals driving 4% growth in total company in [indiscernible] fee revenues, led by 9% growth at the Television segment.\nOur fiscal 2024 results compare against the prior year of marquee events, including the record-breaking Super Bowl 57, the FIFA Men's World Cup and the midterm election cycle. As anticipated, the comparison to these cyclical events contributed to an 18% decline in total company advertising revenues. Total company other revenues were down 4% year-over-year, with higher sports sublicensing revenues, more than offset by lower content revenues impacted by the SAG and WGA labor disputes.\nTotal company expenses decreased 5%, largely due to the absence of costs associated with the Super Bowl and Men's World Cup in the prior year. However, this was partially offset by the first year step-up under our new NFL rights agreement. Also contributing to this overall decrease in expenses were lower entertainment programming costs due to the strikes. Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.5 billion or $3.13 per share, up versus the $1.24 billion or $2.33 per share reported in fiscal 2023.\nRestructuring, impairment and other corporate matters was impacted by charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation last year and nonoperating other net was impacted by the change in the fair value of the company's investment in Flutter, partially offset by the book gain on USFL assets contributed to the United Football joint venture. Excluding noncore items, full year adjusted net income was $1.65 billion and adjusted EPS was $3.43 a share.\nTurning to our fiscal fourth quarter. Fox delivered total revenues of $3.09 billion, up 2% from the prior year quarter and quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $773 million, up 5% from the prior year quarter. Total company affiliate fee revenues grew 5% over the prior year, with growth at both our television and cable segments supported by our recent cycle of affiliate renewals. Total company advertising revenues were flat as the revenue generated from our Summer of Soccer and growth at Tubi was offset by lower ratings and pricing of the FOX Network.\nTotal company other revenues were down 11% and primarily due to a lower volume of third-party content sales in the current year quarter. Growth in total company expenses was held to 1%. Here, costs associated with the broadcast of the UEFA Euro and Copper America along with digital investments at Tubi were partially offset by the deconsolidation of the USFL and lower programming and production costs at Fox Entertainment from the higher mix of unscripted versus scripted content.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of $319 million or $0.68 per share was down versus the $375 million or $0.74 per share reported in the prior year quarter. Excluding noncore items, adjusted net income in the quarter increased to $423 million, while adjusted EPS grew 2% to $0.90 a share. Now turning to the quarterly results of our main operating segment. Our Cable Networks fourth quarter revenue grew 2% year-over-year. Cable affiliate fee revenues increased 2% with growth in pricing from our affiliate renewals, outpacing the impact from industry subscriber declines running in the mid-8% range.\nCable advertising revenues grew 3% at the at the national sports networks advertising benefited from the broadcast of [indiscernible] Copper America and the UEFA European Championship at FOX News, ad revenues benefited from higher pricing, improved ratings and slightly lower preemptions. Cable other revenues were essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter. Cable expenses were 11% lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the deconsolidation of the USFL and lower programming costs at FOX News, partially offset by the UEFA Euro and Copper America. All-in, quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the Cable segment grew 20% over the prior year quarter to reach $703 million.\nTurning to our Television segment, where we delivered 2% growth in quarterly revenues. This was led by 9% growth in television affiliate fee revenues as price increases across Fox owned and operated and FOX-affiliated stations continue to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Television advertising revenues fell 1% as the broadcast of the UEFA Euros and Copper America and growth at Tubi were offset by lower ratings and pricing at the FOX Network. Television other revenues fell 19% in the quarter, primarily a result of a lower volume of third-party content sales.\nExpenses of the television segment grew 8% over the prior year quarter primarily due to costs associated with UEFA Euro and Copper America and digital investment at Tubi, partially offset by lower programming and production costs at Fox Entertainment. Taking the lease factors into account quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the Television segment declined 35% against the prior year quarter to $148 million.\nDuring the full year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx of $1.5 billion before we get to capital allocation and balance sheet, it's worth [ fighting ] some key items for this coming fiscal year. Most notably, we returned to another major event cycle in fiscal 2025, led by Super Bowl 59, which we expect will drive significant growth in both advertising revenues and free cash flow. However, this is the first Super Bowl under our new NFL contract, and accordingly, we'll have elevated rights amortization.\nWe continue to expect strong political advertising in the first half of the fiscal year from the election cycle which will particularly benefit our Stations Group. From an affiliate revenue perspective, we have a relatively light year of renewals with approximately 1/4 of our total company distribution revenues up for renewal which are more weighted to our cable segment. We expect to continue to invest in our digital-led growth initiatives. Here, Tubi will continue to be the focus of investment spend with the collective digital portfolio expected to deliver improved EBITDA relative to 2024.\nWe also look forward to the expected launch of Venue Sports this fall. As a reminder, our share of ownership results from venue will be recorded below EBITDA in equity earnings. Returning to capital allocation. Over the course of the fiscal year, we returned $1 billion of capital through the repurchase of $40 million Class A shares and a further $250 million in dividend payments, underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns. Today, we announced an increase in our semiannual dividend to $0.27 per share. With the payment of this dividend and taking into account share repurchase activity since year-end, we will cumulatively returned over $7.25 billion of capital to our shareholders since the spin in 2019.\nThis includes $5.65 billion of share repurchases, representing over 27% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. This is all supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby to get started with Q&A.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGreat. Thank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community."

I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 3rd quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. This quarter, FOX continued to distinguish itself from its peers delivering 7% EBITDA growth and demonstrating again the strength of our brands and the advantages of our strategy. This result is even more impressive when considering we are comping to last year's third quarter, which enjoyed a significant tailwind from Super Bowl 57. In the fiscal third quarter, total affiliate revenue fees grew 4% with positive growth at both our Television and Cable segments, driven by pricing benefits from our recent renewals. Headline advertising revenues were down during the quarter as expected, due to the absence of the Super Bowl and fewer NFL broadcast than in the prior year. If not for the difference in our NFL postseason schedule, our total advertising revenues would have increased a few percent. Overall, advertising trends at FOX are clearly moving in the right direction, both in the scatter market and in early upfront discussions. Demand for sports remains robust, while trends at FOX News are improving across the board, including the fact that we have now fully lapped the direct response market issue that had adversely impacted FOX News PR revenues.\n\nAnd while there wasn't much of a primary season this year, we do expect strong political advertising for national and local races as well as local ballot issues in the first half of our fiscal '25 which would largely benefit our station group. As we look to our annual upfront presentation next week, our focus on live content and must-watch events, such as the coming presidential election cycle and next year's Super Bowl combined with Tobi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service will favor our enviable position with advertisers across the FOX portfolio. Operationally, FOX News again ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and primetime. FOX News also strengthened its leadership position inside the category gaining share again, commands 50% of total debuting.\n\nThese gains are underpinned by a dedicated team of journalists and staff who are focused on delivering coverage and insights on current events most relevant to our viewers. Building from our strength in primetime, we are expanding our leadership across day parts, whether that be mornings with FOX & Friends, afternoons with The Five or late nights with Gutfeld. And we expect this momentum to continue as we ramp action coverage heading into the fall. Tubi ended the third quarter with 22% revenue growth driven by a 36% increase in total view time and 20% growth in monthly active users to just under 80 million MAUs. Our expansive content library and our differentiated user base have solidified Tubi's position as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the U.S. with 1.6% of total TV viewing, ahead of Peacock, MAX, The Roku Channel, Paramount+ and Pluto TV and only marginally behind Disney+. Paramount's debut on the Nielsen Gauge in February of '23 to the most recent gauge in March of '24 to be share of total U.S. TV view time grew 60%, which is faster than any other streaming service over that same period of time.\n\nApart from just its growing scale Tubi's also unique and uniquely valuable to advertisers through its reach and through its engagement. Over 60% of Tubi users are classified as cord cutters or cord nevers and 90% of those user time watching is proactively on demand, as opposed to passively watching a fast channel. This positions to be very well as an important part of the growing digital streaming advertising marketplace. We look forward to showcasing Tubi's strengths at next week's upfront. FOX Sports had an impressive quarter with strength across all areas of our portfolio. We finished the 30th anniversary of the NFL on FOX on a high note with 3 NFC playoff games on FOX averaging an incredible 45 million viewers. This was capped with the NFC Championship game growing over 56 million viewers, which is 19% higher than last year's NFC Championship game and the most watched in over a decade.\n\nThis season also reinforced FOX solid position in collar sports with strong viewers from both college football and college basketball. In fact, in the current academic year, FOX has aired the most watched college football, men's College Basketball and women's college basketball games across the regular season. College Sports has grown to become the second biggest source of FOX viewership behind only the NFL. Total consumption of college sports on FOX has grown by over 40% through the last five years. And in the March quarter, we launched the UFL, United Football League, the result of the merger of the USFL and XFL. With this merger, the outlook for spring football is promising, and we are pleased with the results through the midpoint of the season.\n\nWhile the sports calendar in our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter tends to be quieter, FOX Sports is excited to present its summer of soccer, featuring over 200 hours of live soccer coverage across our platform starting with the UEFA European Football Championship on June 14th and Copa America on June 20th. This summer will also feature a new schedule from FOX Entertainment, with returning favorites like Gordon Ramsay's Food Stars and exciting new shows like the 1% Club. This follows a successful spring slate that featured two of the top five new primetime series in Krapopolis and The Floor. With Krapopolis, ranking as the number one new Primetime Entertainment Show and The Floor as the number one game show season to date.\n\nLast quarter, we announced the formation of a new sports-focused digital distribution platform with our partners Disney and Warner Brotherss Discovery. We are happy to have hired truly a world-class CEO in Pete Distad and he is off to a flying start. In just several weeks, the JV now has over 150 engineers and executives dedicated to building a unique, innovative product which focuses on sports fans outside of the traditional TV bundle. We've already launched an internal data service, which I have been trialing this past week, and I have to say it's an incredibly exciting product and we can't wait to launch it this fall.\n\nToday's media market is certainly dynamic, but the strength and leadership of our brands and their capacity to convert those strengths financially underscores our considered strategy. Underpinned by our best-in-class balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and just 1 time net leverage. We remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful balance of managing our existing businesses, pursuing new adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Steve.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX's strategy continues to deliver solid results. Even with the comparison to our blockbuster NFL schedule of the prior year, we posted total revenues of $3.45 billion and grew adjusted EBITDA by 7% to $891 million. Total company affiliate fee revenues grew 4% over the prior year with growth at both our Television and Cable segments, supported by a recent cycle of affiliate renewals. Reflecting the event-driven nature of our business, advertising revenues on a headline basis were down 34% as we compare against last year's broadcast of the Super Bowl, along with 2 less NFL playoff broadcasts in the current year quarter. As Lachlan just mentioned, if not for the impact of these NFL schedule items, total company advertising revenues would have grown low single digits. Total company other revenues were down 22% versus the prior year primarily the result of the timing of sports of licensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter this year. Total company expenses fell 21% year-over-year primarily a result of the NFL postseason schedule differences I just mentioned. Net income attributable to stockholders of $666 million or $1.40 per share compared to the net loss of $54 million or negative $0.10 per share reported in the prior year period.\n\nThis year-over-year variance reflects the growth in EBITDA as well as the absence of last year's FOX News Media litigation charge and a current quarter book gain on the merger transaction of the USFL which is now being deconsolidated in connection with the formation of the United Football League. Excluding these and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $1.09, up 16% against last year's $0.94. Now let's turn to our segment results. At Cable, revenues were $1.47 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter, while EBITDA grew 3%. Cable affiliate fee revenues were up 1%, with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals outpacing the impact of - from industry subscriber declines running in the mid-8% range. Cable advertising revenues fell by 6% or $20 million at the national sports networks, advertising revenues were down due to the absence of last year's Super Bowl-related programming, and the world baseball classic. At FOX News, ad revenues were impacted by moderating direct response pricing declines and lower digital traffic, partially offset by higher national pricing. Cable other revenues decreased $89 million, primarily a result of the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were more weighted towards our fiscal second quarter.\n\nCable expenses were 16% lower than the prior year, primarily due to the timing of the associated sports sublicensing expenses, lower costs at FOX News and the deconsolidation of the USFL. All in and despite segment revenues being down 6%, quarterly adjusted EBITDA at Cable grew 3% over the prior year quarter to reach $819 million. Turning to our Television segment, where revenues were $1.94 billion, down 22% from the prior year, while EBITDA increased 24%. TV affiliate fee revenues grew 9% over the prior year as price increases across our owned and operated as well as 30 FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from subscriber declines. As mentioned previously, TV advertising revenues were impacted this quarter by the composition of our post-season NFL schedule, namely the absence of last year's Super Bowl and 2 less NFL playoff games. As a result, on a headline basis, TV advertising revenues were down 40%. TV Other revenues increased $30 million, primarily the result of the timing of deliveries from our entertainment production companies. While total TV revenues were down versus the prior year, this was more than offset by a 24% decrease in TV expenses.\n\nExpenses were lower in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the NFL schedule along with fewer hours of original drifted prime time content, including the impact of the industry labor disputes. All in, we delivered quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the TV segment of $145 million up 24% over the prior year quarter. Turning to cash flow, where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.39 billion in the quarter reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming, coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. From a capital return perspective, from the commencement of the third quarter through today, we have repurchased $300 million under our share buyback program, along with returning nearly $125 million to our shareholders via our semiannual dividend payment. Our total cumulative buyback activity since the launch of the program in 2019 now amounts to $5.4 billion or 26% of our total shares outstanding and we remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization. These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in gross debt. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby to open the Q&A.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I'd like to emphasize the functionality for the question and answer queue. If you wish to ask a question, please press 1 and 0 on your touchtone phone. You will hear a tone indicating you have been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from queue at any time by once again pressing 1 and 0. If you are using a speaker phone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. It has been requested that you limit yourself to one question. Once again, if you have a question, please press 1 and 0 at this time. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of John Hodulick from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn C. Hodulik\n\nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC\n\nGreat. Thank you, and good morning everyone. Strong growth again at Tubi. I guess a couple of questions on that. I mean, first, what's driving the growth in TVT? Any color you guys can provide on CPMs? Disney yesterday gave you a little color on some weakness in connected TV CPMs. And then three, any color you can provide on dilution at Tubi and maybe how you guys view future profitability of that business? Thanks.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks very much, John. So, let me - I'll start. I'm not quite sure what I understand what you mean by dilution at Tubi, but let me start with the other two. The growth of Tubi continues to be incredibly strong. I think TVT growth comes from both new subscribers or new viewers finding the platform. As you'd be aware, we've very efficiently be marketing the platform to bring more people to it, and it's becoming a wider and wider known and loved brand in the marketplace. And the reason for that is we have - we've talked about it on calls before, with 250,000 movies and television series, on the platform. And now over 250 in fact, I think, around 270 live fast channels on the platform, it really does offer a tremendous product for everyone who's utilizing it.\n\nBut it's very interesting because of all those fast channels and all those 2,000 movies and TV series, 90% of the viewing comes on demand. And this is very important because when the viewing comes on demand and it's proactively on demand, as opposed to passively sort of sitting back and watching our fast channel, that's much more valuable to advertisers. And it certainly is something that we're going to make a big deal about at our upfront presentations next week. So, because of that, we are very confident we can hold our CPMs at Tubi. We're already very efficient with our CPMs. I think some of our competitors priced themselves when they entered the AVOD market over the past 12-18 months are very high, and we're seeing the marketplace then having to drop CPMs as new entrants add supply to the market.\n\nSo, that's affecting the market overall. It certainly has an impact on the market for advertising for Tubi. But from a CPM point of view, it's not really going to be a big impact to us. I should just say, though, that next quarter, we are going to be facing difficult comps in the fourth quarter. I think if you remember, this time last year, Tubi was up 47%, in revenue, and that's going to be a very difficult comp for us next quarter. So, there will be some headwinds for the whole marketplace, but from a comp point of view for Tubi as well in the next quarter. So, that's just a slight word of caution.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Robert Fishman from Moffett. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert S. Fishman\n\nAnalyst, Nomura Securities International, Inc.\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. Given all the press about the NBA negotiations underway, just curious if you can think a little bit as far as your broader sports rights go? And how do you think about the value of FOX Broadcast Network as you negotiate those future sports, right? And then, the flip side of that is you feel like you're at a competitive disadvantage without your own SVOD service to compete for future rights? And then if I can, just separately, given all the M&A discussion in the industry, what are your latest thoughts on monetizing some of your strategic, noncore assets like your FanDuel option and Studio Lot? Thank you.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Roger. So, with the MBI, obviously, I can't sort of comment on other people's sort of negotiations and where that may or may end up. And in terms of how we think about it affecting the value of the FOX Network and our sports portfolio. We're very happy with our sports portfolio. We obviously look at - but packages as they come up but we see them as a portfolio or a bouquet of sports rights that we have, and we feel very strong with the current portfolio that we have, which is one of the reasons why we didn't pursue the MBA in this round of negotiations. But I think it does go to the value of broadcast television because sports leagues still need reaches the - is still incredibly important for them, for them to drive their fan bases, for them to get the maximum amount of viewership to their games and matches.\n\nAnd so, the value of the FOX Network and frankly, our strategically kind of our position station group to any sports league only increases over time is what we're seeing. And therefore, I don't think coming of second part of your question, I don't think we are strategically disadvantaged with not having a subscription video-on-demand service because we found in the past, we can partner with others. Well, frankly, the leagues to tend to partner with others, we can take the rights where we can broadcast to the most amount of Americans possible and they can allocate rights to SVODs as needed. But they're never going to be able to live entirely without a broadcast network and the broadcast distribution.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nYes. So, Robert, just in terms of the M&A picture, our posture on sort of what near-term noncore assets, like we're strong believers in the sports betting market in this country. We read with interest you all not to put $1 billion-dollar value on it. And so, it is now our intention is to see through and eventually exercise. And then the Studio Lot, we think is a long-term asset for us. We have development plans for that. And so, we don't any change in posture around early monetization of those assets. We think they are incredibly valuable for the long term.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nAnd I'd just remind you, it's not only the value of the option, but also the equity that we have in Flutter, which is today worth over $900 million.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nNext question, please, operator?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley . Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Daniel Swinburne\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nThanks. Good morning. Lachlan, just sort of a question around kind of your products coming to market, the streaming JV and also maybe how Tubi might fit in, any more you can share with us on sort of what you think is really differentiated about the product? We haven't seen it yet, you have. And I noticed in the Disney deck yesterday that it says that a definitive agreement hasn't been signed yet. So, I didn't know if there was something holding it up or if that meant anything or any update on sort of the go-forward plan. And then, I'm wondering Tubi with its reach as an app-based service, is that an opportunity for maybe bundling the JV product or merchandising and in some way, you have a pretty interesting direct customer relationship with Tubi. I know it's a different kind of product offering. But I was curious if you thought about leveraging that asset or those two assets together to create more value for the company.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks very much, Ben. So first of all, as I said, I've got actually in the room behind me, I've got the beta version of the streaming app and I don't think we've announced the name yet, so I won't inadvertently do it on this call. I hope not yet anyway. But look, it's something that we've been able to engage with, and it is really looking tremendously exciting, as I said in my comments. It's very innovative. It's designed to be entirely focused on the cord nevers, cord cutters, people who are not in the cable bundle. And we frankly can't - won't be able to compare it to a tier of live channels. It's a very different digital-first product which I'm - when you eventually get it and get to enjoy it, you'll understand how groundbreaking certainly in this country, it really is. In terms of the speed, everyone is running at a sort of full pace to get the product finished and delivered.\n\nObviously, there's the fun side of it, which is like the user interface and how you use it, which has been great to use, but there's a ton of work, obviously, in engineering behind that in ingesting content from multiple partners and being able to combine that into one sort of seamless platform. So, there's a tremendous amount of work that's being done to get them - to get us over the line this autumn but we're incredibly excited. And so, there's no - I wouldn't read anything into a final deal terms being signed. It's just a matter of everyone running on all cylinders to get this finished. So, on Tubi, sorry, the Tubi. We don't see Tubi is a very different product. We don't see an opportunity at this stage, or we haven't contemplated an opportunity at this stage to bundle the sports service with Tubi. I think it makes potentially more sense to bundle sports with other SVOD services, which you'll likely see as we go forward.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jessica Ehrlich from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Reif Ehrlich\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you.  A couple of questions. First, on political advertising. Lachlan, you seem pretty confident that it will come back. But I guess the question is really - will it come back to linear the way it has in the past and what's your overall outlook. Second, on M&A, you may have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. So, I was just wondering if you could explore what opportunities you see out there. There seems to be a lot of things going on in the industry. And then finally, just a follow-up on Tubi, which has I mean such incredible momentum you've really pulled away from certainly all the other fast channels and competing with the big SVOD channels or network platforms. What does it look like over the next three years or so?\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jessica. So on - let me start with political. We are confident - obviously we're disappointed for multiple reasons that there wasn't a more competitive primary season. But we certainly know this is an election which both sides of politics or all sides of politics are very focused on, have raised a tremendous amount of money, and that money will flow ultimately to local television. And we are extremely confident of that. One of the reasons we're confident in addition to the amount of money that we know has been raised are just a position of our stations - specific stations within the group and how that aligns with the political map.\n\nIf you look at the tight - so putting aside presidential election [inaudible] call to talk about sort of national trends and people focus on presidential. But you have to look below presidential and look at sort of Senate races. So, we have tight center races in key markets where we have big stations. And you have to remember, Jessica, these are big new stations, right? And political money tends to run alongside news on local news. And so, there's tight races in Arizona, these are presented in Michigan, certain races in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin. And also, of course, our DC station will benefit from tight race in Maryland. In addition, you've got a lot of issues on the ballot in different markets. So, Arizona, Florida, I think Maryland, again, all have a lot of issue money flowing into those onto the ballot.\n\nSo, we think it's going to be an incredibly strong political season. We're just starting later than we had first expected. And then you traditionally have - when you have a primary - more contested primers. So, we'll start to see the benefit of that in the first half of our next fiscal '25 for us. The next question on M&A and the balance sheet, I agree wholeheartedly. I think we have the best balance sheet in the industry. So, I think that's the math. That's just a fact. And so, we continue to look for accretive opportunities that would align with our kind of strategic goals and initiatives and we'll continue to do that. We obviously don't want our balance sheet to go to waste but we haven't found anything yet that we're going to do or follow. But it is something we are keeping a close eye on.\n\nAnd then on Tubi, what is - how does Tubi look over the next three years? Well, Tubi continues to grow. Obviously, as you get to scale, the growth trajectory, which is just harder to comp with the growth that we've had over the last couple of years. But Tubi continues to grow. Money will continue to flow from linear entertainment television, particularly cable entertainment networks into streaming AVOD and SVOD with advertising supported SVOD services. That trend will not slow, and Tubi will be one of the main beneficiaries of that money flow. So, we're confident in the continued growth of Tubi. And under the leadership of Angele, it just goes from strength to strength.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, that question comes from the line of Michael Morris from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael C. Morris\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys. Two questions, if I could. The first one is on the JV and some of your existing distribution partners have brought up concerns. It's in some way unfair to them for you to have a sports-only JV. It seems that you would disagree by virtue of the fact that you're moving forward. So, I'd love if you could address those concerns and whether you think there will be changes in the marketplace or whether you think those concerns are unfounded. And the second question, a bit more on the model, perhaps for Steve, television profit was, I think, notably strong in the quarter, given that on a year-over-year basis, you did not have the Super Bowl or those extra playoff games. So, can you maybe unpack a little bit? We would think that those types of events would be uniquely profitable so to show profit growth as you comp those challenges. I'd be curious if you could talk about sort of the sustainability and whether maybe we're overestimating how profitable those games are. Thank you.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike. Well, let me start. So, on the sports joint venture and how we certainly view it and how we discuss it with our distribution partners. I think the first thing, and this is incredibly important to us is that we are wholly and fundamentally supportive of the traditional cable television bundle. It will continue to be, for a very long time, our number one revenue stream. And we are all in to support our distributors in every way we can in that bundle and supporting their subscribers and their business. So that's absolutely a fundamental fact for us. Having said that, we've always said it's important for us to put our brands where viewers are, right?\n\nAnd in the universe of sports fans that don't currently take a cable bundle, that is the universe that the sports joint venture will be entirely focused on. And it's frankly important to us that because we are so invested in the Cable bundle, that the sports joint venture will be very targeted and very focused on the nontraditional Pay TV viewer universe. And we think we can very cleverly and very - in a very targeted way market to those subscribers so that we minimize any cannibalization of the traditional subscribers. And so, we're very open with our distributors. We're very open with how important they are to us and also how - because of that importance, how we can focus the sports joint venture and the errors that needs to be focused on.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nMike, it's Steve. Just in terms of television profitability. So, quarter-to-quarter, we were up close to $30 million. The way to think about it is the single biggest event was Super Bowl, which was a high tens of million dollars EBITDA contribution last year versus this year. But then you look at it this year to offset that, we grew affiliate fee in the segment by about $70 million. And so, one for the other basically is a push, TV was a push quarter-on-quarter in terms of EBITDA deficit there. And so, then what's left is the biggest EBITDA sort of driver of contribution when you look at it from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, is the change in entertainment programming costs, which was an ongoing push towards from scripted towards unscripted to get dollar cost per hour down without harming dealership, as well as the impact of the strikes. And so, that's - there's a lot of other puts and takes in there, but there are sort of the big three things that drive it.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nAt this point, we are out of time, but if you have any further questions, please give me or Charlie Costanza a call. Thanks so much for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 2nd quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer.\nFirst, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThank you, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Against the backdrop of an active news cycle and another robust fall sports schedule, our fiscal second quarter, again illustrated the strength of FOX. The growth we delivered in affiliate fee revenues was the standout this quarter, with the television segment growing by 10% and the cable segment returning to growth, once again demonstrating the power of our brands and our programming.\nWe've now largely completed our fiscal '24 affiliate renewal cycle, having achieved our commercial goals without disruption and setting a solid foundation for renewals in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter were down primarily due to comparisons to last year's major cyclical events, including the midterm elections at the TV stations and the broadcast of the Men's World Cup in the cable and television segments.\nParsing through the cyclical comparisons, our content, coupled with the outstanding performance of Tubi is clearly an advantage in a mixed advertising environment. More specifically, sports advertising was very healthy during the quarter, and we saw particularly strong demand for the NFL and college football which continued into the NFL playoffs.\nAt news, the second quarter was more nuanced. While preemptions and the direct response market adversely impacted quarterly growth, we sequentially narrowed the gap between the current and prior year in ratings and in pricing. We were also able to increase our viewing share over the previous quarter and the positive trends in share, ratings and pricing have carried over into the current quarter.\nLast week, I visited our bureau in Jerusalem. Met with our talented and dedicated staff there and saw firsthand the devastation [indiscernible] by Hamas on October 7. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers go after the victims of that day, the innocence killed in Israel and in Gaza and the hostages still denied the embrace of their families and loved ones. The work our correspondents, our camera people and our producers do, reporting on these events is important outstanding and deeply appreciated.\nNow on to sports. In calendar 2023, 96 of the year's 100 most watch telecasts were live sports. FOX was responsible for 29 of the year's 100 most watched shows, more than any other network. This marks the fifth straight year that FOX has topped the industry in live sports viewing and demonstrates the unparalleled reach and engagement our content achieves. The 30th NFL regular season on FOX concluded with an average of 19 million viewers across all games with America's game of the week averaging 25 million viewers and 8-year high. And Fox NFL Sunday logged its 30th straight year as the #1 NFL pregame show. That strength continued into the post season with FOX's 3 post-season windows, delivering a best ever playoff average of almost 45 million viewers across the wildcard, divisional and championship games.\nIn digital, we saw a strong engagement at Tubi, which finished with a very impressive 62% growth in total viewtime and 17% growth in revenue. Tubi's library of over 240,000 movies and TV episodes, coupled with ubiquitous distribution drove engagement, helping Tubi-reach 78 million monthly active users, log almost 2.5 billion streaming hours in the quarter and set a new monthly record of $855 million total viewing hours in December alone. Tubi has consolidated its position in the streaming landscape ranking as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the United States according to Nielsen and surpassing Peacock, Max, Paramount + and Pluto TV in view time for 7 consecutive months.\nAt Fox Entertainment, the second quarter saw programming strength with Fox having the season's #1 new broadcast entertainment series in Krapopolis. Hats off to Dan Harman, the #1 new game show debut in Snake Oil and the #1 cooking series in Hell's Kitchen. We're also pleased with the very strong start of our mid-season lineup and the early success of [ We Are Family ] and the [ floor].\nBefore I hand over to Steve, I'll comment on the sports platform we announced last night between Fox, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. This new and unique digital distribution platform is focused on sports fans outside of existing pay TV offerings. Upon launch in the fall of 2024, the platform will offer a broad suite of sports, including those from a combined 14 linear networks that broadcast sports today. The inclusion of our networks in the platform is consistent with our strategy, being proudly consumer-first and distribution agnostic.\nAcross the distribution ecosystem, our traditional pay TV market will remain our dominant customer base for some time to come. As such, we remain committed to our existing distribution partners, where our strong portfolio of leadership sports, news and entertainment brands thrive in their bundled offerings. This unique new platform opens up a new market for us. One that we at Fox have not accessed before, and they were excited to participate in. As always, we are focused on delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner and we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term. Let me now turn it over to Steve for his comments on the quarter's financial results.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. With the vast majority of our fiscal 2024 affiliate renewals now successfully completed, Fox delivered 4% growth in total company affiliate fee revenues, led by 10% growth at television and a return to growth at cable. This growth reflects the must-have nature of our content and the value that our distribution partners place on it.\nConsistent with our expectations regarding event cycles, Advertising revenues this quarter were impacted by the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup at Fox Sports and midterm political revenues at the local television stations, along with lower advertising revenue at Fox News Media. Collectively, these factors contributed to a 20% decline in total company advertising revenues. Total company other revenues grew by 14%, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues. All in, FOX reported total company revenues of $4.23 billion, down 8% from the prior year.\nTotal company expenses decreased 5% over the prior year primarily due to the absence of the Men's World Cup at Fox Sports and fewer hours of original scripted programming of Fox Entertainment due to the strikes. However, this was partially offset by the first year step-up under our new NFL rights agreement.\nQuarterly adjusted EBITDA was $350 million as compared to the $531 million reported in the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to stockholders of $109 million or $0.23 per share compared to the $330 million or $0.58 per share reported in the prior year period, largely due to the EBITDA impact I just mentioned, along with the net changes in the fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 12%, reflecting a one-off remeasurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in state tax laws. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS was $0.34 per share versus last year's $0.48.\nTurning to our segments. Starting with cable, which reported 2% growth in total quarterly revenues. Cable affiliate fee revenues increased by $5 million, with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals, outpacing the impact from industry subscriber declines running at approximately 8%. Cable other revenues increased $124 million, largely driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues associated with our college sports and international soccer agreements. This growth in affiliate and other revenues was partially offset by a 23% decline in cable advertising revenues.\nAt FOX News Media, advertising revenues were impacted by the direct response marketplace, low comparative ratings and higher levels of preemptions due to our breaking news coverage of global events. Meanwhile, at the national sports networks, we measured against last year's broadcast of the Men's World Cup. Expenses at the Cable segment were 14% lower than the prior year, with savings mainly gained from the absence of the Men's World Cup as well as lower legal programming and production costs at FOX News Media. Taking all these factors into account quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the Cable segment grew 60% over the prior year quarter.\nMoving to our Television segment, which reported total quarterly revenues of $2.54 billion, down 13% from the prior year. The TV segment reported strong 10% growth in affiliate fee revenues as price increases across all FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. TV advertising revenues were down 19%. The solid growth at Tubi was more than offset by comparisons with last year's cycle of major events, including the FIFA Men's World Cup and midterm political revenues as well as the relative mix of world series matchups and game counts.\nAlso at TV, revenue from our entertainment production companies was impacted by the SAG and WGA labor disputes. This contributed to a $64 million decline in TV Other revenues, most of which was offset by a commensurate reduction in expenses. Overall, expenses at the TV segment remained flat as higher costs under the NFL agreement and a modest increase in investment in Tubi were offset by lower costs from the absence of the Men's World Cup, lower college sports rights costs and fewer hours of original scripted content due to the strikes. Together, these revenue and expense impacts led to a quarterly adjusted EBITDA loss of $138 million of our TV segment compared to an EBITDA contribution of $256 million reported in the prior year quarter.\nTurning to free cash flow, where we recorded a deficit of $615 million this quarter. This is consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle where the first half of our fiscal year reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables. In terms of capital allocation, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased an additional $550 million through our share buyback program, bringing the total cumulative amount repurchased to $5.15 billion or 25% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019.\nIn addition, today, we announced a $0.26 per share semiannual dividend. These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $8.4 billion in debt. These balances are before taking into account the repayment of one of our $1.25 billion note in late January. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabi to open up the Q&A.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community."

I just want to start with a comment and a note of thanks. We are living through tumultuous times. And at the outset, I want to acknowledge the work our journalists are doing covering the horrific October 7 terrorist attack and the subsequent ongoing war in the Middle East. From the reporting of Trey inks, Greg [indiscernible], Mike Tobin and Lucas Tomlinson in Israel; and Steve Harrigan in [indiscernible] to the deep analysis and insightful commentary by our reporters and hosts, including John Roberts and Trace Gallagher, to the essential and brave work of our on-the-ground producers and camera crews, Fox's fulfilling its mission defined, report and analyze the news of the day without fear or favor.\nNews reporting is hard and are reporting is perhaps the hardest. And while the for Central to this new cycle and were heavily on those we ask to expose them, their exposure is necessary. And so our team deserves our admiration and our gratitude as they continue to work tirelessly and under demanding conditions to keep us up to date on events far away and on their impact closer to home. My sincere thanks to them all. Now turning to today's first quarter earnings release. Against a backdrop of an active news cycle and a robust sports schedule, fiscal 2024 has started off on a solid operational and financial footing. Fox's focused portfolio of assets continues to distinguish itself and deliver exceptional results.\nFinancially, we are now comparing against the fiscal '23 cycle of events that delivered then record revenues and EBITDA. Despite this comparison, we posted total revenues this year slightly ahead of last year's record. On the affiliate side, we reported 2% total affiliate growth, led by 8% growth of the TV segment in the quarter. Importantly, we have continued to secure constructive renewals, which deliver for our partners and reinforce the value of our brands and program. Advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by around 2%, principally due to a comparative quarter last year that was much heavier in political ad revenues at our local TV stations. We understand there is inconsistency around the broader advertising market, particularly in entertainment, but our focus on live sports and news continues to deliver with healthy national pricing and demand in addition to continued momentum at Tubi. Underpinning revenue are our core brands, which consistently resonate with viewers.\nAnd the consumption data clearly shows this with total viewing of FOX brands up 2% in the quarter. FOX Sports was a big driver of that consumption, especially with its broadcast of the Women's World Cup, where the U.S. versus the Netherlands on FOX was the most watched Women's World Cup game match ever on U.S. English language television. From summer to fall, our lineup is bolstered by our football packages led by the NFL on FOX, we are averaging over 17 million viewers through [indiscernible]. Based on the strength of our remaining schedule, especially from Thanksgiving to Christmas, we expect that engagement to improve significantly. In College Football, interest is reaching new highs FOX's big new Saturday is progressing to a third straight year as the #1 game window in all of college footfall, averaging almost 6 million viewers. At Tube, we had another enviable quarter, delivering 30% revenue growth driven by an impressive 65% lift in total [indiscernible].\n[indiscernible] passed 70 million monthly active users in September, logged nearly 4 billion streaming hours in the first half of the calendar year and remains the #1 AVA player and most watched free ad-supported TV streaming service in the United States. Additionally, Tubi has beaten Pluto, Max, Paramount Plus and Peacock and Bouton for 5 consecutive months. One reason for the high engagement level at [indiscernible] is its extensive content library that now exceeds 60,000 titles, which translates into more than 225,000 movies and TV episodes in addition to approximately 300 fast channels. And during the quarter, Tube introduced rabbit AI a Chat GPT 4 powered recommendation engine to help users navigate this incredible range of titles. Tubi also offers a unique and compelling proposition to advertisers. Our recent MRI study of streaming peers concluded that tube saw the fastest growth amongst young and diverse populations. And that TV is able to deliver high-value net new audiences with 33% of Tubi streamers unreachable on other top AVOD services. Now turning back to Fox News, the strength of our overall news coverage and the reach of our linear audio and digital content is unmatched. Whether it is the conflict in the Middle East, the upcoming 2024 election cycle or volatility in the financial markets, FOX News is increasingly their viewers first choice. The launch of our new expanded prime time lineup in mid-July further solidified Fox News' leadership position, not only in cable news but in all of cable, finishing the quarter as the most watched cable network in both total day and Ponton. FOX News maintained its lead as the most watched cable news network, beating CNN and MSNBC and total viewers and in the demo for both prime and total day.\nWe have seen this thing continue and expand in the current quarter, with October viewership increasing over 20% from the first quarter with over 30% growth in the key demo. Ratings leadership during the quarter was achieved across the platform. The FOX [indiscernible] channel had the top 6 cable news programs with P2+ and the top 7 programs within the demo. In P2, the 5 led the way in terms of viewers, followed by Jesse Water's prime time and Hannity, while the 5 [indiscernible] Hannity and Jester [indiscernible] with a top 4 programs in the demo. And Fox Business News ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, feeding CNBC in total viewers during the business day for the sixth consecutive quarter. The election cycle started off with the successful Republican presidential primary debate, which is FOX News channel's highest-rated telecasts since election day 2020 and the highest-rated nonsports telecast of the year across cable. While the debate kicked off the election cycle, once we get deeper into it, our local station group will benefit greatly from increased political spend in the coming quarters.\nOver at FOX Entertainment, we started the 2023 to 2024 broadcast season as the #1 network in the key adult 18 to 49 demo, and Fox ranks as the top network and entertainment program. first in at least 10 years. FOX has 3 of the top 4 highest-rated premieres of the 2023/'24 season to date in [indiscernible], the Simpson and the Mass Singer. And the season's #1 new game show with snake oil. Across the company, fiscal '24 is shaping up nicely. We look forward to a great enthusiasm across the fall sports season, underpinned by the NFL college football and now the completed World Series, continued viewing growth at Tubi and renewed momentum at Fox News and our local stations as the election cycle heats up.\nOur balance sheet remains a core asset for FOX and we will continue to deploy it in a disciplined and thoughtful manner that delivers value for our shareholders. Finally, I would like to congratulate my father on a 70-year career at News Corp and Fox. His enduring legacy can be felt in both of these companies. And I can assure you that he is still very much involved and will continue to be for years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the operating details of the quarter.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX reported total first quarter company revenues of $3.21 billion, which is slightly above the prior year quarter. This was led by a 2% increase in affiliate fee revenues as the pricing gains from recent distribution renewals more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. From an advertising perspective, we, of course, faced the tough comparison to last year's record midterm political revenues at our local stations. This, coupled with continued softness in the direct response marketplace at FOX News more than offset the benefits we saw from the broadcast of the FIFA Women's World Cup, the 30% revenue growth generated at [indiscernible] and continued support of national pricing for live content.\nTaking as a whole, our advertising revenues declined 2%. Meanwhile, total company other revenues increased 2% or $6 million. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $869 million as compared to the $1.09 billion reported in the prior year quarter. Expenses increased this quarter driven by higher rights amortization and production costs associated with the Women's World Cup, the first year step-up from our NFL rights renewal and increased expenses at our digital businesses.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of $407 million or $0.82 per share compared to the $605 million or $1.10 per share reported in the prior year period. This move largely reflects the EBITDA impact I just mentioned, along with the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flat recognized in other net. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS was $1.09 versus last year's $1.21.\nTurning to our operating segment results, starting with television, where we delivered total quarterly revenues of $1.78 billion or a 4% increase year-over-year. This was driven by an 8% increase in TV affiliate revenues with healthy growth in fees across all FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. Advertising revenues at our TV segment grew 1%, led by the benefits from the broadcast of the Women's World Cup, continued growth at Tubi and the timing of college football broadcast, partially offset by the absence of last year's midterm political revenues and lower ratings of the FOX network. Television Other revenues increased 6% in the quarter, primarily a result of the timing of participations tied to our entertainment production initiatives.\nThe growth in revenue at our television segment was more than offset by a 10% increase in expenses, including costs associated with the Women's World Cup, the first year step-up associated with the renewal of our NFL rights and continued investment at 2b. Together, these revenue and expense impacts led to quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $351 million in our Television segment compared to the $409 million reported in the prior year quarter. Our Cable segment reported total quarterly revenues of $1.39 billion, a 3% decrease year-over-year.\nCable affiliate revenues were down 2% in the quarter, largely a result of industry subscriber declines, which continue to run in the 8% range. Cable advertising revenues were down 8% as a broadcast of the Women's World Cup and the men's [indiscernible] gold cut were more than offset by the continued impact of a softer direct response marketplace and lower ratings at FOX [indiscernible] Media. Notably though, we continue to see healthy national linear and digital demand from advertisers of Fox News Media. Cable other revenues increased by $6 million in the quarter due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues. Meanwhile, expenses at our Cable segment increased 13%, led by higher programming rights amortization and production costs for the Women's World Cup and Gold Co, the timing of college football broadcast at FOX Sports One and contractual rights increases across our sports portfolio.\nAll in all, this resulted in adjusted EBITDA at our Cable segment of $607 million compared to the $742 million reported in the prior year period. Turning to cash flow, where free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx, was negative $70 million in the quarter. This is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle with the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased a further $300 million through our share buyback program. We have now cumulatively repurchased $4.9 billion, representing approximately 24% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in 2019, and we remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $7 billion. This is supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.\nThis excludes the $1.25 billion of senior notes that we issued in early October. The proceeds from which we intend to use to pay down the corresponding maturity coming due in January 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community."

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we will take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. With this morning's earnings release, we closed out a very strong fiscal 2023, fueled by successes across every aspect of our business. While Steve will cover the details of the fourth quarter in just a moment, for the full year, we generated record annual revenue and EBITDA. Notably, we reported revenue growth of 7%, including 12% advertising growth, supported by major tent poll events like the midterm election, Super Bowl 57 and the FIFA Men's World Cup as well as outstanding growth of Tubi and 3% affiliate growth led by the first 1/3 of our distribution renewal cycle.\nThese results demonstrate that FOX's differentiated strategy continues to deliver engaged audiences at scale for our advertising and distribution partners across our sports and news verticals while also driving exceptional growth across our digital businesses. In a world of increasing audience fragmentation, FOX's collective linear and digital viewership was up 8% year-over-year. Beyond screener reflection of that strategy was clearly apparent throughout fiscal '23 and across our networks and platforms.\nFOX's broadcast of Super Bowl 57 was the most watched TV show of all time. Our Thanksgiving day game was the most watched NFL regular season game of all time, and the U.S. England match was the most watched U.S. Men's World Cup match of all time. FOX News maintained its lead as both a top-rated national cable news channel as well as the top-rated network across the entire cable ecosystem and ranks as the #2 national network in all of U.S. Television.\nAnd on the streaming front, Tubi made its debut in Nielsen's the gate, growing total consumption in fiscal 2023 by 79% and making it the #1 AVOD player with consumption levels equal to a top 5 cable network. Tubi's fiscal '23 was nothing short of spectacular, underpinned by growth in total view time, which in turn powered revenue growth. It was a year of increased awareness and engagement for Tubi, whether that was being recognized by Nielsen as America's most watched AVOD service. It's expanding content library and TBT metrics or the 5 can lines awards bestowed upon Tubi Super Bowl spot. Each quarter during the year saw successive gains at Tubi and the fiscal fourth quarter was its most impressive of all, with revenue growth of 47%, driven by strong engagement with total viewer time growing by 65%.\nEach month of the quarter set new records from monthly viewers. With Tubi's revenue and engagement accelerating in fiscal '23, we are looking to further strengthen Tubi's position in fiscal '24. To that end, we are very excited to welcome Anjali Sud as the new CEO of Tubi and look forward to seeing Tubi flourished further under her leadership.\nAt FOX News Media, we continue to lead both in ratings and engagement. The FOX News Channel ended the fourth quarter as the most watched cable network in total day for the ninth consecutive quarter, while maintaining its lead as the most watch cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC in both total viewers in the demo for both prime time and total day. FOX News debuted its streak prime time lineup last month. We are pleased with the initial results and are confident that our deep bench of talent will continue to set the standard for all new services as we move towards the 2024 presidential election.\nThis past year, FOX News leadership position was never at risk. We sustained double-digit advantages in total viewership of our nearest competitors for the entire fiscal year. even during the period where our prime time lineup was in transition. In fact, since its mid-July debut, FOX News' new Prime Time lineup is up over 35% in total viewers and up over 40% in the 25 to 54 demographic versus the June schedule. Meanwhile, the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable news network, beating CNBC and total viewers during the business day for the fifth consecutive quarter. Across FOX Entertainment, we had a solid year, notching multiple wins, including the #1 entertainment telecast with NextLevel Chef, the #1 new drama of 2023, with the accused and the #1 new unscripted series with Special Forces, world's toughest test.\nOur local TV station group delivered a record midterm election sales cycle that was just shy of the last presidential cycle. We are very pleased with fiscal '23, a year where FOX again delivered best-in-class results and further differentiate itself from its peers. We enter fiscal '24 from a position of strength despite headwinds facing our industry and the lingering effect of some macroeconomic uncertainty.\nWe will renew the next 1/3 of our distribution agreements and navigate a variable ad environment, supported by solid results from the recent upfront for our unique content offering, which distinguishes itself in any marketplace. You've heard me say this many times, FOX's focus strategy is different from our peers. It's uniquely good. Nowhere is that more evident than in the current environment where FOX'S leadership position is proven. In this year's upfront, we believe FOX led the market in both price and volume across our live sports and news offerings.\nWhile it's early in the quarter, underlying ad trends have shown signs of improvement over last quarter. We are seeing an uptick in scatter driven largely by sports and national news is solid. At our Tubi, we saw further momentum in both revenue and TBT growth in July. This promises to be another strong year for FOX as we wrap up the Women's World Cup in a few weeks with stellar advertising support before kicking off American football in early September with the big 10 and the NFL.\nWe're already seeing our live sporting events continue to break records with the Women's World Cup broadcast. The U.S. versus the Netherlands on FOX was the most watched Women's World Cup group stage match ever on U.S. English language television. We'll also broadcast our first UEFA European soccer championship later this year. Further, we expect that our relaunch news lineup will continue its momentum as we head into the presidential election cycle, which will also be a boon to our local stations. And of course, we expect Tubi's growth and scale to extend even further.\nUnderpinning all of this, we can't forget our balance sheet, which remains robust even after this year's legal costs. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt, giving us a net leverage ratio of roughly 1x, the best balance sheet in the business. We have set it time and time again. Our mix of assets puts us in a uniquely stronger position than our peers. With this strength and our relentless focus on our core business, we are committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner as we look forward to 2024.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the operating details of the quarter and full year.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX delivered strong financial results for fiscal 2023, with total company revenue growth of 7% and record EBITDA. Advertising revenues across the company were up 12%, led by a 17% increase in our television segment, made all the more impressive when comparing against revenues generated from last year's broadcast to Thursday night football. This growth was driven by a banner year of events, including the record-breaking Super Bowl 57, FIFA Men's World Cup and the midterm election cycle, along with the considerable momentum we are driving at Tubi. We completed approximately 1/3 of our distribution renewals this year, supporting the lift in our total company affiliate fee revenues of 3%. As signaled previously, the impact from these initial renewals primarily benefited our television segment, leading to an 8% increase year-over-year. Total company other revenues saw a 5% increase.\nThe result of the full year impact of MarVista, TMZ and Studio Ramsay Global, which were acquired in fiscal '22, along with the higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. From a bottom line perspective, this robust company-wide revenue growth was the key driver of the 8% increase in full year EBITDA to $3.19 billion. Net income attributable to stockholders was $1.24 billion or $2.33 per share, up versus $1.21 billion or $2.11 per share reported in fiscal '22.\nAs you may recall, other than that was impacted this year by charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation and the gain associated with the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, full year adjusted net income increased 17% to $1.87 billion with adjusted EPS up 26% to $3.51 per share.\nTurning to our fiscal fourth quarter results. FOX delivered total company revenues of $3.03 billion, which is consistent with the amount reported in Q4 fiscal '22. Quarterly EBITDA was $735 million, down from the $770 million in the prior year. This was largely due to the cyclical comparison with the prior year's midterm election and advertising impacts on our FOX News and FOX Entertainment businesses, along with a modest increase in overall expenses.\nTotal company affiliate revenues grew 3% in the quarter as the pricing benefits from our recent renewals were partially offset by the impact of industry subscriber declines. Total company advertising revenues decreased 4%, which was primarily a result of lower political advertising revenues at our television stations, especially when compared to our June record June quarter last year, along with the impact of a softer direct response marketplace of FOX News Media.\nThe momentum we have seen at Tubi throughout the fiscal year accelerated in our fourth quarter, with revenue up 47% on the back of increased engagement and stable pricing. Total company other revenues were essentially unchanged from the prior year. Growth in total company expenses was [ healthy ] 1% and and includes investments at Tubi, albeit at a slower rate than Tubi's revenue growth and the expansion of the USFL as well as higher programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of $375 million or $0.74 per share was up versus the $306 million or $0.55 per share reported in the prior year quarter. As the EBITDA movements just described, along with the restructuring and other below the line at costs were more than offset by the mark-to-market increases of our investment in Flutter. Excluding noncore items, adjusted net income in the quarter increased to $443 million and adjusted EPS increased 19% to $0.88 per share.\nNow turning to the quarterly results of our main operating segments. At Cable Networks, fourth quarter revenue saw a 3% decrease year-over-year. Cable affiliate fee revenues were down 2% in the quarter, as pricing gains from our affiliate renewals were more than offset by net subscriber declines of approximately 8%. Cable advertising revenues fell 11%, largely on the back of the softer direct response marketplace at FOX News. While Cable other revenues increased 7%, led by revenues generated by the second season of the USFL. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA at cable was down 7% as these revenue impacts were partially offset by lower expenses, led by lower digital and use gathering costs at FOX News Media, partially offset by higher costs associated with the USFL. Our Television segment reported 4% growth in quarterly revenues. This was led by a 9% increase in Television affiliate fee revenues with healthy growth in pricing across FOX owned and operated and FOX-affiliated stations continue to outpace the impact from subscriber declines.\nTelevision advertising revenues fell 1% as the strong growth at Tubi was offset by lower off-cycle political revenues and a slower rebound in the base market of the FOX Television stations and lower ratings at FOX Entertainment. Television other revenues grew 8% in the quarter, primarily a result of increased activity at our entertainment production companies. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA at our Television segment remained flat compared to the prior year quarter as the increase in revenues was offset by higher expenses where we had higher programming rights amortization and production costs at FOX Sports. Costs at Tubi were also higher than the prior year, however, this was outpaced by the rate of revenue growth to deliver improved EBITDA in the quarter.\nDuring the full year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx of $1.4 billion, inclusive of legal settlement payments. Before we get to capital allocation and balance sheet, it is worth noting some key items for fiscal '24. We will, of course, be comparing to the marquee events of fiscal '23, including the Super Bowl and the midterm election cycle as well as transitioning to the first year of our NFL rights renewal and broadcasting our first UEFA European Championship.\nAt the cable sports networks, we expect margins to improve in fiscal '24, reflecting our disciplined approach to college sports rights renewals, net of sublicensing income. In terms of affiliate revenue, we make no predictions on industry subscriber volumes. However, as we've previously indicated, we have another 1/3 of our total company distribution revenues up for renewal this year and expect to see the benefit of those renewals towards the back half of the year and skewed towards our Television segment. We expect to continue to invest in our growth initiatives. Here Tubi will be the focus of investment spend with the collective portfolio expected to deliver EBITDA in line or better than fiscal '23.\nAnd from a cash flow perspective, we expect FOX will be subject to the new corporate alternative minimum tax beginning this fiscal year. This will not impact our P&L tax provision, but will likely elevate our cash taxes in the near term. However, we still expect to realize the full benefit of our cash tax asset over time.\nReturning to capital allocation. Over the course of fiscal '23, we returned $2 billion of capital through the repurchase of 46 million Class A shares and 7.5 million Class B shares. This includes the cash impact of our previously announced $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction. This buyback activity was supplemented by over $260 million in dividend payments in the year and underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns.\nToday, we announced an increase in our semiannual dividend to $0.26 per share. With the payment of this dividend, we will have cumulatively returned over $6 billion of capital to our shareholders since the spin in 2019. This includes over $4.6 billion of share repurchases, including the ASR representing over 22% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019.\nThis is all supported by the strength of our balance sheet where as Lachlan mentioned, we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt. Fiscal 2023 was another year of strategic focus and strong execution at FOX. That, combined with the most robust balance sheet in the industry supports our ongoing commitment to capital returns as well as flexibility to pursue value accretive investment.\nAnd with that, let's turn the call back to Gabby to get started with Q&A.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community."

Welcome to the FOX Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Kiley. Good morning, and welcome to our Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.\nPlease note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding FOX Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThank you, Gabby, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. FOX's strong fiscal third quarter operating results once again demonstrate the power of our content and the brands it underpins and the repeated capability of our focused strategy to deliver solid financial results.\nIn the quarter, we grew top line revenue by 18%, led by the remarkable 43% growth in advertising and a solid 3% growth in affiliate revenue. Underpinning this performance was a record Super Bowl LVII on the FOX Broadcast Network which generated approximately $650 million of gross advertising revenue across our businesses and was the key driver of our 61% advertising revenue growth at our Television segment. This year's Super Bowl matchup between Kansas City and Philadelphia delivered 115 million viewers across FOX platforms, making Super Bowl LVII the most watched program in U.S. television history and the pinnacle of an extraordinary year for Fox Sports.\nThe strong lineup of programming and advertising demand for FOX Sports continues into our fourth quarter, which includes the return of NASCAR the second season of the USFL, the start of Major League Baseball's 2023 season, the finals of the UEFA Nations League and a first for FOX the Belmont Stakes. Leveraging the reach of a Super Bowl lead-in, we launched the second season of Next Level Chef, which promises to be the next big lifestyle franchise from our Studio Ramsay partnership. Our entertainment business also found success with the #1 new series and new drama over the year in Accused and the #1 new unscripted series in Special Forces: World's Toughest Test. FOX has now debuted the top new unscripted series for 5 consecutive seasons. In fact, the combined power of our sports and entertainment programming places FOX at #1 amongst broadcast network season to date in the key 18 to 49 demo.\nOur strong sports calendar also had a halo effect at the FOX Television stations, which saw many local advertising verticals higher in the quarter. In what continues to be mixed local advertising market conditions, we are encouraged by growth in categories, including auto, restaurants and entertainment, but are watchful across other categories, including bedding, retail and telecom.\nMeanwhile, Tubi's performance in the third quarter was nothing short of stellar with revenue growth of 31% supported by sustained gains and engagement, where total view time increased 38% year-on-year. And while still early in the fourth quarter, the April results for Tubi show the momentum across the platform accelerating. Having recently marked the 3-year anniversary of our acquisition of Tubi, our progress over this longer-term time frame is just as impressive, having grown quarterly TBT by over 200% and revenue by 400%.\nJust as importantly, the Tubi brand has asserted itself on the broader media landscape. Our viral Tubi spot in the Super Bowl, which received massive press coverage, had almost 7 billion impressions. And our strong growth and engagement has now led to Tubi's inclusion in Nielsen's The Gauge, marking the first time Tubi has reached 1% of total TV viewing minutes and making to be the most watched fast service in the United States.\nAnd just last month, we announced the formation of Tubi Media Group, under Paul Cheesbrough, which brings together our digital capabilities in a more formalized and coordinated way to help us better monetize our digital touch points across all our FOX properties. We thank Farhad for his entrepreneurial leadership at Tubi over the last 3 years and, of course, before he leaves the business in terrific shape with an outstanding team to drive continued strong growth.\nAt FOX News Media, we retained our leadership position amongst our peers. The FOX News Channel ended the third quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and prime time while maintaining its lead as the most watched cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC combined. Also notably, the FOX Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network, leading CNBC in total viewers during the business day and market hours for the fourth consecutive quarter.\nLet me briefly address the settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems. We made the business decision to resolve this dispute and avoid the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process. Our decision clearly in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The settlement in no way alters FOX's commitment to the highest -- standards across our company or our passion for unabashedly reporting the news of the day. We're proud of our FOX News team, the exceptional quality of their journalism and their stewardship of the FOX News brand.\nWhether it be our coverage of politics and elections, world events such as the Warren Ukraine or domestic issues, such as the crisis at the border, our journalists bring compelling news home to our viewers every day. The standards behind this reporting are not only what makes us the #1 cable news network but the #1 network in all of cable. In fact, in a recent poll, 41% of respondents chose FOX News as their most trusted network news.\nSo as we look ahead, we are confident in the strength of the FOX brands and the strength of our balance sheet. And while we are not completely immune to the headwinds facing the broader industry and the general economy, we are well positioned given our areas of differentiation. Nonetheless, you can expect us to be even more focused on our cost base as we look to reinforce our strategy for future growth.\nWe remain committed to driving long-term shareholder value creation through the thoughtful management of our existing business, the pursuit of new and exciting adjacencies and returning capital to our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the details of the quarter.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nChief Financial Officer, Fox Corp.\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX again delivered strong underlying financials in our fiscal third quarter with 18% revenue growth and 3% EBITDA growth, bolstered by a record-breaking Super Bowl LVII. Our advertising revenues increased 43%, led by the Super Bowl, along with the higher volume of NFL playoff windows and accelerating growth at Tubi.\nMeanwhile, our affiliate revenues grew 3% on the back of pricing benefits from recent renewals partially offset by trailing 12-month subscriber losses continuing to run in the 7% range. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $833 million, up $22 million over the prior year quarter as these revenue increases were partially offset by higher expenses. This was primarily due to higher sports rights amortization and production costs associated with our NFL, Super Bowl and playoff schedule.\nThe net loss attributable to stockholders was $54 million or negative $0.10 per share compared to net income of $283 million or $0.50 per share reported in the prior year period. The variance was primarily due to other net where we recognize charges associated with the FOX News Media litigation, partially offset by the gain associated with the change in fair value of the company's investments. Excluding these and other noncore items, earnings growth was strong with adjusted net income growing 8% to $494 million and adjusted EPS of $0.94 per share, up $0.13 against last year's $0.81 per share.\nNow turning to our segments, starting with Television, where revenue grew an impressive 36% in the quarter. Television advertising revenues led this growth with a 61% increase fueled by Super Bowl LVII, which, as Lachlan mentioned, generated over $650 million in gross revenue. We also benefited from 2 additional NFL playoff games, 1 divisional and 1 wildcard partially offset by the timing of 1 less regular season game.\nMomentum at Tubi remained strong with advertising revenues up 31% to $170 million on the back of increased engagement and stable pricing. These strong advertising tailwinds in the Television segment were partially offset by lower prime time ratings at the FOX Network and mixed base market conditions at our local stations when excluding the Super Bowl. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 9% and as healthy growth in pricing across FOX owned and operated and affiliated stations continued to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues remained essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter.\nEBITDA at our Television segment was up $82 million to $117 million. Expenses increased in the quarter driven by higher costs related to the Super Bowl and a higher volume of NFL games. The increase in expenses was partially offset by lower costs at FOX Entertainment, including the absence of a write-down of certain scripted programming in the prior year quarter.\nOur net EBITDA investment in Tubi of approximately $60 million was broadly in line with the prior year quarter. At Cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were down 7% due to the impact of a softer direct response marketplace at FOX News Media, while being partially offset by the benefit of the World Baseball Classic on the national sports networks. Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat, coming in at $1.1 billion with rate growth broadly offset by subscriber declines. Cable other revenues were up 10% in the quarter led by higher FOX Nation subscription revenues.\nEBITDA at our Cable segment was $792 million compared to the $864 million reported last year largely due to these revenue impacts along with elevated legal costs at FOX News Media and higher expenses associated with the second season of the USFL and the World Baseball Classic at FOX Sports.\nNow turning to cash flow where we generated strong free cash flow of $1.48 billion in the quarter, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our fall programming coupled with our major sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. From a share repurchase perspective, as we foreshowed on our last call, we continued with our normal cost buyback activity of $250 million in the quarter and deployed $1 billion of additional capital to an accelerated share repurchase transaction. We retired approximately 80% of the shares associated with the ASR in the March quarter and expect the remainder to settle in the coming months.\nWe remain committed to fully utilizing our current $7 billion authorization, where we now cumulatively repurchased approximately $4.4 billion, representing 20% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. These meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position, where we closed the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. While this reported cash balance does not include the impact of the Dominion settlement, we continue to maintain a very robust balance sheet that supports our ongoing commitment to capital returns as well as flexibility to pursue value-accretive investment.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back to Gabby to open Q&A.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we would be happy to take questions from the investment community. ."

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2023 2nd quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer.\nFirst, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.

And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Gabby. And thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our second quarter results. Our fiscal second quarter continued to build upon the strength of the first quarter to deliver record first half ratings and revenue at Fox. Financially, we delivered a 4% increase in our top line, including 4% advertising revenue growth. Our EBITDA grew a massive 71% and principally due to strong advertising results from sports and political as well as the impact of exiting Thursday night football.\nOur television segment led this growth and had a truly stellar performance. The Stations Group posted another record political midterm cycle with approximately $250 million booked during the first half of our fiscal year. This is higher than our previous midterm record and just shy of our fiscal '21 presidential year record. These are impressive numbers and reinforce the strength and breadth of our station group. FOX Sports was also a key growth driver this past quarter where advertising pricing and demand remains solid on the back of viewership records for the NFL and for the World Cup.\nBy every measure, Fox Sports is having an extraordinary year. FOX's domination of the fall was led by four of our most prominent rights packages, the NFL the Big Ten Network, Major League Baseball and FIFA, all coming together to produce a truly powerful schedule. For the fourth straight calendar year, FOX Sports is the industry leader in live events with some notable achievements that bode well for our future, including the current NFL regular season on FOX averaged over 19 million viewers and finished as the #1 NFL package on television.\nAmericas game of the week averaged just over 24 million viewers and is projected to be the most watched program of all of television for the 14th straight year. And our Thanksgiving game this year was the most watched regular season game ever on any network, delivering 42 million viewers. College Football had its most watched season ever on Fox led by Big new Saturday, which was the most watched college football window for the second straight year. While the annual Ohio State Michigan rivalry was the most watched regular season college game on any network in 11 years. And, of course, the 2022 Men's World Cup exceeded our expectations with average viewership of over the tournament up 30% from the 2018 matches.\nWe can't wait for the Women's World Cup this summer, and we're already getting ready for the 2026 Men's World Cup here in North America. Of course, the strength of the Fox Sports portfolio was on full display this past Thanksgiving with our traditional Thanksgiving NFL game, USA versus England in the World Cup, a huge college football game and Americas game of the week all spread over just 4 days. The ratings were impressive, but the revenue we generated was even better.\nWe wrote just shy of $250 million over the long weekend. And the strength of FOX Sports has continued into the current quarter on the back of exciting player football and what will be a record sold out Super Bowl this coming Sunday. At Tubi, we had another strong quarter where ad revenues grew by 25% over last year as we continue to outperform our peers. We have seen increases in almost every major KPI of Tubi including CPMs, TBT and engagement. In fact, Tubi had its highest quarterly viewership in the fiscal second quarter with total viewing time up 41% year-on-year, while December alone was the highest TBT and highest user month ever.\nThese trends have continued early into the third quarter as tubi adds viewers and content to the platform. At Fox Entertainment, Rob Wade has settled in his new role as CEO and has already launched two of the season's biggest hits, Accused ranked as the most watched debut on any broadcast or cable network in 2 years. And Special Forces World's Toughest Test is this season's #1 unscripted program. Further, Fox Entertainment recently announced a multiyear extension with Hulu of our long-standing content licensing agreement which bolsters Fox's streaming audience and provides Hulu with a key point of differentiation in a crowded streaming world.\nTurning to Fox News Media. The Fox News Channel ended the second quarter as the most watched cable network in total day and in prime time, while maintaining its lead as the most washed cable news network beating CNN and MSNBC combined in both total viewers and demo in the quarter for both prime and Total Bay. And the Fox Business Network ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network beating CNBC and total viewers through the Business Day and market hours for the third consecutive quarter.\nFox Nation accelerated subscriber growth over the last quarter and last year and had the best quarter ever for engagement in terms of ours view, no doubt driven by brilliant fresh content like Yellowstone 150. Looking at the distribution side of our business, we have now completed most of the deals expiring in the first year of our multiyear affiliate renewal cycle. So far, the results confirm the confidence we have in monetizing our leading brands and content, and we are pleased that the market recognizes the value that Fox delivers to their offerings.\nIt has been a truly strong quarter, one that showcased the very best of Fox and have shown that the underlying performance of Fox is exceptionally healthy. Looking ahead into this third fiscal quarter, our top line will, of course, be aided by a record Super Bowl. But we are still seeing solid national demand for our news and sports platforms, growth in the Tubi KPIs, and we are encouraged to see multiple ad categories pacing strongly positive at our local stations.\nBefore handing the call over to Steve, I want to add some perspective to the Fox story. In the almost 4 years since the spin, Fox has grown and flourished, while pursuing a simple strategy. A core business of trusted brands that delivers consistent and substantial audiences and a portfolio of digital growth initiatives that scale over time. With our focused sports and news franchises, we have taken a differentiated approach choosing to serve our audience primarily through the pay TV ecosystem, which optimizes the delivery and value of live programming.\nOur ability to drive our business and execute our strategy is underpinned by a number of accomplishments. For example, our affiliate and advertising revenue growth is driven by our pricing power reinforced by regularly delivering large-scale audiences and uniquely providing exclusive content to our pay TV distributors. This approach has led to nearly $2 billion in affiliate revenue growth and over $1.3 billion in advertising revenue growth since the spin in 2019.\nBy focusing on live content, our core Fox brands have been able to run sharply counter to the broader trend of linear TV. We can see this by looking at consumption trends. Over the past 10 years, consumption of FOX Sports events is up 18%, and consumption of FOX News is up 28%. Our portfolio of sports rights is secure and is the best out there with the vast majority of them locked up for the foreseeable future. Our NFL rights, the single best package in all of television extends through the 2033 season.\nWe've just completed the first year of our Major League Baseball extension and renewed our big 10 rights, which each takes us out through the end of the decade. We have the European championships through 2028 and another cycle with our FIFA World Cup rights. These long-term rights provide us their visibility and necessary flexibility to plan our businesses and pursue growth opportunities moving forward. On the digital side, we have made calculated investments in areas where we believe we can add significant value.\nSports wagering and advertising video on demand are the two best examples of this. We have affirmed footing in the sports gambling space. We were the first among U.S. media companies to strike a partnership with a betting operator because we see the potential for sports betting to drive engagement, enhance the viewing experience and keep viewers coming back to Fox Sports linear and digital platforms.\nThe various financial options and investments we have reflect our view that sports gambling is a long-term play, and we are focused on cementing our leadership in this rapidly evolving and high-growth sector. Tubi, the #1 AVOD player leads our streaming strategy and with minimal investment when compared to our peers. Revenue and engagement KPIs at Tubi have far exceeded our expectations and are consistently growing in the healthy double-digit range since we acquired it almost 3 years ago.\nThe result in Tubi is a proof that our strategy is working and we will continue investing in and growing this platform. Finally, I'd like to address the recent announcement regarding News Corporation. As you know, my father and I have reached the conclusion that exploring a combination with News Corp is not optimal for shareholders of Fox or News Corp at this time.\nAs such, the special committees were disbanded and no further time or action is being taken on this topic. I've said in the past that I think scale provides flexibility and that it's important to be prepared when opportunities present themselves. The rationale behind considering our combination with News Corp was about that: scale, flexibility, synergies, opportunities, great IP and above all, creating value for all shareholders.\nAs the CEO of Fox, I have never felt more confident about our strategy, the quality of our assets and the strength of our financial position. This confidence is clearly demonstrated by this morning's announcement to increase our share repurchase authorization to $7 billion with the immediate deployment of $1 billion of the expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction while continuing our current in-market purchases.\nConsistent with our track record, we remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner and we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long term. And now let me turn it over to Steve for more on the results.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nCFO, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Lachlan. And good morning, everyone. Fox continued to deliver financially in the fiscal second quarter with total company revenue growth of 4% and 71% growth in EBITDA. Notwithstanding the absence of Thursday night football, our overall revenue growth was led by a 4% increase in advertising revenues, where in the quarter, we saw continued strength in political advertising at the stations which when viewed across the full fiscal first half, nearly matched the political record set during the 2020 presidential cycle.\nAdditionally, our sports advertising was supported by its full roster of marquee events and to be continued to sustain its high-growth trajectory. Our affiliate revenues increased by 1% with limited renewal activity impacting the quarter and trailing 12-month subscriber losses remaining consistent at approximately 7%. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $531 million, up $220 million over the prior year. In addition to our revenue growth, we also benefited from lower expenses as a result of our early exit from the Thursday night football agreement.\nNet income attributable to stockholders was $313 million or $0.58 per share up meaningfully against a net loss of $85 million or negative $0.15 per share reported in the prior year period. Alongside our growth in EBITDA, you'll recall that our GAAP P&L is regularly impacted by the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter, which we recognize in other than that. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, growth was strong with adjusted EPS of $0.48 per share, up $0.35 against last year's $0.13 per share.\nTurning to our segments. At television, we delivered 6% revenue growth including a 5% increase in advertising revenues. As you know, our advertising revenues in the December quarter of last year benefited from our coverage of Thursday night football. Despite that comparable headwind, we delivered meaningful gains across the segment. This was led by the strong political cycle, the addition of the World Cup at Fox Sports and continued strong growth at Tubi.\nOn the NFL specifically, we also benefited from strong pricing, a record-breaking Thanksgiving Day broadcast and the timing of week 18 of the season sliding back into the December quarter. Meanwhile, advertising revenue growth of Tubi was up 25% in the quarter and exceeded $200 million on the back of record levels of engagement. In an uneven programmatic advertising marketplace, we are able to maintain CPMs and are well positioned to deploy more inventory as market conditions strengthen.\nTelevision affiliate fee revenues were up 6% as healthy growth in pricing across all FOX-affiliated stations continue to outpace the impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues increased 26% in the quarter primarily reflecting the consolidation of the prior year acquisition of MarVista. EBITDA at our Television segment was up $529 million to $256 million as we benefited from the strong political market and realize the anticipated financial benefit from the exit of our Thursday night football agreement.\nThese benefits were partially offset by higher costs from the World Cup and the annual growth in rights amortization we see across our sports portfolio. Similar to the levels reported in our fiscal first quarter, our net EBITDA investment in Tubi amounted to approximately $50 million in the December quarter. At Cable, we saw revenues generally in line with the prior year. Cable advertising revenues were essentially flat. As Lachlan mentioned, we continue to see meaningful pricing gains in national advertising across our leadership brands. Additionally, our national sports networks benefited from the broadcast of the World Cup in the quarter.\nHowever, this was offset by a softer direct response marketplace that impacted FOX News Media. Cable affiliate fee revenues were broadly flat, coming in at $1.03 billion. As we have signaled previously, we are in the early days of our next distribution renewal cycle, where we expect revenue gains to be skewed towards the television segment. Meanwhile, Cable other revenues were up 7% in the quarter, once again led by higher Fox Nation subscription revenues.\nEBITDA at our Cable segment was $353 million compared to the $668 million reported last year, largely due to higher costs of the national sports networks led by the World Cup and postseason baseball. Expenses were also elevated at Fox News Media due to the digital investments of nation and weather and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation.\nNow turning to cash flow, where consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle, we recorded a free cash flow deficit of $610 million in the quarter. This typical first half trend reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased $550 million higher our share buyback program. This takes the total cumulative amount repurchased to $3.15 billion, representing 15% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019.\nIn addition, today, we declared a $0.25 semiannual dividend. And as Lachlan mentioned, this morning, we also announced an incremental buyback authorization of $3 billion taking our total authorization to $7 billion. We will immediately deploy $1 billion of this expanded authorization toward an accelerated share repurchase transaction. While concurrently continuing with our normal course buyback pacing, which would see us repurchase $450 million in additional shares across the remainder of the fiscal year.\nThese meaningful capital return measures are enabled by the strength of our financial position that we again closed the quarter with a very robust balance sheet, comprising $4 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. And with that, let me turn it back to Gabby.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community."

Welcome to the FOX Corporation First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Gabby, and thank you all for joining us this morning to discuss our first quarter results and happy Halloween, everyone. I was trying to think of a Halloween reference or a joke, but in fact, there's nothing scary in these results. Actually, fiscal '23 has started off -- by the way, that's called a dad joke in my household. Fiscal '23 has started off on a solid footing for us, supported by healthy viewership at sports and news, revenue growth across our platforms and impressive momentum at TUBI. Financially, we delivered 5% growth in our top line revenues, led by an 8% increase in advertising and 3% growth in affiliate revenues. Our advertising growth in the quarter was driven by strong pricing at FOX News and FOX Sports, record first quarter political revenues at the local stations and in a quarter where industry-wide digital advertising revenues appear to have been under pressure, to be posted standout revenue growth of almost 30%. These are great results for FOX.\nHowever, we recognize that there is a lot of commentary around advertising headwinds as the macro environment evolves. Yes, the broader national advertising market is looking more fluid compared to the time of our last earnings call. However, the macro impact is not uniform across our verticals. While we have observed some softness in the linear entertainment scatter marketplace, remember that FOX does not over-index to network entertainment. So any impact there is nominal to us and has been more than offset by the digital entertainment strength delivered by TUBI. Additionally, despite the economic headwinds, we are seeing continued strength across our linear news and sports portfolios, led by the pharmaceutical, restaurant and streaming categories. These dynamics underscore a flight to quality and the importance of our focus on live content with over 2/3 of our advertising revenue generated by live sports and news. At our local stations, we generated record political revenues for the September quarter.\nSecond quarter-to-date political revenues have also been very strong, given the combination of races and ballot issues across our markets. And I can confirm with a week still to go before election day, we have already beat our fiscal year 2021 record at the local stations, excluding the Georgia runoffs. Meanwhile, base market sales at the local stations were stable in the first quarter. It's still too early to gauge how much of an impact the macro uncertainty will have on local-based market advertising in the December quarter.\nBut we are encouraged by the continued positive growth we are seeing in the automotive category, but recognize industry-specific dynamics that are impacting sectors such as wagering and government public health advertiser. On the distribution side of our business, we have completed the first round of our multiyear affiliate renewal cycle. So far, the results are consistent with our expectations, and we are pleased that the market recognizes the value of our brands as they deliver for their customers.\nTurning to our business units. FOX News, turned in another stellar performance, finishing the fiscal first quarter as the #1 channel on cable and the third most viewed network in weekday prime in all of television behind only NBC and CBS. FOX Nation had a standout quarter for subscribers and engagement with total subscription growth north of 45% and total hours watched up almost 70% over last year, making our fiscal first quarter FOX Nation's highest quarter ever for hours watched.\nFOX Sports has had a very exciting calendar or has a very exciting calendar ahead of it this fall. The NFL on FOX is off to a great start, and we're pleased to report that America's game of the week is averaging nearly 23 million viewers, up 9% over last year. The 2022 college football season also got off to an outstanding start with 10.6 million viewers for Alabama, Texas and the season's first big new out of the game.\nIt's no surprise that FOX's big news Saturday remains the #1 window in college football with viewership up 15% over last year. And Fox continues to be the primary home for baseball's postseason, where our coverage across FOX started in October and culminates with the world series throughout this week.\nAs always, we're barracking for a tight 7 game series. You know quite well that we have assembled an array of marquee sports rights and many of them will be on full display later this month during the Thanksgiving weekend, when FOX will play a host of 4 of this year's biggest matchups, the Giants vs Cowboys on Thanksgiving, the U.S. men's soccer team versus England in the World Cup on Friday, Michigan and Ohio State on Saturday afternoon and, of course, will present America's Game of the week on Sunday afternoon which is between the Rams and the Chiefs.\nIt will be a terrific game. This extraordinary holiday weekend slate sets us up nicely as we prepare to broadcast Super Bowl LVII in February. Elsewhere, the story at TUBI is breathtaking with first quarter revenue growth reaccelerating to almost 30% over last year.\nThis marks the first time that TUBI revenue has surpassed the advertising revenue generated by FOX Entertainment in a meaningful way. And in the December quarter for TUBI looks to be a continuation of that momentum with revenue growth rate currently pacing ahead of the September quarter at nearly 40%. Driving revenue at TUBI is strength across all major KPIs, particularly total viewing time, which was up over 50%.\nIn fact, this was TUBI's highest quarterly viewership ever with TBT reaching 1.3 billion hours. TUBI's impressive progress in growing audience engagement and monetization is indicating that our investment strategy and operational focus is working nicely. At Fox Entertainment, we saw some changes last month with Charlie Collier moving on to new challenges. We are happy that Rob Wade has stepped into the role of CEO of FOX Entertainment and those who know Rob will share my view that he will be a tremendous steward to our entertainment businesses.\nOur fiscal year is off to quite a start. The September quarter results once again highlight the strength of our leadership brands. And we are just getting started on what promises to be a banner year for FOX. We are encouraged by the operating trends across the portfolio and the early returns on our digital investments. When paired with our strong balance sheet and low leverage, the FOX story remains a differentiated one amongst its media peers. And while we continue to be mindful of how the macroeconomic environment evolves during the months ahead, FOX remains well positioned to navigate and outperform through any potential uncertainty. Finally, let me comment on the announcement made earlier this month regarding a potential combination of FOX and News Corporation. As has been made public, both FOX and News Corporation have formed separate special committees to explore a potential combination following letters received from my father, Rupert Murdoch and the Murdoch Family Trust. For a combination transaction to proceed, it will need the approval of both special committees and a supportive vote by the majority of the minority nonaffiliated shareholders of each company.\nThe special committee has not made any determination at this time, and there can be no certainty that the company will engage in such a transaction. Given the importance of the work of the special committees, I'm not in a position to take any questions on the proposed transaction at this time. And now Steve will take you through the financial highlights of the quarter.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nCFO, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. As Lachlan mentioned, we have made a solid start to fiscal 2023, delivering total company revenue growth of 5%. This top line momentum was led by 8% growth in our advertising revenues, where in the quarter, we continue to see healthy scatter demand for our leading news and sports properties and generated meaningful revenue reacceleration at TUBI. We also benefited from a record fiscal first quarter for political advertising revenues at our owned and operated television stations.\nNotably, we are able to drive 3% affiliate fee revenue growth without the benefit of any significant renewals impacting the quarter and trailing 12-month subscriber losses running at approximately 7%. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.09 billion, up 3% as our revenue growth was partially offset by higher expenses led by continued investment in our digital initiatives and increased rights amortization at FOX Sports.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of $605 million or $1.10 per share compared to the $701 million or $1.21 per share reported in the prior period. Once again, this was impacted by the change in fair value of the company's investment in Qatar, which we recognize in other net. Additionally, our effective tax rate was slightly higher in the quarter primarily due to a remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets associated with the reduction in state taxes.\nThis had no impact on our cash taxes in the quarter. Excluding this impact and other noncore items, adjusted EPS was $1.21, up 9% over last year's $1.11. Turning now to our segments, starting with cable network programming. Cable advertising revenues were up 2% as our market leadership in news continue to drive linear pricing gains at the FOX News channel.\nThis was partially offset by lower programmatic revenues at our digital news properties in the current period as well as the impact of scheduling effects at our national sports cable networks where last year's revenues benefited from the Concacaf Gold Cup and Copa America tournaments. Cable affiliate fee revenues were consistent with the prior quarter. As we have signaled previously, we are in the early days of our next distribution renewal cycle. We are pleased with the outcomes of our earliest renewals, and we continue to expect to see these benefits take effect in the back half of our fiscal year and initially concentrated towards the television segment. Cable other revenues increased 9% in the quarter, primarily due to higher FOX Nation subscription revenues. EBITDA at our Cable segment was $742 million compared to the $774 million reported in the prior year period and included the impact of elevated breaking us costs and the timing of digital investments of FOX News Media.\nAt television, we delivered 8% revenue growth, led by an 11% increase in advertising revenues. Our television station saw a record September quarter for political advertising revenues, while the FOX network benefited from continued strength in pricing and additional MLB broadcast of Fox Sports, partially offset by softer ratings.\nNotably, we saw a sequential reacceleration of growth of TUBI, with revenues up 29% to approximately $165 million. This was on the back of a 53% increase in total view time and stable CPMs. Television affiliate fee revenues were up 6% as healthy growth in fees across all Fox affiliate FOX-affiliated stations more than offset any impact from subscriber declines. Other revenues increased 5% in the quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of the TMZ and MarVista acquisitions, partially offset by the timing of deliveries of Bento Box. EBITDA at our Television segment was up 14% in the quarter, where we saw the typical seasonal increase in our marquee rights at costs at FOX Sports including the impact of our MLB renewal, partially offset by lower marketing and programming expenses of FOX Entertainment.\nWe are clearly making strong progress in both audience growth and monetization at TUBI which underscores our confidence in the long-term value of this asset. So it is worth noting that the EBITDA we delivered in the quarter at the Television segment and FOX more broadly, incorporates an approximately $50 million EBITDA investment in TUBI.\nNow turning to cash flow, where we generated $196 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, where the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year.\nFrom a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased a further $300 million via our share buyback program. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion. Having now cumulatively repurchased $2.9 billion, representing approximately 14% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in 2019.\nFinally, we continue to maintain a very robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. Fiscal 2023 is now well underway and with a strong program of showcase events still to come, coupled with the strongest balance sheet in the industry, Fox is uniquely placed to navigate any macro uncertainty and deliver value to our shareholders. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call back over to Gabby.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we'll be happy to take questions from the investment community."

Welcome to the FOX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI'll now turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.\nPlease note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding FOX Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings.\nAdditionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks very much, Gabby, and welcome aboard. Well, we have concluded another successful fiscal year, achieving both the financial and operational goals we set ourselves, with a relentless focus on strengthening our core brands, while investing in our high-growth digital initiatives.\nOver the year, we delivered 8% total company revenue growth, including 7% affiliate revenue growth, notably without the benefit of any meaningful renewals and 9% advertising revenue growth, despite the record political revenues we saw in the prior fiscal.\nThose of you on this call who were at our 2019 Investor Day will remember our commitment to you that we would have achieved $1 billion of incremental Television segment affiliate revenue by the end of calendar '22. I'm more than pleased to confirm that we have achieved that $1 billion target in this past quarter, a full 6 months ahead of schedule.\nAs anticipated, our EBITDA was down modestly as we continued our investment in TUBI and the FOX News Media digital properties, including FOX Nation and FOX Weather and with the launch of the USFL this past spring. Most importantly, FOX continues to stand apart in a crowded media ecosystem, delivering a consistent operating performance and a robust free cash flow profile alongside an enviable balance sheet.\nOur leadership position was again evident during the recent upfront advertising sales cycle in which we booked volume commitments approximately 15% above last year's upfront, with nearly 25% of our current year commitments across our growing digital properties. We achieved pricing increases in the high single to low double digits as compared to last year's upfront.\nSports led the upfront market, illustrated by the fact that we sold more NFL Sunday advertising in the current upfront market than we did across Sunday and Thursday combined in the prior year's market. This excludes advertising commitments for the upcoming Super Bowl, where we are pacing well ahead of schedule and seeing very robust demand at record pricing levels.\nOur success in the upfront spanned our entire portfolio. We were able to achieved broadcast level pricing increases at FOX News, boosted sellout at FOX Entertainment and importantly, drove significantly more incremental ad dollars into TUBI. We are, of course, aware of the chatter around advertising headwinds. And of course, we will be prepared if the market turns downward. But let me be clear, we are currently not seeing an adverse advertising impact on our business.\nThis speaks to the unique positioning and strength of our core platforms. Over 2/3 of our fiscal '22 advertising revenue was generated by live content with sports and news delivering 40% and 30%, respectively. Locally, base market advertising sales have been stable. In fact, we are currently seeing a return to growth in the auto category for the first time in a couple of years. This stability in the base market provides a good foundation for the upcoming political cycle, where the outlook is remarkably strong.\nOn a comparable basis, our June quarter political advertising revenues were roughly 3x larger than those of the fiscal fourth quarter of the last presidential election, which turned out to be an all-time record political cycle for the company. With the combination of political races and ballot issues across our markets, we continue to expect this election to deliver another record midterm cycle.\nIn fact, excluding the impact of the Georgia runoffs in the last cycle, this midterm cycle looks certain to surpass the 2020 presidential cycle at our local stations. There are U.S. center races in 13 of our 18 markets, including what we expect to be heavy political spending in Arizona, Florida and Georgia. Additionally, there are gubernatorial races in 17 of our 18 markets where we expect heavy spending in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Texas and Wisconsin. Add to that the issue money in a few key markets, and we are seeing an unprecedented wave of political spending, which accelerates as we head towards November.\nAt the national level, we believe that we achieved the highest upfront pricing increases in cable news history at FOX News, which, to a certain extent, is to be expected as the FOX News channel again closed the year as cable's most watched network in prime time in total day and continues to generate audiences on par with those of the Big 4 broadcast networks.\nFOX News was the only cable news network to post viewership gains in the fiscal year in the key adult 25 to 54 demo and total viewers, while extending its streak to 16 consecutive months beating CNN and MSNBC combined in prime and total day for both the key demo and total viewers.\nFor over 2 decades, FOX News has been the highest-rated cable news channel in prime time. Notably, FOX News just finished the month of July as the third most viewed network in weekday prime in all of television, trailing only CBS and NBC.\nI've spoken about the political diversity of the FOX News audience previously, specifically about the fact that we have more independents and Democrats watching us than watch CNN or MSNBC, but the diversity of our audience extends beyond political affiliation. In July, the Fox News Channel was the most viewed cable network with Asian and Hispanic viewers. In fact, in that month, viewing among Hispanic households was up 38% and among Asian households up 43%.\nElsewhere news, the FOX Nation platform increased its subscriber base by approximately 80% over the past fiscal year. supported by sustained and high conversion rates of trialists to paid subscribers and retention rates well above industry averages.\nAt FOX Sports, live event viewing was up 5% through the first half of the calendar year, led by our NASCAR schedule, which generated viewership up a solid 10% over 2021. This spring was busy for FOX Sports as we launched the inagural season of the USFL. The USFL averaged over 1 million viewers on FOX, at least 20% higher than the EPL on NBC and regular season NHL broadcast on ABC and more than twice the viewership of MLS on FOX.\nIn its first season, the USFL clearly delivered on its most essential goal, which was to demonstrate that the league belongs alongside other long-established spring sports properties. And as you know, we have an incredibly strong year ahead in sports, which includes the FIFA Men's World Cup beginning this November and the Super Bowl next February.\nAt FOX Entertainment, our content strategy is focused on ad-supported multi-platform television that can thrive both creatively and financially well into the future. We look to use our broadcast network to build and support businesses beyond our linear air. An example of this approach is Next Level Chef, which was the #1 new broadcast entertainment program this past season and FOX' first owned production inside our partnership with Gordon Ramsay, whereas we used only to license Gordon's product from third parties, we now license hits like Next Level Chef to third parties, and we have done so with the sale of the format to ITV in the U.K. Another example of how we extend and monetize our IP is the just launch of Gordon Ramsay FAST Channel on TUBI.\nAnd speaking of TUBI, 1 year ago -- 1 year into our focused investment cycle at TUBI, the platform generated TVT growth of nearly 40% and revenue growth of 45% across the fiscal year, with both metrics coming in better than planned and reinforcing our decision to invest in this strategic asset.\nDuring the June quarter, 34% growth in TVT helped drive revenue growth in the low double digits despite a more difficult prior year comparison when we began our ramped content and monetization strategy. In the quarter, we launched 25 linear channels, grew our VOD library to over 45,000 titles and premiered 13 efficient TUBI originals. We will continue to invest judiciously in TUBI with our sights set on achieving $1 billion in revenue run rate in the next couple of years.\nAs you know, our affiliate renewal cycle begins in earnest this new fiscal year, and we are again looking forward to industry-leading gains from the superior value of our channels and services. With some early meaningful station and affiliate deals already completed, including the recently closed Verizon deal, we go into this renewal cycle with confidence the market appreciates the value of our brands.\nIn aggregate, these financial and operating achievements again highlight the fact that the FOX story is one of strength, one of focus and one of stability. We will see how the macroeconomic environment evolves during the months ahead. But as we have demonstrated over the course of the last few years, FOX is well positioned to outperform.\nWe remain encouraged by the FOX specific trends that I've highlighted and that we're observing in real time, underpinned by the best balance sheet in the business, the same solid balance sheet that helped us thrive despite the challenges of COVID and that will continue to support our investments for long-term growth and shareholder returns.\nAnd with that, I will turn you over to Steve.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nCFO, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. We ended our third full fiscal year with total company revenue growth of 8% and top line growth across all of our operating segments in every quarter of fiscal '22. Even in a year that for us was light on major sports events and was an off-cycle political year, total company advertising revenues led this growth with a 9% increase over fiscal '21.\nCable segment advertising revenues were up 9%, and primarily benefited from higher pricing across our news and sports networks. Television segment advertising revenues were up 8% on the back of increased engagement of TUBI as well as higher pricing and the normalization of live event programming at the FOX Network, following COVID-related disruptions last year. These gains were partially offset by the absence of the prior year's record political revenues and lower ratings of FOX Entertainment.\nTotal company affiliate revenues increased 7%, led by 10% growth at the Television segment and 5% at the Cable segment. Total company other revenues increased 15%, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues as compared to prior year pandemic-related disruptions, growth in FOX Nation subscription revenues and the consolidation of TMZ, MarVista and Studio Ramsay Global. This growth in other revenues was partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the company's sports marketing businesses last fiscal year.\nWe also delivered sustained momentum in our consolidated digital revenues with a nearly 30% increase year-over-year. This digital growth was supported by the organic investments across our digital portfolio that we articulated at the outset of the fiscal year. These investments, the establishment of USFL and higher programming rights amortization associated with the normalized sports and entertainment schedules, contributed to a modest decrease in our full year adjusted EBITDA, which came in at $2.96 billion.\nFull year net income attributable to stockholders was $1.21 billion or $2.11 per share, while adjusted EPS was $2.79, down modestly against the $2.88 billion -- sorry, the $2.88 reported last year, primarily due to the impacts on EBITDA I just mentioned.\nTurning to the quarter, we delivered total company revenues of $3.03 billion, up 5% over the same period in '21. This growth was led by a 7% increase in total company advertising revenues, highlighted by the strength of FOX News, record June quarter political revenues at FOX Television stations and continued growth of TUBI. Total company affiliate revenues grew 4%, with 7% growth at the Television segment and 2% growth at the Cable segment. Once again, this distribution revenue growth was driven by rate increases as the rate of subscriber declines increased modestly in the quarter with trailing 12-month industry sub losses running in the high 5% range.\nTotal company other revenues increased 4% as the consolidation of our entertainment production companies and continued momentum at FOX Nation were partially offset by the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were impacted by COVID in the prior year. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $770 million, up 7% over the comparative period in fiscal '21 as our revenue growth was partially offset by higher expenses, including the impact of the anticipated digital investments of FOX News Media and TUBI and the first year deficit associated with the launch of the USFL.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of $306 million or $0.55 per share was higher than the $253 million or $0.43 per share in the prior year quarter. This variance reflects the EBITDA movement I just described, along with the mark-to-market adjustments associated with the company's investments recognized in other than that.\nExcluding non-core items, adjusted EPS in the June quarter of $0.74 was up 14% over last year's $0.65. It is worth noting our effective income tax rate was higher for both the quarter and the full year, primarily due to a $30 million remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets associated with changes in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings. This had no impact on our cash taxes.\nNow let's turn to the performance of our operating segments for the quarter, starting with Cable Networks, which reported a 4% increase in revenues. This was led by a 14% increase in cable advertising revenues, driven by strong gains in both pricing and audience at FOX News notwithstanding slightly higher levels of preemptions associated with our breaking news coverage.\nAlso contributing to the overall segment revenue growth was a 2% increase in affiliate revenues, once again due to the healthy pricing gains across all of our networks. Cable other revenues were unchanged compared to the prior year as the continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation and the addition of the USFL were offset by the impact of the timing of sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID in the prior year.\nEBITDA at our Cable segment was down 7% against the prior year as these revenue increases were more than offset by increased expenses, including the planned digital investment and higher programming costs, including those associated with breaking news coverage at Fox News Media as well as the launch of the USFL.\nOur television segment reported a 5% increase in quarterly revenues. This was led by a 7% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting increases for both direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations and our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates. Our Television segment delivered 4% growth in advertising revenues, driven by higher political advertising at the FOX Television stations, continued growth at TUBI and the introduction of the USFL, partially offset by lower ratings of FOX Entertainment.\nOther revenues at television increased 3% in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of TMZ and MarVista Entertainment and the consolidation of our stake in Studio Ramsay Global, partially offset by the timing of deliveries at Bento Box.\nEBITDA at our Television segment increased over 50% as expenses were flat against the prior year quarter. Here, we saw an accelerated digital investment at TUBI and the consolidation of the entertainment production assets, offset by the timing of programming costs at FOX Entertainment.\nDuring the full year, we generated free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx of $1.6 billion. Over the course of fiscal 2022, we returned $1 billion of capital through the repurchase of 18.7 million Class A shares and 8.7 million Class B shares. This was supplemented by over $270 million in dividend payments And underlining our continued commitment to shareholder returns, today, we announced an increase in our semi-annual dividend to $0.25 per share.\nWith the payment of this dividend, we will have cumulatively returned over $3.75 billion of capital to our shareholders since the formation of FOX. This includes share repurchases totaling over $2.65 billion against our buyback authorization of $4 billion. From our balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $5.2 billion in cash and approximately $7.2 billion in debt.\nOur fiscal 2022 financial performance, along with the progress we have made on our strategic priorities, provide a strong foundation for us to springboard into fiscal '23, where the setup is incredibly favorable. We remain confident that collectively, the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, the momentum heading into November's midterm elections and the start of our next major distribution cycle will deliver record revenues and EBITDA in fiscal '23.\nAs we've highlighted previously, our plans for fiscal '23 incorporate maintaining our current level of investment in our digital growth initiatives. From an affiliate revenue perspective, as you would expect, we make no predictions on industry subscriber volumes. However, from a rate perspective, given the timing and nature of our affiliate renewals, you should expect to see the financial benefit of these renewals skewed to the second half of the fiscal year and concentrated toward our Television segment.\nOur focused strategy and operational execution continue to distinguish us. Together, they have delivered sustained financial outperformance since the establishment of FOX and will be showcased with a banner year of events in fiscal '23. This momentum, supported by the most robust balance sheet in the industry, position us well to navigate the broader macroeconomic turbulence, while creating value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, Gabby, let's now open it up for Q&A.\n\nGabrielle Brown\n\nExecutive VP & Chief IR Officer, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community."

Welcome to the Fox Corporation Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to our Chief Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJoseph Dorrego\n\nChief IR Officer & Executive VP of Corporate Initiatives, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2022 3rd quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community.\nPlease note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA or EBITA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on this call.\nI don't know about everyone else, but I often find early mornings after a coffee or 2 or 3 to be a good time to reflect on the progress we are making and to plan the days or weeks ahead. Sitting here on the Fox lot with my colleagues, I can recall our Investor Day when we saw all of you or most of you in person and kicked off the new Fox, now already a few years ago. Some of you asked then, correctly, could the new, streamlined Fox aggressively grow its top line revenues? And while we committed to you then that we would add $1 billion of television distribution revenue by calendar '22, we all knew that proof would be in the pudding. So it's pleasing that this quarter, we again delivered healthy distribution and advertising revenue growth across our brands and complemented by further stellar growth at Tubi. Overall, we delivered 7% revenue growth, led by 9% advertising growth and 5% growth in our distribution revenues. As a reminder, this 5% growth in distribution revenues does not include the benefit of any material renewals this fiscal year. Those renewals start next year.\nAnd our advertising growth was notably broad-based. Cable advertising grew by 20% in the quarter. This growth was driven by FOX News as its pricing and rating strength more than offset the elevated level of preemptions due to the coverage of the war in Ukraine. Television advertising grew by 6% in the quarter. This increase was led by Tubi, which saw its advertising growth accelerate from approximately 40% in the December quarter to 50% on the back of increased engagement. In addition, continued strong demand for sports drove overall growth at the Fox Network. And at the local level, advertising revenues increased despite continued supply chain and other economic headwinds.\nAs we look to our upfront next Monday, we are encouraged by the early momentum in the market. And we believe that our focus on live, including the must-have events of the coming year, such as the Super Bowl, the World Cup and even the mid-term political cycle, puts us firmly in the lead with our advertising partners as upfront deals are made. And as we established last year, Tubi will continue to play a leading integrated role in our upfront efforts.\nWe are in this enviable position due to the execution of our strategy by our core business units. It's hard work, but it pays off.\nFOX News Channel finished the first quarter of calendar '22 as cable's most watched network in prime time and total day viewers. In fact, FOX News was the only cable news network to post gains versus the prior year quarter in total viewers and the key demographic, adults 25 to 54. FOX News has now beat CNN and MSNBC combined in total day and with both total viewers and the key demo for 9 consecutive months, and with a total day share of 54% across both demos. These achievements reflect the growing breadth and depth of our programming slate. Notably, The Five was the most watched program in cable news for the second consecutive quarter. Meanwhile, Gutfeld! delivered its highest-rated quarter ever, while Jesse Watters Primetime, which launched in late January, is averaging over 3 million viewers in the 7:00 p.m. time slot.\nBroadcasting 97 of the Top 100 most watched cable news telecasts this past quarter, FOX News continues to attract the most politically diverse audience in its peer group, watched by more democrats and independents than MSNBC and CNN in total day and prime time.\nMeanwhile, our sustained and disciplined investment continued to drive subscriber growth and engagement at FOX Nation. The FOX Nation subscriber base has more than tripled in less than 18 months, driving engagement levels to new heights in each quarter. The avid FOX News fans have clearly embraced the FOX Nation platform as demonstrated by its consistently high conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers and retention rates well above industry averages.\nMomentum also continued at FOX Weather, which benefited from expanded distribution on Roku, YouTube TV and Amazon, resulting in sequential growth in total view time across each month of the quarter.\nAt FOX Sports, the USFL is off to an encouraging start. Through its first 3 weeks, nearly 20 million people have watched the USFL on TV, and games on FOX and NBC are averaging 1.5 million viewers. That compares favorably to well-established spring sports properties like the NHL, Formula 1, the EPL and MLS, all properties which either recently earned sizable rights increases or are expected to do so soon. We are clearly establishing that the USFL belongs in this competitive set, which is our primary goal in this first season.\nAt the NFL, we are pleased to announce that we have reached agreement to carry an incremental game this coming year on Christmas Day. As a reminder, last year's Christmas Day game on FOX delivered over 28 million viewers. We look forward to the release of the full NFL schedule expected later this week.\nElsewhere, our NASCAR season is off to a strong start. Though early, the low teens gains we are seeing in viewership would represent one of the more meaningful single-season improvements across the 22-year history of NASCAR on FOX. And we couldn't be more excited about the upcoming 2022 FIFA World Cup on FOX Sports, with the qualifications of the U.S. Men's Team and its blockbuster match against England on Friday, November 25. This match will contribute to an unprecedented Thanksgiving weekend of sports on FOX, bookended by the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day and the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry on Saturday. That's likely to add up to the most watched NFL game of the regular season, the most watched U.S. men's national soccer team match ever, and the most watched college football game of the season, all during the busiest consumer shopping weekend of the year. This speaks to the power of our platforms and to the prudence of our strategy.\nOf course, our linear businesses are complemented by Tubi, where total view time increased 50%, propelled by record quarterly viewership. In fact, Tubi delivered 18 of its top 20 TVT days in its history this past quarter, a period where there's traditionally some softer seasonality in the AVOD market. Meanwhile, Tubi expanded its industry-leading library, and now counts more than 42,000 titles in this portfolio. Importantly, Tubi also renewed key distribution deals, including its Amazon partnership, and signed its first custom deal for Samsung's smart TVs.\nIn the third quarter, we continue to invest in the future of Tubi, which we believe will be a strong growth engine for the company for years to come. We have also invested in FOX Weather, which is now available ubiquitously in every broadband home across the country and provides our clients with a new, very broad advertising platform.\nAnd finally, FOX Nation goes from strength to strength as it builds upon the engagement between FOX News and our most ardent fans. These initiatives illustrate the entrepreneurial nature of FOX, endowed with America's strongest media brands and most enviable balance sheet.\nBefore handing over to Steve, I'd just like to acknowledge the incredible bravery, sacrifice and professionalism of the entire FOX News reporting team in covering the war in Ukraine. Journalism is rarely easy, and often, it is very hard. Bearing light on the horrors of this war and the resulting refugee and humanitarian crisis that is born is probably the hardest assignment we can give. I am, we all are, deeply grateful for the tremendous work and extraordinary journalism that Trey Yingst, Jennifer Griffin, Steve Harrigan, Jeff (sic) [Greg] Palkot, Ben Hall and many more excellent reporters have provided our audience.\nTragically, 2 of our journalists were killed in Kiev, and Ben Hall remains in treatment for his serious injuries. Our thoughts and the thoughts of the whole Fox family are with them and their families.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Steve.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nCFO, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone.\nOur third quarter results once again reflect the strength of our leadership brands and the continued growth of our digital businesses. We achieved total company revenue growth of 7% year-over-year, delivering top line growth across all of our operating segments for our fourth consecutive quarter. Total company affiliate revenues increased 5% despite the fact that only 5% of our total company distribution revenues have been up for renewal this fiscal year. Meanwhile, the rate of industry subscriber declines remained steady in the quarter, with trailing 12-month sub losses running below 5%. Total company advertising revenues grew 9% as our leadership brands once again delivered premium pricing, coupled with continued strong momentum at Tubi.\nQuarterly adjusted EBITDA was $811 million, down 10% over the comparative period last year, as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher expenses. As we have foreshadowed on prior calls, the increase in expenses was mainly driven by the anticipated increase in digital investments, including FOX News Media and Tubi. Additionally, we saw higher programming rights amortization and production costs at Fox Sports, and were impacted by an approximately $30 million write-down of certain scripted programming at Fox Entertainment.\nNet income attributable to stockholders of $283 million or $0.50 per share compared to the $567 million or $0.96 per share we reported in the prior year quarter. As we have seen in recent quarters, this below-the-line variance was primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter, which we recognize in other net.\nExcluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $0.81 per share compared to last year's $0.88, primarily reflecting the movement in EBITDA.\nNow let's turn to our business segment results, starting with Cable Networks, which reported an 8% in revenues. The strong revenue delivery was underpinned by significant gains in cable advertising revenues, which grew 20% in the quarter. Notwithstanding slightly higher levels of preemptions associated with our breaking news coverage of the war in Ukraine, FOX News was the engine of this advertising revenue growth, with strong gains in both audience and pricing. Cable affiliate revenues increased 3% over the prior year period, a result of healthy pricing gains across all of our networks.\nCable other revenues increased 23%, led by the timing of sports sublicensing revenues, which were impacted by COVID last year, as well as continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. This growth was partially offset by the disposition of our sports marketing businesses, which was sold in March of last year.\nEBITDA at our Cable segment increased by $14 million over the prior year period as these revenue increases were partially offset by higher expenses related to the digital investment at FOX News Media and the timing of programming amortization and production costs at the cable sports networks following the COVID-related disruptions of the prior year.\nAlmost matching the strong revenue growth in Cable, our Television segment delivered a 7% increase in revenue. This was led by an 8% increase in television affiliate revenues over the prior year quarter, reflecting increases for both our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations and for our programming fees from non-owned station affiliates. This run rate assures achievement of our target of $1 billion of incremental television affiliate revenue this calendar year that we announced at our Investor Day back in 2019.\nOur Television segment also delivered 6% advertising revenue growth, reflecting strong linearizing at the FOX Network and continued growth at Tubi, partially offset by lower impressions of FOX Entertainment. At Fox Sports, the impact of the additional week to the NFL regular season was offset by the absence of the rotating NFL divisional playoff game this year. And at the FOX Television stations, notwithstanding the ongoing supply chain-related challenges to the auto category, we continue to grow advertising revenues supported by gains from our digital sales efforts and continued demand from the sports betting category.\nOther revenues in our Television segment increased 17%, primarily due to the impact of the acquisitions of MarVista Entertainment and TMZ and the consolidation of our stake in Studio Ramsay Global.\nTelevision EBITDA was lower by $100 million against the prior year period, as its healthy revenue growth was more than offset by the planned digitization at Tubi, higher sports programming amortization and production costs at FOX Sports, and an approximately $30 million write-down of certain scripted programming at FOX Entertainment.\nTurning now to cash flow. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.54 billion in the quarter, reflecting our normal seasonal cycle of collecting advertising revenues from our old programming and the result of our sports rights payments being concentrated in the first half of our fiscal year. Our share repurchases since the commencement of the quarter have totaled $300 million, and fiscal year-to-date, we have now returned over $1 billion of capital to shareholders. This is comprised of approximately $275 million in the form of our semi-annual dividend payment and a further $800 million in share buybacks.\nWe remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion and have now cumulatively repurchased approximately $2.4 billion, representing over 11% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019. We continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt.\nSo as we look forward, the setup for fiscal 2023 remains incredibly strong with the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl LVII, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, November's mid-term elections, and the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle.\nSo with that, I'll now turn the call back to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you very much, Steve.\nAs you know, we usually -- after Steve's comments, we go straight to Joe and straight to questions. But we have breaking news, which I'm -- in the spirit of being always open and giving our investors and our shareholders the latest news in the company, I'll go straight to this, and literally, this is happening in real time.\nWe are pleased to announce that immediately following his playing career, whenever that may be, 7-time Super Bowl winner, Tom Brady, will be joining us at Fox Sports as our lead analyst. Over the course of this long-term agreement, Tom will not only call our biggest NFL games with Kevin Burkhart, but will also serve as an ambassador for us, particularly with the client and promotional initiatives. We are delighted that Tom has committed to joining the FOX team, and we wish him all the best during this upcoming season. I'm sure everyone joins me in warmly welcoming Tom Brady on board. Thank you very much.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Joe.\n\nJoseph Dorrego\n\nChief IR Officer & Executive VP of Corporate Initiatives, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Lachlan. And now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community."

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Joe Dorrego. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJoseph Dorrego\n\nChief IR Officer & Executive VP of Corporate Initiatives, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call.

First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. .\nPlease note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results.

And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\n\nLachlan Keith Murdoch\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to discuss another -- a really, truly remarkable quarter for Fox Corporation.\nIn our fiscal second quarter, we delivered 9% revenue growth and 2% EBITDA growth, even while continuing to invest in our digital initiatives. These results demonstrate our ability to expand our emerging digital businesses while focusing on delivering overall growth for our shareholders. This strategy has been unwavering and disciplined, and we have not been convinced to deviate into areas where we cannot be a leader.\nOur financial results in the quarter benefited from healthy affiliate revenue growth and what continues to be, at least for Fox, a robust advertising marketplace. Our advertising revenue grew 6% versus the prior year quarter, which is notable when you consider that last year included a record net political advertising revenue of nearly $250 million.\nFrom a national advertising sales perspective, we have seen robust CPM growth and broad-based demand across most advertiser categories. This is clear evidence that our portfolio of leadership brands, which over-index in sports and news, continues to deliver the live audiences at scale that our advertising partners seek. To understand the scale of our reach across the U.S., you only need to look to our NFC championship game a week ago, where, at peak, we had 55 million viewers tuned into the game.\nThe overall market trends in local advertising also remained positive for us as we achieved double-digit base advertising revenue growth in the quarter when excluding political revenue. Perhaps even more important to note, our local advertising revenues have now fully recovered from the impact of COVID and are up over prepandemic levels.\nWhile we continue to see softness in the local automotive category caused by the ongoing supply chain delays, this is being more than offset by growth in nearly all other categories led by sports betting. We have already written over 50% more local sports betting revenue at this point of the fiscal year than we did across all of fiscal '21. We have seen these same local trends continuing thus far into the third quarter. Overall, our operating businesses are performing well, underscoring our unique strategy and differentiated position.\nLet me touch on some of the highlights. The FOX News Channel celebrated its 25th anniversary this past October by reinforcing its exceptional ratings leadership. On the same call last year, we were fielding questions about whether FOX News have peaked, yet for the 20th consecutive year, FOX News is the leader in cable news across the board in total viewers and the 25 to 54 demographic for both total day and primetime. Calendar '21 also marked the sixth consecutive year that FOX News led all of basic cable in total day and primetime viewership.\nFOX News leads by a wide margin. commanding a 55% share of total day cable news viewership this past quarter. FOX News' share of the younger demographic was even higher at 57%, marking its second highest quarterly share of the younger demo on record. FOX News' audience was also the most politically diverse with more independents and Democrats tuning into the network than to our competitors'.\nOur unmatched programming lineup continues to drive these great ratings results and bring a blue-chip roster of advertisers to the channel and its digital extensions. For example, in the aggregate, across all of cable news this past quarter, FOX News delivered 14 of the top 15 programs. We simply could not be better placed as we look forward to the midterm election cycle later this year.\nMeanwhile, the momentum continued at FOX Nation, which increased its net subscribers in the quarter by over 30% versus the September quarter, supported by strong fresh content to help drive higher subscriber numbers and very low churn. Additionally, FOX Weather, which is breaking through a crowded field of established incumbents, is off to a great start, and its growth will continue in the current quarter as we expand the distribution of the FOX Weather live video streams across multiple platforms, including YouTube TV, Amazon News, Roku and Fubo.\nAt FOX Sports, we also had a strong quarter, led by our NFL and college football coverage. Over the last 12 months, FOX Sports had more telecast across the top 100 programs than any other network, let alone any other network sports division. And of the total minutes of NFL and college football that Americans watched during the 2021 regular season, about 1/3 were viewed on FOX.\nI commented on the post season a moment ago, and by any measure, it was a great series of games for us and for the NFL. Audiences and advertisers embraced the post season, which capped a record-setting revenue full season for us at FOX and non-Super Bowl year.\nDemonstrating that growth and the demand, we had 21 advertisers placed in this year's NFC championship game that were not present a year ago. The results from this season underscore the value and importance of our long-term partnership with the NFL that will continue for at least the next 12 years.\nCollege football had equally impressive results. FOX's big new Saturday window grew by 15% over the normal 2019 season. and with an average viewership of over 5.8 million has become the #1 window in all of college football. To put the success of our college football strategy in proper context, in 2016, FOX's last season prior to adding the Big Ten rights, our share cost football viewership was just 7%. Today, we have grown this threefold to a 22% share.\nWe continue to leverage our leading sports franchises into adjacent opportunities and are pleased with progress at FOX Sports Super 6, which ended the year with more than 6 million users, up more than 20% over the prior year. In addition, this coming April, we will launch the USFL, a new innovative spring football league, which Fox will control. And again, our strategy to invest in our flagship brands and serve our loyal audiences has enabled us to realize new and exciting digital growth opportunities.\nAnd nowhere is this more apparent than at Tubi. While some companies are focused on multibillion dollar content investments in search of streaming subscription growth, to be continues its unrelenting focus on advertising video on demand with a strategic and measured investment approach. This approach has yielded solid momentum across all key revenue and performance indicators.\nQ2 represented Tubi's best performing quarter ever; in December, its best-performing month. In the quarter alone, Tubi achieved 54 of its top 100 revenue days, 55 of its top 100 viewer days and 50 of its top 100 total view time, or TVT days. Tubi exceeded 3.6 billion hours streamed in calendar 2021, marking a 40% increase in TVT over the prior year due in large part to the breadth of its library now at more than 41,000 titles, a quickly expanding linear news and sports offering with more than 100 channels, its high return on investment in licensed content and original releases and its world-class technology.\nWe chose to acquire and now operate Tubi with a singular goal of winning in AVOD. There are no competing priorities internally and no revenue transfer from other assets in our portfolio. That is to say, Tubi revenue is truly incremental to us.\nAs Steve will discuss in a moment, our focused portfolio of leadership assets and emerging digital businesses is delivering consistent growth in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. Taken as a whole, we have the most valuable news franchise in the country, if not the world, the leading live sports franchise and a top broadcast network reinforced by a strategic portfolio of local stations, all of which have digital extensions to their businesses.\nAnd in the 3 years since we formed Fox Corporation, we have used this collective platform to develop a rapidly growing AVOD streaming business and create optionality within the sports betting ecosystem. We feel we are in a strong position and could not be more excited for the months ahead as we prepare for what should be an active and exceptional fiscal 2023 for Fox. With that, I will turn it over to Steve to take you through the quarter in more detail.\n\nSteven Silvester Tomsic\n\nCFO, Fox Corporation\n\nThanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter with total company revenues growing 9% year-over-year, once again highlighted by revenue growth across all of our operating segments. Our total company affiliate revenues grew 11% against the prior year quarter, reflecting healthy increases at both the cable networks and television segments. The rate of subscriber declines held steady in the quarter with trailing 12-month industry sub losses continuing to run below 5%.\nNotwithstanding the tough comparison against our record political advertising revenues in the prior year quarter, our total company advertising revenues grew by 6%. As Lachlan mentioned, we benefited from the premium pricing our core brands were able to extract from a healthy marketplace, continued growth of Tubi and a full season of college football following the disruptions caused by COVID in the prior year.\nTaking a step back from the comparability challenges versus fiscal '21, Fox's total advertising revenues are now running a healthy 12% ahead of Q2 fiscal '20, which was pre COVID and unaffected by political advertising revenues. This is before taking into account the contribution of Tubi to our current day advertising revenues, which take the reported growth rate up to 20%.\nMeanwhile, total company other revenues increased 20%, supported by a full college football season that drove high sports sublicensing revenues at the cable segment following the disruptions caused by COVID last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $310 million as the revenue increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with normalized sports and entertainment programming schedules, contractual sports rights escalators and the digital investments we called out on previous calls at FOX News Media and Tubi.\nThe net loss attributable to stockholders of $85 million or $0.15 per share varies from the net income attributable to stockholders of $224 million or $0.37 per share in the prior year quarter primarily due to the change in fair value of the company's investment in Flutter, which we recognize in other net. Excluding the impact of this and other noncore items, adjusted EPS of $0.13 in the current year quarter was down modestly when compared to the $0.16 reported in the prior year quarter primarily due to the higher depreciation and amortization resulting from our new broadcast facility coming online late last fiscal year.\nNow let's turn to our business segment results, beginning with Cable Networks. Cable revenues increased 10% year-over-year with 12% growth in cable affiliate revenues. As a reminder, the reported 12% growth includes the impact of distribution credits we accrued for last year as a result of canceled college football games due to COVID. Excluding the impact of the distribution credits, underlying cable affiliate revenues increased low single digits in the December quarter, reflecting contractual pricing gains across our portfolio of networks even without the benefit of any meaningful renewals this year.\nCable advertising revenues grew 3% primarily as a result of continued pricing strength across the portfolio led by FOX News Media and additional MLB playoff games at the national sports networks. Despite the difficult comparison to last year's election cycle, FOX News Media actually expanded its linear advertising revenues in the quarter, a testament to the clear leadership position of the channel.\nCable other revenues increased by $26 million led by higher sports sublicensing revenues, which were impacted by COVID last year as well, as continued subscription momentum at FOX Nation. Cable EBITDA increased 17% over the prior year, reflecting healthy revenue growth partially offset by higher programming costs associated with contractual rights escalators and normalized schedules at the national sports networks.\nWe also increased our digital investment at FOX News Media, including expanded programming and marketing at FOX Nation and the launch of FOX Weather. At television, we delivered 8% revenue growth in the quarter. This was led by a 10% increase in television affiliate revenues, reflecting double-digit rate increases for both our direct retransmission revenues at our owned and operated stations and programming freeze -- fees from nonowned station affiliates. We also delivered advertising revenue growth of 6% despite the absence of the record political advertising revenues we generated in the prior year. This growth reflects continued pricing strength at the FOX Network, where our full sports lineup led by the NFL, college football and the World Series, delivered record Q2 advertising revenues for our network sports business.\nWe also continue to see strong momentum at Tubi with revenues up by over 40% in the quarter and a meaningful rebound in the base market of the FOX Television Stations. As Lachlan mentioned, supply chain constraints had no real observable impact on our portfolio with softness in the local order demand more than offset by the growth in other categories, including sports betting.\nTelevision other revenues increased $31 million, primarily reflecting higher content revenues at FOX Entertainment as well as the acquisitions of MarVista and TMZ. EBITDA at our television segment was down $88 million against the prior year period primarily as a result of higher programming costs associated with the normalized entertainment schedule and sports rights escalators at the FOX Network and the planned ramp-up of digital investment at Tubi.\nTurning now to free cash flow, where we recorded a deficit in the quarter of $753 million, which reflects the normal working capital cycle of the business with the concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables in the first half of our fiscal year.\nWe continue to be active with respect to capital returns to our shareholders with a further $300 million of additional buybacks since the start of the December quarter. We remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $4 billion, of which we have now cumulatively repurchased $2.15 billion, representing over 10% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in November 2019.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we finished the quarter with $4.26 billion in cash and $7.95 billion in debt. Subsequent to quarter end, we used cash on hand to repay our $750 million January bond maturity.\nOur ability to deliver another successful quarter despite the continued uncertainty of COVID and difficult comparisons against the prior year political cycle gives us confidence in the remainder of our fiscal '22. As previously discussed, with only approximately 5% of our total company affiliate revenues up for renewal this fiscal year, we expect affiliate revenue growth will moderate in the back half of the year. However, the demonstrated strength of our focused portfolio positions us well for our next major renewal cycle, which begins in fiscal '23 and where we have approximately 70% of our total company affiliate revenues due for renewal across fiscal '23 and '24.\nWe plan to continue to invest in our digital assets, given our success to date. Now that we are at the midpoint of our fiscal year, we anticipate that the year's total net EBITDA investment in our digital initiatives, along with the expected impact of the inaugural season of the USFL, to land towards the lower end of the $200 million to $300 million range that we have previously outlined.\nAs Lachlan mentioned, we anticipate a strong fiscal '23 with the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, November's midterm elections and the start of our next major distribution renewal cycle. And with that, I'll hand it back to Joe.\n\nJoseph Dorrego\n\nChief IR Officer & Executive VP of Corporate Initiatives, Fox Corporation\n\nThank you, Steve. And now we'd be happy to take questions from the investment community. ."

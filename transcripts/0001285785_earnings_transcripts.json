[Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Jason Tremblay. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Tremblay\n\nVice President of Enterprise Strategy & Business Support\n\nThank you, and welcome to our Third Quarter 2025 earnings call. Opening comments will be provided by Bruce Bodine, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jenny Wang, Executive Vice President of Commercial, will then cover the market update. Luciano Siani Pires, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review financial results and capital allocation progress. We will then open the floor for questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release published yesterday in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce.\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call. Mosaic's third quarter results reflect the resilience and strength of our global business as well as the extraordinary work our teams are delivering to help us operate effectively in a highly dynamic market and geopolitical environment. We've demonstrated the ability to shift tons to regions with the strongest demand and capture value across agricultural and industrial markets, and we are navigating near-term fertilizer affordability issues while looking ahead to positive structural market trends. We remain focused on achieving reliable and consistent production from our assets, leveraging our market access advantage and executing our capital reallocation strategy, all in the service of creating shareholder value.\nLet me begin with our key messages for the quarter. First, we've made major investments in asset health, and we are seeing improving reliability. U.S. phosphate production has improved sequentially throughout the year and we remain focused on driving consistent performance across our phosphate assets. Second, our business in Brazil continues to deliver excellent performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased year-over-year, and we are managing well despite a challenging credit environment. Third, global potash demand remains very strong, especially in the Eastern Hemisphere and we are running near record operating rates to meet that demand and capture value. Fourth, cost discipline remains a priority. We've achieved $150 million in initial cost savings and are on track to achieve our revised $250 million cost savings target by the end of 2026, driven by automation, supply chain optimization and improved fixed cost absorption as production increases. And finally, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation.\nRecent divestments, including the Taquari potash mine and the Patos de Minas asset reflect our commitment to streamlining the portfolio and redeploying capital toward higher return opportunities. To cover our third quarter results, net income for the third quarter increased to $411 million versus $122 million in the prior year. While adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter rose to $806 million from $448 million a year ago, driven by higher prices across all segments and very strong performance in Mosaic Fertilizantes.\nLet's look briefly at market dynamics. I'll leave the details to Jenny. Phosphate markets remain tight as global supply constraints persist. Key long-term drivers remain intact, including continued growth in LFP battery demand, rising domestic fertilizer demand in China, which is likely to further erode exports and limited new capacity additions over the next few years. Despite coming off recent highs, phosphate prices remain elevated and affordability pressure remains a concern. We've seen growers in the U.S. and Brazil cautiously approach seasonal buying which has moderated prices and impacted the timing of sales volumes. The challenging farm credit situation in Brazil continues to exacerbate this trend. In India, strong shipments in 2025 have largely recovered back closer to historical norms, but we still see a need for substantial replenishment after multiple years of tight supply and under application.\nPotash markets are balanced as good affordability drives demand around the world, particularly in China and Southeast Asia. Potash and phosphate demand should benefit from the strong yields U.S. and Brazilian farmers have generated this year. We expect big crops in North America and Brazil to remove an additional 1.5 million tonnes of potash and similar amount of phosphate from the soil compared to last year. Growers will need to replenish these nutrients to avoid lower yields next year.\nFor Mosaic, the focus on U.S. phosphate asset health is allowing us to run more reliably and at increased rates. We have experienced 3 consecutive quarters of production volumes improvement, and volumes for the trailing 3-month period ending October have reached approximately 1.8 million tons, which is further improved from the third quarter. We remain committed to return to previously achieved normalized production rates, our focus now is on consistent and sustainable performance. In potash, we completed the Esterhazy turnaround in the second quarter, and the new hydrofloat system is delivering incremental tons. The resilience of our Brazil business demonstrates our effective commercial strategy and disciplined risk management, including a focus on sales to customers with strong credit profiles.\nOur team's deep local expertise and long-standing presence in Brazil have been instrumental in navigating market complexities and maintaining profitable growth. While we expect the usual seasonally slower fourth quarter, we expect earnings in this year's fourth quarter to be higher than a year ago. Cost initiatives are progressing across the company. Mosaic Fertilizantes continues to generate cost reductions and selling, general and administrative expenses declined year-over-year in the third quarter without the impact of the bad debt expense. We continue to leverage our market access, which is a key strategic advantage for Mosaic to accelerate growth in Mosaic Biosciences.\nRevenues for the first 9 months more than doubled year-over-year. We anticipate Mosaic Biosciences will contribute positively to consolidated adjusted EBITDA beginning in the fourth quarter. In addition to strong growth in the Americas, the market for biologicals is growing quickly in China, and we expect India to follow. All in all, we are well positioned for a strong finish to 2025 and a promising 2026 and beyond.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jenny for more detail on agriculture and fertilizer markets.\n\nYijun Wang\n\nSenior VP of Global Strategic Marketing and Head of China & India\n\nThank you, Bruce. We continue to navigate a very dynamic global agriculture environment. Commodity values and trade uncertainty have impacted near-term sentiment in North America, but the recent recovery of corn soybean prices should encourage more fertilizer activity particularly with China now looking to purchase U.S. soybeans and wheat. Any additional direct government help to farmers could provide further support to the market.\nIn Brazil, growers have had to navigate tighter credit availability and higher interest rate but have benefited from expanded trade opportunities, particularly with China. Brazilian fertilizer demand is still growing this year and will likely expand again next year as growers replenish soils and expand acreage for upcoming seasons. Our customers remain engaged and are actively buying fertilizers for the upcoming safrinha core and the 2026 [ suffer ] soybean. Economics remain more constructive in other parts of the world, and Mosaic has pivoted to active markets. Longer term, we continue to see x fundamentals and supportive to fertilizer demand driven by growing demand on food, feed and fuel, which we have seen supportive biofuel legislation around globe.\nMoving to the fertilizer market. On phosphate, markets have been very constructive for March of 2025 given robust demand for new trends, which in turn has supported prices. Prices of phosphate have moderated from recent peaks, but remain elevated, driven by tight global supplies and strong demand. Stripping margins also remain above historical norms. Chinese export of DAP, MAP and TSP are expected to decrease more than 1.5 million tons this year, and China has recently pulled back phosphate export approvals.\nLike Bruce mentioned, LFP battery demand has continued its growth. In the first 3 quarters, Chinese LFP production has already surpassed the full year production in 2024 and representing over 40% year-over-year growth. While Chinese demand for fertilizer and the industrial phosphate continues to grow, we see limited new capacity expansion in other regions over the medium term. In the case of potash, markets are balanced after our first half of supply deficit. Global demand has been steady and expected to approach another record as affordability has encouraged strong Chinese consumption, healthy Brazilian import and the growing Southeast Asian demand, which is tracking up to 50% higher input in some of the key countries.\nGiven this persistent global appetite, we expect record [ Capitec ] shipments this year and the further strength heading into 2026. North American potash demand has held relatively consistent this year on healthy affordability and 4 application tons are moving to the ground as we speak. However, given potash is often applied with phosphate, we may see some modest fall deferral into Q1. In summary, we are optimistic heading into 2026 as growers look to replenish soils and fulfill any pent-up demand. Long-term food security and the industrial use continue to support a constructive outlook for phosphate markets, particularly absent any significant capacity additions. Potash markets are stable on balanced fundamentals, and we expect demand growth to reach to a new record.\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Jenny. Let us take a deeper dive into our performance. You will remember that Q2 EBITDA came below expectations due to a number of larger than usual provisions, inventory adjustments, environmental reserves, legal reserves, and also due to a sharp increase in turnaround expenses, we said these effects were going to reverse in Q3, and they did. Q3 was more of a clean quarter, minimal onetime items and a reversal of turnaround expenses from USD 144 million in Q2 to $85 million in Q3. You should expect idle and turnaround expenses to remain at normal levels in Q4. Despite being a clean quarter, Q3 EBITDA was impacted by lower sales volumes which reflect a shortfall in phosphate production and an intentional slowdown of sales from Fertilizantes given the credit challenges in Brazil.\nLet's address phosphates. On the revenue side, for Q4, we expect phosphate sales to be between 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes with risk to the downside due to demand referral. On the cost side, you saw the significant decline in idle and turnaround expenses from $84 million in Q2 to $42 million in Q3, as expected but we still had a lot of repair work mostly in July, recording into cash conversion costs, which were at $131 per ton, which is about the same level of $126 per ton in the second quarter. The next step is to have a meaningful decline of cash conversion costs in the fourth quarter, given that the asset health and repair work will be normalized and also due to our expectation of higher production and fixed cost absorption. So for phosphates in Q4, higher sales volumes, historically elevated stripping margins and anticipated lower conversion costs should support results.\nIn Potash, cash production cost per ton of $71 was down from $75 from Q2 as production volume increased. We expect the fourth quarter unit costs to be similar to Q3 and finished the year at low to mid-70s. If you recall, we guided 2025 unit production costs in the $64 to $69 range on Investor Day earlier this year. Since then, we kept operating at high cost Colosay mine for longer than expected and the Canadian dollar has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. If we adjust the Investor Day targets to reflect the current exchange rate, our full year forecast would be on track to hit the targets. Potash continues to be a very stable business in terms of production volumes, costs and capital intensity.\nFertilizantes, our results were driven by 2 opposing forces. On one hand, strong underlying business performance, but on the other hand, a softening market in the near term. EBITDA came in at USD 241 million above the $200 million that we have guided even after we strip out the $27 million recovery of the bad debt recorded in Q2. That performance was achieved despite distribution margins at about $20 per ton, which is, again, below our targeted $30 to $40 range as we had to make margin concessions because of the weakening market. The new level of EBITDA generation of Fertilizantes is a testament to the strong cost performance of the business in 2025 despite the strengthening of the Brazilian real.\nWhat do you expect for Q4? Well, we expect an important drop in EBITDA due to a number of factors. Lower prices, still compressed distribution margins normal for the season but still compressed, higher raw materials costs, seasonally lower overall sales volumes and product mix. These uncertainties in volumes, prices and margins are very high in the quarter. So EBITDA could be in a wide range. But in any scenario, we still expect it to be above the same quarter prior year. Thanks to the sustained cost improvements.\nA few words on cash flows. Cash flow from operations was only USD 229 million for the third quarter because of over $400 million increase in working capital driven by several factors: higher physical inventories of the end products in North America and Brazil due to the slowdown in sales at the end of the quarter, higher prices for such inventories and for raw materials and the buildup of inventory of phosphate rock to support future production plans. We expect these effects to partially reverse in Q4, supporting cash flows. But even with that reversal in Q4, if you look at the full year, and we have a slide in the deck for that, working capital will continue to post a large increase. And therefore, 2025 cash flows will be well below what is intrinsic to the business.\nIn 2026, with raw materials prices stabilizing, phosphate rock inventories being consumed by higher production and the adjustment in inventories in Brazil and North America, cash flow from operations and free cash flow is expected to improve significantly. Therefore, we're prudently deferring any extraordinary dividends or buybacks to 2026. Finally, a note on noncore asset sales and capital reallocation. You saw Mosaic announcing the completion of the Taquari transaction yesterday. We sold this potash mine in Brazil for USD 27 million. But the transaction is also expected to eliminate capital investments exceeding USD 20 million in the short term. We will avoid significant capital investments to extend life of mine beyond 2030 in the medium term and we will transfer asset retirement obligations of USD 22 million. So a lot of capital that is not going to be deployed anymore in this asset.\nMosaic also announced the closing of the sales of Patos de Minas idle phosphate mine early October with proceeds of $111 million, with $51 million already received. The rest will be collected over 4 years. We have many assets under review and several strategic talks ongoing and we expect 2026 to be a year when capital reallocation will gather steam. So in conclusion, we are highly confident in our ability to finish the year on a high note and we encourage you shareholders to focus on the strong momentum we expect to enter in 2026.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call. I'll start with an overview of our performance and outlook, then Jenny will provide insight into the markets, and Luciano will discuss details of our earnings.\nOur key messages for today are: First, our hard work to improve operating performance is paying off. It's apparent in our Brazil results, and we expect to see improvements in our U.S. phosphate production business now that the vast majority of our work to enhance reliability is complete. Second, the market environment remains strong with tight supply leading to very strong phosphate margins and rising potash prices. In fact, we raised our full year potash production to capture strong demand.\nThird, the cost reduction efforts we've been pursuing in Brazil have led to a strong first half of the year. and we expect earnings growth to accelerate in the remainder of 2025. And fourth, our extensive market access continues to be a key competitive advantage for Mosaic.\nThe current market situation demonstrates this point with some unevenness in the Americas, there is still more than enough demand around the world for all the tons we can produce. We have the agility to send tons to markets where demand is strongest.\nTo cover our second quarter results, we generated net income of $411 million and adjusted EBITDA of $566 million compared with a net loss of $162 million and adjusted EBITDA of $584 million in the same quarter of 2024. The factors that drove earnings lower are behind us. And across the business, we are poised for a strong second half of 2025. Potash and phosphate markets are tight, and we are maximizing production to benefit fully.\nWe see no signs of a second half price reset that has occurred in the past few years. The global phosphate market has been tight for 2 years now, and we do not expect that to change in the near to medium term even with the additional supply we expect to provide to the market. All of the supply and demand dynamics we've been discussing remain in effect. While China recently resumed exports at a low level, Chinese exports remain restricted as producers there meet domestic demand for agriculture and growing demand for industrial uses.\nGlobal farmer demand for phosphate fertilizers remains robust. As an example, Indian importers have come back to the market with increased government support and are now working to meet 2 years' worth of pent-up demand. Also remember, there is not much additional capacity that is expected to come to the market over the next few years and announced projects take quite some time to come online. Put simply, there is not enough phosphate fertilizer available to meet demand, and we expect this dynamic to continue well into 2026 even if there is some demand deferral in the Americas.\nIn our business, our work to fortify our U.S. phosphate assets to maximize future production took longer than we expected but there is no more planned maintenance that would impede us from reaching our target run rate of 8 million tons per year. To provide more detail, our extraordinary level of work is complete at Riverview in Louisiana. Our Bartow plant has been operating at target rates for a couple of months. And in New Wales, where installation of our final new gypsum pumping station was delayed. All 3 new stations are complete. We are now returning to our normal cycle for turnarounds.\nOur third quarter sales volume guidance of 1.8 million to 2 million tons reflects our confidence in our strengthened assets. Our annual guidance for phosphate production is now 6.9 million to 7.2 million tons, reflecting the more extensive maintenance downtime we experienced in June and July. It's also important to note that as our volumes improve, so do our unit costs, we expect to reach our Analyst Day per ton cost targets later this year.\nIn potash, the market has evolved from balanced to tight. Maintenance activities at multiple producers around the world have reduced near-term supply and demand remains strong, underpinned in part by continuing high palm oil prices in Southeast Asia. We are running hard to meet demand and benefit from the market conditions.\nThe second quarter turnaround at Esterhazy is complete and we plan to run our Colonsay mine at least through the end of this year. As a result and to meet very strong global demand, we have increased our annual potash production guidance to 9.3 million to 9.5 million tonnes. We're feeling very good about our business in Brazil, too. While credit issues are persisting, we expect fertilizer demand to remain strong and supply limited. As a result, we anticipate EBITDA from the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment to push higher from the strong levels we've seen in the past 2 quarters.\nBefore Jenny provides more details on the markets, I'd like to highlight the important competitive advantage our market access brings to Mosaic. The new Palmeirante facility, which was inaugurated last month, adds 1 million tons of distribution capacity in the fast-growing northern region and reinforces our market-leading presence in the country. We also continue to leverage our market access to grow the Mosaic Biosciences business. First half revenues for Biosciences more than doubled compared with a year ago. We expect Mosaic Biosciences to contribute positively to adjusted EBITDA beginning in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, a note on capital allocation. We're continuing to make progress on our work to reclaim capital so that we can deploy it in pursuit of better returns. The hydrofloat project and the new Palmeirante facility are good examples of this. We hope to have news on the processes we've announced, including Carlsbad and Taquari in the near future. At the same time, we are expecting stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year, which would allow us to pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. All in all, we have made important and substantial progress this year and we are in excellent position for a very strong second half of 2025.\nNow I'll pass the call to Jenny.\n\nYijun Wang\n\nSenior VP of Global Strategic Marketing and Head of China & India\n\nBruce highlighted strong fertilizer market fundamentals. Before I dive deeper into the phosphate and potash market, I'd like to address the recent pressure on ag commodities and why we are still up on global agriculture. Commodity market has been pressured by both trade and macro uncertainties as well as the record [ safrinha ] harvest in Brazil and the potential for a record U.S. crop this fall.\nHowever, as we mentioned before, Ag fundamentals remain positive across much of the world, including in many of the key geographies where we operate. Global Ag market continuously to be supported by strong demand including support of new biofuel policies in India, Brazil, Indonesia and the U.S., which supports ag market in the long run. The headwinds we see in certain geographies related to fertilizer affordability will necessarily train some demand, for example, in Americas, but this provides a tailwind to demand in the future. as growers will need to replenish their soil nutrients.\nSpecifically on phosphate, prices have steadily climbed this year with a strong demand that is constrained by supply. And despite higher prices and the lack of available supply that may result in some demand deferral, global shipments are expected to approach a new record. The most notable factor on supply side remains China, which have returned seasonally to the export market, though we anticipate a further reduction in high-analysis phosphate export this year. As the country limits export quarters in support of the domestic market and industrial phosphate production.\nOn the demand side, government financial support has energized Indian buying at higher prices. While we expect growth in India shipments this year, supply constraints will likely leave India face another year of pent-up demand that bodes well as we move towards 2026. In North America, summer fill was earlier than expected, given the empty pipeline and fewer imports were largely sold out for the quarter and at higher values than spring season.\nImport supply is down around 20% year-over-year, given tariffs on most of the oranges and these volumes are expected to stay subdued. This means that even there is meaningful demand deferral at the grower level this fall, there should be ample demand for Mosaic's products. While in Brazil, we are expecting another fertile shipment record this year, with inputs up sharply in the first half to meet the demand.\nWith no significant price reset expected in the near term, we expect stripping margins to remain elevated as sulfur prices appears to have stabilized and ammonia looks like it could soften through the balance of the year. Longer term, we anticipate elevated stripping margin will continue as solid fundamentals carry into next year. As I mentioned, we like to again see pent-up demand as we enter 2026 driven by demand deferral this year and limited channel inventories.\nOn the supply side, New capacity takes time to build and won't feature meaningfully until at least 2027. On top of this, we expect China to continue to reduce export availability as independent projection for LFP demand through 2030 exceed even our own projection. In the case of potash, the market shifted from balanced to tight in the first half of this year, and we anticipate prices to hold around current levels, driven by what could again be a record global shipment. Global supply is now filling the effects of the announced maintenance in Russia and Belarus, the slowdown in louse expansion and lower production from China and Chili.\nRegarding demand, U.S. customers indicate it will be about normal for full season despite prices that are higher than last year, given they still find good value at these levels. like phosphate, offshore potash imports are also trading last year, further tightening the domestic market. Brazilian demand has also proved resilient in this higher-priced environment, with inventories near normal despite higher input so far this year.\nFinally, annual contract in China and India was signed about $65 per ton higher than last year. With this expected healthy baseload of contract market offtake plus a continued strong pull from Southeast Asia, where solid grower economics are supported by elevated palm oil prices. We believe that supply and demand will remain tight. In the near term, limiting any late year seasonal price resets that usually we experience.\nLet me pass things over to Luciano, where he will dive deeper into financial results, our strategies and the capital allocation.\n\nLuciano Siani Pires\n\nExecutive Director, Finance & Investor Relations, Vale SA\n\nGood morning. This was a very unusual quarter in terms of results with a lot of noise. We encourage you to see the underlying performance of the business through the numbers and also see why we believe Q3 performance will be amongst the strongest in many, many quarters. First, on net income. The notables were actually on the positive side. The U.S. dollar lost value compared to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar. So there was a reversal of the foreign exchange effects experienced in previous quarters, a total of $220 million. In addition to that, we had a gain of $216 million in the market value of our modern shares and with these 2 main effects, net income was $411 million compared to a net loss of $162 million a year before.\nSecond, on EBITDA. Well, you saw we had these larger than usual provisions that amounted to more than $60 million on a net basis. Most of these do not have any cash effect in the quarter. And some also will not have cash effects going forward, such as, for example, the bad debt expense, the inventory adjustments, one asset write-off, but some will, some will have a cash component. For example, we recorded $8 million in environmental reserves for future remediation at our Taquari potash mine. We recorded $4 million for legal reserves. So we had a number of net unfavorable items that all came together this quarter. And while we always have some level of this kind of activity, it was quite large. We don't expect to repeat this level in Q3 and Q4.\nJust a note on bad debt. The $30 million bad debt expense in Mosaic Fertilizantes, we had with a single customer it is 90% backed by insurance. So we expect recoveries going forward. Indeed, for example, this quarter, we collected $50 million related to a bad debt expense booked in Q3 last year. Also on EBITDA, you can see that all the work of turnarounds that we talked extensively cost us money, a lot of money. We have been speaking about $100 million overall aggregate investment to increase reliability. But part of that, you can see in these elevated idle and turnaround expenditures, some of the work just can't be capitalized, it has to be expensed.\nNot a surprise, a significant part of the increase in idle and turnaround expenses came from phosphates. And why is that? We not only extended the duration of our turnarounds, which impacted our production volumes, which impacted our fixed cost absorption, but we also spent more actual dollars in repairs and maintenance. These works, another reminder, are all with the goal to derisk not just our second half performance, but well into the future as we return to a sustained and more normal production output level. So therefore, we also expect Q3 idle and turnaround expenses to decline from Q2 to get to a more normalized level because the work has been completed to improve asset reliability.\nSo now the bright part. Phosphates, for example. You know that everything changes upon the volumes. As we said, 85% of our cash cost of conversion is fixed. So given the low production volumes, the unit cost metric of $126 per ton in Q2 behaved exactly as it should. It is above our Investor Day target of $95 to $100 per ton, but only because of low production volumes. On a positive note, cash mine rock costs in Florida are the lowest in 10 quarters, $51 per ton against an average of $55 per ton in 2024. You're not seeing it yet because of the low volumes of finished product. But these results will flow into the blended rock costs once finished product volumes come back.\nIn Potash, the cash production cost per ton was $75, up from the same quarter last year, again, due to less fixed cost absorption and lower but it was down from $78 in the first quarter. And we conducted a turnaround at Esterhazy in Q2 this year versus Q3 last year, and the shift in timing impacted a lot of metrics year-over-year when you compare Q2 '25 to Q2 '24. It impacted production volumes unit costs and turnaround and hydro expenses. So again, as in phosphates, you should expect potash Q3 turnaround in [ IO ] expenses to decline from Q2.\nMosaic Fertilizantes, so far, the nicest story. There, we have achieved $106 million of our $150 million cost reduction target. These cost reductions and the higher realized prices are behind the $150 million in EBITDA despite the bad debt expense of $18 million, net of recoveries. In Q3, with increased volumes, no further bad debt expenses and a recovery in distribution margins were bound to have an excellent quarter. The question is if we're going to be above $200 million mark or well above the $200 million mark. This will depend on management of sales volumes given the credit environment.\nAnd finally, for you to better model Mosaic Fertilizantes. This quarter, we added disclosure on production sales volumes in the result and outlook tables in the press release. We provide margins that are earned by these tons and we provide further breakdown of these tons in the performance data sheet. All this new disclosure, hopefully, will add some transparency to this segment. Back to cost reductions. We have achieved $150 million cost reduction targets established last year.\nHow? On the back of Mosaic Fertilizantes as we discussed and SG&A alone. However, in SG&A, the bottom line is clouded because of the bad debt expenses and because of the noncash amortization of the large technology investment we made and that amortization started in Q3 2024. And so we also included in the appendix of the presentation and demonstration of the SG&A savings.\nAnd with this achievement, we are now extending our goal from $150 million to $250 million. Going forward, this additional $100 million in value capture is expected to be achieved by the end of 2026 and will come from further cost reductions by automating administrative functions, optimizing supply chain and other cost reductions in operations gross margin optimization and fixed cost absorption as we ramp up our production levels. So the prospects here are very, very exciting.\nSo to conclude, quarter 3 EBITDA in all segments is expected to be significantly higher than last quarter. With an extraordinary level of turnaround to improve asset health and reliability behind us. In phosphates, we expect volumes to increase. Cash conversion cost per ton to decline significantly in the third quarter, turnaround and idle expenses to come down as well, and therefore, having strong EBITDA growth from Q2 to Q3. In potash, we're pedal to the metal, increasing production, sales outlook to take advantage of favorable market conditions. And Mosaic Fertilizantes will be peak sales peak margin season in Q3. We definitely have the win at our back.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jason Tremblay. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Tremblay\n\nVice President of Enterprise Strategy & Business Support\n\nThank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Opening comments will be provided by Bruce Bodine, President and Chief Executive Officer. Jenny Wang, Executive Vice President of Commercial, will then cover the market update. Luciano Siani Pires, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review financial results and capital allocation progress. We will then open the floor for questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release published today and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce.\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining our call. I'd like to start by welcoming Luciano to his first call as Mosaic's CFO. We've known him for a long time through his service on Mosaic's Board, and we're thrilled to have him on our team.\nWe're taking a different approach this quarter. During this first part of our call, I'll cover our high-level business performance and strategic progress, then Jenny Wang will give you an update on the markets, followed by Luciano providing more context on our financial performance and capital allocation strategy. After that, we'll take your questions.\nI'll start with our key messages for today. First, agriculture markets have improved, and we expect constructive ag and fertilizer fundamentals in 2025. Second, at Mosaic, we are making operational and strategic progress, and the business is positioned well to benefit from good markets this year. And finally, our work to shed noncore assets and reallocate capital is taking shape.\nTo cover the numbers, fourth quarter net income was $169 million, and adjusted EBITDA came in at $594 million. We saw strong phosphate prices and stripping margins, solid Potash performance despite low prices and excellent underlying business performance in Brazil.\nLet's talk about the segments first. In Potash, the Esterhazy complex, which is the world's largest potash mine and among the most efficient, continues to generate strong cash flow across the commodity cycle, and we are continuing to optimize it. Our Bell Plaine potash mine delivered 100% operating rate and record production in 2024. We resolved the electrical issues we experienced in the third quarter, and we are operating at full milling and hoisting capacity now, which will let us continue to drive costs down.\nIt clearly benefits us to produce every tonne we can at Esterhazy, and we're investing to do just that. Last year, we finished a project to increase our compaction capacity by 500,000 tonnes. And this year, we expect to complete the hydrofloat project to provide an additional 400,000 tonnes of capacity per year. We expect potash demand to remain strong given affordability and the trends in crop prices combined with supply reductions caused by recent news coming out of Laos, China, Belarus and Russia.\nThere's a lot going on in geopolitics that could impact potash markets. There is quite a bit of uncertainty around Canadian tariffs, and we're watching that situation closely. Even accounting for the impact of tariffs, potash prices will remain affordable. Therefore, we expect no major demand destruction.\nThe potential resolution of the war in Ukraine would have very little impact to the global potash supply. The same goes for Belarus sanctions, very little impact on supply. Jenny will give you more detail about these dynamics in a few minutes.\nIn Phosphate, supply remains tight and demand remains very strong, which has led to prices and stripping margins remaining significantly above historic levels for the past several years with no end in sight. I should note that we have secured our long-term ammonia supply. We signed the last of 3 supply contracts late last year, so we have locked up reliable supply at competitive rates.\nRestoring our U.S. phosphate production to historical levels remains a top priority. Fourth quarter production was lower than expected because of a challenging recovery from hurricanes Helene and Milton. Most of our storm-related downtime was in the fourth quarter.\nWe've often said the pathway to higher levels is not straight up. Early this year, we have turnarounds at Bartow and New Wales, and we have more work to do to improve asset reliability in Florida and Louisiana. To this end, we are accelerating capital spending to address these issues and expect that work to be finished by the middle of the year. Overall, we expect our production volumes to improve throughout the year and reach 7.2 million to 7.6 million tonnes for the year.\nOur business in Brazil is performing very well even with the market and credit headwinds. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA for the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment of $82 million shows strong underlying business performance. Our margins in Brazil are healthy. Our distribution margin was at the high end of the annual normalized range and our production cost per tonne trended down in the fourth quarter. With the constructive market dynamics we see ahead in 2025, we feel good about Mosaic's business in Brazil.\nOur solid operating performance is supported by good cost discipline. We're making good progress toward our cost reduction targets, but I'll leave the details to Luciana.\nNow I'll talk about our strategic progress. We've told you before that we're analyzing our facilities on the basis of their returns on capital. The outcomes of that work are allowing us to find better owners of underperforming assets and redeploy capital for better returns. We've already announced several deals, including the pending sale of our Patos de Minas site in Brazil and the conclusion of the Ma'aden transaction. That deal gave us a transparent value for our investment, which is about $1.5 billion as of today, as well as a $522 million gain in a long-term capital redeployment possibility. We have other moves in the works, including our pursuit of strategic alternatives for our potash mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico.\nWe're not just focused on making our portfolio stronger, we're also investing in our strengths and growing in our core business in new areas. In addition to the compaction and hydrofloat project I mentioned earlier, our new 1 million tonne blending plant in Palmeirante, Brazil is almost finished.\nOur newest growth engine, Mosaic Biosciences, is accelerating. We doubled revenues and acreage on which our products were applied in 2024, and we expect a similar growth rate in 2025. We'll have a lot more to say on Mosaic Biosciences at our Analyst Day in New York on March 18. I hope you'll join us whether in person or online.\nNow I'll ask Jenny to give you her thoughts on agriculture and fertilizer markets. Jenny?\n\nYijun Wang\n\nSenior VP of Global Strategic Marketing and Head of China & India\n\nThank you, Bruce. We expect 2025 to be a good year for agriculture commodities. Let's start with crops.\nFundamentals are strong for most crops around the world. Strong global corn demand in 2024 is leading to expectations of a much lower stock [indiscernible] ratio, which in turn has led to rising corn prices since last September. Soybean prices have also moved off their lows [ set ] last year.\nAnimal protein market remained very strong and are expected to continue to drive robust demand for grain and oilseeds product in seed regions. In addition, palm oil prices have stayed in a high range for some time now.\nAll in all, the world's farmers have strong financial incentive to maximize yield in 2025. Of course, that bodes well for phosphate and potash demand.\nFirst, for phosphate. Higher crop prices mean phosphate will be more affordable. We believe demand will remain very strong. And remember, phosphate fertile demand is driven by a combination of factors, including rising oilseeds production with the increase in global biofuel demand. At the same time, rising use of phosphate for battery production has created another pool on phosphate. With limited new phosphate production coming into the market over the next few years and with ongoing Chinese export restrictions, we expect supply to remain tight and prices and stripping margins to remain elevated by historical standards.\nRegarding stripping margins, in the near term, we anticipate that they will remain attractive even with sulfur prices increasing, as ammonia prices are expected to come to ease. And as a matter of fact, March spot ammonia price was concluded at $40 below from the last month.\nIn potash, as Bruce mentioned, global demand has been strong, and we expect that to continue. Palm oil prices are supporting another strong year for potash application in Malaysia and Indonesia, while Chinese demand is expected to remain solid after 2 consecutive record shipment years in 2023 and 2024, with volume topping 18 million and 19 million tonnes, respectively. Bear in mind, the shipment averaged just 15 million tonnes in the preceding 5 years in China.\nIn addition, Brazil has worked through much of its inventory through the second corn crop, and we have seen very strong demand for potash in the soybean season. As a result, we expect 2025 shipments to set another record for potash.\nSupply is likely to be more constrained this year than last due to the 2 largest producers in China guiding to lower output in 2025, and both Belaruskali and Uralkali announced that they would produce fewer tonnes. Additionally, there is significant uncertainty as to how much additional production will be available from Laos given continued issues with mine inflows and sinkholes. As a result, we believe potash market are improving, are very constructive.\nNow I will pass the call over to Luciano for insight into our financial performance.\n\nLuciano Siani Pires\n\nExecutive Director, Finance & Investor Relations, Vale SA\n\nWell, thank you, Jenny, and thanks to you, Bruce, for your warm welcome. So I've been CFO of Mosaic now for 2 months, responsible for our finance strategy, IT. Coming in, I think Mosaic is mature, has a clear strategic direction, strong financial foundation. I can give you several examples. The balance sheet is a good place, BBB, where it's most efficient to be. We have lots of funding options in place. Share count has been reduced by almost 20% over the past years, something that maybe the market doesn't fully appreciate. And yes, after a few years of cost inflation, I believe there's good momentum in the cost control initiatives. And the $150 million target, I'm confident we will reach it, and we'll discuss this in a moment.\nCapital expenditures are also under control. Mosaic delivered on its commitment to reduce CapEx by about $200 million last year. This year we have flat CapEx to address some reliability challenges, but we will continue to reduce CapEx in future years.\nSo I'm privileged to step in with so much already accomplished.\nI'll give you some detailed comments and color on some of the most meaningful numbers on our financial statements and performance. This is a little new, but my goal is for you to be able to understand the drivers of our performance and to model it going forward.\nSo I'll start by comments with net income. Obviously, it's complicated, lots of nonrecurring events. First one, we exchanged our stake in the MWSPC joint venture, for the shares of Ma'aden. And you see a $522 million gain on this one. And this is the difference between the market value of the shares on the date of the closing to the book value of our former stake on the joint venture.\nBut then you have another gain of $28 million, and this is now the increase in the market price of the stock between the closing date and December 31. And going forward, you will see the mark-to-market of the value of those shares reflected in our financials. So this is going to be recurring.\nNet income was also impacted by this large balance sheet, $390 million foreign exchange loss in the fourth quarter, which is in the notables table in our press release. That comes from the intercompany loans from the U.S. to Brazil and from the U.S. to Canada. They're both denominated in U.S. dollars. And the issue is that the Brazilian real weakened a lot during the fourth quarter, by 14%, worst-performing currency in the world. And so the local Brazilian balance sheet debt also increased by a similar amount.\nAnd the Canadian dollar also weakened by 6%, so the Canadian balance sheet also faced a loss. So these negative effects were huge in the quarter and they go up into the consolidated financial statements of Mosaic as a whole.\nWell, but this foreign exchange story also goes into the adjusted EBITDA performance of our businesses, and again, and most importantly, into Mosaic Fertilizantes in Brazil. The Brazilian distribution business buys themselves finished product. And at any given time, we have open payables in dollars. The payables now in Brazilian reals are more expensive. And as we pay the obligations, we recognize a loss in EBITDA in the local income statement. The difference between the payables in U.S. dollar, the current exchange rate, which is more expensive than the older one. This goes into EBITDA.\nThere are other smaller losses in FX hedging. And all in all, that reduced the adjusted EBITDA for Brazil by $35 million in this quarter, and may continue to have around $20 million impact in the first quarter of '25 just because we still have and working through the old payables.\nAnd why am I saying all of this? Because I want to call your attention to the fact that our adjusted EBITDA for Brazil in the fourth quarter was $82 million. But that was after all these charges. So to see our underlying performance, you need to add back this $35 million loss. So instead of $82 million of adjusted EBITDA, we are in the $120 million territory. And once these payable things is gone, that's the number you're going to see printed from the second quarter of '25 onwards. So it's actually going to be even higher given the cost improvements ongoing.\nSo why we're now into this $120 million plus territory for EBITDA? For 2 factors. Well, first, cost performance is really now strong. As part of the $150 million cost reduction program, we already captured $35 million recurring savings only in Brazil.\nJust to give you some color. One initiative, for example, we changed our mine plans, we increased rock production, and we ceased importing phosphate rock, which is much more expensive. That only change reduces our operating cost in Brazil by $35 million to $40 million annually, and about $15 million was already captured in 2024.\nThe other factor is now that the FX rate provides a tailwind in costs. So altogether, if you compare fourth quarter of '24 with fourth quarter of '23, you can see this in our performance data sheet, which is in the website. phosphate raw costs are down 15%, and phosphate conversion costs are down 23% in that period. So very confident about Fertilizantes going forward.\nSo one another highlight is SG&A. $497 million in 2024, is largely flat when you compare it to $501 million in 2023. But 2024 includes a $30 million loss on receivables. You'll remember a significant Brazilian retailer that defaulted. So without this loss, SG&A would have been like, instead of $4 million less, would have been $34 million less or a 6% year-over-year reduction.\nAnd considering other nonrecurring noncash factors, we can say that $42 million have already been saved on intrinsic SG&A as part of the $150 million in cost savings. And by the way, we've got insurance on this $30 million debt. So at some point, we expect to revert the majority of this loss in bad debt.\nHow about potash and phosphates? In potash, [ MOP ] costs have been largely flat, $65 to $75 a tonne in the past 4 quarters. But it should edge down as we produce more tonnes from Esterhazy, which is our most efficient mine, and with the hydrofloat project coming online later this year. The margin will also improve as we make more granular products which, on average, earn about $20 to $30 more than standard products.\nIn phosphates, the cost actually increased in Q4 due to the plants being idle following the hurricanes we discussed. But the recovery in volumes will, in '25, will dilute the cost per tonne.\nAnd we're already looking for more than $150 million in cost reductions. So we have this digital acceleration program that should bring about $70 million in benefit. Another $50 million is coming from a better mine plan and mass recovery at our Patrocinio and Araxa complex in Brazil. And we will discuss all of this in detail and we'll have additional news for you on our Analyst Day upcoming on March 18, which I invite all of you to attend.\nI'm sure we're going to be also discussing capital allocation in the Q&A. And I was very lucky to come in right in the middle of the conclusion of the $1.5 billion deal with Ma'aden shares. And I actually got my hands and worked in the $125 million Patos deal. I'm fully committed with the program to reallocate capital to the benefits of shareholders.\nAnd one final note, we've decided to discontinue our monthly price and volume releases. We've received some feedback from you that these releases were not particularly helpful, more noise than signal. So we're discontinuing it. So with that, I want to turn the call back to you, Bruce.\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Luciano. To summarize, Mosaic delivered a solid year despite considerable market weather and operational challenges. Our outlook for 2025 is positive. With our improving operational performance, lower cost profiles and excellent financial foundation mosaic is well positioned to benefit from the strong market conditions we see ahead.\nNow, operator, we'd like to take questions from the audience."

[Operator Instructions] Your host for today's call is Jason Tremblay. Jason, you may begin.\n\nJason Tremblay\n\nThank you, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Opening comments will be provided by Bruce Bodine, President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by a Fireside chat, then open Q&A. Clint Freeland, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jenny Wang, Executive Vice President, Commercial, will also be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, they are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release published yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce.\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion. Before we begin, I want to acknowledge that we have recently experienced some serious safety incidents. We take safety extremely seriously, and we are working to further improve our culture to ensure our people go home safe after every shift.\nMoving on to our earnings discussion. This morning, I will add some color to the information we published and then we'll get to your questions. This was another solid quarter for Mosaic, both in terms of our results and our operational progress.\nFor the quarter, Mosaic delivered adjusted EBITDA of $584 million on revenues of $2.8 billion, compared with adjusted EBITDA of $744 million and revenues of $3.4 billion a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.54 compared with $1.04 in 2023. We are making good progress across our strategic initiatives, both to grow the company and manage costs and our market outlook remains constructive.\nI'll start with the actions we are taking to strengthen the business for the long term. We are hyper focused on managing costs, and we're making good progress across G&A, operating and capital expenditures. Hence, the announcement of our $150 million expense reduction program between SG&A and cost control measures implemented in Brazil, we have already achieved more than 1/3 of the annual run rate cost savings target. This does not include phosphate fixed cost absorption resulting from higher production volumes in the second quarter.\nWe have also executed Phase 1 of our third-party contractor reduction plant in Brazil and expect to begin seeing the benefits in the second half of this year. With several projects winding down and careful CapEx management, we are on track to achieve our targeted $200 million reduction in capital expenditure. Our work to improve our operations and driving operating efficiency is paying off.\nPhosphate production volume in the second quarter increased by almost 100,000 tons over the first quarter. This is a significant improvement on an annualized basis. Efficiency improvement is also seen in our Potash and Mosaic Fertilizantes segments, where unit production costs improved meaningfully across the board.\nOur growth projects are proceeding well. Our MicroEssentials expansion at Riverview is operating and ramping up. Our Potash compaction project at Esterhazy is complete and the new Palmeirante blending facility in the northern region of Brazil is on track to be completed in 2025.\nOur Mosaic Biosciences business is making significant progress. In fact, we have launched our biological products in North America, Brazil, China, India and 9 other Central American markets. Our products are now in use on 5 million acres in North and Central America, which highlights the competitive advantage of our brand, customer relationships and distribution strength to provide as we introduce new and innovative products. We completed and successfully launched our global digital acceleration program, which is driving improved customer service, cost reductions and many other benefits.\nThe strength of our business and our cost controls have allowed us to continue to return significant capital to shareholders. We have returned almost $300 million to shareholders, including $160 million of share repurchases in the first 6 months of this year. Our business improvements are complemented by the positive signs we're seeing in fertilizer and broader agriculture margins. Strong global phosphate demand drove higher prices through the second quarter as seasonal sentiment improved. We believe the long-term outlook for phosphate with increasing demand for food, fiber, fuel and industrial use is compelling.\nPotash contract settlements in China and India established the price floor and brought buyers back to the market. In season fertilizer demand in Brazil is strong, and we continue to execute well amid the recovering ag environment there. Mosaic Fertilizantes results are solid and our cost position demonstrates improvements.\nLet's take a deeper look at our progress in the U.S. Phosphate business, where our goal goal is to return to a run rate of 8 million tons per year by the end of 2024. We're making good progress as demonstrated in our second quarter production volumes, which advanced 98,000 tons from the first quarter. On a run rate basis, some of our facilities, specifically Bartow and New Wales have achieved about 90% of the production levels we need to reach our system-wide gold.\nOur turnaround work is clearly paying off. For example, in New Wales following the turnarounds we executed in March and April, we saw a significant step-up in production for the second quarter. In Louisiana, our production run rate has improved after several unplanned outages last year and has reached 85% of the target production level. Several projects are scheduled for the remainder of the year, which will further close the gap to the target rate.\nRiverview performance in the quarter was lower than target rate due to the outage caused by our brushfire earlier this year and a normal pace of production ramp-up after a major capacity conversion, which was completed in May. The outlook for the rest of the year is solid.\nAll in all, we are pleased with the progress we have made in our production ramp and our hard work will continue to pay off for the remainder of the year. Higher production brings lower unit costs, as you can see in our second quarter results. The majority of our turnaround activity will be complete by the end of the year, resulting in significant production improvements and $20 to $30 per ton conversion cost savings.\nNow let's move on to a brief look at the markets. Ag commodity markets have diverged around the world with corn and soybean prices softening and other crop prices, notably for palm oil rising. Important factor for Mosaic is that crop nutrients remain affordable for most of the world's farmers, which leads to strong fertilizer demand and application.\nIn Phosphate, our long-term positive outlook continues, rising demand for grains and oilseeds to support both increasing food and fuel demand, combined with soaring demand for industrial uses to create competition for limited phosphate supply. Chinese exports remain subdued and major new supply is years away.\nIn the short term, the seasonal price reset that we saw in the first and second quarters of this year were shorter and less severe than expected. Prices have rebounded given strong demand and tight supply. North American demand is particularly strong with buyers seeking summer fill after emptying their bend this spring.\nBrazil demand is also good with growers concerned about limited availability. In India, where grower demand is very strong, importers are still awaiting a more compelling government subsidy. While Chinese exports have resumed, recent news indicates that government restrictions could tighten given rising in-country phosphate prices. Due to the positive dynamics and sentiment as well as subdued raw material costs, stripping margins remain well above historical averages, and we expect strong margins to continue.\nThe Potash market remains balanced. After a very strong North American spring planting season, our summer fill program was very well received. In fact, the recent contract settlements in China and India signaled a floor for prices. And as usual, stimulated buying activity all over Asia, resulting in Canpotex sold out through Quarter 3. We restarted Colonsay in early July to make sure we have enough product to meet our customer commitments while Esterhazy is in turnaround. Keep in mind, we need to run Colonsay for approximately 5 months to offset 1 month of Esterhazy production. We will continue to flex Colonsay as needed.\nNow I'll provide some color to our segment results. In Phosphate, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $308 million on revenue of $1.2 billion. Sales volumes were solid and higher than first quarter and prices were strong. Margins were up from the first quarter due to strong pricing, fewer tons purchased from third parties and our lower conversion costs. We expect sales volumes to increase sequentially in the third quarter.\nPotash adjusted EBITDA was $271 million on revenue of $663 million. While second quarter prices declined from the first quarter, sales volumes were solid, and costs were down. We remain highly efficient in our operations. In fact, production unit costs improved again in the second quarter with MOP cash production cost per ton declining 11% from the first quarter. Our third quarter pricing expectations reflect a higher mix of international sales compared with the second quarter.\nIn Brazil, we recorded adjusted EBITDA of $96 million and sales volumes of 2.2 million tons. Our results were solid due to our strategy of prioritizing margin and cash flow over volume. Our distribution margin was within our normalized $30 to $40 per ton range, and we expect similar margins in the third quarter. Our production margins improved from prior year. Cash unit cost of mined rock and phosphate and potash production all came down due to our focus on cost reductions. In addition, we had another strong quarter in co-product sales.\nFinally, a brief word on capital allocation. Our strategy has not changed. We're investing in the business, conserving capital where we can and returning excess cash to shareholders. To conclude, Mosaic is executing well across our strategic initiatives, and we are generating solid results and our outlook for the remainder of 2024 and beyond is positive.\nNow, let's move on to the first set of questions."

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce.\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call. In addition to reviewing Mosaic's performance for the quarter, there are 3 key topics we'll discuss today. First, the transaction we announced with Ma'aden highlights our commitment to unlocking shareholder value. Exchanging our 25% stake in the MWSPC joint venture for an approximately $1.5 billion position in Ma'aden provides a clear indication of value and greater capital flexibility in the future; second, we are making good progress on several high-return, low-capital intensity initiatives that will improve results across the commodity cycle; and third, fertilizer market fundamentals remain constructive and the phosphate supply and demand picture is particularly compelling. As the North America spring planting season winds down and fertilizer prices have moderated, fertilizer demand strength is now emerging in other key agricultural geographies, which will bode well for pricing in the second half of the year.\nBefore I dive deeper into these areas, let me summarize our first quarter results. Mosaic generated adjusted EBITDA of $576 million on revenues of $2.7 billion. The phosphates segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $277 million on sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes. Solid North American demand and limited supply pushed phosphate prices higher in the first quarter, and our realized stripping margins remain substantially above historical levels.\nOur results in this segment included a higher mix of sales sourced from third parties to mitigate the impact of the heavy turnaround schedule we discussed last quarter. The potash segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $281 million on sales of 2.2 million tonnes, reflecting the benefits of strong spring seasonal demand in North America. Global prices have stabilized, including in Brazil, where we're seeing prices move higher as we head toward the [ safer ] season.\nFor the first quarter, Mosaic for Lizantes generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million from sales of 1.7 million tonnes. The continued divergence of our performance from many others in the Brazil ag industry is resulting from the decisions we've made to prioritize risk management and margin over volume. Last year, we quickly worked through high-cost inventory. And this year, we are navigating the challenging credit and liquidity environment by prioritizing sales to lower credit risk customers, demanding prepayments and insisting on contract performance.\nOur distribution margin improved in the second half of last year and first quarter results were significantly better than expected. We also had very strong co-product volume and margin performance during the quarter. Our results this quarter show that we're successfully working through challenging environments to drive strong results. At the same time, we are focused on creating shareholder value in additional ways. A great example of this is our transaction with Ma'aden, which will exchange our 25% position in the MWSPC joint venture for an approximately $1.5 billion position in Ma'aden shares. This new structure allows our successful long-term partnership with Ma'aden to continue while also providing increased investment transparency and flexibility for capital redeployment over time.\nI should note that we believe that neither this transaction nor any potential future transactions involving the Ma'aden shares will result in any material tax friction. We have several other ongoing initiatives to drive improved returns. Our $150 million cost reduction plan is on track and delivering early results. Potash production cash cost per ton declined about $10 in the first quarter compared with the same period in the prior year. We are rightsizing our workforce and have identified opportunities to reduce our third-party contractors over the next 18 months, which will result in $20 million to $30 million in annual cost savings when complete.\nWe are making progress on our SG&A expense management. With our first quarter SG&A expenses down by $21 million or 16% compared with a year ago. We are also focused on improving and optimizing our operations. In phosphate, we're making good progress on our volume improved plans through the execution of extensive maintenance turnarounds, including activities at the River View and New Wales plants in the first and second quarters and a turnaround at the Louisiana plant in the second quarter.\nIn potash, our Esterhazy HydroFloat project, which will give us an additional 400,000 tonnes of capacity will be in service by mid next year. We are expanding our market access with the construction of a 1 million-tonne blending plant at [indiscernible] in the fast-growing northern agricultural region of Brazil. The project is well underway. We are currently building the warehouse structure, support buildings and electrical infrastructure and expect to complete the project early next year. We have recently completed the MicroEssentials conversion at our Riverview facility.\nOnce it is fully ramped up, over half of our U.S. phosphate production will be higher-margin value-added products. We are also on track to reduce our capital expenditures by $200 million in this year versus last year. These initiatives all have one thing in common. They improve returns across the cycle. With that, let's take a closer look at agriculture and fertilizer markets. While corn and soybean prices have softened recently, farmers remain profitable. Even a small lift in these commodity places would return farm profitability to quite healthy levels. Moreover, the prices for many other ag commodities, such as palm oil and rice remain at very attractive levels.\nIn addition, weather is shifting rapidly from a strong El Nino to La Nina, which should prove positive for Southeast Asia, India and Brazil. Favorable conditions in Southeast Asia are particularly important as we expect the region will be responsible for about 2/3 of global potash shipment growth this year. In fact, in January and February, potash imports to Malaysia and Indonesia were up about 35% versus a year ago due to depleted channel inventories in a very constructive potash to palm oil price ratio.\nPhosphate markets remain tight, we are seeing the expected post-spring seasonal slowdown in North America, but Brazilian demand for the safer season is emerging. Strong demand and limited supply pushed [ SSP ] prices in Brazil, up by $30 per tonne in April. The recent seasonal uptick in Chinese phosphate export availability has exerted downward pressure on prices in India. But India demand for phosphate this year is expected to be solid on the back of an above-average monsoon season. India's demand will surely exceed China's ability to supply the nation. We expect the Indian government to increase the maximum retail price to allow importer economics to work in the current global pricing environment. And thus, incentivize producers to send tonnes there.\nLonger term, the outlook for phosphate continues to be very positive. Demand is growing to produce more grains and oilseeds for food and biofuels and for increasing industrial uses, including battery production. At the same time, limited new supply is coming to market and Chinese exports are down about 25% from historical norms. The structural changes in phosphate supply and demand point to strong fundamentals in the years ahead. The global potash supply and demand picture is balanced, the same seasonal dynamic occurring in potash, North America is slowing, but Brazil is picking up, resulting in a $30 increase in MOP prices in Brazil in recent weeks, an indication of positive market sentiment and constructive supply and demand dynamics.\nWith Southeast Asia demand returning, we continue to expect near record global potash shipments this year. Now moving on to our outlook. For phosphate, we expect second quarter sales volumes of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes and average FOB prices at the plant of $530 to $580 per tonne. The fire at our Riverview facility caused damage to pipes, pumps and a phosphogypsum transfer station. Our team engineered a temporary solution that enabled us to restore some phosphoric acid production in just 2 weeks, and we are now back at full capacity.\nWe expect some reduction in the second and third quarter sales volumes, but overall, the impact was minimized. Our second quarter guidance reflects the impacts of the fire, the ongoing turnaround activity and the seasonal softening in the U.S., partially offset by improvements in Brazil. For potash, we expect second quarter sales volumes of 2.2 million to 2.4 million tonnes and average FOB price at the mine of $210 to $250 per tonne. For Mosaic for Lazanes, we expect second quarter sales volumes and profitability to improve from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality and our differentiated approach to tackling Brazil's operating environment.\nWe expect planned turnaround activities to weigh on production margins in the second quarter. As you recall, we completed the high-priced inventory destocking in the first half of last year. Going forward, we expect distribution margin to be at normal annualized level of $30 to $40 per tonne, but it may vary from quarter-to-quarter. To conclude, despite the seasonal reset of the market as we transition out of North America planting season, our outlook for the year is positive. We are taking near-term actions and executing long-term initiatives, as our agreement with Ma'aden demonstrates, to continue to strengthen our business and maximize shareholder value. Now we'll move on to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Your host for today's call is Jason [indiscernible]. Jason, you may begin.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Opening comments will be provided by Bruce Bodine, President and Chief Executive Officer, followed by a fireside chat, then open Q&A. Clint Freeland, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jenny Wang, Executive Vice President, Commercial, will also be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release published yesterday in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWe will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce.\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today. This is my first earnings call as Mosaic's CEO, and I'd like to begin by acknowledging [ Jack ] O'Rourke for his many contributions to the company. Jack held this role for nearly a decade, and the company is much stronger today, thanks to his leadership. Under Jack, Mosaic expanded its footprint in Brazil with the successful Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. We completed development of the world's largest potash mine. We transformed our cost structures, and we deleveraged and optimized our balance sheet. We have opportunities to improve returns and drive shareholder value by building on the current position of strength that Jack helped create. I look forward to evolving Mosaic's strategy and to helping all of you understand just how we will do that.\nSo for today, there are a few key messages that we would like you to take away from this call. First, phosphate markets are very strong, we expect dynamics to remain constructive for the foreseeable future, and we are working to optimize our production so we can benefit fully. Second, we expect demand recovery in potash. In fact, we are seeing early signs of demand emerging in Brazil. That said, given current potash economics, we will be curtailing production from our Colonsay mine. Third, we are taking these actions as well as reducing costs and capital expenditures to improve through cycle returns. Finally, with our strong financial foundation in place, we remain committed to prudent capital allocation selectively investing when risk-adjusted returns are compelling and returning excess cash through share repurchases and dividends.\nFor full year 2023, Mosaic generated revenue of $13.7 billion adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.57. We invested $1.4 billion in the business, refinanced $900 million in long-term debt and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, including over $750 million in share repurchases.\nLet's start by looking at the market. 2022 brought extreme volatility to fertilizer markets. High prices driven by supply disruption eventually reduced demand. In 2023, as prices retreated customers returned in many key markets. The long-term global grain and oilseed supply and demand picture remains encouraging with secular demand growth outpacing supply. In addition to population and income growth, demand for agricultural commodities is being driven by renewable fuel adoption, which we expect will continue to ramp over the next several years.\nRecent policy mandates have been announced in California, the European Union and in Singapore, and additional mandates are expected in the future. This emerging source of demand has the potential to require tens of millions of additional acres of production. Short-term fundamentals also look positive.\nWe believe that ongoing weather challenges in key growing regions, including Brazil, will result in grain production lower than what the market is anticipating. This suggests that already low stock-to-use ratios will remain under pressure and support a healthy grain price environment.\nOn this point, there tends to be a lot of focus on the stock to use ratios for corn and soybeans. As you can see in the presentation materials we posted, these two commodities represent approximately 30% of the global potash and phosphate consumption. This means that 70% of consumption is tied to other crops, many of which are experiencing continued tightening in their ratios. We believe the result is that growers around the world continue to be incentivized to maximize yield and crop production through strong fertilizer applications.\nIn North America, a long fall application season drove strong demand well into the fourth quarter. Solid winter fill activity tells us bins are near empty and channel inventories are low. We are seeing demand strength continue into the spring planting season and sales volumes are mostly committed through March.\nIn Brazil, barter ratios for both soybeans and corn are favorable. And while weather impacts have delayed fertilizer purchases, our outlook for full year 2024 is very positive, with expectations of fertilizer shipments at or near an all-time record as growers need to replenish soil nutrients. Favorable ag commodity and fertilizer demand drivers are especially promising for phosphate markets.\nWe expect global supply will remain tight due in part to China's fertilizer export restrictions as the government prioritizes domestic food security. Tighter environmental oversight has also had an impact with the reduction of domestic DAP production. China also continues to direct more asset to industrial markets. Lithium iron phosphate production has more than tripled in the last 2 years, and we expect growth to continue at a rapid pace. The competition for phosphate molecules is intensifying. And it will continue to do so for quite some time.\nThis, together with limited capacity additions in the near future, suggests phosphate market fundamentals will remain constructive. For potash, Supply is adequate to meet demand in the near term and economics have not yet improved, which is why we intend to curtail production at Colonsay. We will continue to monitor market developments and customer demand. And when needed, Colonsay will be prepared to return to service in short order.\nOverall, [ ag ] and fertilizer market dynamics remain solid. At Mosaic, we continue to focus on meeting customer needs executing on our business strategy, optimizing our operations and delivering value to shareholders.\nTurning now to fourth quarter results and our first quarter outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Mosaic delivered revenue of $3.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $646 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.71. Our potash business generated $322 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales volumes of roughly 2.6 million tons. With the port at Portland, Oregon back up and running, the team at Canpotex had a strong finish to the year, enabling us to deliver sales volumes well within the range of our initial guidance.\nWe expect sales volumes for the first quarter of 2024 in the range of 2 million to 2.2 million tons and potash prices at the mine in the range of $225 to $250 per tonne. In phosphates, we generated $259 million in adjusted EBITDA on sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes. Realized stripping margins remained strong for the quarter but were offset by lower cost absorption from lower production levels. For the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volume in the range of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tons and DAP realized prices at the mine in the range of $580 to $605 per tonne.\nMoving to our business in South America. Despite the weather-driven fertilizer demand headwind in the fourth quarter, we delivered strong operating results with adjusted EBITDA of $111 million, Distribution business margins came in well above the historical normal annual range of $30 to $40 per tonne. In the first quarter this year, we expect margins to recede from the fourth quarter as part of the normal seasonality of the business. The first quarter of each year typically has a higher amount of fertilizer volume going to Brazil's corn crop, which demands a higher percentage of nitrogen products, which historically generate lower and less consistent margins. And lower volumes of MicroEssentials, which generates higher margins. As a result, margins are generally lower during the quarter but improved from there, resulting in annual margins in line with our historic norm of $30 to $40 per tonne.\nWe executed well against our capital allocation strategy in 2023 and and our balance sheet remains optimized. We spent $1.4 billion in CapEx and made significant progress on our investment projects. We refinanced $900 million in debt and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through an increased dividend and share repurchases. Our returns included not only free cash flow but also proceeds from asset sales such as the sale of [ Streamsong ] Resort.\nFinally, I want to discuss our top strategic initiatives for 2024. First, we're focused on driving down costs. Over time, we expect to achieve at least $150 million in annual run rate savings off of a 2023 baseline, driven in part by savings from our global digital acceleration program, which will go live later this year.\nNext, we'll continue to transform our operations to increase resilience and flexibility. Our top priority in phosphate is to improve our production volumes. We are working toward an annual run rate of 8 million tonnes over the next few quarters by enhancing the overall reliability and efficiency of our operations. To this end, we have a busy turnaround schedule at our Florida facilities in the first half of this year as we target areas that have caused us the most significant maintenance issues.\nNext, we'll further expand our presence in Brazil, one of the most dynamic agricultural regions in the world by completing a 1 million ton distribution facility at [ Pal Meranci ] to serve the fast-growing northern region of the country. We'll also further strengthen our product portfolio by growing noncommodity products. We are expanding MicroEssentials capacity at our [ Riverview ] plant here in Florida, and we expect those additional tonnes later this spring. We anticipate that more than half of our phosphate sales will be value-added products, which clearly is a differentiator for us.\nIn addition, we are planning for the next-generation MicroEssentials Pro, which is delivering significant yield improvements in field testing. MicroEssentials Pro will also extend our patent protection until 2038.\nFinally, we'll remain true to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. In 2024, we expect to reduce total capital spending by about $200 million, and we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders.\nTo summarize, our outlook for agriculture and fertilizer markets remains positive. At Mosaic, we have a strategic road map to optimize returns through the business cycle to grow and to decommoditize our product offerings, and we have a very strong financial foundation from which to operate. I'm looking forward to updating you on our progress as the year proceeds. Now let's move to Q&A.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nBefore we move on to the live Q&A, as we have done in the past quarters, we would like to address some of the most common questions that we received after we published our earnings materials last night.\nFor our first question, Bruce, a number of analysts have asked questions about potash and phosphates. Market dynamics of these two crop nutrients seem to be diverging. With phosphates being strong, while potash is finding its way. Can you tell us how you see these markets developing as the year progresses?\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nI think this is a good way to characterize current market conditions. Phosphate markets are very positive due to strong demand, low inventories and a tight supply situation globally, leading to some of the strongest stripping margins in the last decade. We believe stripping margins will remain elevated for the remainder of the year.\nLooking at the key regions. In North America, channel inventories are low, and we are seeing strong demand for spring planting. For Mosaic specifically, we continue to operate at minimum inventory levels and our first quarter sales are almost fully committed. In Brazil, inventories are well below the 5-year range, and our outlook for the year remains positive as growers need to replenish soil nutrients. India's proposed subsidy rates announced earlier this month showed an increase for phosphate fertilizers from the prevailing rates in the fourth quarter of last year, but importer margins remain negative. With very strong grower demand and low inventories, which are at the low end of the 5-year range, subsidies should move higher.\nIn China, we are seeing an increased focus on food security. The government is limiting exports to ensure adequate domestic supply while also meeting rising industrial demand. We expect these dynamics to continue to limit exports for the foreseeable future. Industrial demand, particularly China's lithium iron phosphate market has been very strong, with production more than tripled in the last 2 years to 1.7 million tonnes of finished fertilizer product equivalent in 2023. We expect additional production growth in the future as demand continues to sort. Overall, this leads us to conclude that phosphate markets will remain constructive for the rest of the year.\nIn potash, the supply constraints from Belarus and Russia, seen in the past few years will continue to abate in 2024. On the demand side, we see stability in North America. In fact, our winter fill program was fully sold. And similar to phosphates, we are almost fully committed for Q1.\nIn Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, high-priced inventories were worked down in 2023. 2 years of under application in those markets will put further strain on crop yields if nutrients are not replenished. We are seeing significant pent-up demand in that region.\nIn China, while potash inventories are higher than historical periods, the fertilizer stock-to-use ratio is normal due to increasing on-farm demand as a result of favorable pricing. It's been reported that China intends to increase its strategic reserves meaning that inventories will have to remain higher than historical periods to meet this objective. We also expect lower Chinese domestic production as a result of the recent news capping production in its key potash basin due to environmental concerns. The combination of these factors should drive a need for continued high import volumes to meet the demand.\nThe weather in Brazil has slowed demand in the near term but we are seeing early signs of demand emerging in potash prices moving up slightly. In fact, when you look at the entire fertilizer market, we expect shipments to be at or near peak levels in 2024. Putting these factors together, we expect the pace of global potash shipments to improve as 2024 progresses.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Bruce. As a follow-up question, given the market backdrop you just described, what actions are you planning to take?\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nWell, given the strength of phosphate markets, Mosaic's focuses on increasing our phosphate production volumes and further improving our margins by increasing our MicroEssentials volumes. Getting our production to an annual run rate of 8 million tonnes, not only increases revenue, but also significantly reduces our unit costs. MicroEssentials generates significant yield improvements. And as a result, generate superior margins for farmers, retailers and Mosaic.\nFor Mosaic, not only do we earn a premium margin in our phosphate segment but we also command a premium margin in Brazil as we capture the retail premium for these products. In Potash, Mosaic is focusing on flexibility and cost management. The curtailment of production at our Colonsay site demonstrates our commitment to flexibly managing our network to ensure our low-cost sites at Bell Plaine and Esterhazy operate at capacity, while Colonsay is only used when market conditions dictate.\nWe have a couple of projects that will increase our product mix flexibility before the end of the year. This will enhance our ability to adjust our end product mix to respond to changes in the market conditions more effectively in order to optimize our cost structure and margins. In addition to cost reductions in our operations, we are focused on driving SG&A reductions and optimizing our investments in CapEx and working capital. These initiatives will ensure our customer demand is met. Our through-cycle financial performance will continue to advance and shareholder value is maximized.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nOur next question is related to Mosaic [ through Lazantes ]. Brazil remains a problem a region for many [ ag ] input companies. What is your outlook for 2024?\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nThis is a fair observation. A lot of these companies are still in the process of destocking excess high-cost inventories or writing off their assets given the challenging market conditions. At Mosaic, we took early action to complete the destocking of high-priced inventory in the first half of 2023 without any significant write-offs. As a result, we entered the second half of the year in a great position and it shows in our margins. The margin per ton in our distribution business returned to the $30 to $40 range in the third quarter and came in above that range in the fourth quarter.\nIn 2024, we expect record or near record fertilizer shipments despite lower fertilizer demand in quarter 1 due to weather conditions as growers continue to be incentivized by constructive [ BARDA ] ratios and the need to replenish soil nutrients. From a distribution margin perspective, we expect normal seasonality on a per tonne basis, lower than the normalized annual range in the first quarter, but within the range for the full year.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nChanging topics. There's a question about CapEx. You're indicating that spending will decline by approximately $200 million this year. How do you see that CapEx evolving longer term?\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nWe're coming out of a period of elevated CapEx due to an unusual number of high-returning opportunity projects from across the business. We are coming to the end of these projects, and as a result, our spending is declining. In addition to the $200 million reduction in 2024, we anticipate a further reduction in 2025 with a longer-term run rate to be at or below $1 billion.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Bruce. And with that, we will now move to the open question-and-answer session. Operator, please open the line for follow-up questions. ."

We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we get to the normal part of our call, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the next step forward for our company. Last month, we announced that I plan to retire at the end of the year. It has been an honor to work at this outstanding organization and lead this incredibly talented team. We've accomplished a tremendous amount over the last 8 years, but one of the areas I take most pride in is our focus on identifying talent and developing the next generation of leaders. As a result of those efforts, Mosaic's Board of Directors appointed Bruce Bodine, President and selected him to be Mosaic's next CEO starting on January 1, 2024.\nBruce is a Mosaic veteran, who's been with the company for 24 years and led several functions across our business, including most recently as Senior Vice President of North America. As a member of Mosaic's senior leadership team for the last 8 years, he's played a major role in establishing our current strategic priorities. The board takes succession seriously and has been planning for my retirement for some time. Bruce's selection follows an exhaustive evaluation of both internal and external candidates. Bruce's broad experience, strategic mindset and leadership throughout the organization, make him the ideal person to lead Mosaic into the future. Please join me in congratulating Bruce.\n\nBruce M. Bodine\n\nSVP of North America, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Joc. I'm excited to take the next step in January as CEO, and I'd like to take a moment to lay out my vision for the future. Mosaic is a global leader in the fertilizer industry. Over the last few years, we have grown our footprint in the world's most important agricultural regions, expanded our portfolio of value-added specialty fertilizers and built one of the world's most efficient potash production complexes. These investments were being made while we were reducing long-term debt by $1 billion and repurchasing 15% of our outstanding shares.\nLooking ahead, we will continue creating value for our shareholders. With the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at Riverview and the investments we've made in Mosaic Biosciences, we're pushing further into non-commodity value-add ag products. We're also continuing to explore entering the purified phosphoric acid market for lithium iron phosphate battery production. We're engaged in discussions with auto and battery manufacturers and our Board has already approved engineering work on a commercial plant.\nIn Brazil, Mosaic is already the country's largest supplier of fertilizer, and we're expanding our footprint even further with a 1 million-ton distribution facility at Palm Meranti in the fast-growing northern region in Brazil. In potash, we're further optimizing our Esterhazy facility by debottlenecking the mills and adding 400,000 tonnes of very low-cost production. Across our business, we are pursuing cost reduction initiatives. Operational improvements and our global digital acceleration program are expected to drive significant savings throughout the enterprise of at least $150 million, which you'll be able to see in our segment results and SG&A. These are all modest investments with very high returns, which means we expect 2023 to be a high watermark for capital spending.\nNext year, we expect total CapEx to be down by up to $200 million from 2023. This will allow us to continue returning all excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We believe our shares present very compelling value. I look forward to continuing this dialogue with all of you. But for now, I'll hand it back to Joc for his final discussion on broader markets and our results.\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Bruce. Today's agriculture market is tight. Food security is a major concern around the world, but crop production is constrained. Global stock-to-use ratios for grain and oilseeds remains near historic lows which highlights the crop supply is struggling to keep up with demand. Weather conditions around the world, particularly in developing markets, have impaired production Today, El Nino weather patterns are having an impact across Southeast Asia and Australia. The situation is being exacerbated by persistent under fertilization. Over the last 2 years, we've begun to see a significant relationship between insufficient nutrient consumption and disappointing yields. And of course, key growing regions are being impacted by geopolitical flare-ups and all-out war, as is the case with the war in Ukraine.\nOver the last 2 years, Ukrainian grain and oilseed exports are down 32% from pre invasion levels. It's difficult to see how other regions will be able to offset the shortfall, given poor weather and reduced fertilizer applications.\nDespite reduced production levels, demand around the world remains strong. China's import of soybeans, beef and wheat are at record levels. India, which accounts for nearly 40% of global rice trade, has a limited ban on non-basmati white rice exports and places duty on a portion of its remaining rice sales in order to ensure adequate domestic supply. Additionally, we're now seeing emerging demand from renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. In the U.S., biofuels represent 1/4 of soybean consumption. These dynamics mean elevated crop prices could persist through 2024 and beyond, and growers will want to maximize yields.\nThis brings us to the fertilizer market. The ply of potash and phosphates is being impacted by sanctions, weather disruptions and evolving producer behavior. In potash, sanctions and other disruptions continue to limit exports from the former Soviet Union. Belarus remains locked from port access in Lithuania, forcing it to find other outlets for its shipments. Some of those exports have shipped via ports in Russia or by rail into China, though total shipments remain well below pre-sanction levels of 12 million tonnes. This year, we expect Belarus exports to be in the range of 8 million to 8.5 million tonnes, and we expect limited increases from that range in 2024.\nIn Canada, labor strikes rail congestion and terminal repairs have limited the West's ability to mitigate lost FSU tonnes. More recently, the conflict in the Middle East, in addition to the ongoing war in Ukraine, highlight the risk of further supply disruptions. In total, global potash shipments are expected to be in the range of 64 million to 65 million tonnes, simply because the supply isn't there to meet additional demand particularly in developing markets, but crop supply is primarily made up of subsystems farming.\nIn phosphates, over the last decade, China grew to be the largest exporter of finished phosphate fertilizers, supplying about 30% of the seaborne market in 2021. But over the last 18 months, export restrictions and a shift of production away from agriculture to industrial markets, has significantly reduced phosphate fertilizer exports. This year, we estimate China's exports could be 3 million to 4 million tonnes below the 2021 level. of 11.4 million tonnes or roughly 7 million to 8 million tonnes.\nOn the demand side, we are seeing strong consumption returning. We saw this play out in the spring in North America. After a slow start to the season, favorable economics and depleted slow reserves brought farmers back to the market. Our phosphate and potash shipments in North America were the highest in the last 5 years. This was followed by a great summer fill program and a very strong fall application season. The last 3 months through October were a record for Mosaic's North American potash shipments.\nWe saw similar dynamics play out in Brazil. That for season fertilizer shipments ended up being very strong. For the full year, we expect total fertilizer shipments in Brazil to be 43 million to 44 million tonnes, the second highest total in history. With destocking of fertilizers in Brazil complete, inventories are quite low and will need to be replenished for 2024.\nIn India, we continue to see strong demand driving elevated imports. Phosphate inventory levels are near the low end of the most recent 5-year range, which suggests shipments are going straight to the ground. Potash inventories are also very low and we're seeing indications of price acceptance that could drive higher shipments going forward.\nFor several quarters now, we have discussed that once volumes begin to move, prices will follow. We're now seeing available volumes move and pricing has stabilized and shown seasonal strength in many markets. These dynamics highlight the value of Mosaic's portfolio. Our business is well positioned to meet customer needs and deliver value to shareholders. In potash, our third quarter results reflect the strong sales volumes in North America to meet that demand and mitigate the impact of Esterhazy's plant turnaround, [indiscernible] was restarted at the beginning of the quarter.\nLooking ahead, we expect fourth quarter potash sales volumes of 2.4 million to 2.6 million tonnes and netback MOP prices at the mine in the range of $235 to $260 per ton. Our pricing guidance reflects a product mix shift towards overseas sales as North American fall application season winds down.\nIn phosphates, we recovered quickly from the impact of Hurricane Adalia, and we're able to restart operations in approximately 3 days, which really minimized the impact of the storm. Separately, we are working through the repairs at our Fostina facility in Louisiana following a power disruption by the local utility that occurred late in the third quarter. Those repairs should be completed in the fourth quarter.\nWe expect fourth quarter sales volumes to be in the range of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes, and DAP prices at the plant gate of $530 to $580 per ton.\nMoving to Brazil. Our Fertilizantes segment reported strong third quarter results. Let me emphasize that we pushed to destock high-cost inventory in the first half of 2023. and this effort was completed early in the second quarter. Our distribution business is no longer experiencing the same pressures that others are, as you can see from our results this quarter.\nFor the fourth quarter, over 90% of our sales volume is already committed and priced. With our order book and inventory position, we expect our fourth quarter distribution margin to be in the range of $40 to $50 per ton. Our approach to capital allocation has not changed. We remain committed to investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Our CapEx budget for 2023 is $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And as Bruce mentioned earlier, we expect to reduce total capital spending for 2024 by up to $200 million. Our balance sheet is strong, and our commitment to return capital to shareholders remains unchanged. All excess cash will be returned through dividends and share buybacks. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $900 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, including $150 million of repurchases in the third quarter.\nBefore we go to questions, let me summarize. The world needs more crop supply and we won't get it without good fertilization. Farmers are seeing good economics and want to maximize yield with fertilizers but supply is uncertain and channel inventories are low. Mosaic is well positioned to benefit while continuing to deliver value to shareholders, and we're returning significant capital while still investing in the business. I look forward to watching Bruce lead Mosaic into the future.\nPaul, let's move over to questions."

[Operator Instructions] Your host for today's call is Paul Massoud, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A of The Mosaic Company. Mr. Massoud, you may begin.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, and welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Opening comments will be provided by Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by a fireside chat and then open Q&A. Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jenny Wang, Senior Vice President, Global Strategic Marketing will also be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\nActual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release published yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Mosaic delivered revenues of $3.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $744 million and adjusted earnings per share $1.04.\nFirst, I'd like to discuss the broader agricultural market. Where fundamentals remain constructive, global demand for crops is very strong and supply is struggling to keep up. Geopolitical events are having a major impact. The war in Ukraine continues to restrict supply from one of the world's most important agricultural regions.\nLast month, the UN Black Sea grain initiative collapsed and was followed by the bombing of several grain terminals. As a result, we expect Ukrainian exports of corn and wheat to be down by as much as 30% versus last year, which was in itself a down year.\nBut conflict is only 1 part of the supply problem. Around the world, weather extremes are having a profound effect on crop production. North American yields this year could be negatively impacted by dry conditions and El Nino is hurting production across Southeast Asia and Australia.\nThis situation is exacerbated by underapplication of nutrients, especially potash, which is crucial for drought resistance and crop resilience. To maximize yields and meet global consumption needs, growers need to increase cropping intensity, which will mean increasing fertilizer applications.\nThe world can't afford multiple years of under fertilization and crop production shortfalls. Today, China is importing record levels of soybean, wheat and beef. Roughly 5 million tonnes of China's corn imports over the last 12 months were sourced from the Black Sea grain deal. This is supply that must be replaced by other regions.\nThe shortfall extends beyond China. Countries across Europe, Africa and Asia will need to replace lost Ukrainian supply. In India, the focus remains on food security and affordability. Recently, the government responded by banning the export of non-Basmati what rice to ensure adequate domestic supply.\nConstrained supply and strong demand will continue to put pressure on global stock use ratios, which are already at multiyear lows. All these dynamics together continue to support a constructive ag market. The strong ag fundamentals should lead to strong fertilizer demand for the next several years, and we're already seeing robust demand in several of our key markets.\nSince the spring, improved affordability, channel inventory destocking and sustained demand for grain and oilseeds have brought customers back to the market. In North America, a strong spring application season, depleted fertilizer inventories, which customers are now looking to replenish.\nLogistical constraints associated with low water levels on the Mississippi River and limited trucking capacity persist, but favorable grower economics are leading retailers to secure supplies early to avoid any backups. In Brazil, the market is beginning to move as we expected.\nLike we saw in North America, demand was deferred late into the typical window, but customers have returned to the market. In-country inventories are well below the levels seen earlier this year and growers are trying to secure tonnes ahead of the fast approaching safer season.\nIn India, monsoon rains have been strong enough to drive grower demand for fertilizer. Phosphate imports are expected to be strong throughout the rest of the year. Switching to potash supply. Sanctions continue to restrict Belarusian exports. After a surge earlier in the year, rail volumes to China started to level off.\nWe continue to expect Belarusian potash exports to be in the range of 7 million to 8 million tonnes, which is well below their historic 13 million tonnes. In North America, port terminal capacity has been constrained by multiple events. Repairs at Canpotex's Portland terminal are ongoing and should be completed by the end of the year.\nIn Vancouver, a 13-day strike resulted in a temporary curtailment of the Neptune Terminal, but work continues to finalize a new labor deal, and we hope this will be resolved shortly. Canpotex is making use of alternative ports in Canada and in the Southern and Eastern United States to mitigate some, but likely not all of the impact on international shipments.\nWe expect constrained phosphate supply as well. Over the last several years, changes to China's environmental policy led to the permanent closure of 25% of the domestic capacity. China is also focusing on food security by ensuring adequate domestic supply while also meeting rising industrial demand, both of which are expected to limit exports for the foreseeable future.\nIndustrial demand, particularly in China's lithium iron phosphate production is expected to grow dramatically over the next several years. Last year, LFP production more than doubled to 1.1 million tonnes of finished fertilizer equivalent and production is expected to grow by an additional 500,000 tonnes in 2023.\nThis new market will continue to take phosphate volumes away from fertilizer production. We expect China's exports to be in the range of 7 million to 8 million tonnes this year or roughly 35% below 2021 export levels.\nOverall, the fertilizer market recovery is playing out as we expected. In a tight market, volumes are moving and prices are following. Phosphate prices have risen over the last month, while potash prices have stabilized and are now beginning to move higher.\nThis sets the stage for a constructive second half of the year and into 2024. We believe our business is well positioned to capitalize on this recovery. Over the last several years, we've invested in our business to maintain our position as a reliable supplier to customers.\nIn addition to the work we've done on our production assets, we've also invested in the infrastructure necessary to deliver that product. A few examples include the overhauling of our rail fleet, revitalizing our in-country distribution facilities and our purchase of the remaining share of golf sulfur services to secure logistics around our sulfur supply. These investments are integral to our results.\nIn potash, sales volumes for the second quarter reflected the benefit of a strong North American spring planting season, while prices reflected the bottoming of the global market. Markets are improving. A trend we expect to continue throughout the second half of 2023. Over the last year, Mosaic has met demand by carefully managing production and inventory.\nWe have built a flexible low-cost system that's able to capture market opportunities as they become available. Last month, we temporarily restarted our Colonsay mine to replace Esterhazy production, which is currently undergoing its summer turnaround.\nIn the third quarter, we expect total potash sales volumes of 2.1 million to 2.3 million tonnes. This guidance reflects the results of a very successful summer fill program in North America, which was oversubscribed by 30%. We currently expect MOP prices at the mine in the range of $250 to $300 per tonne.\nIn phosphates, we reported strong sales volumes in the second quarter. Our average realized price was at the high end of our guidance range, and our stripping margin benefited from lower raw materials costs. As we discussed last quarter, we are pushing ahead with increased investments in our phosphate business targeted at improving reliability. This may require short-term increases in maintenance like we experienced during the second quarter.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter, we have a solid order book with 70% committed and priced today. We anticipate total sales to be in the range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes and DAP prices at the plant in the range of $475 to $525 per tonne.\nIn Brazil, we reported sequential improvements in our operating results. Our distribution margins are recovering, and we expect that trend to continue in the third quarter as Brazil demand moves higher. 90% of our third quarter volume is already committed and priced.\nFinally, I'd like to spend some time on our capital allocation strategy. Our approach has not changed. We remain committed to investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. In potash, an independent audit of the K3 mine and K2 mill expansion was recently completed, which verified a total nameplate capacity of 7.8 million tonnes at our Esterhazy potash complex.\nEsterhazy is now the largest potash operation in the world and certainly one of the most efficient. In addition to the underground optimization, we've also begun debottlenecking the K2 mill at Esterhazy by installing a new hydrofloatation process.\nThis will add up to 400,000 tonnes of incremental production capacity with minimal additional operating costs. We're investing $55 million in this project, which has an unlevered after-tax IRR in excess of 75%. In phosphates, we continue to move production away from commodity products and towards differentiated value-added products through the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at our Riverview facility.\nFollowing the expansion, which is expected to be complete by the end of the year, about half of our North American phosphate sales volumes will be higher value specialty products. This is a $34 million investment with an after-tax unlevered IRR in excess of 50%. This expansion comes just ahead of next year's launch of MicroEssentials Pro, which is the next generation of MicroEssentials. Our field trials in Brazil indicate that growers will see a yield bump on soybean acres of 3% or roughly 2 bushels per acre versus current generation of MicroEssentials.\nAgainst traditional MAP solutions, MicroEssentials Pro provides an 8% yield advantage or nearly 5 bushels an acre. The patent on the new formulation extends through 2038. We are very excited about the launch of MicroEssentials Pro, which builds on an already strong foundation of value creation for the growers, our customers and for our shareholders.\nIn addition to higher-grade phosphate fertilizer, we're also exploring entry into purified phosphoric acid for the lithium iron phosphate battery market. Our initial work has validated this opportunity and together with constructive and developing discussions with OEMs and battery manufacturers, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $60 million to commence engineering work on a commercial plant.\nIn our Mosaic Fertilizantes business, we're building a 1 million-tonne blending and distribution facilities in Palmeirante, in the state of Tocantins in Northern Brazil. We currently don't have much presence in this region, so the facility will extend our distribution footprint into an attractive high-growth area.\nThis is an $80 million investment with an after-tax unlevered IRR in excess of 20%. In total, our capital spending expectations this year remains unchanged at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Our balance sheet is strong.\nDuring the quarter, we entered into a $700 million credit facility, which gives us additional flexibility to manage our capital. Our final focus is on capital return to shareholders. All excess cash will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nYear-to-date, we're ahead of our target. Over the last 18 months, we've repurchased 15% of our float and believe our shares still represent good value. Our regular dividend today is $0.80 per share, and our business positions us to consider further increases over time.\nTo sum up, Mosaic continues to demonstrate the earnings power and resilience we have created over the last several years. Our second quarter results were strong despite deferred fertilizer demand in many markets and our outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond is quite positive. The world's farmers have strong incentive to maximize crop production and meet global food demand. Fertilizer is critical to their success, and Mosaic will continue to meet that need.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThanks, Joc. Before we open the lines for live Q&A, we'd like to address some of the most common questions that came in last night. Our first question is on our guidance. With fertilizer markets turning higher in the last few weeks, is there conservatism in our outlook? What are we assuming in our volume and price ranges for phosphates and potash?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Paul. In potash, our volume will be dependent on the ability to ship internationally. With the continued labor unrest following the 13-day strike in Vancouver and the ongoing repairs at Portland, our export capability may be limited. But the midpoint of our guidance range is in line with our historic average, which tells you how strong the North American demand has been this summer.\nDemand has been very strong with our summer fill program oversubscribed by 30%. Phosphate volumes could also see some upside given the strong global demand, but we're limited on inventory. We expect production to be higher sequentially, so there is some opportunity to exceed our current guidance range.\nOn pricing, 70% of our Q3 order book is committed and priced. Depending on how the rest of the quarter plays out, there is an opportunity for price upside. But much of that would get realized in the fourth quarter, where we have more unpriced tonnes.\\\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nJoc, our next question is on Brazil. Fertilizantes' recovery appears to be slower than some had expected. Were there any major surprises in the second quarter? And how should investors think about that business in the second half of the year?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Weaker pricing affecting our production business and demand deferral due to grower liquidity issues extended longer into the second quarter than we had been anticipating. But the market did eventually turn. .\nAnd at today's prices, the BARDA ratio for beans is very attractive, which is driving farmers to secure supply for their safer season. Our distribution business posted a sequential improvement in quarter 2, and we see that trend continuing into the second half of the year.\nSecond half distribution margins are expected to be at the high end of our targeted range of $30 to $40 per tonne. In production, second quarter results were impacted by unplanned outages at Uberaba and Airshow. Those issues are behind us, so we expect higher volumes in the third quarter.\nThe other issue in our production business was working through higher cost inventories of sulfur and ammonia, which we now expect to be lower in the third quarter. Overall, with high-cost finished product destocking and distribution now complete and Brazilian operational issues behind us, the business is very well set up for Brazil's busiest quarter of the year.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nJoc, our next question is on Colonsay. What was the rationale for Colonsay's restart? Is market demand now strong enough to keep it running after Esterhazy's turnaround is complete?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Yes. Colonsay will be needed for the foreseeable future. Over the last year, we have met potash demand by carefully managing production and inventories. In quarter 2, strong demand in North America resulted in approximately 300,000 tonnes of inventory drawdown with Esterhazy's planned summer turnaround and a very successful summer fill program, Colonsay tonnage is required to meet our customer expectations and needs.\nAt present rates, Colonsay must run approximately 5 months to replace the 1-month Esterhazy maintenance turnaround. With strong demand in North America and a rebounding international market, the main determinant to future volumes will only be limited by export logistics capabilities.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nJoc, the last question that we want to address is on capital allocation. Mosaic is still committed to returning all free cash flow to shareholders.\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nOur commitment to return all of our free cash flow has not changed. Though to reiterate, that is a commitment to return cash flow over time, not a quarterly commitment. Returns will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on the seasonality of our business and internal capital needs.\nHowever, keep in mind, year-to-date, we have returned in excess of 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThat concludes the fireside portion of our call. Operator, could you please open the lines for the live Q&A?"

Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Mosaic delivered revenues of $3.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $777 million and adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share. The fundamentals of the agriculture market remain quite attractive. Global stock-to-use ratios for grain and oilseeds are at 25-year lows. To put that in context, it would take 2 to 3 years of perfect weather and adequate fertilizer applications in every major growing region around the world just to get back to normal levels.\nWith weather patterns shifting to an El Niño environment, the likelihood of that happening is low and would be exacerbated by under fertilization. We are beginning to see the negative impacts on crop production. Yields in the European Union turned lower in 2022 because of poor weather and under fertilization and will remain under pressure this year if fertilizer applications remain down.\nWe're seeing a similar story in rice. The combination of El Niño and under fertilization could further threaten yields in key growing regions. With reduced supply of sunflower seed oil because of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the global market needs alternative edible oils and is looking to palm oil as an important substitute. Lack of fertilization, particularly potash, will impact Southeast Asian production. All of these factors are expected to support global crop prices for the foreseeable future.\nSwitching to fertilizer markets, farmer affordability for phosphates and potash globally is very good with prices that are much more sustainable than the levels we saw a year ago. This is bringing growers back into the market, though supply constraints are still a concern. In potash, Belarusian exports remain limited because of sanctions. We've seen volumes move by rail into China and, to a lesser extent, through excess Russian port capacity, but transportation costs are high, and total exports remain well below pre-sanctioned levels. This year, we expect total exports from Belarus to be roughly 7 million tonnes. In addition, we also continue to see indications of reduced Russian product as well.\nIt is clear that today's potash market is tight and supply chain is under pressure, but this extends beyond just Belarus and Russia. This vulnerability is highlighted by the recent failure of the walkway on a conveyor Canpotex 4 million tonne per year Portland terminal. Canpotex is still assessing the total damage, but expects to redirect much of the lost volume to other North American ports, albeit at some additional cost.\nIn Phosphates, China remains committed to a structural shift away from exports. While it's possible to see a modest increase in exports over the 2022 total of 6.4 million tonnes. Domestic fertilizer demand, rising industrial consumption and environmental restrictions will cap China shipments to other markets. These supply constraints remain even as demand in our key customer markets is seeing a recovery.\nIn North America, spring planting season is well underway, and farmers have returned to the market, though retailers have been slow to adjust their prices to global wholesale market prices. Despite that resistance, growers are still committing and taking tonnes. Retailers are replenishing their inventories. In April, Mosaic's volumes saw a significant rebound in the North American shipments for both potash and phosphate. Combined, Mosaic shipped over 1 million tonnes of potash and phosphates to North American customers in April alone.\nThis is the highest total we've seen in the last 5 years. In Brazil, the is supportive of demand, and we expect commitments for the third quarter to ramp up with prepays for fertilizer ahead of the softer season. We expect Brazil will see a 9% to 10% increase in fertilizer shipments in 2023 over last year.\nIn India, inventories for potash remain depleted as all purchases are going straight to the ground. After a year of reduced potash applications, a potash contract was signed in April at a price of $422 per tonne. In addition to providing necessary supply to Indian farmers, the contract helps stabilize global pricing. In Southeast Asia, with the shortfall in edible oils globally, the palm market is driving strong demand. Globally, we're seeing good farmer economics, which suggest strong demand for phosphates and potash in 2023.\nGiven this landscape, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit from today's market conditions. In Phosphates, after 2 years of production issues caused by multiple hurricanes, raw material shortages and other issues, the segment's performance has improved. Volumes during the quarter were higher than any quarter in 2022, and our stripping margins also benefited from lower raw materials costs. We expect both of these trends to continue in 2023.\nIn the second quarter, we anticipate total sales volumes of 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes with DAP FOB prices at the plant in the range of $550 to $600 per tonne. In Potash, volumes began to move over the last week of the first quarter, and that has continued into the second quarter, especially in North America. We expect demand to continue recovering throughout the year. Our operations at Esterhazy and Belle Plaine are performing well. Esterhazy is one of the most efficient mines in the world, and Belle Plaine should see benefit from lower natural gas costs in 2023.\nAt Esterhazy, the last of the 13 miners is expected to come online later this year. In total, Esterhazy's annual operational run rate should increase from 5.5 million tonnes last year to well over 6 million tonnes by the end of 2023. We're committed to producing enough potash to meet market demand. With the incremental output from Esterhazy, we believe we're producing what the market needs, which means we'll only restart Colonsay when it's needed. We don't think this will be before the second half of the year.\nIn the second quarter, we expect total sales volumes of 2 million to 2.2 million tonnes with MOP prices at the mine in the range of $325 to $375 per tonne. In Brazil, first quarter results reflected the impact of declining prices and inventory destocking. As we said in February, we expected our Q1 results to be impacted by destocking of high-priced inventory. And now that is largely behind us.\nLooking ahead, we expect distribution margins to trend back towards the range of $30 to $40 a tonne. In the second quarter, 90% of those tonnes are already committed and priced. Finally, I want to reiterate that we are committed to our capital allocation strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders. We've met our commitment of reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. As such, we expect to refinance the $900 million that matures later this year.\nOur CapEx spending expectation this year remains unchanged at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. We're focused on high returning modest spend projects like our distribution facility in expansion of MicroEssentials at Riverview and the exploration of purified phosphoric acid. Beyond that, all excess free cash flow will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $608 million, which included $456 million of share repurchases and $152 million in special and regular dividends. Over the last 18 months, we've repurchased 15% of our float and still believe our shares represent very good value. Our regular dividend today is $0.80 per share, and our business positions us to consider further increases over time.\nBefore we move to the Q&A, let me summarize. The global ag market remains constructive. Grain and oilseed supplies are tight, and growers are incented by favorable economics to apply nutrients. We are already seeing the recovery in shipments in North America and expect the rest of the world to follow. Our production operations are performing well. Phosphate production has recovered, and potash is benefiting from the most efficient mines in the world with swing capacity available to meet demand growth.\nOur balance sheet is strong and sustainable over the long term, and we remain committed to returning significant capital to shareholders while continuing to invest efficiently in the business. With that, I'd like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nBefore we move on to live Q&A, as we've done in past quarters, we'd like to address some of the most common questions we received after we published our earnings materials last night.\nJoc, the first question that we received was, how do we see ag markets evolving over the rest of 2023?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you. While there has been recent volatility in the agricultural markets, the fundamentals remain strong. We're starting with a 25-year low stock-to-use ratio for grains and oilseeds. Now much has been made of Brazil's larger-than-expected crop, but offsetting that is problems in the Argentinian, Europe, Asia and others who are suffering from lower yields due to weather and under fertilizations.\nThen as we look at going forward, this year's El Niño and under fertilization brings up a real risk to the 2023 ag markets. Now weather is always a known uncertainty. But as we've seen in recent past, extreme weather events that negatively impact ag production seem to have become more commonplace. Longer term, we do continue to see great potential for demand growth from biofuels, including an increased call on oilseeds to feed renewable diesel production as well as the enormous potential for sustainable aviation fuel.\nWe also believe that biofuel use will continue to rise in the medium term even as cars transition towards electrification. To sum up, there is a rational basis for ag commodity prices to have eased off in recent weeks. However, there is strong fundamentals for ag bullishness .\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nJoc, a follow-on to the ag markets question. How do we see what you just said impacting fertilizer markets over the rest of this year?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nWell, thank you. I'd like to start by saying what we're seeing in North America demonstrates just how strong the market could be this year. If we look at North America in the months of March and April, those were both very strong months and up about 20% from where we were probably last year. So if I look forward there, I expect that will carry over to a stronger season in Brazil once the application gets started, and then it will continue for Asia and other regions. Now I'm going to turn it over to Jenny to give a little more detail on the supply and demand of the fertilizer markets.\n\nYijun Wang\n\nSenior VP of Global Strategic Marketing and Head of China & India\n\nSure, Joc. Let me start from phosphate. The export control out of China is going to continue as the country is going through phosphate industry shift from production on fertilizers to industrial products. The Chinese government is going to continue to ensure their farmers to have affordable and available fertilizers in country for their own production. The export restriction is going to continue to be in place. We believe this year, the export out of China will be somewhere between 7 million to 8 million tonnes.\nWith the tight supply of phosphate and the rebounding demand, we believe this is a very constructive margin environment for phosphate.\nTurning over to potash. Export out of Belarus last year had significantly reduced from 12 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes. This year, despite multiple export corridors being utilized by Belarus, we still don't believe that they have opportunity to export over 8 million tonnes out of Belarus. And the production out of Russia is continuously under the risk. On the demand side, as Joc mentioned, we are seeing a very strong spring season in North America.\nIn the market when spring application have started, we're seeing a bigger volume and we have seen price appreciation in the market. And in the market in Northern plants, where the spring season are still ongoing, we have started to get inquiries from our customers for their summer fuel demand. This demand to summer fuel and applications are indicating a strong and robust demand for the full season in North America. We believe what is happening in North America is going to happen in a market like Brazil, where they are going to prepare for their incoming seasons, and we believe they will engage soon. With strong demand in Asia, we believe the buyers will reengage and the price and volumes will respond positively.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Jenny. The next question is a follow-on to what we just talked about. Given this constructive outlook on the fertilizer markets, can you explain your thinking behind the guidance for pricing and volume, particularly for Potash?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you. In Potash, we guided to a normal quarter in North America and a conservative view of the export market. Early quarter demand in North America is stronger than we would have expected and certainly stronger than normal. And history would say that the strong North American market will be followed in other markets such as Brazil and Asia. If this occurs, there is certainly upside to both potash volume and price. We have seen over and over again that once volumes move, price follows.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nJoc, our next question is on Mosaic results. Could you provide more color on the quarter and how you see the performance of the segment evolving over the rest of the year?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you. In the distribution business, the lead time to position products is quite long. As such, when the second half volumes were lower than we expected, we ended the year with high-priced inventory. Now we have sold most of this higher cost inventory down and expect the rest of the year to be much more normal. Transitioning between cycles can temporarily expand or contract margins, but true cycle margins remain unchanged.\nFor example, in quarter 4 of 2022 and quarter 1 of 2023, distribution margins were below historic levels, but they will return as market stability is achieved. Distribution margins in second quarter to the fourth quarter will be in the $30 to $40 range when averaged together.\n\nClint C. Freeland\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, The Mosaic Co.\n\nJoc, one other thing that I would note that I think is important in this discussion is that we use average cost accounting for the cost of inventory in Brazil. And what that means is that as prices -- sales prices are moving either up or down, the average cost of inventory that we're recognizing in our results is moving a little slower than that market price. And as a result, during increasing price environment, you'll see expanding margins. During declining price environment, you'll see declining margins.\nBut that's why over the course of the year, we will see margins in the target range that we've talked about. But quarter-to-quarter, as market prices are moving, you can see a level of volatility in results.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nDirector of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Joc, Clint and Jenny. Operator, let's move on to the live portion of the call."

(Operator Instructions) Your host for today's call is Paul Massoud, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis of the Mosaic Company. Mr. Massoud, you may begin.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nVP of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Opening comments will be provided by Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by a fireside chat and then open Q&A. Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jenny Wang, Senior Vice President, Global Strategic Marketing will also be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release published yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our full year 2022 earnings call. Mosaic had a record year in 2022, delivering revenues of $19 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $6.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $11.01. In 2022, we reached several operational milestones that allowed us to benefit from strong prices. K3 reached its initial capacity of 5.5 million tonnes. In Brazil, we grew our distribution market share from 16% to 18%. In North America in phosphates, Performance Products represented 43% of total sales volumes, and now we've begun to look at expanding our MicroEssentials capacity further, which we will discuss later. These efforts are driving strong free cash flow generation, which allowed us to return significant capital to shareholders in 2022, while also strengthening our balance sheet.\nOver the last 12 months, we've repurchased $1.7 billion worth of shares outstanding. If we include the fourth quarter of 2021, we've bought back more than 10% of the shares outstanding or roughly 40 million shares. In addition to share repurchases, we've also paid investors nearly $200 million in dividends. Our regular dividend now stands at $0.80 per share, up from $0.60 per share the prior year. And on the balance sheet, we met our long-term debt reduction target of $1 billion with the retirement of $550 million of long-term debt in November.\nBefore diving into our business further, I'd like to briefly discuss broader agriculture and fertilizer markets. Ag market fundamentals remain very constructive with December corn near $6 per bushel and November beans near $14 a bushel. This reflects ongoing global food security concerns at a time of disappointing production. Global stocks-to-use ratios are at 25-year lows and remain under pressure because of elevated risks that threaten output in 2023. The world continues to watch the war in Ukraine. We have consulted with top military and foreign policy leaders who share our concern that the conflict seems unlikely to be resolved in the near term and will have long-lasting impacts, particularly in the production of key crops like wheat and sunflowers, which is a source of significant amount of the world's edible oils.\nOutside of Europe, we believe the USDA's latest estimate for Argentinian production appears optimistic as drought conditions during the growing season suggest yields will disappoint. In Brazil, weather has delayed the planting of safrinha corn which could pressure the record crop that many are forecasting. Around the world, we still see fertilizer shortages in many key agricultural markets, despite some major markets being well supplied. However, the overall shortage still threatens total production, and this will underpin global crop prices for some time.\nNow let's focus on the fertilizer markets. The sharp spike in nutrient prices in the first half of last year resulted in growers aggressively mining their soils. As we enter 2023, phosphate and potash prices are now half of what they were at the peak. With crop prices still very strong, farmer affordability for nutrients has improved significantly and is now back to the levels seen in 2020 and 2021. This suggests a strong rebound in demand as growers seek to maximize yields with sufficient fertilization. The world is still short of potash. Certain markets are seeing more readily available supply, but this means other markets are not able to get what they need. Belarusian supply remains constrained because of the ongoing sanctions. We believe Belaruskali's exports were down about 8 million tons in 2022, and we expect only modest recovery in 2023 with total exports of around 6 million to 7 million tonnes or half of their pre-sanctioned export volumes.\nThe limited product, Belarus has been able to get out of the country has been aggressively marketed over the seasonally slow winter, and we've seen similar actions from some Russian producers. This is driving recent weakness in prices, but we believe the phenomena is temporary and will reverse as spring demand ramps up. In phosphates, China remains committed to the structural shift impacting where it sends its phosphoric acid. In addition to shutting down production for environmental reasons, a significant portion of phosphoric acid is now being directed to industrial uses, including the battery market. Roughly 1 million tonnes of finished fertilizer equivalent was diverted to the battery market in 2022 and we think that will continue to grow rapidly over the next few years as additional battery capacity is added. This suggests China's exports of phosphate fertilizers will continue to be down significantly as restrictions extend into 2023.\nInventory levels in our key markets for both phosphates and potash have declined considerably from the elevated levels observed in the second half of last year. Grower demand across the Americas has been very strong because of favorable affordability, but retailers have been hesitant to replenish inventories because of the volatility in global prices especially in potash with the aggressive off-season marketing from the Russians and the Belarusians. U.S. spring demand is ramping up over the next coming weeks, and we believe we have reached a bottom in potash prices.\nIn Brazil, sentiment has improved. Inventories have worked their way down to much more normalized levels for both potash and phosphates as growers take advantage of much more attractive barter ratios. We estimate fertilizer shipments will total 46 million tonnes in 2023, up more than 10% from last year, and roughly 35% of those expected shipments have already been contracted. In India, phosphate inventories remain very low even after a year of elevated imports as most of the product went straight to the ground.\nGovernment subsidies for the coming fertilizer year will determine whether India will be able to attract the nutrients it needs to meet its food security concerns. In Southeast Asia, potash has become much more affordable for palm oil producers as well, which should drive demand recovery. Globally, we're seeing very good farmer economics and depleted inventories that suggest strong demand for phosphates and potash in 2023. Given this landscape, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit from the market's recovery. In phosphates, lingering issues from Hurricane Ian impacted our operations during the fourth quarter for longer than originally expected, but Florida operations returned to normal operating levels earlier this month. We now believe we've moved past the operational issues that impacted output and are dedicating resources to fixing key components in our production.\nAt Bartow, we are upgrading our sulfuric acid production facilities following the recent production stops we saw after Hurricane Ian. And at Faustina, we've improved operations at our ammonia plant and saw a significant increase in the amount of ammonia produced from our plant during the fourth quarter. Florida production has returned to normal operating rates. During the first quarter, we expect total shipments of 1.7 million tonnes to 1.9 million tonnes with realized pricing of $625 to $675 per tonne. We expect stripping margins will remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter as lower raw material prices offset lower finished product prices. In our potash business, slower demand led us to temporarily stop production at our Colonsay mine, but we think the current market situation is temporary and expect to restart operations at Colonsay within the first half of 2023.\nAt Esterhazy, the 12th miner is being commissioned, and the 13th miner is expected to be in service before the end of the year. When that's done, it will add at least 1 million tonnes of additional annual capacity at one of the most efficient mines in the world. In the first quarter, we expect sales of 1.8 million tonnes to 2 million tons with realized MOP prices at the mine of $425 to $475 per tonne. Mosaic Fertilizantes had its best year since we purchased the business in 2018 with adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion in 2022 despite volatility in the second half of the year. Fourth quarter results reflect the sharp reversal of commodity prices from the highs of the first half of the year, which negatively impacted both the production and the distribution margins. But for the full year, our distribution margins averaged $36 per tonne, which is right in the range of $30 to $40 per tonne that we'd expect. First quarter distribution margins will be similar to fourth quarter as higher inventory is worked through. But for the full year, we do expect distribution margins to be back within our normal range.\nAs we think about the evolution of our business, we continue to execute our high-returning investments while returning capital to shareholders. In phosphates, we've begun expansion of our MicroEssentials offering by adding capacity at our Riverview facility. The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Upon completion, about 50% of our North American phosphate business will be sales of value-added performance products. This is not an expensive project. Total budget is less than $40 million with a payback period of less than 2 years.\nWe're also building a test plan for purified phosphoric acid production in North America to verify final design plans for commercial operation. This is the next step in our shift away from commodity fertilizers and opens up new markets like food production and batteries.\nWe're also exploring using the plant's byproducts to produce NPKs. In Brazil, we continue to grow our distribution business. While our footprint is already large, there are still areas where we see opportunities to expand. We've begun construction of a 1 million tonne blending and distribution facility at [Pomerance] in the fast-growing North with access to very attractive rail infrastructure. Returns of about 20% and on an expected $80 million budget, make this another example of highly attractive modest investments.\nWe're also monetizing past investments. In January, we sold our Streamsong Resort for $160 million because we could realize appealing value for a noncore asset. Our joint venture in Saudi Arabia is also performing well. In 2022, Mosaic's equity earnings from the joint venture totaled $195 million, which is about 1/4 of our initial investment. This year, they plan to reduce debt by $800 million. They've also distributed $100 million in dividends to investors. Our proportional share of $25 million was received this month.\nFinally, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to our approach to balance sheet management and shareholder capital returns. In November, we retired $550 million in long-term debt, and this allowed us to meet our commitment of reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. As we look at our balance sheet today, we believe we are well positioned for the long term. Similar to last year, we plan to return substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2023 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Since September of 2021, we bought back $2.2 billion in shares, and we continue to see great value in our shares. To emphasize that point, we plan to proceed with a $300 million accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter. We've also grown our regular dividend to $0.80 per share, and we're well positioned to consider further growth, especially with our reduced share count. In addition to the regular common dividend, our Board of Directors has approved a special dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid out on March 30 to shareholders of record on March 15.\nGiven our strong cash flow, combined with the proceeds of asset sales, our Board approved this payout as a supplement to our ongoing share repurchases. Before we go on to Q&A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered record results in 2022 and we expect favorable dynamics to continue in 2023. The world is short global grains and oilseeds. So farmers are incented to maximize yields. We expect this to drive strong fertilizer demand and our business is well positioned to meet that demand through our existing assets and exciting new growth opportunities. With the strong cash flows that these provide we're returning significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nWith that, I'd like to now move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

(Operator Instructions)\nYour host for today's call is Mr. Paul Massoud, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis of The Mosaic Company. Mr. Massoud, you may begin.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nVP of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call.

Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. Mosaic delivered record third quarter revenues of $5.3 billion, which resulted in net income of $842 million or earnings per share of $2.42. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.7 billion.\nThese results are driving significant cash flow generation, which is allowing us to return significant capital to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the business and strengthen the balance sheet. During the quarter, we returned roughly $670 million to shareholders, including $600 million of share buybacks.\nNow before diving into our operations, I'd like to address current market dynamics. Food security remains a concern around the world. Global grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios remain at 20-year lows, and early data continues to suggest there may be further downside to total production once the fall harvest is complete.\nIt is important to remember that the market was tight when the year began, well before the start of the war, and issues over the last several months have further exacerbated the situation. Ukraine's production shortfall is significant, but weather issues like high temperatures and drought conditions in other major growing regions are having an even bigger impact on an already tight market.\nIn the U.S., weather delayed spring planting, and the compressed planting window reduced nutrient applications. The growing season was further impacted by high temperatures and drought in some areas. Weather tends to be a significant factor in yield, but under-fertilization doesn't help, and you can only mine the soil for so long. Both are contributing to an expectation of weaker-than-normal North American harvest. And this was reflected in the most recent USDA yield forecast.\nIn Brazil, fertilizer shipments appear poised to have dropped around 10% year-over-year. And La Niña remains a threat despite the market counting on record-breaking corn and soybean production. Beyond grains and oilseeds, we're seeing food security issues play out in other crops as well. Staples like rice are also seeing significant production shortages, driving some countries like India to restrict exports.\nBecause of this, we see a tight market for global grains and oilseeds continuing into 2023 and beyond. The global fertilizer market remains tight with supply constraints in both potash and phosphate still unresolved. Global potash supply remains impacted by the significant reduction in Belarusian exports, which we think will be down 8 million tonnes in 2022. Of the 4 million tonnes they will export this year, we estimate about 2 million tonnes were shipped in the first quarter before the sanctions and Lithuania's decision to prevent Belarus from using its ports.\nBelarus exports are down significantly from the first quarter, and we do not expect much recovery through the rest of the year or for most of 2023. This means the market will continue to be short of potash in 2023. The phosphate market is also impacted by supply constraints. China production is down because of environmental concerns, and exports are being restricted to ensure domestic availability and affordability.\nThis year, we expect China's phosphate exports will be down by up to 5 million tonnes. Those restrictions could extend through at least the first half of 2023 and possibly beyond as China prioritizes securing domestic food supply and meeting growing industrial demand.\nWhile global channel inventories of phosphate and potash remain below historic norms, certain regions, especially in the areas where we do most of our business, saw inventories build in the first half of the year. But prices have retreated back to levels low enough to entice growers to step back into the market. We expect inventories to continue working lower through the end of the year and into early 2023.\nU.S. fall application has been trending back towards normal levels. We believe we could end the season with inventory significantly depleted, especially for phosphates. The U.S. is also experiencing low water levels on the Mississippi River, which is delaying supply coming through New Orleans.\nIn Brazil, the higher-priced inventory built during the first half of the year has slowed third quarter shipments. But sentiment is improving. Prices have retreated enough to encourage sales, and we expect inventories will end the year much the same as where they started. The barter ratio suggests we're approaching a much more constructive environment for demand.\nIn India, importers are taking advantage of the price pullback in phosphates. India's phosphates inventory is still low, while farmer demand remains strong. Government subsidies remain at a level that is supportive of phosphate imports but are likely to leave the country short of adequate supply of potash.\nTo summarize, the strength of crop prices and more affordable fertilizer prices suggest nutrient demand will recover from the summer lull we experienced during the third quarter. Given the constructive ag backdrop, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit.\nIn our phosphates business, Hurricane Ian forced us to shut down operations late in the third quarter, which delayed shipments at the end of September. Our team performed admirably and was able to get our Florida operations back up and running quickly following the hurricane. We estimate the shortfall in production to be in the range of 200,000 tonnes.\nLooking forward, we now expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of 1.7 million to 2 million tonnes. Our phosphate business is expected to benefit from lower raw material prices in the fourth quarter, particularly as low sulfur prices start flowing through our costs. We expect a fourth quarter benefit of $40 to $45 per tonne from lower raw materials in our North American phosphate business over the cost in the third quarter.\nIn our potash business, we are realizing the benefits of improved volumes from Esterhazy and from the addition of Colonsay. 11 of the 13 planned miners are now running at Esterhazy, and improved operating rates at Colonsay together are driving higher volumes. We anticipate some turnarounds during the fourth quarter that will impact total production but expect sales volumes to be 2 million to 2.2 million tonnes.\nMosaic Fertilizantes continues to be a very good business, having earned $1.2 billion in EBITDA over the last 12 months. High inventories built during the second quarter led to slower than initially expected demand during the third quarter as shipments typically seen during quarter 3 didn't materialize. But pricing trends towards the end of the third quarter reached a level that is beginning to drive shipments, and we've begun seeing that in our business. Some of the third quarter buyer hesitancy is impacting the fourth quarter, but we expect trends to begin normalizing as we finish out the year.\nBefore moving on, I'd like to address the next iteration of our transformation process. Over the last 3 years, we've extracted significant cost efficiencies in Brazil, lowered our cost profile in the potash business with transition to Esterhazy K3 and benefited from the combination of support functions across North America.\nOur next area of focus is the realization of efficiencies through a digital transformation of how we manage our business. In our release last night, we introduced our global digital acceleration project, an initiative that will transform how we use data to manage a complex business across our global footprint. This effort will upgrade our core systems and allow for more seamless integration across sales, production, supply chain and global support functions.\nOver the next several years, the total cost will be about $200 million to $250 million, split roughly evenly between SG&A and capital expenditures. As a result of this transformation, we expect to realize significant benefits in our sales and production planning and our cost and capital management. Similar to our early transformation efforts, this initiative will continue the trend of adding shareholder value. We expect this investment will have a payback in the range of 3 to 4 years.\nFinally, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. Later this month, we expect to retire the remaining $550 million of long-term debt that completes our goal of $1 billion of long-term debt reduction. Our CapEx expenditures expectation this year remains unchanged at $1.3 billion, and all remaining free cash flow after these commitments will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\nDuring the quarter, we returned roughly $670 million to shareholders, which included $600 million of share repurchases. Over the last year, we have reduced our share count from approximately 380 million shares to 340 million shares. Putting all of this together, our outlook is quite strong. The global agriculture market continues to point to tight supply and demand for grains and oilseeds.\nWe strengthened our balance sheet. Our team has recovered from Hurricane Ian in Florida. Our potash business continues to benefit from our low-cost position at Esterhazy and the flexibility gained from restarting Colonsay. Our Brazil distribution business has a significant and growing footprint in an important agricultural market. We have positioned ourselves to maximize value across our business, and this has allowed us to return significant capital to shareholders.\nWith that, let's move on to the fireside chat portion of our call. Paul?\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nVP of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThanks, Joc. Similar to last quarter, before we open the lines for live Q&A, we're going to address some of the most common questions that came in last night. First, we received several questions on our general view of both the potash and phosphate markets. Where are we most optimistic? And where do we continue to see risk as we move into 2023?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThanks, Paul. I'm going to hand this over to Jenny for some detail here, but let me summarize by saying we're very positive on both markets as both remain supply-constrained. Ag fundamentals remain strong, and fertilizer prices have moderated from the previous peak seen earlier this year, which is driving a return to more historic levels.\nSo Jenny, can you give us some detail?\n\nYijun Wang\n\nSenior VP of Global Strategic Marketing and Head of China & India, The Mosaic Company\n\nThanks, Joc. I'd like to start from North America. The warm and dry weather has allowed farmers to go to the field for fall applications with a wide open window. And as of today, we are still saying products are going to hit ground. This improved farm economics and affordability has encouraged farmers to put down their phosphate and potash in the fall.\nIn fact, we started to get customers' inquiries and the request for the spring season demand. We sold a block of phosphate to one of our major customers yesterday as their customers, the farmers, have come to the table to buy product with the concern of the potential logistic issues for the spring supply and very strong cash flow the farmers are having to manage before end of the year. So a good and normal fall applications are setting a good stage for the inventory drawdown in North America and set good stage for spring season in 2023.\nMoving over to Brazil. The barter ratios have improved significantly with the moderation of fertilizer prices and elevated at commodity prices. We are saying the Brazilian customers are reengaging in the purchases in order to prepare the coming safrinha seasons, and the inventories are coming down.\nMoving over to India. The farm economics have been very strong this year with the support from their government. The monsoon has also been helpful as we see demand increases, especially for phosphate. The recently announced subsidy program from the Indian government has been very supportive to their phosphate input and also consumption. We are seeing steady buy-ins from Indian customers on DAP recently at $750 per tonne level.\nWith the strong demand in Q4 and getting into 2023, we continue to see the supply constraints for both phosphate and potash. On phosphate, we expect that Chinese export control will continue as we get into 2023 as the Chinese government to ensure that domestic supply availability and their farmers to be able to get fertilizers for their food production. And there's very little new capacities coming online in phosphate production in 2023.\nSimilarly to potash, we envision Belarus and Russia's supply will remain constrained in 2023. And the alternatives as well will not be able to ramp up quickly to offset the continued constraints from that part of the world. To summarize, as you mentioned, Joc, we are very positive to both phosphate and potash as we move into 2023.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nVP of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThe next question is on channel inventories for both potash and phosphates. Can you provide some detail on recent channel inventory levels and what we expect for the balance of the year and early 2023?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThanks, Paul. I'm going to hand this one straight over to Jenny. Jenny?\n\nYijun Wang\n\nSenior VP of Global Strategic Marketing and Head of China & India, The Mosaic Company\n\nSure, Joc. The inventory level in most parts of the world are pretty low. In some of the regions like in Europe, the inventory level is really, really low given the supply situation in 2022. I probably want to provide some color on the inventory situation in North America and Brazil, where we believe most of the question is about.\nIn North America, for both phosphate and potash, the current channel inventory are about average relative to historical norm at the same time of this year. As of yesterday, our upper country warehouse capacity for phosphate has come down to 30% used. And for potash, that has come down to 50% used. This level of the inventory are right at the same level as we see historically at this point of time.\nAs we are seeing good norm fall application, the channel inventories are expected to come down further. I also want to remind ourself, logistics remain very challenging in North America, particularly on the river, which highlights the unique strength of Mosaic's assets, which can serve North America by both rail and barges.\nMove over to Brazil. Since the war started in the first quarter, a lot of Brazilian customers rushed to buy products from all around the world in order to ensure their supply. As a result of this rush buying, we are seeing a very high inventory building at a port in Brazil started in July. That inventory at port has gradually fell down over the last few months. By end of October, we are saying that inventory export has come down by 35% versus the peak in end of July.\nThe other thing that I want to mention is the import shipment to Brazil. In the mid of the year, the vessels coming to Brazil had to wait for over 8 weeks to unload product because the ports warehouses are so full. Now the waiting time has come down to less than 2 weeks. That's a signal. And in the meantime, we are seeing reexport vessels for both potash and phosphate. With that, we believe the market reached to the bottom in Brazil.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nVP of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nJoc, the next question is on the status of our potash production increases, especially given what we've seen with recent demand and price trends. Are we committed to continuing to increase production in 2023?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Paul. And let me start by talking about Esterhazy. Esterhazy has been a 10-year plan. And in that plan, we not only brought out a new mine at K3 but fully intended to bring on an extra 1 million tonnes of production, which was aligned with the capacity of the K1 and K2 mills.\nSo as we talk about that, we've always looked at Esterhazy as being our most efficient, lowest-cost operations. So yes, we absolutely will expand the capacity of Esterhazy's K3 mine to meet the capacity of the mill. In terms of Colonsay, we see an immediate need for those tonnes as the gap in supply from Belarus has meant there's been an opportunity for us and through Canpotex exporting more product. That near-term need, we expect, will continue into 2023. So we certainly see a need for Colonsay in the near term.\nBringing that production on has been relatively inexpensive, likely in the range of $50 per capacity tonne. So on that basis, that's paid off over a matter of months. So how will we look at it as we go forward? We will always be focused on working towards value, not volume. And as such, we will meet the needs of the market and no more.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nVP of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThe fourth question we should cover is on Fertilizantes gross margins in the fourth quarter. How should investors think about the impact of cost inflation in Brazil across our production and distribution businesses? And what are the key takeaways on costs?\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you, Paul. Yes, inflation is showing up in our cost structure through the increased price of commodities, labor and inputs as well as our raw materials. We expect, overall, the impact on our cost structure to be around 15%. Our distribution business in Brazil benefited by matching low-cost inventory with high-priced sales in Q2. We saw a reversal of that in the third quarter.\nFor distribution business, due to the timing of purchases, a step down in gross margin per tonne is expected. However, even with that, we are still seeing gross margins above our historic norms.\nWith that, operator, can we open the call to questions from the audience."

(Operator Instructions)\nYour host for today's call is Paul Massoud, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis of the company -- of The Mosaic Company. Mr. Massoud, you may begin.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nVP of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nThank you and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. Opening comments will be provided by Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer, followed by a fireside chat as well as open Q&A. Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jenny Wang, Senior Vice President of Global Strategic Marketing, will also be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. Statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release furnished yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release and performance data also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.\n\nJames C. O’Rourke\n\nCEO, President & Director, The Mosaic Company\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 earnings discussion. I hope you've had a chance to review our posted slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide more additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session.\nMosaic delivered second quarter net income of $1 billion and earnings per share of $2.85. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.64, and adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion. Free cash flow totaled $794 million, allowing us to return $667 million to shareholders during the second quarter, including $612 million of share repurchases, bringing the year-to-date buyback total through June 30 to over $1 billion.\nWe've continued to buy back shares aggressively through July because we believe our portfolio positions us to continue driving strong results and generating significant cash flow through the rest of the year and into 2023. As such, Mosaic's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to begin once the current one is exhausted later this year.\nBefore digging deeper into our business, let's discuss the broader agricultural markets. There are several issues threatening global food security. The war in Ukraine continues to create uncertainty around food supply from one of the world's most important crop producers. In addition, Europe and U.S. have experienced very high temperatures, while Southern Brazil is showing signs of drought conditions. And all of this is happening at a time of lower overall nutrient applications because of constrained supply.\nEach of these issues alone can have a material effect on global crop production. But together, the risk to food security is significant. This suggests global stock-to-use ratios, which are already near 20-year lows, will remain under pressure. Because of this, we see a tight supply and demand scenario for global grains and oilseeds continuing through 2022 and into 2023.\nAs we focus on the potash and phosphate fertilizer markets, the fundamentals remain quite strong. In potash, we continue to expect Belarusian exports to be down 8 million tonnes this year. Some of that will be mitigated by incremental supply from producers like Mosaic over the next 18 months. But that will not be enough to erase the deficit that we see lasting well into 2023 at least.\nIn phosphates, China has continued to restrict exports as it prioritizes domestic industrial and agricultural demand. We now believe full year phosphate exports from China could be down as much as 5 million tonnes from the prior year total of 11.5 million tonnes.\nShifting focus, we believe global fertilizer demand in the first half of 2022 was down about 10% from the same period last year, which aligns with the shortfall we've seen in supply. Grower sentiment has grown more cautious. But supply constraints are supporting global prices and margins well above historical levels, a situation we believe will continue at least through the rest of the year.\nNorth America and Brazil have been well supplied thus far in '22, but much of the rest of the world is continuing to see unfilled demand of both phosphates and potash as a result of limited supply. In North America, a compressed planting season, macroeconomic headwinds and volatile crop prices impact spring season consumption. First half applications were down from the record year in 2021 but remained in line with historic levels. Looking forward, we expect normal demand leading up to fall application.\nIn Brazil, we saw first half demand in line with historic levels. Channel inventories were built in country by importers driven by concerns over supply availabilities stemming from geopolitical events. Significant customer prepays, though, indicate farmer demand will ramp up as the [softer] season gets underway.\nIn India, we've begun to see importers enter the market and take advantage of the recent price pullback in phosphates. India's phosphate inventories are low and concerns over availability persist. Farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong, and the government continues to indicate it will ensure adequate supply for domestic consumption.\nIn China, port inventories of potash sit below 2 million tonnes. And in Southeast Asia, shipments of potash appear below historic levels. We see these dynamics impacting demand beyond 2022 as reduced application this year will require a catch-up in future years when supply availability improves.\nAs we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain optimistic. The investments we've made over the last decade have positioned us well for today's environment. In Brazil, our 2018 acquisition of the Fertilizantes business has driven significant shareholder value. We've seen EBITDA grow from less than $70 million in pro forma 2017 to $1.2 billion over the last 12 months. And we've completely recapitalized the business, having now bought back all of the shares issued and repaid all of the borrowing to fund that deal.\nLooking forward, Mosaic Fertilizantes will continue to benefit from its market position as the country's largest producer and second-largest distributor. We are seeing inflation in our cost structure but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact. In potash, we are realizing the benefits of K3, one of the world's most efficient potash mines, and we're actively working to optimize that asset. We've reached our initial operating run rate target of 5.5 million tonnes per year at the end of the first quarter and plan to continue our optimization of the complex with the addition of 3 new underground miners over the next year, resulting in an incremental 1 million tonnes of production capacity.\nAt Colonsay, we've begun the process of restarting the second mill, which should expand output to 2 million tonnes per year by the second half of 2023. In phosphates, we continue to benefit from our advantaged position in ammonia, and we're now seeing an improvement in sulfur costs that should begin to flow through to our production costs later this year. We've seen prices moderate down to levels we believe are sustainable for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our stripping margins will remain well above historic levels.\nGiven the outlook for our business and the free cash flow we expect to generate, capital allocation remains a key focus for us. First, we continue to invest in our business. For 2022, total capital expenditures remain unchanged at $1.3 billion. We remain open to modest, high-returning projects and small bolt-on acquisitions, especially in Brazil, but we are not interested in large-scale greenfield projects. Second, we're committed to ensuring a strong balance sheet and plan to retire $550 million of long-term debt in the second half of 2022, after which, we see no need to further deleverage.\nThe third pillar of our strategy is returning capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And we expect that pace to continue, if not accelerate, as the year progresses. In total, we expect to return essentially 100% of our free cash flow after the commitments to the business and the balance sheet we've discussed.\nBecause we're approaching the end of our current authorization, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization of $2 billion that begins once we've exhausted the current authorization. At today's valuation, buying back our own shares provides better economics than any other use of cash. So we expect to take advantage of this as long as the opportunity remains. We may also consider supplementing share repurchases with special dividends over time depending on market conditions. As we've said in the past, we will not build cash on the balance sheet just for the sake of it.\nBefore going into Q&A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered very strong results in the second quarter, and we expect favorable dynamics as we continue through the year and into 2023. We're continuing to help the world grow the food it needs by ensuring customer demands are met, and we're returning significant capital to shareholders while still investing in the business and strengthening our balance sheet. Now with that, I would like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nPaul Abdelmassieh Massoud\n\nVP of IR, The Mosaic Company\n\nAs we've done in past quarters, we'd like to address some of the most common questions we received after we published our earnings materials last night."

I hope you've had a chance to review our posted slides as well as our news release and performance data, which were made available on our website yesterday. I will provide some additional context before we respond to questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session.\nMosaic delivered first quarter net income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $3.19. Adjusted EPS was $2.41, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion. Our results continue to highlight the positive evolution of our business, which reflect the contribution from Brazil, the additional production from the restart of Colonsay and the transition to K3, one of the largest and most efficient potash mines in the world.\nPhosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $632 million, reflecting the impact of strong pricing, which more than offset higher input costs. Potash also benefited from higher prices as well as the transition to Esterhazy K3 and the elimination of brine inflow management costs. As a result, segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $651 million.\nIn Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $233 million as the team capitalized on a strong market environment and its inventory position, particularly towards the end of the quarter as seasonal demand began to pick up. Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending well beyond 2022. The year began with a tight agricultural market and elevated prices, reflecting a 20-year low in global grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has exacerbated the situation and pushed soft commodity prices even higher. Together, these 2 countries account for 16% of global grain and oilseed export market. With Ukraine's planting season now at risk in the coming year, and Russian crop export potentially also being constrained, the market is grappling with the potential of reduced supply of a number of key crops, which includes wheat and corn, but also oilseeds like soybeans, sunflowers and their respective oil.\nThis situation has amplified food security concerns and is resulting in protectionist government policies that will likely drive commodity prices even higher. As an example, last week, Indonesia placed a temporary ban on exports of palm oil, one of the most commonly used cooking oils in the world, to ensure domestic supply. All of this suggests elevated crop prices are likely to persist for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.\nThe strength in crop prices, combined with global fertilizer industry supply constraints, have pushed nutrient prices higher. In potash, sanctions against Belarus and uncertainty over Russian exports are having an impact on supply. Global prices have pushed higher as buyers look to secure adequate volumes. The global phosphate market has also priced in uncertainty around Russian supply of both finished products and inputs like ammonia and sulfur, though we are seeing some movement of Russian phosphates today.\nIn addition, China's export restrictions remain in place. While we expect an easing of China's restrictions, we believe phosphate exports will drift lower over time as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side, from chemicals and electric vehicle lithium iron phosphate batteries.\nOn the demand side, we expect global shipments of potash and phosphates to be down from 2021, but the cause of this is availability, not affordability. Consumption will be forced to adjust to available supply.\nIn North America, weather is indicating the possibility of a compressed application season, but growers remain incentivized to maximize yield. Today's crop prices more than offset input cost, which suggests that farmer profitability in 2022 will be at the second highest level in more than a decade.\nSimilarly, grower economics have also improved in Brazil, thanks to rising soybean prices. In India, farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong, thanks to another good monsoon season and strong global grain prices, but availability is still lagging. In response to stronger grower demand and historically low domestic inventories, last week, the government increased fertilizer subsidies. We see this as a positive development that should help to meet some, but likely not all of India's significant pent-up demand.\nAs we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain very optimistic. In potash, K3's ramp-up to the initially targeted 5.5 million tonnes per year is now complete. Logistical constraints and winter weather impacted first quarter shipments and production, but these issues appear to be largely behind us.\nIn addition, Colonsay, which was down in March as rail constraints forced temporary curtailment, is now back online and operating at an expanded run rate of 1.3 million tonnes over our initial target of 1 million tonnes. In the second quarter, we expect sales volumes of 2.4 million to 2.6 million tonnes. Realized prices in the second quarter are expected to be $40 to $60 per tonne, higher than realized prices in the first quarter.\nIn phosphates, we expect a recovery in volumes in 2022. Raw material costs have escalated, but we are well supplied to meet our production targets. In ammonia, we continue to benefit from a significant cost advantage, thanks to our internal production at Faustina and our supply agreement with CF Industries. In the first quarter, 80% of our ammonia needs were met by tonnes linked directly to Henry Hub (inaudible) and shielded from the price swings in the global ammonia market. As a result, our first quarter ammonia costs were roughly half of the benchmark prices.\nIn the second quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes. Our expected sales volumes reflect an improvement in logistics delays, somewhat offset by inventories well below historic levels. Second quarter phosphate prices on an FOB basis are expected to be $140 to $160 per tonne higher than first quarter prices. Price increases in the quarter are expected to significantly outpace the impact of higher raw material prices on our cost structure.\nFor Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformational efforts over the last 2 years. Seasonal demand began picking up late in the first quarter and should continue through the (inaudible) season. We expect to benefit as potash inventories, which were built during the fourth quarter, begin shipping to customers. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact.\nGiven the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key part of our strategy. We continue to expect returning up to 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, including the $463 million returned in the first quarter of 2022. We completed the $400 million accelerated share repurchase program announced last quarter and continue to repurchase shares through our existing authorization. As a reminder, last quarter, our Board also approved a new $1 billion authorization.\nIn the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Part of that target was met with the retirement of $450 million last year, and we expect to reach the finish line later this year when another $550 million of long-term debt reaches maturity. Given our outlook for the year, we expect we'll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business. We seek out high-returning, modest investments in areas like enlarging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials and investments in soil health and biologics.\nWith recent disruptions to global fertilizer supply, a situation we believe could extend for some time, we are also actively exploring debottlenecking opportunities to increase our fertilizer production as quickly as possible. In potash, we've already raised Colonsay's annual run rate to 1.3 million tonnes, up from our initial restart target of 1 million tonnes, and we see a path to reach 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes in the second half of 2023 through the restart of Colonsay's second mill.\nAt Esterhazy, we are exploring the debottlenecking of the mills, which could add several hundred thousand tonnes by the second half of next year. In total, these initiatives could add roughly 1.5 million tonnes of potash production by the end of 2023. The cost for all these projects is expected to be less than $100 million.\nIn North American phosphates, we expect production to be roughly 1 million tonnes higher than the 2021 production total of 7.3 million tonnes as headwinds experienced last year are addressed and our assets run at more normal rates. In Brazil, we are pushing for improved recovery from our phosphate mines and we're exploring the expansion of our quarry mine that increases production and extends its life.\nIn total, when one considers our footprint in North America, our production in Brazil and our allocation of Ma'aden's finished product, by the end of 2023, we have the potential to see operating rates close to 25 million tonnes of total finished product well above our 2021 production total of 19.7 million tonnes.\nWe take our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs very seriously. We believe the geopolitical issues that have impacted global supply during the first quarter will not be reversed anytime soon. As a result, we are pulling every lever we have to efficiently raise our production rates to help offset the supply shortages from other sources in ways that also creates value for shareholders.\nWith that, let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call."

Adjusted EBITDA total one point three billion up 78% from the prior year. As pricing increased output from K three and the reate colonza largely mitigated the closure at K one and K two.\nIn Brazil, Mosaic fer isantte's generated adjusted EBITDA of $821 million, up 74% from the prior year. As a team capitalized on strong demand, a trend that we expected and drove our decision to acquire fer iste's four years ago. In 2021, Mosaic fer isantte's was able to achieve its $200 million transformational EBITDA improvement target over a year ahead of sched.\nThese results highlight the decisions we've made over the last decade that have strengthened the business. Most significant has been the construction of K three which, at full capacity, will be one of the largest, most efficient and automated potash mines in the world.\nAssuming a net investment consistent with what we discussed at our 2019 Analyst day at today's prices. K three's payback period can be measured in months rather than the year.\nAlso in potash. We successfully restarted konza and reached our targeted annual run rate of one million tons during the fourth quarter. falonza's fourth quarter cash costs averaged $85 per ton, well below our preidle cost of $100 a ton, despite higher price-driven taxes and royalty.\nIn Brazil. Our acquisition of Mosaic fertlisontes in 2018, followed by the team's transformational work to improve margins, has driven significant shareholder valueat the time of the transaction, pro forma EBITDA was less than 70 million. Our 2021 results show that we've been able to optimize that business through integration and transformational, share gains and co-product sale.\nIn our phosphate business performance products primarily higher, larger microentials now account for more than 40% of the segment's finish products salesquality.\nAll of these decisions, combined with strong execution, put us in a position to benefit from 2000 and y one's favorable map market backdrop and improve Mosaic's financial position. In 2021, Mosaic retired $450 million of long-term debt, raised the annual dividend by 50% and repurchas nearly half a billion dollars in share.\nLooking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending through 2022. global demand for grain and oil seeds remains high, while stock to use ratios are at the lowest point in more than a.\nFood security concerns and rising biofuel consumption are driving demand for con and soybean, as well as rice wheat coffee, aloil and other agricultural commodities. These dynamics are sustaining agricultural commodity price.\nIt's the strength in crop markets combined with global industry supply constraints that have pushed fertilizer prices higher. Global supply disruptions from 2021 are expected to continue impacting the global market in 2022. in potash sanctions against Belarus are beginning to have a profound impact on supply. Global buyers are beginning to acknowledge this, including India China, which both signed contracts with campacx at $590 per ton to ensure they have adequate supply for 2022.\nIn phosphates. The secular shift of China's supply away from exports towards D agriculture and industrial consumption is expected to outlast the short-term export band currently in place. Over time, we believe domestic demand will drive China's phosphate exports lower as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side from chemicals and electric vehics lithium iron, phosphate, batteries.\nGlobally strong demand over the last 18 months resulted in many producers delaying maintenance downtime to meet customer needs which will have to be addressed at some.\nOn the demand side, farmer economics in most global growing regions remains construct.\nInflation and input costs are impacting profitability, but recent increases in crop prices are improving armor economics for 2022, even if that estimated profitability remains below the 2021 record level.\nAs we head into North American springpl.\nWe are seeing normal buyer behavior as demand continues to reflect strong underlying crop prices.

When combined with Bell plane and a full year of production from konate, we expect higher production in 2022, with production costs trending lower as the year forest.\nIn the first quarter we expect sales volume of one point eight to two million tons, with average realized FOB prices more than $125 per ton higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter.\nIn fohospstates. We also expect a recoverying volume in 2022 following last year's production curtailments related to sulfur shortage in the second quarter and Hurricane Ida in the third and fourth quarter.\nWe expect to see input cost inflation in 2022, especially related to our open market purchases of slfur pammonia. But in ammonia we continue to benefit from two thirds of our needs being met by internal production and our supply agreement with DF industries. In the first quarter we expect phosphate sales volumes of one point six to one point eight million tons. Our expected sales volumes reflects supply chain constraints as well as low inventories at this part of the year because of Hurricane AIDA. Average realized ffob prices are expected to be more than $60 per ton higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter, somewhat offset by higher input costs.\nFor Mosaic fertilisontes we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformation efforts.

We plan to exhaust the remaining portion of that authorization throughoutopen the market.\nAs a result, Mosaic's Board has approved a new $1 billion repurchase authorization, which goes into effect after the current program is completed.\nThe ASR and our new authorization together represent about 8% of our market capitalization.\nCombining both authorizations represents approximately 12% of our current market.\nIn addition to share repurchases, mosa's bore has also approved raising the regular annual dividend from 45 cents to 60 cents per share, beginning in the second quarter. This is the third regular dividend hike in the last 12 months and reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the.\nIn the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 million. Last year, we retired $450 million, which leaves 550 million left towards our ultimate goal. This coincides with 550 million of long-term debt the matures later this year.\nIt is also important to note that our working capital needs tend to grow as our end markets strengthen. Because of this, we have expanded our working capital lending facilities by $375 million to help us more efficiently manage our liquidity.\nGiven our outlook for the year, we expect will also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business, even as we return the majority of our capital to shareholders over the last five years, the value created by key investments like accelerated construction of K threethe acquisition of Mosaic fer lisantte and the development in growth of MicroEssentials being per itself. Looking forward, we will continue to seek out high returning investments, but our focus is not on large-scale greenfield projects. Rather, we believe that a return can be realized in areas like in larging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials and investment in soil, health and biologic.\nIn the last area, we are seeing very promising results. As an example, throughout our partnership with bioconsortia, field trials of a first-generation nitrogen fixing formulation for corn has shown promising results that we believe are as good as anything available in the market todayand we believe further development can result in a best-in-class nitrogen solution for growers in the next two years.\nWe will have exclusive rights to that product when it comes to market in the Americas, China and India de-growing regions that want to reduce their nitrogen coststhis is just one example of many partnerships, as we continue to explore roous solutions across biologicals and soil healthand we continue to do this through small, efficient investments that established exclusive rights, partnerships like with bioconsortia, or give us access to entire product portfolios, as is the case with our recent investment in plant response, a small ag technology company that develops and commercializes plant and soil health productsin total, we've invested approximately $50 million over the last two years to build the foundation for an exciting future portfolio of value-add products that our customers are asking forwe anticipate having more to share on these investments over timethese moves emphasize our commitment to disciplined capital allocation.\nWe will remain flexible in our approach, continuing to evaluate compelling opportunities that strengthen our business over the long term, optimize our balance sheet and return significant capital to sharehold.\nFinally a discussion of the future of our business would be incomplete without including an update on some of the initiatives we've taken to make sure we continue to operate sustainably. Over the last year, we've made significant progress towards our ESG performance targets, originally set in 2000 and twentyso much So that we've set even higher targets in the area of carbon emissions. Mosaic has set a target of being net zero at its Florida operations by 2030 and globally by 2000 and Forty.\nFor diversity and inclusion. We set new goals for 2030 around the issues of race, gender and community support. Our global goals ensure that our actions are purposeful, sustainable and measurable as we seek to operate our business, while also helping to build a more inclusive culture, were all of our employees can thrive with that. Let's move on to the qa portion of the call.\nThanks jock. Before we open lines the live qa, we're going to address some of the most common questions we receive. Last night, after our materials will released. To speed things along, we won't identify each individual analysts because many subminitted.\nOur first question is on the issue of the potdash market in mller roes. How should investors think about the impact of sanctions on the global market?\nThank you. First, the panash market was already tight before any sanctions came into place. Higher crop prices, higher demand for fertilizzer globally as led to a tightness in this market that was driving higher prices before the bellerussian S.\nberussian sanctions have simply exacerbated and made the tightness more serious in terms of the length of the sanctions, we really don't know and there's no obvious immediate resolution to that issue right now, But of maybe a regime change. I CAn't see how that issue is going to be resolved.\nIn terms of the shortfall we believe it could be anywhere from a few million tons in the best case scenario to as much as.\neight million tons if the sanctions remain all through the year. Our base case we're working on right now is that there will be about a four million ton deficit this year.\nNow the best evidence for this from our perspective is not what we see, But what our buyers are saying. Our buyers are signaling that this issue could be longer lasting than some of our producers have suggested. India and China both signed 2022 contracts at $590 for longer durations in the previous six -month contracts, and we are hearing similar sentiment from our other global customers. They cannot get the tonnage and if they can, there is no method to pay for with U say.\nSo it's fair to assume that every producer is likely already evaluating every economic ton that they can get out to the market, including us. But remember, in addition to maximizing an increasing tonnage, we cannot forget about the supply chain.\nSubstantially increase our logistics capability. Producers will need more railcars or port capacity, and all of this takes time andcap.\nFollow question on this issue: how much can Mosaic raise volumes to help to overgap? Specifically, what run rates are you targeting? Is there any potential upside in the near?\nAnd thank you.\nBefore the sanctions Mosaic,' targeted run rate by the end of the first quarter was about 10 and a half million tons and let me just quickly give you the breakup of that. esther hazy, in its existing form we believe can run a consistent, sustainable five and a half million.\nBell plane around three million.\nblonzsay. Before the shutdown was running someumwhere around one to one and a half million tons, and we will find the right spot for that this year. That gives us an MLP tonnage of around nine and a half to 10 million tons available today, and then K meaggot, just a little over 700 thousand tons, takes our total to about 10 and a half million tons of sustainable production capabilility.\nSo as we look forward, what can we do to push?\nOur capabilities. We know we have some latent capacity at konz and we're looking right now at how we can do a little extra development, put for mining panels into place that we're shut down a few years ago. In terms of K three.\nThe run rate of five and a five million tonns. We think we could run a little more than that and that'will play out as we start getting more and more mining areas running and we get the eleventh minor in position. The other issue: at Este, rhazy we think we think there's some pretty good debotlenecking projects that we are already studying and we believe some of those will lead to a little better tonnage coming out of Esterhazy. In terms of Bell plane, we believe it's running pretty much at its maximum right now. So the easy tonnages will come from debotlenecking palonza, getting more miners into higher production panels and then pushing K three and doing the small debotlenecking projects that come at the end of a allong capital.\nJack the next issue was on the broader phospate market and China.\nHow much will China export this year? Could that export? pandy lifted earlier.\nThank you.\nWe think China exports could be down as much as two and a half million tons this year to about nine million tons.\nWe do expect that the ban could be lifted as early as the ending of the planting season, and we have to expect that at today's prices. It wouldn't be surprising to see China's producers try to benefit from that high price environment.\nBut we do think that annual exports are going to continue to trend lower over time, that cular domestic demand in China will pull increasingly large amounts of phosphates away from the export market. And we cannot ignore industrial use.\nBattery growth and domestic fertilizers will take precedence over exports, and we expect the Chinese government will continue to force suppliers to prioritize domestic demand.\nOur next question focuses on farmer economics, and I think this one's for youend.\nAr G economic.\nNow at the point where nutrient demand destruction is a real threat.\nToday's prices around all major growing regions, we are saying pharmace. Economics and affordability are very.\nIn the it is. It is probably lower than last year's level. It is far above the historical average. In North America we are saying customers and farmers behavior are at normal as the price sprint season in Brazil, especially over the last few weeks, as So the impriced R, we are saying very strong customer and buying happening in the country. And in India we expect the government is going to do again a readjacks to their subty level in order to support their farmers demand to prfate and pash, as they did last yearif there is any stretch to the consumptional demand, it is probably because of lacking of availability: cross goals of souofate and pash and the global demand if there, if the TS are available.\nJack we've received quite a few questions on phosphate- first quarter guide.\none point six to one point eight million ton seems like compared.\nWhat's happening. There is the lower sales volume guidance due to operational issues or due to demand destruction and buyers.\nWell Thank you. In terms of our expected volumes for quarter 1, I think there's really two big issues we have to consider when we look at our sales volume. The first, of all us is actually quarter 4: were Hurricane Ida and subsequent repair events impacted of the beginning of the fourth quarter and left us with very low inventories entering this year which, of course, tends to contribute to first quarter sales?\nIn terms of the other issue, from our perspective it's really the logistics. COVID-19 and winter weather are having a major impact on the supply chain, including rail, ocean freight portz and trucking withjust.\nThe industry is seeing delays throughout the system and that's contributing to the lower than historical sales volume. Guidance: just as an example: rail alone: this year we're seeing about a 20% to 30% increase in cycle time for our trains and you can expect that to have a big impact on revrac at the very end of the quarter. That said, we expect our annual sales to be in line with historic. Arms for phosphates: delayed shipments due to supply chain issues.\nWe'll resolve themselves as we come out of the winter weather and we get through this last wave of COVID-19, though we will see those come in the next quarter or two.\nThe thing I would emphasize is we're seeing normal buyer behavior. Yes, nutrient prices are up. The crop prices more than offset that and point to a very good year for grow profitability. Even if it's a small step back from the 2021 levels, we expect crop prices to continue to incentiize farmers to apply fertilizer as they nor.\nquint. Our last two questions are for you.\nThe first set is on working capital. You add some color around working capital. What you anticipate needs to be in 2020 two.\nThanks Paul. So I think, as everyone knows, our business is highly seasonal and we can experience pretty significant working capital changes throughout the year, and over the last couple of years we have put in new working capital facilities. Help us manage through me some of that, some of that seasonal dynamic.\nAnd the current pricing environment in the environment that we've been in and the rate of change that we've seen.\nThat just amplifies those seasonal working capital moves. And so, you know, more recently we've upsized some of our working capital lines to better align our options and our tools to the needs of the business.\nJust to give you a sincese. As we look at the second half of last year, our core working capital needs were up well over billion dollars and the majority of that was in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2022, I think any incremental working capital needs are likely to be dictated by the pricing environment that we see. To the extent that the pricing environment moderates in the rate of change moderates, then I think the working capital incremental needs will moderate. But if we do see a continuation of what we've seen in the last six months, I think we could expect to see increasing working capital require.\nClint. Our final question is on our capital allocation strategy.\nSeem to be prioritizing share repurchases over other.\nZack correct.\nAnd what are those other uses, and is it possible to do it all, given our commitment to return up to 75% of our free cash?\nThanks Paul. As we look forward to the balance of 2022, we expect to generate a significant amount of earnings and cash.\nAnd as we think about capital allocation for this year, we intend to continue strengthening both our business and our balance sheet by continuing to invest in high return and opportunistic investments and paying down debt.\nBut we think we can do those things and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders this year within the construct that we've outlined.\nToday we announce an increase in our dividend for this year and going forward, as well as buyback using an ASR tool. As we go through the balance of the year, we intend to remain disciplined and nimble and look at different ways of returning capital to our shareholders, but our current priority is on buybacks. We look at our share price where it is and we think that it is compelling given the environment that we see. So that's our priority today, but again, we intend to remain flexible as we go through.\nThanks Clint. That wraps up the firesight chat portion of this call. I would now like to turn it over to the audience for yourquest.\nAz her.\nAsk a question you will need the press for a woman you.\nwewithdraw your question, just P.\nLimit yourself.\nFirst questionion comes a line of John Robert.\nIn your life.\nThank you. I assume in Brazil that the competitive distributors are significantly exposed to Russian and Ukrainian potash if they have to, if they have trouble sourcing poct or if few competition as trouble scing potash, does that also impact their ability to cross-sell other inputs? That is, if farmers have to turn to fertiilizantes for potash, are you likely to pick up the other inputs as well?\nYeah thanks John certainly that would offer an opportunity to us. But I suspect what'will happen is that actually the blends will probably be adjusted for less potash. If there's actual pot ash shortages and we do believe there will be a real risk of pot ash shortages. The Brazil market know should be fairly good. They've been delayed by rain and etcter so far but we believe this will be a good market. So we do expect it's going to be very tight for potash as the.\nFull impact of the sanctions really comes home to roost, if you will. So yes, we may pick up a little bit, but I don't think it'll be because of the glend.\nOpportunity versus others. I think it'll just be because of people trying to get hold of potash.\nOur next question comes lyami jeel.\nBmo capital markets.\nBy good morning if B.\nIf uh, nutrient decided that some of these issues around dolls, BC or perciistants and they wanted to really unidol there are millions of access ton highera bunch of moners into satchew in and really ramp up their volumes, would you be supportive of that? What I mean is: and campa tex, obviously you would get. You should get your proata faales share. If nutrient can have millions to ton to their production and you cannot, you would not get. You would have to refuse the ability to produce your proorata and give it to nutrient. Would be supportive of that? Would you see to renegotiate a little bit how cathpa work?\nI don't want to be in any way a base of Joel and good morning. But I cannot answer a question and about confidential negotiations that would happen within campax. So I think you can only wait to see what happens this year to know now having said that I will say one thing. We have been flexible in the past this year well aware including last year when we had an inability to produce we.\nAsked and allowed nutrient to produce the gap which they helped fill. So obviously we are all very concerned and interested in supporting our customers globally.\nSo to do that there will be an element of flexibility. But I CAn't speak specifically but.\nNext question cooff the line of Chris Parkinson from his.\nGreat Thank you very much. You've done a pretty solid job of over the past, for years, completing trrhaz, eumminating brand inflowcosts and now it appears Colin say has had a nice gap down the cash costs post the issues you'were facing in last year. So when we kind of take a look at this year under the context of current contract spot pricing, higher operating rates, transportation costs and even the Canadian resource tax, if we just take a step back and just look at where you ultimately think the gross margins should be for this year and perhaps just any additional considerations we should also have for 2023? Thank you.\nOkay Thank you, Chris.\nI guess you've got to look at this in two ways. What's the cash margin and what's the.\nWhat's the gross margin after depreciation? Let me just talk about cash for a moment and I'm going to be pretty general here. But you know, if you look at right now for standard, we have a contract through campex for $590 a ton.\nI think you can pretty much make estimates. You know we've announced konzate being $85 a ton. The others are significantly lower than that and put around number on transport, which is easy to do, I think you come up with a.\nYou know, quite frankly, a gross margin, a cash margin, that is at least 50%.\nThe next question cross the line of ad Adam seamblesman from goldmansach.\nahyes, Thank you. Good morning, I was hookp. You could ll give a little more color on the psphate operating cost environment. Obviously inputs that have risen here- way you frame deapt- should be margins. They have declined as a result. boo, in the market outlook check you didn't provide any specific cost guidance and phosphate for the first quarter that you sometimes do or have done in the past. Ity color there and maybe just be the quick follow-up to that last question. dack on the cash margins for ptash. That's 50% before, after the resource.\nWell we're enough. We call resource taxes and royalties part of our cash costs. So we're sooring when you want to correct that, if time. Yeah, So in calculating our cash cost per ton, we do include Royal.\nNoding.\nI think our other Canadian producer does not include royalties either.\nThey call.\nBut there are some inconsistencies between the two of us, but I would say that both of those are in our EBIT.\nAnd do recognize the resource. Tax is quite significant.\nSo in terms of.\nFlorida cost, if you will, for phosphates. The way you can look at it is, first of all, are.\nAverage ammonia costwhich.\nyouknow if we pay 20% of.\nFor.\n20% of the cost per ton of ammonia goes into. So ammonia cost $600. You can times at by zer two and that's the cost inside that, though right now you know, market ammonia is probably in the range of Jenny.\n$1 thousand. So that adds about 200 plus dollars per ton to the cost of making phosphates. Now, recognize our cost are significantly lower than that because two thirds of ours is on a natural gas basis. So for our competitors call it $250 per ton, for us probably more and half. That range would be the right number in terms of sulfphur 40%. So sulfur prices $300 than you know. Your cost in making DAF is probably $120 per ton. So you could, you could look at that for our competitors being a total cost of, you know, up to three hundreddollars extra a ton and for us probably 220 or something in that.\nNext question comes to line of Steve.\nFrom Bank of America.\nYes Jack, I want to ask you maybe a two part question, fer lisanttes, and then the first one being these co-product sales. Is that the gypsum, or you know you have some titanium and overburened there. What's driving that, the co-product sales? And then maybe a higher level question on fer laisants is: where do you think you can take that business from here? Is the opportunity in expanding your domestic production there or being able to increase, you know, more imports with port expansions? Where doyou, where do you see the most opportunity in fer laiszantte?\nokayso first coproduct sales I think you're absolutely right. The majority of the co-product sales is likely the sale of gysum but there's a number of co-products whether they be produced from some of our wastewater streams or whatever. But we sold last year. I think over $400 million of coproducts with a pretty health the margin because the cost of these of course is very low. So you we feel that's a pretty attractive place and of course when you sell gysum that' gystacks you. Don 't have to make in the future. So again big piece of thebe long-term business improvement will be those sales of coproducts and particularly the sale of gypsum in terms of moving this business forward. You're right there's a number of opportunities. I think there is a number of new opportunities for co-products in particularly when you look at.\nTitan.\nniopium.\nAnd whatnot that is naturally in our ore and is made by our neighbors. At least are neighbors at catalo. The other areas IP is distribution and distribution particularly as you go to the North West part of the country. So Northwest part of monteroso and heading into what we call the montapto States which are the Northern States South of the Amazon. But in the Western side of the country we believe the distribution opportunity there is high. We are looking very seriously about how we.\nAnd.\nGet a bigger piece of that, how we can participate more in that. So distribution one area co-products, new products and, of course, if we can debotleneck or improve our existing operations, that's another great area for.\nTaking advantage of what is a great Mark.\nThe next question crosses the line of Vincent and who's for Morgan down.\nBut I thank you and morourning everyone. jock, I was wondering if you talk a bit about regional phosphate prices and just a gap that exists between- uh, you know, India and the rest of the world basically, and you know how you envision that evolving through the course of the year, whether you know how it will converge or if it will converge. Thank you.\nYeah okay thanks, vinson. I'm going to start off but I'm going it over, tojny. But I think what you be fair to say is you know when the demand started really picking up this year, India was the first to respond and you know, in the, in the typical winter lull, North American prices probably lagged, but those are quickly catching up as we get closer to the North American spring. But let me let jenjnie talk a little bit about price disparity around the world and what that.\nYes you mentioneddue to the very low inimport India. Last year we saw the pent up demand and for sure that was realized in the first to months of the year and the India basically paid vapp price up to 920 V cent. I think you referred to the gap between India and the rest of the world and with the prices riilot in Brazil over the last few weeks we saw the Brazilian be also stpped into the market. Up to yestertoday the gap between Brazil fate to India a very close. We saw the price of mapp in Brazil already rach to over to $900 per time and similarly to noa. We saw some seasonal price lows and over the last two weeks that price has resbonded and we saw the shrinking of the price gap between noa and India as well. Overall we see a pretty much strong demand supported by the farm economics and also pent up demand. India and in that case of China as well. We see the fundamental of the firstast big market is going to continue to be tied and the price level is going to stay at the adeleate.\nAnd let me just highlight: in North America we don't participate in those.\nFluctuations of price that occur when the traders start trading of the Gulf. We kept our price list constant through that and very quickly, once the pricing windows ended, prices came up to ourprice.\nQuestion comes the line of Michael pike kenin from Cleveland research she I.\nYeah good morning. M just wanted to get a sense, you know, in terms of your longer term expectations for India's ability to continue to afford, you know, fertilizer. I know that they raise their subsidies but uh, you know, it seems like prices are going up at a pretty fast rate. You, how do you sort of see India's demand evolving more the next several years, not just in 2022, where they need to restock?\nLook I think India, you know. This becomes more than a simple problem for a country like India, with 700 people living in basic poverty and relying on the agricultural economy.\nYou know, the Modi government needs to be respondsive to those people So they have a tight balance to keep food security and food affordability for their population and also keep their farmers able to be profitable So that they keep farming. So you know, our expectation is that India will continue to bread that or walk that tight rope as best they can. So they will have to respond to global price.\nThey will have to make sure they get the fertilizer they need and we're seeing that right now. I mean with the fast settlement of their potash and the at 590. they were the first to settle with campac quite early and I think that reflects the pent up demand that they need to make sure gets out to their farmers. And then we just talk about, you know, their willingness to pay $930 for or $920 for phosphates. So we're seeing.\nThe buyer response. We know the government will have to either help with food subsidies or with fertilizer subsidies to keep that balance and I know, when it comes down, if food Securities are going to do what they have to do to make sure that work.\nAnd that's long term manshort.\nNext question comes to line of Andrew Wong from R B, C capital.\nGood morning. So just a couple of questions herefor some phillzon p. can you just talk about why the flyirrock and conversion costs continue to move up through the year? Is that multi-due to local inflation? And what's the expected run rate at the current affects rates for this year and going for? And then maybe a second question, probably more for clent Mosaic: as a very complicated business that's across multiple geographies and product l and may can be difficult to non model out. Some of the varabilities are on the quarters and even maybe for the year. Is there any thought on providing some more specific guidance, such as maybe including for the lavantpes in the kind of quarterly notoutlook guidance or maybe even guing to like a specific EBITDA line?\nOkay thanks Andrew, and I will leave. I will leave the tougher guidance question to Clint, because that's only fair.\nLet me start with fer isante and the cost structure for laisonte's. There's a lot of factors, I think, that are impacting fer isante' right now. I mean the first of it is, as you mentioned, is inflation, and if you look at U's dollars is probably easier to see where that's been not as severe as what it might look like. But Brazil's probably seeing in industrial inflation somewhere in that 15 to 20% this year and that's having a real day-to day impact on cost structures.\nThe other thing that has hurt Brazil in the last while, of course, is COVID-19. It has made it a lot more difficult to do mechanical or maintenance turnarounds. It's made getting.\nSupply chain, people in place, et cetera, et cetera. So you know there's maintenance that takes longer, just a lot of little niggly things that come with the people problems and the COVID-19 problems. And then there's, of course, supply chain issues- getting materials- and when you get materials are more expensive. So all of those things are impacting. We think that.\nLong-term U's dollar and U's dollar to Brazilian rei will be offset with the inflation rates. So in other words, if the inflation kee higher than U's, it will probably be equalized by exchange rate.\nAnd the other issues should go away with the COVID-19 and whatnot, as they sort of returned more normal.\nNext question on the line to my Andrew.\nBut.\nSorry the operator, we still have the second part of that question.\nYeah I Andrew, this is cllaent, and thanks for your question on guidance. You not think, as we've spoken about before you, one of the challenging things about providing?\nSpecific earnings. Guidance is just you know how quickly andimmaterially prices can change in that.\nChange our expectations. Now I outlook for the year, But what we have tried to do is to provide a framework, provide areas of our cost structure, of our spend and so forth that can be helpful in modeling the company. I know that Paul and I have.\nBeen speaking particularly about fertillazanchase and is there some more information and in detail we would provide around that business to help investors understanding and model that business better. So I think that's that is an ongoing conversation. interireally. I would expect this to put a little bit more focus on that as time goes on and if there are other areas that you would find particularly helpful and understanding some of the complexity. Certainly we opened up to those discussions and to get.\nThanks operator. Can we move to that?\nHere next question comes to line of Adrian kamano from.\nOut the mordening and what aequestional fo is if think you can cheject that you would be able to reach ound numbervel of unions for the free get way to.\nWas the streates St. there are some Mo actions to conver the IMP of surprise and proto life. For if you was suing that the market would normalize a from point PR.\nYeah it could be later to move projects that do formce that you.\nI'm sorry I've got such a static yely here. I only I didn't catch most of that.\nWe try repeating that later.\nYeah a trgg.\nQuestioning: is the fuar get force trade easily piding just in comization of the market in terms of betrating, or can companyive if tory?\nOptions to come.\nI sort of got phosphate and market but I was but all I've really got.\nOkay maybe Adrian, maybe we can let Paul talk to you after this. I'm sorry we the connection was so bad. We really didn't hear of that well at all. So maybe Paul, you can contact Paul and we can talk. Thank you sorry.\nLast question comes from the line of Jeff, the kclass from GP Morgan.\nThanks very much. Do you expect the global phosphate market to tighten in 2023, or to loosen, or you?\nThanks Jeff. I'm going to let Jenny talk a little bit about this, but let me start off by saying you, as we look at this, over the next, let's say, three to five years and even short term- short term, we expect China's exports to be lower, which should lead to tightness in the next little while, and as we look forward from that, assuming the market continues to grow at the normal rates, we don't have any big projects coming forward that we think are going to.\nGoing to fill that gap So we see it tight this year and assuming our Chinese estimates are correct continuing tight for the next four or five years even and then as we look at the evolution of industrial uses for phosphates and we talk about lithium iron phosphate batteries in particular. But as we as we move into those other uses for phosphates particularly in China we do expect long term that the Chinese exports will continue to decline and that.\nNew project.\nThat aren't haven't been to called yet and take four or five years. We'll have to fill that gap jny, anything else?\nOkay So Jenny's.\nOkay.\nLooked with that. I will conclude our call here by reiterating some of our key messages.\nMosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021, driven by very strong agricultural and fertilizer Mark.\nAnd by leveraging the value we have created through major investments and cost restructuring.\nWe look forward to returning much of that value that we created to our shareholders.\nThrough the accelerated share repurchase, our new repurchase authorization and an increased dividend target.\nAnd with continue high levels of global fertilizer demand and ongoing tight supplies in both potash and phosphates, we expect another year of very strong value creation in 2020.\nThank you for your call, for the call and how a great.\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's country.\nThank you for participating. You may not."

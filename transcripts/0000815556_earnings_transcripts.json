My name is Serge and I'll be your coordinator for today's event. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to hand the call over to Michiel Langezaal, CEO. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMichiel Langezaal\n\nFounder, CEO & Chairman of Management Board\n\nThank you, operator. I'd like to extend a warm welcome to everyone on this call as well as to those joining via webcast. You can find a copy of the presentation used during this call on our Investor Relations website found at ir.fastnedcharging.com.\nMoving to Slide 1, the Title Page. Hopefully, everyone has that in front of them now. As always, I'd like to use the cover to show something I'm really proud of. This quarter, it is the opening of our 2 stations at Gentbrugge, on the route from Amsterdam to Paris roughly in the middle. Two large charging stations with 16 chargers for cars each and a separate charging area for trucks.\nOn top of this, you will find there a fully branded large Fastned restaurants. The road next to it has some 50,000 cars passing by each day on either side to ensure great station economics. Already today, after just being open for a few weeks, we see more than 100 sessions and even more shop visitors per day than only growing from there on. But there's more to this flagship location. It is the first zero emissions service area that was standard out and built in Europe.\nAn important development to ensure ample space is made available for charging along the motorway. This instead of just adding a charger or 2 to an existing petrol station, which unfortunately is still happening way too often. Logically, I'm very proud that Fastned was able to win this important first tender and was among the parties that helped shaping it. This not only gives us a several decade-long investment horizon on the strategic location. It also gives us tools to work with governments across Europe to accelerate the build-out of our network. And there's more to come.\nMoving to Slide 2. With reference to the information provided in these slides and discussed during this call, please take note of the disclaimer. Moving to Slide 3. My name is Michiel Langezaal. I'm the CEO and one of the founders of Fastned. Normally, Victor Van Dijk, our CFO, is with me on this call presenting this webcast together. Unfortunately, Victor is on a temporary leave of absence and is unable to join us today. So it will be just me presenting this. For the Q&A, I'm accompanied by our Head of Investor Relations, Patricia Alam, who many of you already know. So warm welcome to Patricia.\nToday, I will take you through the highlights for Fastned during the third quarter of 2025. And I can tell you there is a lot to talk about. Logically, we will discuss the latest top line results An update on network growth and electric vehicle sales is also on the agenda. And as always, we will discuss station performance for the quarter. After the presentation, we will be happy to answer your questions. If possible, please limit them to 2 questions per analyst so we can give everybody the opportunity. We've scheduled this call to last for 1 hour.\nSo let's get started. The following slide presents the highlights of the third quarter of 2025. Starting with growth. We are continuing to deliver strong profitable growth growth that tracks the rise in electric vehicle adoption and revenues of EUR 31.5 million set a new quarterly high for Fastned, up 44% year-on-year. And this is no small feat especially in a market that showed a temporary shift in the balance of supply and demand to the supply side over the last 2 years.\nMoreover, and something we discussed in our calls previously, a market with some new entrants, significantly discounting prices in attempts to boost station utilization, yet Fastned continues to win. Energy delivered was up 32% year-on-year to 46.8 gigawatt hour, which compares to an increase in EV stock of 30%. And so we roughly grow with our fair share of kilowatt hours sold, but revenue related to charging grew by 44% year-on-year, significantly outgrowing the market. This is an important and unique differentiator. We have great pricing, fair but with a decent margin.\nWe have good sales volumes that grow fast like the EV market. So we have both. We're not just putting down chargers. We're building a sustainable, profitable charging business. Our gross profit growth, up 40%, clearly demonstrates the fast growth of solar power. With solar prices dropping sometimes even negatively during mid-day hours on sunny summer days. Most people use their cars during daytime when the sun is out. and fast charging when needed is happening in that same period of time.\nSo the takeoff profile of our fast-charging stations quite nicely follows the SUNS radiation curve. This feat allows Fastned to benefit from fast-growing solar generation capacity and low or even negatively negative energy prices.\nOur network at the end of the quarter encompassed a total of 380 stations, and we are extremely proud of our construction achievements, but we're not resting on our laurels. We're acutely aware of the ambitious goals we've set, reaching 1,000 stations by 2030 means ramping up our build base to 100 and eventually 150 stations per year.\nOn top of this challenge comes the fact that we are constructing much larger, more complex stations, which demand more from our teams and our contractors. The average station size has grown from 4 charge positions on average to more than 6 nowadays, representing a 50% growth in capacity deployed. We're also accelerating the rollout of retail facilities, offering coffee, sandwiches and toilets at our sites. While these don't add to our station count -- they are vital to our customer experience. But at the same time, they ask a lot extra from our construction teams.\nJust think about the build of the 2 shops we've seen on the title page. Those 2 shops alone are the work for several people for full year. So yes, we are proud of our progress and our results this quarter, but we also recognize the road ahead. As we start 2026, we'll have less than 600 stations to go to reach our 1,000 station targets by 2030. That requires a sustained build base of 100 to 150 stations per year. Our teams are focused on this. In this fourth quarter, we will be delivering at an annualized build base of above 100 stations. Our aim is to maintain and grow this momentum quarter after quarter. I'll share more details on this later on.\nTurning to site acquisition. End of the quarter, we had a total of 624 locations in our portfolio, of which 380 are operational today and 244 under development. With our acquisition pace now consistently above 100 locations per year, we are firmly on track to meet our 2030 goal. A particularly point of price this quarter, the opening of our very first 2 stations in Spain. Fastned is now active in 9 countries with each in-country team having people for the scouting and developing of locations, people to design our stations, people to manage construction and people to maintain our stations. This setup is to ready the company for the next scale phase in our development, further accelerating our build base and allow our kilowatt hour delivery to scale with the massive BEV growth ahead of us.\nHaving scaled our organization from a leading Dutch charging network to a leading European charging company, while continuing to deliver the same reliable charging service is one of those experiences that gives our team confidence the confidence to deliver on our ambitions ahead such as scaling our build base.\nMoving towards cash. At the end of Q3, our cash position was standing at EUR 87 million. Fastned is currently issuing its third bond round for 2025, which will close at the end of this month. Concluding, we're pushing hard to deliver on the ambitious targets we've set, and we're seeing very positive momentum and continued growth. The stations we've built are delivering strong results, even in a market with slightly fewer cars than previously expected at this point in time.\nIn this context, the gap between Fastned and the competition is widening. Yes, some other companies are deploying charges quickly, like we do or sometimes even faster for periods. But none of them have stations and a concept generating revenues anywhere near ours. Several are discounting prices in an attempt to attract traffic to less desirable locations, which negatively impacts their revenue.\nMoreover, after a wave of big oil companies entering the charging markets, we're now seeing divestments and a slowdown in investment from that sector. Our status as a pure player charging company with a profitable station concept is placing us in a strong and unique position in that market. We're continuing to build our network and our competencies to thrive and lead discharging markets.\nWe're doing the hard work, the work that is needed to build charging stations on great locations to deliver a great charging experience and deliver on all these other items that make up a great charging concept. We're taking down bottlenecks. It is the hard work that leaves behind a very serious barrier to entry for others. That is part of the value we create. We remain ambitious on network growth, but we will not compromise on investment discipline. This combination is what makes Fastned unique.\nOn that note, let's move on to the next slide to talk about BEV sales. On the left, you can see that Q3 was another great quarter for EV sales with year-on-year growth in practically all markets. The sales share in Belgium grew slightly from an already very high basis. The sales share in the Netherlands was stable at roughly 1/3 of all cars sold being electric. The much larger markets, Germany, the U.K. and France made significantly larger strides moving towards or even beyond 20% of new cars sold being electric.\nThe absolute registrations, you can find at the bottom of the slide, show the impact of market size with a country like Germany registering more than 300,000 new electric cars year-to-date. Also, when adding these up, it shows that the total number of EVs in Europe is growing strong.\nIn terms of outlook, we expect to see even more. In H1 of this year, around 850,000 EVs were added to Europe's fleet. [ Schimdt ] Automotive forecasts 1.2 million more arriving in H2. So the fourth quarter of this year will be ramped up even more.\nHow does this fit the bigger picture? While earlier this year, Brussels gave OEMs some extra wiggle room on the fleet average CO2 targets. Instead of having to comply with the 95 grams fleet average per kilometer in each year over the period from 2025 onwards, they are now allowed to average for a period of 3 years. This gives them some flexibility to delay the scaling of their EV sales by some months. But make no mistake, those electric cars still need to be sold in order to deliver the same 95-gram average. And this is why more growth is expected in the months to come.\nLooking further ahead to 2030, there will be a significant step down in the target emissions with a maximum of 49 grams CO2 fleet average. To achieve this milestone, roughly half of all cars sold will need to be electric. So there's a lot more to be done. Which brings me to the 2035 road map and discussion with the European Commission and OEMs on this topic.\nMoving to the next slide. The President of ChargeUp Europe have had the privilege of sitting at the table in some of the highest level discussions shaping the transformation of one of Europe's largest industries. Our automotive sector, a sector worth hundreds of billions and with roughly 7% of GDP, representing a significant share of our continence economy.\nThe fact that we, as Fastned are at this table and not other players in our industry is a testament to our commitment to shaping the future of mobility. And to Fastned's position as a true industry leader. The photo you see on the right of the slide is what they call the family picture and was taken during my recent visits to the European Commission's Automotive Dialogue Session. But this is just one of the many moments where Fastned leadership has met with high-level officials which happens in the member states and in Brussels, each time driving the change our industry needs to deliver on its mission.\nSo when we talk about industry leadership, this is what it looks like. Now let's return to the topic of 2035 and share our perspective on the ongoing conversations in Brussels, in Germany and how the media is covering these developments, along with what is expected to move forward. To put it simply, we recognize that the European automotive industry is uneasy about the growth path ahead. Achieving 1,000 Fastned charging stations by 2030 is an ambitious goal for us, reaching electric vehicle sales, representing roughly half of the total is an equally bold target for the car industry.\nWithout a growth mindset and the right organizational culture it is a daunting challenge. When we look at these interactions, they can largely be summarized like this. The European Commission is asking the industry for ideas on how to accelerate progress and increase certainty on delivering on the targets set because, as they say, the future is electric. No matter what.\nMeanwhile, the industry is often asking for concessions and a slower base, seeking comfort and maneuvering space. So far, we've generally seen the European Commission insisting the 2035 goals will not change. While carmakers request that those goals will be watered down. Given the political situation, it is prudent for the commission to show some flexibility, but the goals remain unchanged. We see examples of this in Germany where Chancellor Mertz has declared that the future is electric and intense to open the type of incentives to boost EV demand are also negotiating for wiggle room with the commission.\nSo the future is electric. That is the stance of the car industry that is the stance of the commission and the stance of the member states. So we expect to see more incentive packages coming in order to scale BEV demand and deliver on the targets set. And yes, we most likely will see some small wiggle room provided to industry to deliver comfort. That is the summary.\nWith our team and ChargeUp Europe, we do much more on shaping our industry. Through European channels, we work on the progression of affair. The alternative fuels infrastructure regulation or simply put, the law that sets the direction for the development of Europe's charging infrastructure. Through this channel, we work on ensuring market access and competition. This is incredibly important for Fastned as without access to great sites, we cannot build charging infrastructure.\nAnd a great example during the third quarter was the visits of Commissioner Ursula, just ahead of the opening of Gentbrugge, the first zero emission service area in the European Union. This is the station I proudly showed you on the Title Page. Commissioner Ursula is responsible for the climate policy of the European Union and ensuring that Europe reaches its climate commitments. Thus, it was a significant opportunity for Fastned to convey the importance of what we do more. And for policy changes are needed to allow us to compete more freely across Europe and accelerate the mobility transformation.\nWe informed Ursula about the importance of fair competition and gave examples of issues we face in some markets, such as bundled tenders, short-term concession contracts and nontransparent administrative processes. By walking around our Gentbrugge station, we were able to show him what can be achieved when market rules are applied correctly, and the best player wins.\nMoving to Slide 7. And I think our Gentbrugge station really shows what the best means. But it's worth looking at the time line of development of a great location like this, which can stretch to several years. It all starts with initial discussions with policymakers in which we bring our experience and best practices formed over more than a decade in all our markets. This means we can bring innovative new ideas and best practices for tender processes and location design, which is exactly what we did here.\nThis was a bare patch of concrete with no mandates beyond installing some charges, and we turned it into this. Our concepts are the best in the market and give us a chance, a great chance to win key tenders like this one, the first tender for a zero emissions service area in Belgium, in Europe with a concession for 25 years. And why is this zero emissions element so important? Well, we see that governments across Europe are obliged to update their policies for motorway locations and get ready for an electric future where fossil fuels are a thing of the past.\nThis shift means there is overcapacity of petrol stations and an urgent need for more charging infrastructure, especially on highways. Zero emission service areas like Gentbrugge are important because they demonstrate the value of developing additional new electric-only service areas that deliver crucial charging capacity to the markets and decouple such developments from locations where contracts with sitting petrol station owners can delay deployments.\nAny road map to decarbonization must include a step-by-step phaseout of petrol stations, which can well be triggered by the regular concession renewals for motorway locations. And Gentbrugge is a showcase on how to progress with such road maps and should give policymakers guidance on developing their motorway service area policies in relation to this phase out. But this takes time as the time line shows, if you're not in a market for such locations now and you're not in touch with policymakers now, you will not be able to build something sizable in the period up until 2030.\nAnd speaking of Gentbrugge, with restaurants and toilets and playgrounds and fresh coffee. Does this mean we're coming bristas? No, we're not. We are working with a range of partners and developing different commercial setups to cater to different situations. So sometimes, we invest in the restaurants and work together on a revenue-sharing basis. whereby our partner operates and Fastned provides the concept.\nIn other cases, we choose to rent out the building and have a more hands-off approach. This approach gives us a pile of options, allowing us to be flexible in how we introduce our amenities to our great charging stations without falling into the trap of thinking we would also be great baristas ourselves. And this wasn't the only big opening for Fastned during Q3.\nMoving to the next slide. In September, our first 2 stations in Spain opened to electric drivers. With the official inauguration taking place just last week, this is our 9th national market and a crucial time for Spain. The market share for EVs is growing fast and reached 9.4% in June this year. So I'm extremely proud to see our iconic stations opening on a fantastic motorway location just down the road from Barcelona. But it is only a success for Fastned but it is not only a success for Fastned Spain's car industry is Europe's second largest.\nIt is a crucial contributor to the country's economy and it brings with it, many jobs. This means that embracing the transition to electric cars, the next evolution of technology is vital for Spain. And we're delighted to be bringing our expertise to the country. What is key to rolling out charging infrastructure at speed are simple, efficient tenders, long-term concessions hence the removal of bottlenecks related to grid connections and permitting.\nThe latter is the bureaucracy that can add several years to a project time line in Spain. The official inauguration was attended by dozens of guests, including many distinguished politicians and high-placed officials. Most notably, the Spanish Minister of Industry, whose speech aligns with our views on what needs to change to roll out charging infrastructure faster in Spain. So the opening of these 2 stations and having the right people at this opening is a great step forward for Fastned.\nAnd continuing with our market updates, moving to Slide 9 to talk about Germany. In Q3, we also delivered our first charging station built under the contract with Autobahn Gentbrugge, our very first charging station on the Autobahn. And yes, this station isn't as beautiful as you would expect from us. It's a lot more playing and basic. This wasn't our decision. The design was decided by the tendering authorities before hands based on German highway regulations.\nThat said, I'm incredibly proud of us for making this happen. The German motorways were until recently completely exempt from any competition, be it for fuel, for charging or for food. All of this was in the hands of Tank & Rust, which has also held back investments in charging infrastructure. With the tender to realize charging stations and motorway service areas, this will now change and Fastned is happy to be part of that. This charging station has 6 charging positions, a great addition to the charging options EV drivers have on German motorways.\nI am very proud of these results, especially given the complexity of these works in Germany. The cultural barriers to break are significant. Just like how the car industry in Germany is struggling to adopt a growth mindset One can imagine how difficult it is for a transport authority to do so and for Fastned to gain base. So lots of things to learn and improve for all actors.\nIn the coming months and year, we are gearing up the deliveries of roughly 30 such motorway locations in Germany. And that brings me to a summary. Next slide, please. Before we move on, I wanted to show how Fastned is becoming a pan-European charging network. This delivers on the accelerated plan we embarked on in 2021, to see us hit the milestone of entering the 9th country in Q3 validates our decisions to put teams in place in each of these countries. The decision to invest in scaling our organization and invest in the acceleration of our rollout base.\nScaling our company and organization while continuing to deliver that incredible quality of our charging service we are known for across 9 countries, has been a serious milestone and experience for the team and its leadership. It is in this context that we look with confidence at the challenge of further scaling our build base.\nIt is amazing to think you can drive across these 9 countries using only Fastned's renewable energy to charge. And that's what we're seeing more and more during the summer period. Our network now spans many holiday routes that can cater for it. And with long range and very fast recharging cars on the market, the EV family road trip is becoming a reality for many. Logically, we're very happy to see drivers preferring our charging stations to take their brakes and charge their cars.\nWe've seen this holiday, the seasonal holiday traffic playing a role in our great results for the quarter. So I thought that would be valuable to say a little more about this, including talking about other seasonality effects. Moving to Slide 11. With the fourth quarter coming up, it is an interesting moment to talk about this. When you look at the graphs on the slide here, there are roughly 4 important factors influencing monthly sales of our business on top of the holiday traffic we just talked about.\nThe first is the growth of our markets. with such stellar growth of the number of EVs on the road, the customer base in January is just very different to that of December. For 2025, the impact is significant. We started the year with some 6 million BEVs on European roads, adding 850,000 BEVs to this in the first 6 months, growing the fleet by 14%. And the expectation is that the fleet will grow by another 1.2 million in the second half of this year. This means that December will have some 30-plus percent more EVs to sell kilowatt hours to than in January.\nTwo, in summer, many people take their cars on holiday trips, leading to a lot of charging sessions to power their journeys, the typical Black Saturdays with waiting lines in front of petrol stations are a great moment for our business too. We analyzed the impact of this and estimated to be in the high single-digit percentage of revenue.\nThree, cars and especially EVs needs more energy to drive around in winter than in summer. Air density is higher when air is colder, and thus, it takes more effort to push a break through the air. So cars need more energy to drive around. On top of this, people like to have the cabin needed and batteries also like room temperature, both adding energy consumption. In total, this adds up to easily more than 25% when collar.\nLast but not least, when it rains, people more often choose their cars instead of cycling or walking to the train station. It is these effects that accumulate sales growth towards year-end. And that you can see on the graphs here for the years before. So we are readying ourselves for another record quarter, whereby, as always, September is a slight slowdown after summer. And as soon as business starts moving and temperatures gets colder, growth hits our network.\nBut there is more to mention on growth of our network. Moving on to Slide 12 to talk about London. We've said it before and it's worth repeating. If there was one tender to win in recent years, it was that to create London's charging network in a joint venture with places for London. Securing this project was a major achievement and one we're incredibly proud of.\nNow just a year after winning the tender replaces for London, we are very excited to share the very first construction pictures with you. Our inaugural site is at Hatton Cross, right next to Heathrow Airport, a prime location with some 80,000 cars passing by every single day. This station will feature 12 charging points, double the amount of our #1 station in the U.K., which is a Remark Way and which by coincidence is also in the city of London. This station operates at very high utilization rates and sell EUR 1 million plus in kilowatt hours annually.\nSo you can imagine, we have high expectations for Hatton Cross. If all goes according to plan, we'll be opening the sites before the end of the year. Getting from tender win to contract through permitting and all the way to the start of construction in such a short time frame is a massive accomplishment by our team. Also, it is a testament to what is possible when governments implement best practices tenders and create the right conditions to accelerate the rollout of critical infrastructure.\nOn that note, I want to give you an update of our pace of construction. Moving to Slide 13. I Already earlier, I mentioned that construction pace is our current challenge. So where do we stand in [indiscernible]? Well, let's start with our goal for the year. We began the year with 346 stations in our network. In the first 9 months, we built a total of 34 new stations. Right now, we have 30 stations in defenses with active construction underway as we speak. We expect the far majority of these sites to be completed before year-end.\nAdditionally, we anticipate opening even more construction sites this quarter, although most of these will likely be commissioned next year. Altogether, I think this should give you a good ballpark of where our network will stand by the end of the year.\nNow let's talk about construction base. In the first 9 months, we built 34 new stations and expanded another 13, these expansion projects require nearly as much effort from our teams as building entirely new sites from permitting to the on-the-ground work. On top of that, we delivered 2 large restaurants, a major achievements for our project delivery teams. And realized several unmanned shops and built 3 truck charging facilities at existing stations.\nAll in all, this means we completed a total of roughly 54 construction projects in the first 9 months, including some very sizable new developments. This figure demonstrates how we are ramping up our construction capabilities. Just to compare, over the full year 2024, we delivered a total of 58 construction projects. At the current rate, we're on track for an annualized build base of 72 construction projects. That is an increase of 24% compared to last year. So we are ramping up.\nAnd if you look at the number of sites currently in the fences, with contractors on the ground, that pace is above 100 sites per year. So things are moving in the right direction and we're moving forward with determination. To construct stations, we need locations, great locations to build.\nSo let's look at how the site acquisition is delivering. Moving to Slide 14. So let's start with the facts. In the last quarter, we ended -- we added 20 sites to our pipeline, bringing the total for this year to 60 sites signed. By the end of the quarter, our portfolio had grown to 624 locations. 380 of which are operational and with another 244 under development. I mentioned these numbers earlier in the highlights section.\nSo how are we tracking towards our goal of 1,000 stations? With 624 locations already secured, we have fewer than 400 to go to reach that milestone. On this slide, you can see our acquisition pace for last year and over the last 12 months, both consistently above 100 sites per year. With the ongoing onboarding of the already planned for growth of our development teams, we expect this to increase even further. So we are firmly on track to meet our 2030 goal.\nTo give you a bit more context on these numbers, there has been a notable shift from public to private sites in our pipeline. Unlike last year, when the German highway tender added a large batch of sites all at once. This year's growth is closely completely driven by the ramp-up in deal volume of single sites.\nIt's also important to note that our tender win last year with places for London, covering 25 large charging stations in the city is not yet included in this overview. That's because the contracting for the individual locations is still underway. However, most of these sites have already been identified and their development is far more certain than a typical prospect, thanks to our signed joint venture agreements.\nAnd there's more of this as the same more or less goes for our German regional tender wave. That gives us access to 92 search areas in Germany where Fastned has been appointed as the concessionaire to realize charging infrastructure in the region. For us, the key aspects of securing new locations remain unchanged. We focus on high-traffic sites, long lease tenders and the ability to build according to Fastned quality and concept standards. This is what ensures a strong business case and our industry-leading customer satisfaction.\nIn conclusion, we don't trade off quality for quantity. We'll continue to invest with discipline. This is where doing the heart thing really matters. We approach it with a growth mindset, always looking for ways to increase our pace while maintaining both quality and quantity. We're not cutting corners.\nMoving to Slide 15, to start talking about station performance. This graph highlights the results of our unwavering commitment to building only high-quality stations in prime locations. It's about getting every detail right, what we often refer to as delivering the best charging concept in the market. Over the last -- over the past 3 years, we've nearly tripled the number of charging sessions per station, all while maintaining a significant lead over the market average.\nThroughout this period, there have been frequent predictions that the competition would quickly catch up, yet, as the market enters its next phase of acceleration, our absolute leads remains just as strong as ever. In fact, with time, now being much more precious than before, our relative advantage over the competition is actually widening. This higher level of sales per location translates directly into outperformance on a unit economic basis, which brings me to our usual update on station performance.\nMoving to Slide 17. As said, our stations continue to outperform the market. We grew energy sold per average station by 13% since last year. So that is the combination of organic growth of selling more at existing stations lost the sales at new stations, about organic sales growth, the sales growth at existing stations, this came in at 21% for the quarter and tracks nicely with fleet growth, which was 22% for the quarter. The gross profit per kilowatt hour was at the same level as last quarter at EUR 0.54.\nOperational EBITDA for the average station is at 38%, which puts it also in the guidance bracket given earlier this year. These results are really unique for our sector. There are testaments to our high-traffic locations, our best concept and customer experience. It is this proven concept and business case that gives confidence in continuing to expand our network and build the capacity to cater for the massive growth in BEVs in the coming years.\nAnd that brings us to the final slide of the presentation to talk about guidance. Throughout today's presentation, Slide 18, we've explored the context and details behind each of the guidance items you see on this slide. So I won't go into each one of them again. Instead, I want to leave you with a final thought about culture. When faced with big audacious goals, there are 3 ways to respond. The first is to feel uncomfortable. And as we've seen with the German car industry and how they try to deal with the goals now. The second approach is to cut corners hitting the numbers, perhaps, but losing sight of the basic business case and business sense. We've seen some in our markets take this path.\nThe third way is the hard way to stay strong, to embrace a growth mindset and to constantly ask what more can be done to achieve the goal or to increase certainty in attaining it. This is about engaging teams and working together to remove bottlenecks. It is only the third path that creates real and long-term value. And this is the path Fastned has chosen and continues to choose. It is this culture that explains why the gap between us and the competition keeps widening.\nAnd on that note, I'd like to conclude by saying it's been a great third quarter and an even better fourth quarter is ahead of us. Thank you all for listening.\nAnd on that note, also hand the word back to the operator for questions."

Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nGood morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for our Q1 earnings call. As you can see from the -- on the foot book on Page 3, Bob Kierlin, our founder passed away on February 10. He was 85 years of age. I just thought I'd open with a few thoughts on Bob, if you'd indulge me.\nSo Bob was born in June of 1939 in Winona, Minnesota. It's down about 25,000 people in Southeastern Minnesota on the banks of the -- Western banks of the Mississippi River. His first memory of the child was worded 2 victory parade going across the Interstate Bridge coming into In his victory, it said Bob's Compass was a true north -- Bob's Compass had a true north with a belief in people, free mines and free markets. Any indiscriminately respected others seeing the best in everyone without desiring reciprocation themself. I had the good fortune, I knew Bob for just over 30 years. I met them in the second quarter of 1994. And I had across the country road trips. Bob preferred to travel by Van and visit pass locations and I remember my first trip with him. We left on a Sunday morning at about 7:00. We drove to Denver, visited some locations some investors. We drilled to Salt Lake City. We drove to Vegas. We do L.A., San Francisco, Rock Springs, Wyoming and made a way back to Winona on Friday evening. In that, I learned how well red Bob was. And one thing I've observed over the years is there was not a day that Bob Kierlin does not read the Wall Street Journal from cover to cover. And I thought it appropriate based on my travels with him that in his bitter, it said Bob humor was kindled from old mad magazines Bob and Ray comedy shows, which I might be older than most of the folks are fast. So I'm not sure what that is. Steve Martin and Bob Newhart, I do know the latter two, and I do know the Mad magazine reference.\nThe -- about 60 years ago, Bob convinced 4 friends to a company, selling nuts and bolts. The idea didn't work. And he -- but he -- after clean customers, understanding what they needed as far as helping their supply chain needs with fasteners, he wouldn't plan B. And that's the organization you know today and that the investing public first became aware of in 1987 when we went public. 40 years after our start in around 2007-2008 time frame, we revisited Bob idea. Today, about 25% of our revenue goes through in machine. And we've added a lot of other technologies to that since. And if you look at our broadly defined FMI or fatal managed inventory, which is really point-of-use technologies that we've deployed. Over 43% of our revenue today goes through some type of technology platform.\nAnd there's been a number of articles written on Bob over the years and recently. I remember the first one after a trip I did with Bobd. He was regarded as Frugal the Chief CEO in America, the fact that he shares hotel rooms with other Faston employees when he travels. All my trips in Bob, I shared hotel room. And he wore you suits. And they painted somewhat of a character about Bob. But I think in many ways, they missed it. And so what our foot book includes is an from a book Bob role in the late 1990s, titled the Power of Fastenal people. And he talked about philosophy and leadership within the organization. And he had 10 rules about leadership he had coined over the years. And I'm sharing that with our folks on the call today, whether that be shareholders, analysts, employees of Fastenal, others. In hopes that more of society can capture some of the ideas that Bob shared with us. I was very blessed to have met Bob, as I said 30 years ago. Like many others at Fastenal, he changed the course of my life.\nThe -- for me, the one stand out, particularly when I think of Bob is the first rule about challenge rather than control, treating everyone as you're equal, see the unique humanness in all persons, let people learn and we've tweaked that a little bit to challenge people to learn and ask them to consider changing when they learn something new. And then finally, remember how little you know. We have a lot of in Fastenal. A lot of people choose to spend start their career young with Fastenal and spend their career here. Whether you've been here 5 years or 30 years, you always have things to learn. And Bob carried that mantra through his entire life, and he will be sorely missed.\nI was personally blessed in that a couple of weeks before he passed away, I had a nice visit. And we served on the board of another organization together, and we have this conversation afterwards. And he has sorely missed in the organization and in it could be at large. Thanks, Bob.\nFlipping to Page 4. Some thoughts on the quarter. The -- from a quarterly perspective, our sales grew about 3.5%. We had one less day, so our daily growth grew about 5%. The marketplace we operate at is still sluggish. I deem what's happening in our growth as mostly self-help things that we're doing from an execution standpoint, and there's an element of comps in there, too. But it's mostly help. And I make that comment when I look at the sequential patterns of our business. Because that's about how we're executing new customer relationships we're creating and expansion of existing customer relationships that we're creating. We're executing at a high level. And when I think of -- we made a lot of changes 2, 2.5 years ago within the organization.\nAs we came through COVID, we had drifted apart a little bit. And we weren't as focused on a comp goal as we should have been. As travel resumed, we saw signs of that, and we made leadership changes in our sales side of the organization. And everybody has been in their roles now a couple of years, and you're really seeing it gel, and it's timing through in our numbers. The quarter is a little odd to look at if you think about it from a monthly perspective, but don't be misled by that either. January was a bit understated because of weather. And March is a bit overstated because of the timing of Easter. I don't know if Holden will agree to my number here, but I estimate about 2%, 2.5% of the growth in March. It's a bit about Good Friday being in April. And -- but regardless of that, even if you adjust for the weather in January and you adjust for the Easter timing in March, the sequential pattern is quite strong and it's strong in all of our geographies, which is really good to see. And again, I deem that to be about what Fastenal is doing and engaging with the marketplace, rather than what the marketplace is asking us to help with because of their business patterns because it's still sluggish.\nThe -- as is typical of April, we held our customer expo. A few of us actually traveled back yesterday. The Expo is on finished on Wednesday evening and flew back on Thursday morning. We had similar to what we witnessed in 2024, record attendance by customers at the event. It -- last year surprised us a bit because coming out of COVID, the first 2 years in '22 and '23 that we had to show, it was a very subdued event because a lot of organizations either weren't traveling yet or they were doing limited traveling, and it was still difficult to travel nationally that we weren't getting international folks. And so folks weren't coming from Canada or up from Mexico for the event. This year, I can tell you firsthand that we had a record number of attendees from our business unit in Mexico because I had the opportunity to speak to a large group that was gathered. And it was exciting to see the types of questions they were asking about and the way they were approaching the relationship.\nThe other thing -- I'll probably touch on this a couple of times through my commentary, it was a unique week because in talking to various groups, the one thing there wasn't a lot of discussion on was tariffs. That's not to say it didn't come up. But the way we address the conversation in every group I talked to, it was a few sessions we had where it was a Q&A and Bill was the moderator. He led off with a question tariffs and he pointed to that meet each time. And what I really impressed upon our customers is the way a supply chain partner approaches any kind of chaos. I see some stories about the lead up to COVID, the vetting of suppliers that we did for safety products before the world got weird and how that put us in a position to be a better supply chain partner. The tactical decisions we made to go out and buy inventory to get ahead of the onset of everybody Because of the strength of our balance sheet and our financial resources, a lot of that attributed to things we do, but really the foundation that Bob Kierlin laid many years ago and priorities in an organization and what you do with cash. But what I can tell you is we shared with them the tactics we're taking right now in some cases, fattening our balance sheet a little bit to -- it doesn't solve any issue other than it gives you time to have options. Talk about Expo bringing directly into Canada and Mexico that we would have brought to the United States before because some of the new tariffs are not eligible for duty drawback. While it might be more expensive to bring it directly into that market from a logistics perspective, it's a lot less expensive than a tariff that gets layered on top of maybe a tariff going into Canada or Mexico as well. So we're being very thoughtful about that because about 15% of our revenue is in older Mexico.\nFrom the standpoint of the U.S. in all markets, we talked a lot about how we've changed our sourcing patterns in the last 5 years on diversifying where we're sourcing from to provide a better supply chain. But we also talked about the fact that when we diversify our sourcing practices, we don't just play whack-a-mole and try to avoid a problem. We try to improve the supply chain in every step we take. And we try to be relevant to the new manufacturing partners we joined with regardless of where they're located.\nIn that we're a top 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 customer with that manufacturer because if you're a significant customer to a manufacturer and they get tight on capacity, or they need to expand their capacity. They're going to help their largest partners first when they're prioritizing their efforts and the fact that they know we have financial resources to match with dollars, what our commitments are. We often get in line ahead of everybody else, and that serves our customers in the marketplace really well.\nWe've added a bunch of customer site information to our disclosures this quarter, 3 years worth of history. We had a recent Investor Day where we talked about it. We touched on it in our January earnings call to really give their visibility to some of the strategies we have deployed and are deploying to broaden the size of our market opportunity. When I think of stepping into this role a decade ago, one of the points I've made to the -- to our Board was coming from my old role, the advantage of I've studied the numbers of Fastenal for years, and I had a lot of conversation with our regional leaders over the years. So I understood the maybe better how they thought of things, where they discovered success. There are a few people for me that stood out that have been very successful in their business. When I think of our business in Minnesota and Wisconsin, I took a lot of stuff out of that playbook. When I think about our regional leaders, the 2 Millers, Randy, who led our business down in Indianapolis and KC who led our business down in what we referred to the Southeast Central at the time, which was Kentucky and Tennessee.\nOur team in Mexico, our team in international more broadly. Jeff Watts at the time, had a lot of discussions to really understand their tactics for growing because they had consistently discovered the success, maybe sometimes on others had it. Bob Hopper on that list where I touched with and e-covered our Florida market, incredible success and you learn and you ask people, how are you doing it? And what I shared with the Board is our most successful regions have a great key account program. If you put me in this role, I'm going to drive the business towards what they're discovering success because I think it broadens the market for Fastenal, but we have to lower our cost structure to go after that kind of business. And I'm pleased to say we've done that. And you see the success that shines through in some of those customer site information statistics.\nFinally, on Page 4, we inched up our dividend from $0.43 to $0.44 in -- it's a dumb reason. I'll give you a little historical perspective. In 2003, our sales -- total sales, we needed 10.5% growth to break $1 billion that year. We came in at 9.9%, and we reported $995 million in sales. That was cool, but $1 billion plus would have been neither. But we can't change our sales. We can influence it by our activities, but we can't change it, at least not legally.\nIn 2018, our operating income came -- we needed 13.4% growth to break $1 billion that year. We only got 13.3%. We came in at $999.2 million of operating income. We can't change that one either. Holden did get a dirty look from me, but we can't change that one, but we can change our dividend. So in the first quarter, we paid out $246 million, and I looked at Holden and I said, we bumped that up $0.01. If our Board looks along with it and we continue this dividend through the year, we'll break $1 billion in regular dividend for the first time. Some reason, sorry about that.\nFlipping to Page 5. FMI, we continue to execute at a high level there. Given the comment I just made a lot dividend, I'd feel a lot better if we had 130,000 devices, not 129,996, but I'm going to round it and say we have 130,000 devices deployed in 25 countries. Our device count grew 12.5%. When you look at our safety sales growth of almost 10% in March. That's about execution in FMI vending more generally, but FMI more broadly.\nGoing down the page, digital footprint, 61% of total sales versus 59% and 54% 1 and 2 years ago. Our goal remains in October, 66% to 68% of sales is going through digital footprint. And that's what we're working towards. And then again, the customer site data success in our 10,000-plus sites. And what that means is this is a customer, it's a building, it's a campus where we provide more than $10,000 a month in product and services. A subset of that is what we call on-site like customer sites. So that's where we do more than $50,000 a month with that customer. That group grew 7%. So that's about executing and engaging with customers at a high level. There's one category that you'll see that doesn't shine so strongly, and that's our under 5,000. And it's really our under 2,000, a subset of that. And if you're on our e-commerce team right now or if you're in IT or if you're in supply chain, you're getting a lot of pressure and dirty looks from Dan right now because we need to get better at the e-commerce side. We solved the problem with that group not by adding resources and sales teams to go after $500 and $800 a month customers. We want those customers. That marketplace has chosen to buy more in the online channels, and that accelerated during COVID. We're not great at that piece of the business. We're great at a lot of things. That's not on the list, but we can be. And the reason that matters is when you look at -- through some of the customer site data, I believe a great eCommerce platform enhances our ability to be successful in all groups because I believe there's probably a 20% lift. And this is just -- this is the belief. This is not based on any data. I believe there's a there can be a 20% lift in every category, if we have a great eCommerce strategy because there's random MRO spend, we don't necessarily get even when we have a great relationship with the customer because some department in that organization might find it easier to order somewhere else. We need to get better at that.\nI'll shut up now and flip it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Before digging into the results for what we view my final call, I did want to mention a few things. First, to Dan, who nearly 9 years ago, based on the response of many of the people on this call, took a chance on a relatively unorthodox hire. It's been an unbelievable experience working with a great leader, and I sure have enjoyed being your partner in this.\nSo the entire Blue Team, I know I got this opportunity in part because of my outsider's perspective, but at the same time, you all challenged me to earn your trust and respect and you deserve that. I've tried to do that for 9 years, but it wouldn't have been possible if not for your passion for learning, teaching and collaboration, that's the foundation of our culture. So I surely enjoyed being your CFO, and I couldn't ask for 24,000 better friends.\nAnd for our investors, you probably don't realize how often I've actually used your observations, perspectives and questions in my own work here. And for that, I thank you. I hope I've been able to provide a deep and differentiated view into our business. I go on. But if I do, I suspect the music will start, so why don't I just step into Slide 6.\nSales in the first quarter of 2025 were up 3.4% with daily sales up 5%. That's our strongest daily sales rate since the second quarter of 2023. Feedback from regional leadership continues to reflect sluggish end market demand despite generally favorable outlooks. Customer tone did seem to shift from the steady improvement we've seen since the election to plateauing as trade policy created some caution. Notwithstanding this uncertainty, we did not discern any meaningful pre-buying ahead of tariffs. In the absence of much external health, the improvement in our DSR reflects 2 other variables. First, even as the market has stabilized, our comparisons have gotten easier, particularly in the cyclical parts of our business. This factor helped produce our first quarter of growth for fasteners since the first quarter of '23, and acceleration in manufacturing end markets.\nSecond, contributions from our strong contract signings over the past 2 years continues to build. We continue to experience a healthy pace and mix of signings in the first quarter of 2025 and our talent national, regional and government contracts has grown at a double-digit rate for 12 consecutive months.\nNow the monthly cadence during the quarter warrants some discussion. I feel like Dan covered much of that. So I agree with his numbers about the impact of -- Good Friday having fallen in March of last year. What I will say is the quarterly daily sales rate growth is a fair representation of our performance, and we did see acceleration through the period. It was a solid self-help driven result in a soft market. But even so, as you interpret our results, please see stock of the discrete factors that affected each period.\nThe pricing outlook also warrants some discussion. Year-to-date, significant tariffs have been applied to products from China as well as steel, including derivative products like fasteners on a global basis. We continue our long-term trend on diversifying our supply chain where possible to the size and timing of our suppliers pricing actions, and we added some inventory to our own balance sheet. That said, supply chains have gotten more expensive and a part of our response over time will be incremental pricing. We have been proactive engaging with our customers for several months. And in April, we took our first actions, which we believe will contribute 3% to 4% of price in the second quarter of 2025 with the potential for that to double in the second half of '25, depending on the pace and execution of our actions.\nWe have taken no actions on the deferred portion of their typical tariffs should those ultimately go into force. We are encouraged by the easier comparisons, the improved sentiment and particularly our internal momentum. That said, we have limited visibility and share our customers' uncertainty over how current trade policy may impact demand over the course of 2025. However, Fastenal has historically been able to win market share during periods of disruption on the strength of our nimble sales -- our frugal and adaptive culture and the weight of the technologies and global supply chain resources we can apply to finding solutions to customer challenges. That is our expectation in the current environment.\nNow to Slide 7. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2025 was 20.1%, down 50 basis points year-to-year. We had one less selling day in the period versus the first quarter of 2024, which is worth roughly $31.5 million in sales. Had the first quarter of 2024 and 2025 had the same number of selling days, we would have leveraged SG&A and our operating margin would have been down a more measured 10 to 20 basis points.\nGross margin in the first quarter of 2025 was 45.1%, down 40 bps from the year ago period. Product and customer mix was the usual contributor. We also saw higher costs from third-party freight providers and higher hub vehicle lease costs, both coming against relatively flat freight revenue. The price cost was neutral in the period. We anticipate easier gross margin comparisons in the latter half of the year to our effectiveness in managing price cost and the degree of macro improvement will influence this scenario.\nSG&A was 25% of sales in the first quarter of 2025, up from 24.9% from the year ago period. As described above, we believe we would have leveraged in the period had the current and year quarters had the same number of selling days. All major cost categories either leverage or deleverage very modestly with not sending out. We continue to manage cost effectively. Total SG&A expenses were up 3.6% year-to-year consistent with what has been a stable 2% to 4% rate of increase over the last 9 quarters. We continue to invest in key areas of our business to support growth while managing other costs more tightly to reflect the sluggish business conditions. Putting it all together, we reported first quarter 2025 EPS of $0.52, flat with the first quarter of 2024.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We generated $262 million in operating cash in the first quarter of 2025 or 88% of net income. This is a lower conversion rate than we might typically achieve in the first quarter, reflecting our current investment working capital. Otherwise, we remain comfortable with the cash duration of our model and continue to carry a conservatively capitalized balance sheet with quarter-end debt being 5.1% of total capital. Accounts receivable were up 5.4%, reflecting sales growth, relatively faster growth to larger customers that tend to carry longer terms and an uptick in quarter end deferred payments from our customers. Inventories were up 11.9%, not different than the preceding quarter. We have increased inventory as part of our effort to improve product availability in our in-market locations and improve picking efficiencies in our hubs. We have added stock to support customer growth, including expected incremental growth in the warehousing space, and we accelerated some inventory scheduled for future delivery into current periods ahead of potential tariffs. Inventory growth may remain elevated in 2025 as we continue to navigate tariffs and has more inflation builds in entry.\nAccounts payable were up 23.9%, reflecting the increase in inventories and the timing of payments with certain capital projects. Net capital spending in the first quarter of 2025 was $53.8 million, up from $48.3 million in the first quarter of 2024. This increase is consistent with our expectations for the full year where we anticipate capital spend in a range of $265 million to $285 million, up from $214 million in 2024. This increase is from higher FMI device spending in anticipation of higher signings, higher IT spend, which includes projects aimed at developing additional digital capabilities, and distribution center outlays to reflect spending on our Utah and Atlanta hubs and automated picking additions across our hub network.\nWith that, operator, we'll turn it over to begin the Q&A."

Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the Q4 Fastenal earnings call. And I'll -- if you would -- I'm going to -- in the foot book, on Page 3. Our business grew 3.7% in the fourth quarter and an extra day, so daily was 2.1. Frankly, a frustrating start to a challenging year. Our business gets and loses leverage relatively quickly when our growth expands or our growth contracts. And you saw evidence of that in the quarter, where we lost some leverage, and EPS came in at $0.46, so down about 2%.\nDecember, I think it's worthwhile to talk a little about December. And then, frankly, we've already moved down to 2025. But to look at December from the standpoint of -- there's 2 months going on there. The first roughly 15 days, so when I think of Friday before Christmas, we were trending towards sales growth, daily growth. We felt it would be in [ excess of 3% ]. Depending on which voice you listen to when we were comparing trends, you could have argued for 4%, but a 3-plus percent number.\nAnd in the last -- that Christmas week and then that New Year's Day week, that collapsed. And if I'm doing the math, it tells me if first 15 days of the month, we're growing at 3% to 4% and you weigh that against the last 5 days and having all that evaporate, that means in the last 5 days, we were probably negative, somewhere between 9% and 12%. And however, we don't believe -- we believe the first part of the month is more indicative of where we are and where we're going to be in January and February than what we saw in the last area.\nIf you look at the data of what's happening. We have a lot of anecdotal data. But I sat down on January 2 with our vending team. And I said, we have something unique here that we really should understand better. And that is we have vending machines in just over 20,000 facilities on the planet. And the calendar is the calendar. And -- let's look at a baseline. I asked them -- we get a lot of the information that comes in and we look at it in weekly snapshots. So Sunday to Saturday, type snapshot.\nAnd I said, look at the 2 weeks prior to the week that Christmas touches and look at what our trends were and what our pace of business was in that time frame, and then look at each week thereafter, so the week the Christmas touches, the week that New Year's touches, the first clean week of January and the second clean week January, so you can really look at -- did something different happen there.\nThe other thing that I asked them to do is we're fortunate with a range of customers. Obviously, industrial is our biggest component. But in the vending area with a meaningful customer base that represents nonmanufacturing entities, and a handful of those are eCommerce companies. So -- and their trends would be completely different because they're really busy around the holidays.\nSo take out our top 10 vending customers. We did that, and I said that's analyze the rest. And -- excuse me, the top 10 non-manufacturing vending customers. So if I look at -- and then I said determine a bright line of where you think the facility is shut down, and the team came to the conclusion that if we're doing 100 transactions on average a day and that number goes to 25% or less, we're going to consider that facility as essentially shut down.\nAnd because the only people there are -- maybe there are some maintenance folks that are in there, because it's a good time to do maintenance. Maybe there's a few production lines that are running because they're behind, or maybe there's an area you don't shut down like heat treatment because it's too expensive to start it back up. So in 2022, about 25% of the facilities we sell into that have vending, about 25% saw the activity drop more than 75%. So they were running less than 25% of normal.\nIn 2023, that was 30%. In 2024, a that's 35%. So a meaningful uptick really since the economy weakened in '22, the industrial economy, we saw a meaningful uptick in each of the 2 years and that was accentuated this year. More telling was the week of New Year's. So the week after Christmas, [ 6% ] percent were shut down, 6% were shut down. This year, it's 17% were shut down. So there were a tremendous number of companies that probably shut down the day after Christmas. And I don't know if they were open the Monday or Tuesday before. But the day after Christmas and they stayed shut down through January 2. They just said, we're idling operations. And that plays very true to what we saw in our numbers.\nThe only other item that was noteworthy is we looked also at -- their activity is just down. Because if there's normally 5 workdays in a week and you're down to 4, you'd expect to be at about 80%. We did see the week after Christmas and 2 weeks after Christmas, a very strong increase in the number of customers that were down at least 25%. And when I look at -- so last week, that number -- the activity had normalized as far as how many are shut down, it's about 4%.\nBut we saw an impact of the weather in the Southeast, and we don't have this week's data yet. Our anticipation is that, that normalized. And Holden will touch on a little bit of that when he looks at truck routes and things like that, that we canceled during last week. So a lot of waiting into the weeds there. I hope that made sense. My guess is a few of you will have follow-up questions for Holden on his -- after the call.\nThe next piece, and I'll touch -- I'll dive a little deeper when we get on Page 2. But in preparation for Investor Day, we thought we had shared some information we're going to be talking about, and we're planning on Investor Day in March. And we thought we'd share a new view. So when I joined the organization back in 1996, it was all about account numbers and dollars per active. So active accounts, how many customers -- how many accounts bought from you and dollars per customer, and growing both of those over time.\nAnd we used to always say in a typical branch, you had 100 active accounts, 10 of those represented about 65% of sales. If you would have looked at it not as an account base, but as a customer, and what I mean by that is we might have 3 account numbers in a building because we're selling to the maintenance area, we're selling to the production area and we're selling maybe a second production line, so you have 3 account numbers to track the activity. That's one customer, but we looked at it as 3 accounts or 3, at the time. I'll touch on that in a second on Page 2.\nFinally, on Page 3, we raised our quarterly dividend by roughly 10%. If you annualize the dividend we just declared, it's about $1.72. We feel very confident on our ability to continue the strong cash flow generation, very indicative of our business model for many, many years.\nSo you see a new chart here, probably an unfamiliar look to the business. But some -- I felt the best way to address this, and I'm not seeing my seat of paper here, unfortunately, is to address a letter I did for our employees. And in that letter -- sorry, I had to go back to my desk to grab it. I describe to our employees what they're looking at in this information.\nSome quick definition. Each customer site is a roll-up of revenue going into a unique site from a branch or Onsite. It includes everything we provide, whether it's dropped at a dock or a customer's desk, supplied via an MI device, shipped to the facility using a third party or picked up at a Fastenal location. Each customer site also rolls together all the individual accounts our local team uses to summarize and build for the products and services we provide. The information on the slide is based on analysis of roughly 270,000 unique customer sites that we supply products into during 2024.\nAgain, it's a simple-looking graphic, but it tells a powerful story about our business. The top 2 buckets summarize customers that are doing more than $10,000 a month; and then the subset of that, they do more than $50,000. So the $10,000-plus includes about 5% of the customer sites we serve, but represents about 77% of our total sales. Since 2017, revenue through these customer sites has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 14%.\nWhen I look at these customers, they really value what we bring to the marketplace, and we have been incredibly successful. In 2024, there are about 13,000 customer sites in this group, again, about 5% of 270,000, which translates into about 54 sites in the average district. There's 240 districts, across our business. The average customer site spends about $38,000 per month, and the number of $10,000 customer sites has increased about 9% a year since 2017.\nThanks to the strength of our Onsite program, there's a subset of this group that has grown even faster, the customer sites where spend is at least $50,000 per month. Since 2017, revenue through this subset of customer sites has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 18%. The scale of this business changes the customer site economics. It allows us to operate more cost effectively, hence, the Onsite program. This, in turn, expands the resources we can provide, improve the opportunity for the customer and for Fastenal.\nIn 2024, there were 2,547 customer sites in this bucket, about 1% of the total sites we serve, which translates to about 11 customer sites in an average district. Since 2017, the number of $50,000-plus customers has grown 16% per year. So we've heavily talked about Onsite acquisition. And as you see, of this 2,500, about 2,000 of them are physically in an Onsite. We'll talk in March about how we intend to deemphasize Onsite numbers and change it to talking about $50,000-plus customers. We believe that positions the best story of telling the business to make it clear what we're striving to accomplish and how successful we are at that endeavor.\nOn the lower half of the slide, there are 2 buckets of customer sites where we appear to us successful. Here are some thoughts on these. Customer sites spending between $5,000 and $10,000 per month represent about 4% of the customer sites we serve. In 2024, there are about 10,000 customer sites in this bucket, roughly 42 in the Nava District, and we've added about 4% more sites per year to this bucket since 2017.\nThis would be mediocre expect on one fact. We've been incredibly successful with many of the customer sites formerly in this group. In fact, many have become $10,000-plus customer sites over the last 7 years. This success has been driven by your efforts to introduce our supply chain, transformational capabilities using FMI, Onsite, production parts, MRO products and many industrial services. In fact, a sidebar here, Industrial Services broke $100 million in revenue for the first time in 2024.\nIt's been great for those customers, for our employees, for our shareholders and for our suppliers. In this slide, our performance isn't mediocre. However, it's not great either. That 4% CAGR should probably be upper single digits, if not 10%. The final bucket of customer sites, less than $5,000 per month, has borne the brunt of changes in our business in the world over the past several years. A decade of strategically closing locations, COVID-19 and its impact on how customers purchase products, thank eCommerce, the removable products from our previously stocked in our distribution centers, this we reversed in 2024.\nA strategic decision regarding sales time allocation and maybe some slippage in execution by the Fastenal organization. I believe the critical aspect of this group is you closed a lot of locations, that customer that sees us as convenient, but not special, that business falls off. The way you make that special is you push harder on your eCommerce capabilities and what it means for unplanned spend. Because what that do -- does, it benefits every customer bucket you see on this page, because we're more than planned spend, we're everything they need.\nFlipping to Page 5. Onsite, we signed 56 in the quarter. So we finished the year with 2,031, increase of about 12% of what we saw a year ago. Customers in the Onsite world grew mid-single digits. We did see similar to what we saw in 2000, older contingents of Onsite go negative during the year. And it's not uncommon on a call with a district manager to learn about 2 or 3 or 4 customers where their business is down 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% where it was a year ago, that's a sign of what the industrial economy is taking away. Our execution and our ability to take market share is a sign of how we do self-help and fight back.\nAll told, we signed 358 Onsites in 2024. We signed 326 last year, so an increase. Not at our goal, but a meaningful increase. And signings that are consistent with previous peaks in 2019, the year before COVID in 2022, the first year we came out.\nFMI Technology, huge aspect of the business here and strong success. We broke 100 MAU signings per day for the first time. We feel very good about how we exit the year and what that means for 2025. And in the fourth quarter, FMI Technology touched about 44% of our revenue versus 42% and 39% in the last 2 years. And we established a goal of 28,000 to 30,000 MAUs for 2025 versus the 28,000 we just signed. And Holden touches on that a bit in our CapEx expectations.\neCommerce, a good story, not a great story. It grew about 28%. eProcurement, where we have established common relations, continues to grow almost 40%, 37.6%. However, the eCommerce piece that contains web, we still struggle there and we're putting double down efforts into that. We realigned some teams to make that a more relevant part of our business. All told, you take eBusiness and FMI Technology, about 62% of our sales, just over 60%, touched our digital footprint. Our goal was to get that to 63% in 2024, so just shy of that number. Our goal for next year is 66%, 68%.\nAnd before I turn it over to Holden, I just want to touch on a couple of things. First off, some comments that Holden made to our regional leaders and our VPs this morning. He talked about in 2024, a cost structure that was effectively managed. And one challenge I made to the group, I believe our incremental margin will be stronger in 2025. And the challenge to them is as our momentum takes us through the year -- and time will tell what the economy allows that momentum to shine through as.\nBut as our momentum takes us into 2025, there's a lot of expenses that we've been squeezing really tightly on in the last couple of years. We have to maintain that, because it puts us in a position to allow for the reload of bonuses. We have a large group of folks within Fastenal that haven't seen bonuses for close to 2 years, 1.5 years at least, and we need to allow the inherent capabilities of Fastenal to reload that. And the best way to do that is to get the revenue growth, capture the gross profit and manage our expenses incredibly well.\nThe other thing I touched on with the group this morning was, as all of you saw in December, Holden announced his decision to leave Fastenal effective April. I think back to -- when Holden joined the organization, I think back to that conversation he had with me and this is when he told me -- I think it was probably a hard conversation for him, at least I hope it was. And when Holden joined our organization back a number of years ago, what we were looking for in a CFO was somebody to bring in a fresh perspective, a very analytical look who could pick apart of the business maybe in ways that the previous CFO didn't do and give it a new set of eyes.\nAnd from that, I want to thank Holden for what he brought to our organization from the standpoint of somebody that didn't grow up in the organization, but knew a lot about the industry and also had a keen mind towards analysis.\nThe other thing that it will -- Holden, I think, was saying to Jeff and Jeff stepped into the President role here last fall, is it allows Jeff, the opportunity -- Jeff Watts, the opportunity to figure out who our CFO should be for our next 10 years, what skill set we are looking for to serve the business today at close to $8 billion versus the business 8 years ago at around $4 billion. And so I wish Holden well and I applaud the move to recognize that maybe Jeff needs a different CFO in the future.\nAnd finally, before that comment sounds like Florness is out the door, I thought I'd share a conversation I had with my kids in August. We do a family vacation every year. And our kids are in their late teens or 20s now. And they asked me, Hey dad, what is it -- what does it mean being CEO versus president? And I said, you ask 10 people, you're going to get 13 different answers. Here's what it means to me.\nI think on the CEO side of the business as you're focused on the strategy where you're going and you're focused very keenly on what that means for people and development, and how the organization should position itself for what it's going to be become. Whereas the president is much more about executing what you're doing every day, every month, every quarter, every year.\nAnd -- but I said, Jeff is stepping into that President piece, but he's also stepping -- he's training for that deal piece. But he still has his first title and that is Chief Sales Officer. And as long as he has that title and even when he gives up, his #1 priority is how we're executing to grow the business and the part of our strategy that's about growing the business. That's his focus. When we get to 10%, we can change that focus.\nAnyway, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Yes, it was a very difficult conversation, just so you know. But this has been a tremendous opportunity. I just want to make sure all investors understand I have a unique opportunity to go try something different. But this has been -- it's been an honor to work for Fastenal, and it's -- this is a great organization and a great opportunity.\nSo jumping into Slide 6. I know what the investors want to hear is what's going on with the quarter. Sales in the fourth quarter in '24 were up 3.7%. Daily sales were up 2.1%. Daily sales growth range from 1.8% to 2.1% throughout the year, a consistency that makes sense in the context of a PMI that spent most of the year signaling modest contraction in manufacturing.\nThe attributes of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 were similarly comparable to prior quarters. MRO-oriented products outperformed OEM-oriented products, with safety up 4.8% and fasteners down 1.4%. Larger accounts outperformed smaller customers, with national accounts up [ 4.2% ] and nonnational accounts down 1%. And manufacturing end markets were up 3.3%, outperforming nonmanufacturing end markets, which were down 0.3%, headlined by a 4.1% decline in nonresidential construction and an 11.3% decline in reseller. There was not a lot of variation in our high-level top line trends through 2024.\nThat said, the fourth quarter of 2024 can't be fully evaluated without addressing the cadence of activity in December. Dan made this point through vending transactions in his review. We see the same thing in daily sales to our top 100 customers, which grew low to mid-single digits in the first 15 days of December, but declined more than 20% in the final 5 days. While holiday-related productions downs occur most years, sustained marketplace weakness and the midweek timing of Christmas and New Years produced uncommonly sharp cuts in December of 2024. And we believe that the last 5 business days of December swung the month from trending towards 3% plus growth to finishing flat.\nNow zooming back out, we remain encouraged heading into 2025. The PMI is still sub-50, underlying business activity remains slow and the start of January was impacted by New Year's and winter storms. The latter disrupted business activity in our Southern U.S. regions reflected in our needing to cancel 6% of our truck routes through January 10.\nOn the other hand, regional leadership sites broadening post-election customer optimism for 2025. We continue to sign new business at a strong rate with our contract base growing double digits, including up 12% in December. We believe these wins are beginning to be reflected in sales. Our monthly daily sales rate exceeded the historical sequential in 3 of the last 5 months, and we believe it would have been 4 of the last 5 but for how December finished. As we move forward, we anticipate we will see revenue from these customer signings continue to build.\nNow to Slide 7. Operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2024 was 18.9%, down 120 basis points year-to-year. Gross margin was as expected. On top of that, our SG&A dollars in the fourth quarter of 2024 were largely in line with the first 3 quarters of 2024 as investments in Onsite staffing, technology and data and sales travel were offset with greater control over more discretionary costs.\nWe continue to believe we are managing costs effectively. We expected operating margin to decline due to the effects of slow growth as we've seen all year. That the deleverage was sharper in the current period than experienced in the first 3 quarters of '24 reflects our seasonally lowest volume quarter and the shutdown impacts.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter of 2024 was 44.8%, down 70 basis points from the year ago period, primarily from positive customer mix. We also experienced product margin pressure, which was partly offset by higher rebates reflecting year-end opportunities to assist suppliers in leaning out their inventory. The product margin pressure was largely due to shipping, with higher container cost affecting fasteners and expedited shipments to warehousing customers during the holiday season affecting safety products.\nWe have made price adjustments to offset the higher container costs and the expedited shipments should not recur, meaning most of the product margin pressure in the fourth quarter of 2024 should not carry into the first quarter of 2025. SG&A was 25.9% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2024, up from 25.3% from the year ago period. The largest impacts are from higher lease costs as we refresh our field pickup fleet and a currency revaluation on certain assets that relates to the stronger dollar.\nThe effects of areas such as IT expense and general insurance loss were marginally negative. We continue to believe that as growth picks up, we will leverage the P&L. Putting it all together, we reported fourth quarter 2024 EPS of $0.46, flat with the fourth quarter of 2023.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We generated $282.8 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2024 or 108% of net income. We generated $1.2 billion in operating cash for the full year of 2024 or 102% of net income. Our cash conversion in both periods was below the comparable periods in 2023, however, this mostly reflects the effects of inventory buildup and subsequent wind-down related to tight supply chains being fully past us, and we view the conversion rates in 2024 as being largely consistent with expectations. We continue to carry a conservatively capitalized balance sheet with year-end debt being 5.2% of total capital.\nGiven our current strong capital position and confidence in the future cash-generating capability of our model, we increased our dividend by 10%. Accounts receivable were up 1.9%, driven primarily by sales growth. Inventories were up 8%. We added $30 million to $35 million related to our initiatives to improve product availability in our in-market locations and improve picking efficiencies in our hubs. Opportunistic year-end buys added roughly $10 million, and we added stock to support customer growth, including anticipated incremental growth in the warehousing space. And we accelerated some inventory ceded for future delivery into current periods ahead of potential new tariffs.\nAccounts payable were up 8.9%, reflecting the increasing inventories. Net capital spending in 2024 was $214 million, up versus $161 million in 2023, but below our projected range of $235 million to $265 million. This related to lower purchases of FMI bins and fewer inflations of modular picking units in our in-market locations. Looking to 2025, we anticipate net capital spending of $265 million to $285 million. We're anticipating another step-up in FMI signings, which will require additional [indiscernible] spend. We're increasing IT spend to reflect projects that moved from 2024 to 2025, and an expansion of projects aimed at developing additional digital capabilities.\nLastly, distribution center spending is up to reflect completion of our new Utah hub, the beginning of construction on our new Atlanta hub and incremental automated picking additions across our hub network. We believe net CapEx is likely to be 3% to 3.5% of sales over the next few years, an increase from 2.7% to 3.2%, largely related to greater incremental capacity upgrades across our distribution center network.\nNow before moving on to Q&A, a couple of items of housekeeping. First, a little color on our decision to not provide Onsite sign targets beginning in 2025. When we first unveiled the Onsite strategy in 2014 to '15, we were challenged with driving internal participation and building scale to justify the investment in the initiative. Today, Onsite represent nearly 45% of our sales and are fully integrated into the value proposition we offer customers.\nGetting to this point has prioritized wallet share with existing customers over winning new customers. And at this time, it's appropriate to seek greater balance between those 2 things. Onsites will continue to provide a market advantage for Fastenal, and we'll continue to sign them. However, our success is not solely defined by how many Onsites we sign. It is defined by how many customers we signed that are doing or can do $10,000 or more in sales per month, whether that's through an Onsite or through a branch.\nTo ensure internal and external stakeholders are focusing on organizationally meaningful data, in the first quarter of 2025, we will begin providing customer data along the lines of what Dan discussed at the start of this call. Second, we are planning to host an Investor Day in Minneapolis on March 13. We plan on providing an update on our end market network, which remains critical to our success, but has evolved in the last few years to support a key account strategy. This will be reinforced for the tour of a local branch that as a great representation of our industrial supply house profile.\nWe will discuss not only our tools and capabilities, but how we deploy them in a truly integrated fashion to provide a parallel value to our customers in terms of supply chain cost, risk and scalability. And last, we will do a deeper dive into the strategic plan we've developed throughout 2024, which is heavily centered on the digitization of tools and capabilities, including AI, to improve our service and addressable market. We'll be sending out invites to the event over the next week.\nWith that, operator, we'll turn it over to begin the Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Taylor Ranta of Fastenal Company. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nTaylor Ranta Oborski\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review these factors carefully. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 earnings call. Before I start on the quarter, I just wanted to share a couple of things. First off, I want to share a story about an onsite of ours in Sweeny, Texas. And I was speaking with [ Steve Diekmann ], our Regional Vice President based out of Houston. And for those of you that -- I suspect most people on the call are aware that Houston periodically gets hurricanes and they had a hurricane. And typically what happens when there's a hurricane and this might be Steve Diekmann in Houston, it might be Bob Hopper down in Florida. Oftentimes, they'll get a call from me or from Casey to see, and this is before, to see how everything is going.\nAnd we often remind them of we got their back. And what that means is when you're in the chaos of the moment, you're forced to make decisions on the fly and there's a lot of things going on. And somebody with 20/20 hindsight a week later, might pick a part decision you make at 3 in the morning to solve a problem. My comment to Steve and Bob as always, we've got your back, make great decisions to take care of our customers and to protect your employees, period. And the second thing, and this happened a few years ago, I read an article about a retirement community in Florida during the hurricane, they were without power and without resources for a few days.\nAnd when [indiscernible] that, you're kind of like how the hell does that happen in today's world. And so one thing I often will throw in there and say, \"Hey, make sure your branches are paying attention to facilities around their area. It might be a hospital, might be a retirement home, whatever it is, call them up and see if they're okay so they need something. I don't care if they're a customer of ours or not be there to help because that's what we are. We're a supply chain when people need stuff.\nSo we have an onsite in Sweeny, Texas with Phillips 66, it's a refining facility. Refining facilities can be demanding customers. If you think about what they do, it's a facility where really bad things can happen if they're not on their A game and so they need something. They don't need it tomorrow. They don't need it next week. They need it. And so Wade, our -- one of our employees at the Onsite. He comes into work on Sunday evening, he doesn't normally come into work on Sunday evening. He came to be there all night long because if they need something, he's there to supply that need. So the hurricane hit on Monday about 2:00 in the morning. I think it lasted almost 6 hours in that area. Good chunk of Houston is without power right now.\nBut our customers in that area gets served by Fastenal. If you go to our branches, you'd find out -- a lot of our branches right now have no power. Their point-of-sale system and their lights are being run by generators, which means when there's a 106-degree heat index, it gets a little warm in there. So in the afternoon, they hop in their pickups and they go call on their top 15 customers. They'll call their other customers. Is there anything we need. Most other businesses are hunkered down, maybe not being there in the same way. We're out there for a pragmatic reason, although you're going to get AC at 1 in afternoon in a [ 106-degree ] heat index, let's be in your truck. But go see your customer, let them know we're there to serve them. Great thing about Fastenal, and thank you to Wade for doing the night shift on Monday morning.\nThe second thing I wanted to touch on is, I want to congratulate our technology team. Last fall, we did a lot -- we're starting some projects around AI or, as I prefer to refer to it internally, FI, it's not artificial intelligence, it's Fastenal intelligence because the source data is our data, and it's a really robust system that we decided to go out and build. And our goal was to roll it out in the second quarter for our folks to start using it. We rolled it out on June 28. It's out there. Our folks are using it, and I had the ability to test it some in early June.\nWhat amazed me, it's scary good what this technology can do. And the way it's set up is, we have a general information it's our chatbot Blue that we created about 5 years ago. And the old system had 130,000, 140,000 [ Q&A payers ]. And based on a probability match, you got what you got. Now you actually get a well-thought-out answer, and it tells you the source of your information and you can look internally at Fastenal only data, so it's Fastenal Intelligence. And if you want to go deeper, you can go externally if you want, but you know the source, and you know how it is, the source of the information is the quality of the information. And sometimes you get what you get when you're on the wild web. But it's great information on general supply chain questions.\nWe've embedded Bob Kierlin's book, the Power of Fastenal people. So there's great leadership insight, if you're asking Bob a question, It's published right now in 30-plus languages. And the next piece we're working on that's going to deploy here in the third quarter is an AI-assisted sourcing tool. And conceptually, what we're after is an employee to be able to look -- hop on this tool and identify what is this item the customer is asking for? What else is it? So I can help rationalize clear product substitutions, depending on if you need it right now, maybe this isn't available for 3 days.\nBut we have 3 things that could substitute for it, what do you need? And then understanding the supply chain. This is readily available. This is difficult to get. And so you can have that discussion with your customer and then understand the market for that. What's the price of the market? What you do you expect to pay for because maybe it's something we haven't sold before. But it really is a tool that's being built, going to roll it out in the third quarter. We're excited about it, and we'll see how that goes from there, but Fastenal Intelligence, not artificial intelligence.\nThird, take a look at the [indiscernible] book, talk a little bit about the quarter. Tough quarter. Net sales grew about 2%. Underlying market remains challenging. EPS was down -- was $0.51, down about 2%. The item I shared with the Board yesterday the team within Fastenal looks in a mirror and says, what are we being paid to do? Are we being paid to defend margin when we're growing 2%? Or are we being paid to figure out how to not grow 2%. The bias goes towards the latter, but we put emphasis on the former as well. And so I think we found the appropriate balance. Does that mean we did everything perfectly? No. There's always room for improvement.\nBut I think we're appropriately balancing where we're going and how to not grow 2% with defending the margin at 2%. As you see in the table on the next slide, I'll get to that in a few minutes, but we continue in that sub-50 ISM, the Purchasing Managers' Index and that's 19 of the last 20 months. We saw a blip in March. That proved to be a head-fake. It's an uncommonly long duration that weighs on U.S. industrial production and consequently affects our daily sales rates because 75% of our revenue is industrial. Our efforts to accelerate our customer acquisition remain encouraging. A year, 1.5 years ago, we had some pretty frank discussions on this call about some missteps that we saw occurring in 2021 and 2022, where our focus on a common goal became blurred. I think there was a little bit too much of what I'm doing and not what we are doing.\nAnd when everyone individually is successful, but we're not successful, something's wrong with alignment. So I aligned all the sales organization under Jeff Watts. Jeff's a proven strong leader of the organization. I have to say Jeff has done a wonderful job in the last 12 to 18 months of pulling this thing together. But it wasn't just Jeff. It's Jeff and his team, it's [ Casey Miller ] stepping up in the U.S. It's Miguel and Tony stepping up international. It's [ Bill Scowsky ] stepping up. And everybody else that supports them, including me stepping up their game to support the sales team as we align on a common goal.\nAnd I think you're seeing that in the second straight quarter of strong oNsite and FMI signings and low double-digit growth in national contract accounts. As I mentioned earlier, we believe we have the right balance for managing our costs, and we continue to maintain this balance. But I have reemphasized with our leadership team and as well as Holden and everybody else it isn't a 2-person endeavor. This is a 23,000-person endeavor. We need to be really tight with spending in the current environment. The one thing that helps us in the latter half of both 3 -- '23, excuse me, in the first half of '24 is we have some wiggle room because of declining incentive comp, that wiggle room keeps getting thinner and thinner, and so we need to be more dialed in.\nAgain, in all frankness, we felt in the first quarter as we were exiting that the second quarter was going to play a little differently. We realized as we went through April, that was not to be the case. And in early May, we tightened it down a bit, and we've tightened down some more here in July. As you would expect from a distribution business, we continue to generate a very healthy operating cash flow, and we have an incredibly flexible and strong balance sheet. The Page 4 is probably a weird chart. I asked Holden, hey, can we just put the table in because I have this nice table of ISM data going back. He's got it going back 50, 60 years or whatever the heck it is, but I have it going back in a decade. We show it because I think it's really good for our investor and our employees to appreciate the environment that we're in.\nAnd so we had all these numbers in there and then Holden came me a couple of days ago and said, we actually can't publish that because that's a subscribed service. I said, \"Well, can you just put in blanks and put a red square, wherever the sub-50 is, so he can at least say magnitude, and he's said, yes, we can do that. So what you see here is a lot of nothing. Except for the fact you can see the duration of sub-50 ISM over the last decade plus 12 years. And you can see that since November of 2022, except for March of this year, we've been sub-50. So we had 16 consecutive months and now 19 out of 20 months. And if you look at that little table in the bottom left, there's 8 periods that Holden highlighted with extended sub-50 PMI ratings. The third one, July of '81 to June of '83 was the longest period. I remember that I was in college, just getting out of high school. You don't realize when you're in college, how bad the economy is other than the -- because you can -- I can find a part-time job.\nUnfortunately, school was a little cheaper back in the early '80s than it is today. But I remember it being pretty tough for my parents and the family farm. The second one is August 2000 to January 2002, about 18 months there, and that was the dot-com meltdown. And from a duration standpoint, the third one is right now, and that was the 16 months that -- so it's 19 months, 18 months and then 16 months duration before we had a blip. But you can see all these periods would have impacted Fastenal negatively. Every one of these 8 that we cite.\nAnd some were severe, some were long in duration. Early '80s was both. I'll let the listener conclude on what you think that should mean to an industrial distributor. Internally, we say, okay, nobody jump out the window, let's focus on what we're doing to add business. Let's focus on what we're doing to grow the business. And for that customer, that's business down [indiscernible] hell out of them.\nPage 5. 107 signings in the second quarter and active sites finished at 1,934. So we're approaching that 2,000 active Onsites, 12% above where we were a year ago. And we grew low single digits, a lot of our older Onsites are negative right now. If you have the bulk of a customer's business and their business is down 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, our revenue will follow suit. If it's OEM fasteners, it follows suit in magnitude. If it's MRO, it follows suit directionally. FMI Technology. When I stepped into this role in 2015, I remember saying to the group, in 2014, we signed 49 devices a day, and we frankly pulled way too many out. There's 2 things we need to do. We have to stop pulling out 20% plus of our installed base. And we have to grow that 49 a day to 100 a day, and we need the infrastructure to do it.\nAnd we slowly built it and slowly built it. 7,188 devices in the first -- in the second quarter, that's 112 per day. Our installed base is now 119,000 weighted devices, an 11% increase from last year. So we're taking market share. We're planting flags, and we're making the business more resilient and efficient. An interesting thing happens. A lot of customers love the technology because they believe in their facility, it steps up their internal game because when they see the OEM fasteners in this Kanban bin that has RFID chips, and it's not messy, it's not chaotic, it's well managed. Maybe you should do that throughout the production line. Maybe you should do that in a bunch of other places, and it challenges everybody in the facility to step up their game and that includes Fastenal.\nSo in the -- we -- about 42% of our sales are now going through an FMI technology. And earlier, I mentioned the impact of the economy. I'll share a few statistics that we get one thing with FMI. You get a lot of statistics on what's going through all these things. So in our FASTStock and that's where we're going out with an Android device that we're scanning bins. And we're managing it with a combination of technology and labor. In January of 2024, we did 16,387 orders per day through scanning technology, and our average order was $224.\nI already shared that from February to March, it dropped from 20 -- it was 225 in February. It was -- it dropped to 216 in March. About 60% of that was volume -- about 40% of that was price. Since then, it's been 216, 214, 217. So our dollars per order is down about $7 from 224. I didn't calculate the percentage here, so I apologize for that. But our orders per day have grown to 17,640 because we're deploying, we're deploying, we're deploying. So we have 1,253 more orders per day, a 7.5% increase. Interestingly enough, when I look at our customer acquisition, we have a number we've always tracked and it's our core accounts. It was maybe more meaningful statistics when we were branch-based and opening branches.\nBut last year, our core accounts was some of the chaos and things we were doing and some execution missteps and some intentional steps. Our cores per day from January to June were down about 4%. This year, they're up about 7%. Part of that is us working through some indigestion, part of that is Jeff and our sales team getting traction. And part of it is just overall execution by everybody supporting them. But bottom line is it's $217 every time we scan a bin and not $224, but we're scanning 7.5% more bins. If I look at vending, and I look at vending, I'm not looking at FASTBin because it's not mature enough to really look at the data because it moves around too much because we're deploying so fast. But we have a lot of vending machines out there. In January, now this is not an order number, this is a monthly number.\nIn January, we did $1,578 per weighted device per day. And recall when we started vending years ago, and I'm old enough and I've been around here long enough to remember those days, we talked about $2,000 when we talked about it with the analyst community. We talked about where can we get that to? We started in the less than 1,000 category. We got it up into that 1,000 to 1,100 and we were stuck there for the longest time. And I have to say our teams and our FMI teams that support them, led by Jeff Hicks have done a wonderful job of challenging and optimizing those machines over time that now we're doing close to 1,600 -- but we didn't do close to 1,600 in June. We did 1,454 per device. So about $124 less, about almost 8% less revenue per device. That's the economy because the -- we've added more devices, as I mentioned, our our FMI Technology is up about 11 -- over 11% from a year ago.\nBut the customer needs fewer things. One advantage to Fastenal in the marketplace is by having our type of supply chain. Not only are we a great supplier and supply chain partner to our customers, we can help them dial their expenses down faster when their business slows down, and it just doesn't pile up because everything is on autopilot. And I believe that makes us a better partner. eBusiness rose about 25%. The eProcurement side is really the driver of that. Our eCommerce side is okay. It's not great. But some of the things we're doing with AI is intended to improve that over time on the unplanned spend side.\nFinally, on digital footprint, 59.4%, that's taking all of our eCommerce, all of our FMI, eliminating the double counting and saying what percent of our business is going through one of those two. It was 59.4% in the second quarter. Actually, in June, it hit 60%. We had expected that maybe we'd get about 66% this year. We now think it's about 63% and that's not because we're not acquiring customers. It's because customers are spending less, and it shows up in our numbers. With that, I'll shut up and turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 6. I think Dan covered the current business conditions. I won't add a lot there, but I can add some additional color from regional leadership. We continue to experience sluggish business activity that has persisted long enough at this point to be spurring an uptick in layoffs and shift reductions. There were more and longer shutdowns around the July 4 holiday. Some of those, frankly, are continuing. And overall, industrial production continues to exhibit modest declines as we saw in April and May, with the key machinery component being weaker than the overall index, and we're feeling that.\nIf I look at our business, total manufacturing grew 2.7%. Our fastener product line was down 3% with contraction in MRO and OEM products. All other end markets declined 1%, reflecting continued contraction in nonresidential construction and reseller end markets. This was partly offset by strong growth in warehousing customers, which, combined with good FMI installs, went a long way to driving our 7.1% growth in safety products. The profile of the second quarter in terms of performance by end market, product and customer size was largely unchanged from the preceding quarter.\nWe did have negative pricing in the period of 30 to 60 basis points. Fastener prices remain down, which is not new, but we also experienced some slippage in price from non-fastener products. I don't want to overstate the impact. I mean our price/cost was very modestly positive in the second quarter of 2024. However, it did ease from where it was in the first quarter of 2024. That's partly from comparisons and the softer market has made things a bit more challenging. Even so, we believe we can improve our own discipline in this area and intend to address the matter in the third quarter of 2024.\nSetting aside the cycle, we are increasingly encouraged over efforts to accelerate customer acquisition. The first half of 2024 has produced strong Onsite and FMI signings and a highly successful customer expo. We are also experiencing accelerating growth now in the double digits and improved mix in a number of our national account contracts. Regional leadership attributes these improvements versus 2023 to better alignment between our teams, a sharpened focus on selling and the relative stability of the business environment, which is allowing teams to focus on winning business.\nGiven our traditional lack of forward visibility, it is unclear when business activity will improve. It's also unclear how impactful holiday shutdowns or the hurricane in Texas will be on July. Even so, barring further erosion in macro conditions, the strong signings activity of the first half of '24 should benefit sales trends in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. Now to Slide 7. Operating margin in the second quarter of 2024 was 20.2%, down 80 basis points year-to-year.\nRecall, in the April earnings call that we discussed a likely impact on the second quarter of 2024 from expenses related to our customer expo and actions taken to support certain warehousing customers in anticipation of additional future business. The combined impact was roughly 30 basis points in the second quarter of 2024 as expected. Some modest impact will carry into July, but the effect on margins in the third quarter of 2024 should be well below what we incurred in the second quarter. Gross margin in the second quarter of 2024 was 45.1%, down 40 basis points from the year ago period.\nThis is primarily due to product and customer mix. SG&A was 24.9% of sales in the second quarter of 2024, an increase from 24.6% from the year ago period. Total SG&A was up 3% due to deleveraging of employee-related expenses customer expo expenses, higher costs for selling-related vehicles as we refresh the fleet and higher general insurance costs. We continue to believe we are effectively spending where we need to spend to support future growth and scrimping where we can scrimp that as growth picks up, we will leverage the P&L. Putting everything together, we reported second quarter 2024 EPS of $0.51, down 2% from $0.52 in the second quarter of 2023.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We generated $258 million in operating cash in the second quarter of 2024 or 88% of net income. While below the prior period, when we were deliberately reducing layers of inventory, the current year's conversion rate is above historical second quarter rates. With good cash generation and a soft demand environment, we continue to carry a conservatively capitalized balance sheet with debt being 6.3% of total capital, down from 9.4% of total capital at the end of the second quarter of '23.\nWorking capital dynamics were consistent with recent trends. Accounts receivable were up 2.8%, driven primarily by sales growth and a shift towards larger customers, which tend to have longer terms. Inventories were down 3.9%, which continues to reflect primarily the softer marketplace, the reduction of inventory layers built a year ago to manage supply constraints and modest inventory deflation. While we will continue to focus on continuous improvement as it relates to inventory management, the rate of decline in our inventory balances will likely moderate going forward as the process of rightsizing our stock is now largely complete.\nNet capital spending in the second quarter of 2024 was $52.6 million, largely flat with $53.9 million in the second quarter of '23. For the full year, we have increased our anticipated net capital spending to a range of $235 million to $255 million, which is up $10 million from the prior range. We anticipate higher spending for vending devices where our mix of signings has been more heavily weighted towards higher cost and scaled units. The projected increase in net capital spending for the full year of 2024 is driven by higher outlays for hub automation and capacity, the substantial completion of an upgraded distribution center in Utah, an increase in FMI to spend -- in FMI spend to support increased signings and higher information technology purchases.\nNow before turning to Q&A, I wanted to offer a higher level perspective on the quarter. The market's tough and the various cyclical forces at play are impacting our growth and profitability. That's not something we control. What we do control is our ability to grow share in the marketplace. A year ago, we weren't as effective as we believe we could be. Today, it's becoming increasingly clear that the changes we made in leadership, approach and focus are favorably impacting our ability to win new customers. Progress is not always a straight line, of course, but we believe we will build on the successes we've achieved in the first half of 2024 and that it brightens our short and intermediate-term outlook regardless of the cycle.\nOf course, we're most excited for what it means for our growth and activity levels among our existing customer base stabilizes. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I'm going to pass it back to Dan. .\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nThanks, Holden. And earlier this morning, as you all know, we put out our earnings release. And just before market open, we put out a second release. Normally, we would have put that release out after the market closed, but it's a Friday, and we didn't want to -- I'm not a politician, so I don't bury news into the weekend. I aspire to be a leader, and we put news out, good and bad, and this is good news. I mentioned earlier about the transition that we had with Jeff Watts stepping into the Chief Sales Officer role. One thing I've learned from Jeff being in that role. First off, the sales leaders have stepped up their game to support Jeff in that expanded role.\nBut of equal importance maybe more important, everybody else has embraced Jeff and Jeff has embraced them back from the standpoint of he's not a salesperson trying to figure out his way outside of sales. He's a business leader who's always had a great relationship with our finance team, with our HR team, with technology, with supply chain. But what he did is he took a big step in the last year, 1.5 years and said, I want to embrace more and I want to learn more and he humbled himself to listen and learn. And he challenged some things back.\nAs a result, we're a better organization. And I'll give you an example. Tony Broersma and his team will overseas the -- our supply chain and distribution. A number of years ago, and we're always doing this, we did a very significant reclass. And what that is, is you're deciding what the stock and distribution. And we removed some stuff. And when Tony stepped into that role, we all challenged him, but Jeff continue to challenge him. But we all challenged him think about supply chain not as what we stock in distribution -- a distribution center. Think about supply chain as how we get product to the customer and where we stage it because we'll be a better organization. I don't care if our inventory goes up or down in distribution.\nHolden cares about our total investment, so do our shareholders, but we really care about how to best serve our customer. And Tony went to work on it and again, was challenged by a lot of people. So we're doing actually a do-over reclass, and we're adding about 18,000 SKUs into distribution in the next 6 months or so. Between now and year-end, he will probably add around $17 million of inventory to our balance sheet. Once in place, some of that will start to burn through. We think that will drop by about 1/3 by March. And we think ultimately, 18 months from now, the net impact is 0 because we're restaging, we're moving stuff around and we're normalizing the quantity on hand.\nWe believe the annual improvement to cost of goods is more than the initial investment in inventory. So that $17 million, we think, is worth about $20 million because when you buy it that way, you're not hurried, you're not scrambling, you buy it more effectively because you can decide where you're sourcing it as opposed to an emergency spend.\nFrom a [ branch ] perspective, not only will they have these 18,000 SKUs available, their workload will actually go down. We cut about 3 million POs a year at the branch and on-site level. 300,000 of those POs relate to this product. So we'll cut our PO workload by about 10% at the branch and Onsite level and enhance our gross margin and our service to our customer at the same time. We think that's a winner. When I think about what Jeff is doing a couple of years ago, I really sat down with the Board and said, I'm turning 60 in November of 2023. You really have to be -- you have to get to know our entire team better.\nI challenge them to -- we scheduled some field trips. We've been doing field trips for the last several years. I challenge them to come to our Employee Expo in December, our customer show in April and meet our leaders. And I really ask them to get to know Jeff Watts better. And we announced this morning that Jeff has been elevated to President of Fastenal. I'm excited for Jeff. I'm more excited for Fastenal because my motivation is simply this, I should say our motivation is simply this. It's a means to grow faster. And I believe Jeff will help that happen.\nI also sat down with John Soderberg. I talked earlier about some of the things John's done and his team have done as it relates to Fastenal Intelligence, not artificial intelligence. And I sat down with John and I said, John, Jeff and I are going to drive you crazy, and I apologize for that, but we're going to punch you from both sides. And we believe we can move even faster. And so I'm excited for everything, but Jeff, congratulations John will try not to drive you too crazy. And to everybody else, supporting Jeff in the organization. Thank you. With that, we'll turn it over to questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Taylor Ranta of the Fastenal Company. Please go ahead, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Ranta Oborski\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2024 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 1 hour, and we'll start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers. .\nToday's conference call is a proprietary of Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today's call is permitted without Fastenal's consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the Internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until June 1, 2024 at midnight Central Time.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call may include statements regarding the company's future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations, and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nThank you, Taylor, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter call. And I'm going to go right to the foot book, Page 3. And my comments on Page 3 can be summarized with 5 statements. First one is a tough quarter. Second one is tricky calendar. Third one is highlighting the customer [ expel ]. Third is strong performance on our growth drivers. And then the final is financially strong and that strength is continuing to build as we've seen in recent years.\nGoing back to the tough quarter. So we grew about 2%. Coming into the quarter, we anticipated a number that was probably in that 4% neighborhood. And the tricky calendar was really a function of January and February are seasonally weaker months for us. Then March starts to pick up as we move into the spring. So having 2 days shifted out of March and into January and February, respectively, wasn't helpful, but that was a known event coming into the quarter. And having the quarter end on Good Friday being in March versus in April is negative. But that's probably more of a function of trying to rationalize and figure out things on the quarter.\nThe truth of the matter is the core issue remains sluggish demand. A positive we saw is after 16 consecutive months of sub-50 Purchasing Managers Index, we broke above 50 in the month of March. And the other day, I chatted with Holden and I said, how long have they been checking the PMI statistics and he said, \"Yes, since early '70s.\" So we did a look and there's been 2 periods that have had longer duration of 16 months. The one would have been in the early 1980s, I believe it was a 19-month duration. The other was in the dotcom meltdown year of the early 2000 that was about a 17 or 18-month duration.\nNow in full disclosures, they were a little bit longer. They were actually more severe as far as where it went into -- how far into the 40s that it went or even into the upper 30s. There were a few other periods, obviously, the '08, '09 period, much shorter in duration, but pretty steep. But we feel positive about the 50 in March, and time will tell if it's a head fake or if it's real. But that speaks to what we think might be happening as we move into the second half of the year.\nThe customer expo, which we'll host next week on the 17th and 18th in Nashville, Tennessee. I'm upbeat about that from the standpoint. One aspect that's challenged us in recent years with customer acquisition has been the fact that starting about 20 years ago, we started doing an employee event or we bring employees in, engage with our suppliers, and it was a great opportunity to hold in the month of December, some planning discussions for the next calendar year but also have a trade show where employees get to interact directly with suppliers and learn about their products, learn about their supply chain.\nAnd also over time, learn more and more about some of the FMI devices that are coming out, which started up in the kind of the 2007, 2008 time frame when we started [ vending]. What we learned a number of years into it that a lot of employees want to bring their customers to this. They thought to be a great means to expose our customer to their supply chain. And we started doing that probably 5, 6 years later, and we've been doing that for many years. In 2020 and 2021 because of COVID, we had to shut down the event. And we felt the impact of that over time, and it shows up in things like on-site signings. It shows up in how we're engaging with that customer.\nWhat I'm pleased to say is after restarting the event in 2022 and continuing it in '23 and '24, in 2024, we were surprised by the overbooked status of the show, and we've had to dramatically expand it. And Holden will touch on some of that in his comments about what that means for the second quarter as far as expenses. But we'll have 50% more people attending this year than did last year, and we'll have double the number of people attending this year than we did last year. I believe that speaks well to our ability to capture market share with that subset of customers.\nAnd that's been challenging us for the last several years because we just couldn't engage in the same way. So it's an expense issue for the second quarter. It's a really high-class expense issue for the second quarter. On the next page, I'll touch on growth drivers. So flipping to Page 4. on-site. We had 102 signings during the quarter. So the number of active sites we had operating at the end of the quarter was up about 12% from what it was in the first quarter of last year. And our sales going through that channel grew low single digits, which tells me that that's where we're seeing the demand issue play out in our numbers is because that number should be closer to what we're seeing in unit growth.\nThe FMI Technology. We signed 105 devices a day, and I believe we've only had one quarter that we've ever done over 100. And if you think back to a few years ago, what we really challenged our team to do back in that 2017, 2018 time frame, we geared up our infrastructure to support 100 signings a day. And we challenge everybody to engage with our customer and to get there. And by 2022, we were doing about 83 a day. In 2023, we have grown that to about 90 a day. And those numbers are based on the average of the first 3 quarters of the year.\nSo last year, we did 92, 106, 95, average of about 98. Officially, we've always said that we want to get that over 100. Internally, what we've challenged our team to do is to get that number up into the 120s. And so we feel really good about Onsite and FMI Technology as far as the progress we're making to take market share. In a similar comparison that I did with the unit growth of Onsite. So FMI, we have 10.5% more devices today than we did a year ago. But you can see some falloff in the revenue per device. And in safety, for example, we grew about 8%. And when I look at our revenue per device, it's down 1% to 2% from a year ago. It's been pretty flat as we've gone through the year so far.\nAnd again, that's a demand. But ultimately, it's a market share. It's a land grab. And so we will take market share by deploying more devices. And then we have to live with what the actual consumption is in those customers, whether it's robust or less than robust. It's a sign of permanent market share, and I'm pleased with the progress we're seeing there. and how it shines through in things like our safety because about half of our vending sales involve safety products.\nE-commerce continues to get nice traction. And our digital footprint continues to expand. We're approaching 60% of sales. And our anticipation is sometime this year, that number will hit the mid-60s, 66 is our target. And ultimately, we believe that ends up being 85% of sales. So on the second page, I feel really good about the progress, but I'll finish where I started. It was a tough quarter, and we feel good about where we're going. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin on Slide 5. Total and daily sales in the first quarter of 2024 were up 1.9%. Q1 is seasonally low volume to start, but this year contended as well with severe weather in January and a good Friday holiday that fell in March for the first time in 5 years, an impact that was compounded by a following on the last business day of the quarter. .\nThis timing is estimated to have cost us 30 to 50 basis points of growth in the quarter. No matter how one treats this noise, however, it doesn't mask that the primary challenge remains poor underlying demand. Industrial production declined slightly in January and February but the components that most directly affect Fastenal such as machinery, were much weaker than the overall index. Overall, end market and product dynamics are unchanged from prior periods. Total manufacturing grew 2.6%, continuing to moderate from prior periods, while our fastener product line was down 4.4% with contraction in MRO and OEM products. This reflected soft industrial production, particularly for key components such as fabricated metal and machinery, and in the case of fasteners, negative pricing.\nNonresidential construction and reseller continued to contract though at moderating rates as we experienced easier comparisons. Sales into warehousing, which are the fulfillment centers of retail-oriented customers remained healthy in the first quarter of 2024, albeit not quite at levels experienced in November and December of 2023. This, combined with good FMI signing contributed to 8.3% growth in sales of safety products. The tone of business activity from regional leadership is best characterized as steady at weak levels. We are encouraged by the forward-looking PMI moving above 50 in March for the first time since October '22. However, current conditions remain better defined by the string of sub-50 readings that prevailed in the latter part of '23 and at the start of 2024.\nNow to Slide 6. We Operating margin in the first quarter of 2024 was 20.6%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. Looking at the pieces, gross margin in the first quarter of 2024 was 45.5%, down 20 basis points from the year ago period. Product and customer mix was a drag, partly offset by slightly positive price/cost, which continues to recapture the negative price/cost that we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, with stocking levels largely rightsized, we experienced an increase in product movement across our network, which produce leverage of internal and external trucking resources, was 24.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2024, an increase from 24.6% from the year ago period.\nTotal SG&A was up 3.2%. Occupancy and other SG&A expenses were well contained, increasing just 1.5% collectively. The deleverage was from labor costs, which increased 3.9%, which included a 3.3% increase in average FTE in the period and substantially higher health care costs. The consistent low growth in SG&A over the last 5 quarters reflects the Blue Team doing a good job, spending where appropriate to support growth and scrimping where appropriate to preserve margin, but at some point, sales growth is the core issue.\nAnd as growth accelerates, we believe we will leverage the P&L. That said, I wanted to provide a little color on some factors that may affect margins in the second quarter of 2024. First, we continue to make investments in travel, hardware and personnel to support near and intermediate-term growth. This won't necessarily to any greater degree than was true in the first quarter of 2024, but it was a reason for deleverage in the period and could be again if growth doesn't accelerate in the second quarter.\nSecond, the expansion of attendees at our customer expo will result in an increase in expenses in the second quarter of 2024 on both an annual and sequential basis. Third, our success solving customer -- certain customers' supply chain challenges in the fourth quarter of 2023 has created opportunities to service these customers at greater scale in the future. This will require certain near-term investments to ensure that we can meet these customers' needs.\nThe latter 2 items could impact second quarter 2024 operating margins by approximately 30 basis points. We do not expect these costs to carry over into subsequent periods. Putting everything together, we reported first quarter 2024 EPS of $0.52, flat versus the first quarter of 2023, with net income up just slightly at up 0.6%.\nTurning to Slide 7. We generated $336 million in operating cash in the first quarter of 2024 or 113% of net income. While below the prior year, when we deliberately reduced layers of inventory, the current year's conversion rate is consistent with historical first quarter rates. With good cash generation and a soft demand environment, we continue to carry a conservatively capitalized balance sheet with debt being 5.5% of total capital down from 10.9% of total capital at the end of the first quarter of 2023.\nWorking capital dynamics were consistent with recent periods. Accounts receivable were up 5.5%, driven primarily by total sales growth and a shift towards larger customers, which tend to have longer terms. Inventories were down 9.4%, which continues to reflect primarily the reduction of inventory layers built a year ago to manage supply constraints and modest inventory deflation. While we will continue to focus on continuous improvement as it relates to inventory management, the rate of decline in our inventory balances will likely moderate going forward as the process of rightsizing our stock is largely complete.\nNet capital spending in the first quarter of 2024 was $48.3 million, an increase from $30.9 million in the first quarter of 2023. This increase is consistent with our expectations for the full year where we anticipate capital spending in a range of $225 million to $245 million, up from $161 million in 2023. This increase remains a result of spending for hub automation and capacity, the substantial completion of an upgraded distribution center in Utah, an increase in FMI spend in anticipation of higher signings and in information technology.\nNow before turning to Q&A, I wanted to offer a higher level perspective on the quarter. Quantitatively, as Dan noted, it was challenging. But qualitatively, it was an encouraging quarter. We've touched on our disappointment with the pace of customer acquisition over the past several quarters and the changes made in mid-2023 to begin to address this. We view customer enthusiasm for our Expo, the solid performance of our growth drivers and trends in our contract business as manifestations of those efforts starting to take root.\nChange takes time and success can be uneven. However, we do believe we are seeing good indications of progress, which should reaccelerate market share gains as we proceed through 2024. With that, operator, we will turn it over to begin the Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Taylor Ranta of Fastenal Company. Please go ahead, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Ranta Oborski\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2023 Annual and Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 1 hour and will start with a general overview of our annual and quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.\nToday's conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today's call is permitted without Fastenal's consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the Internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until March 1, 2024, at midnight Central Time.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call may include statements regarding the company's future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nThank you, Taylor, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the Q4 Fastenal earnings call. I'm going to go right to the foot book, and on Page 3, we have a handful of slides here. So 2023 has seen 2 struggles in our organization. One, since November of 2022, so for 14 consecutive months, we've seen a sub-50 PMI that when you operate very heavily in the industrial space, that's a big deal for you. And there's many benefits that Holden as part of our organization. One is his career before joining Fastenal, he has access to -- he's forgotten things about stuff that I don't even know. And so I asked him. I said, \"Hey, how often does like this happen?\" And he said, \"Well, back to 1970, it's happened 6x that it's been sub-50 for an extended period of time, most recent being the Great Recession in the '08, '09 time frame. But it's a pretty tough period, nice. Okay. And so it's been pretty tough and you could look at that.\nBut the second item, the second struggle is we've executed better. And in 2022, and we put up good numbers. Inflation helped some, the rebounding economy from COVID helped some. The fact that we're pretty good at supply chain and we were able to find stuff and keep people supplied helped because if you can't get it anywhere else, you come and get it from us. But there was some stuff under the hood that we weren't executing as well as we'd like to see. And we made some leadership changes earlier in the year. And I think we're poised really well as we go into 2024. But those are a couple of things that challenged the year.\nDespite all that, in the fourth quarter, we grew our daily sales 3.7%. The team did a really nice job managing expenses. We had a few things that -- sometimes you have a few things that go your way. Sometimes, you have a few things that go against you. On par, things were generally favorable, and we grew our EPS 8.5% to $0.46. If I think of our growth initiatives, kind of uneven. We've continued to see nice development in our installed base of Onsite locations, maybe not as fast as we'd like. FMI devices, we did a really nice job. And we continued to increase our Digital Footprint that we've talked about in recent years.\nOperating cash flow was a record at over $1.4 billion of operating cash that we generated, and it was a 52% increase of what we did in 2022. Now on the surface, that's a little bit misleading because 2022, and I'll touch on that in a second, consumed a lot of working capital because we were ensuring a reliable supply chain for our customers. That brings us to the final bullet on the page, and we paid out a fifth dividend, paid out $0.38 per share here in December. That's the fourth time that we've done a supplemental dividend like that since going public back in the late 1980s. The first time was in December 2008. The world was in free fall. We had cash available. We looked at that cash as being -- this is owned by our shareholders. We don't know what needs they have for liquidity. We do know we won't need this in 2009 if the economy is doing what it does because our business is countercyclical. And we knew we'd throw off a lot of cash. And so we paid out a sizable dividend in December of 2008.\nDecember of 2012, there was a lot of uncertainty in the United States. The federal government was having a fight amongst itself about what tax rates should be on dividends. We didn't know if tax rates were going to go up in 2013 and figured we're sitting on a bunch of cash. Let's pay out to our shareholders and we don't need it. We'd generate a lot of cash in the future. We'll pay it out and let the folks in Washington, D.C. figure things out. It's nice to know that in today's Washington, D.C., things are much more calmer. Sorry for the sarcasm, I'm Midwestern.\nDecember of 2020, the world was in COVID. We had more cash than we needed and we paid out a supplemental dividend. This one is different than the other 3. We invested a tremendous amount of cash into inventory in 2021 and 2022, an incredible amount because supply change became erratic. You can't count -- it was not a reliable time frame of getting containers through ports and getting products. And we're not a sorry company. We don't say to our customers, sorry, couldn't get it. We're a supply chain company. And if we feel that it's going to take an extra 40 or 45 days to get a container, we'll add 50 days of inventory, 6 days of inventory. So we consumed a tremendous amount of cash.\nFortunately, things have become more stable and we harvested that cash in 2023, and we'll generate ample cash as we move into '24 and beyond. We didn't need it. We sent it to our shareholders. We feel we have a really conservative balance sheet, and we have plenty of gunpowder for anything that we need to do as we move into 2024.\nFlipping to Page 4. 58 signings in the fourth quarter of '23. Not a particularly impressive number. Perhaps the environment came a little bit tougher late in the year for signing Onsites. It's not the strongest of year for many of our customers. Perhaps we had some district managers that are looking at their expectations for 2024 and maybe some Onsite signings split into 2024. We're up 12.3%. We finished the year with 1,822 locations. Our older Onsites had a pretty tough year. That speaks more, I believe, to the PMI index than anything else. But we still anticipate 375 to 400 signings next year. We think we're poised to do that. We think the energy is behind it and we think the team is really focused on it. And that speaks back to some of our execution issues I mentioned on the prior page.\nFMI technology. We had a good year with FMI. We did a nice job of signing. If I look at just below the bullet where we say we signed 24,126 MEUs, you divide that by 253 days, that's 95 per day over the span of the year. One thing we've talked about a number of years ago was building our infrastructure to support signing [ 100 devices ] a day. And that was a long way away from what we were doing at the time, but that was kind of the number we had in our head. And I'm pleased to say that the team has essentially gotten there, and it came in at 95 per day for the year. Our intention for next year is to sign 26,000 to 28,000. It's a big number. I believe the team is up to it.\nE-commerce continues to grow well. A lot of that, obviously, we're not growing 28%. So a lot of that is customers are changing how they engage with us. And we're not unique to that. And so I believe e-commerce as a potential of our business is about 25% of sales now. If I go back not too many years ago, it was 5% of sales. So it continues to grow.\nAnd then finally, our Digital Footprint. That's where we engage electronically with our customer. It might be we deploy FMI. So a vending device, a bin with technology embedded, a mobility scanned bin, whatever it might be, but we engage with our customer and then we added the e-commerce on top of that, removed the double coning. And in January of 2020, that was 36% of sales. A year later, it was 38%. A year later, it was 46%. A year later, it was 53%, and now we ended this year at 58%, 59% type of neighborhood.\nFlipping to Page 5. This is the last time you're going to see this chart. We started it a number of years ago. Back in -- so we have about 3,419 in-market locations. It's up 3.5% from where we were a year ago. Back in 2015, about 9% of our in-market locations were what we call an Onsite. Now an Onsite might be we're physically inside the customer's facility. We are operating in a facility down the street from the customer that's dedicated to that customer. We might be operating a facility that's in the back of a branch because the customer doesn't have enough room for us to put everything in there, and we only put there and we backfill -- our backroom is the back of the branch. But it's where we engage in a discrete business with the customer and it ramps up our ability to grow.\nAs we really look at this as being not just something that had happened once or twice back in the '90s. And the first one was, frankly, we couldn't find a building to rent in town and the customer said, \"I have some room,\" and we moved in. So it was more borne out of necessity. But as we realized this was really a business model that could help us grow, it prompted us to revisit our branch network. And so we peaked out in 2013. At that point in time, we estimated we were within a 30-minute drive of 95% of the manufacturing base in the United States with our 2,600-or-so stores or branches, and that included our U.S. and Canadian network.\nBut we looked at it and said, if we pulled that back a bit because some of the business that would be in a branch is going to be an Onsite over time, what would it look like? And we settled on a number of about 1,450. At 1,450 locations, that 95% access to the manufacturing base drops to about 93.5%. And we know if there's customers that are outside that 30-minute window and they're Onsite customers, the fact that our branch is 4 to 5 minutes away doesn't matter. So we saw this as the right density.\nAnd I'll use some -- I'm always -- one beauty about being an organic grower of the year is all of our systems are in 1 system. You have access to a tremendous amount of information. And I did look at our oldest 4 states in the company. And if I go back to 2007, in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, we did just under $400 million in revenues, about 19% of our sales. We had 236 branch locations in those 4 states. We had 20 Onsites. In the next decade, that business -- those 4 states, we grew -- our CAGR was about 5.7% a year. And as you can appreciate, it's a nicely profitable business. It's above the company average by a few hundred basis points. And about 18% of our revenue was Onsite.\nSince 2017, we've closed -- since 2013, we closed a bunch of locations, but we opened a bunch of Onsites. In fact, we've gone from 200 -- we peaked out at 263 branches. Currently, we have 191 so we're down about 30% from our peak. Our Onsite count says over -- is 221, so we have more Onsites than we have branches. In the last -- since 2017, that area has a CAGR of not 5.7%, it has a CAGR of 8.2%. So we took an old, mature, profitable part of the Fastenal business and grew it faster.\nToday, it's about a $1.1 billion business. It's about 15% of our sales and about 46% of our sales run through an Onsite. Sorry for taking us down memory lane there, but I thought I'd give a little insight on why we're excited about the rationalization of the branch network and the Onsite and the potential to expand our ability to grow. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 6. Total and daily sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 were up 3.7%. The quarter finished strong with daily sales in December being up 5.3% and outperforming historical sequential patterns. Much of this strength relates to our warehousing end market, which represents sales into the fulfillment centers of retail-oriented customers. This end market has grown significantly for us since the pandemic, helping to diversify our end market exposure and representing 3% to 4% of sales in 2023. It also grew 45% in the fourth quarter and roughly 60% in December. So strength in this end market was a significant contributor to the performance of our other end markets and our safety products categories in the period.\nNow if you remove warehousing, our sales results continue to reflect sluggish demand. For example, our manufacturing end market continues to grow but at moderating rates, while our fastener product line experienced contraction in MRO, and for the first time this cycle, OEM products. Trends in these markets and product categories tend to be more reflective of cyclical trends and are being impacted by PMI readings that remain sub-50 and soft industrial production, particularly for key components such as fabricated metals and machinery. This setting is matched by muted feedback from regional leadership. But if conditions didn't get better in the fourth quarter of '23, they didn't get worse either. If we adjust warehousing out of our November and December daily sales rates, then the months would still have been very slightly ahead of normal sequentials.\nAs was the case in the third quarter of 2023, pricing was consistent and positive and within a typical range of 0% to 2% with modest deflation within our fastener line. With the usual caveat that our forward vision is limited, we are constructive about 2024 with easier comparisons, channel inventories being in good shape and generally favorable customer outlooks from regional leadership. Entering the year, though, business activity remains subdued.\nNow to Slide 7. Operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 20.1%, up 50 basis points year-to-year and achieving a 33% incremental margin. We view this as solid execution against the backdrop of soft growth and low seasonal volumes. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 45.5%, up 20 basis points from the year ago period. We had year-over-year margin drag from product and customer mix, though the effect did moderate sequentially. This was offset by slightly higher fastener product margins and freight margins, though the impact of the latter moderated meaningfully from the prior quarter and we had slightly positive price/cost. Our view of price/cost is unchanged from what we described in the third quarter of 2023. It does not reflect any incremental pricing actions in the most recent quarter but rather the recapture of the negative price/cost that we had discussed in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our objective remains to be price/cost neutral over time.\nSG&A was 25.3% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2023, improved from 25.7% in the year earlier period. This amounts to small improvements in a lot of areas rather than significant improvement in just one or a few areas. For instance, more favorable comparisons and good expense discipline produced flattish costs and modest leverage around selling-related transportation, information technology and spending on travel, meals and supplies. We experienced modest occupancy leverage as a result of vending devices used in a past lease locker program passing their depreciable lives. These were joined by contributions stemming from improvements in our supplier contribution collaboration programs. The Blue Team did a nice job tightening spending over the course of the year as business activity continued to slow. Putting everything together, we reported fourth quarter 2023 EPS of $0.46, up 8.4% from $0.43 in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We generated $354 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2023 or 133% of net income and $1.43 billion in operating cash for the full year of 2023. Both dollar amounts represent record operating cash generation that was driven by reduced working capital needs. This produced strong cash balances that allowed us to pay a supplemental fifth dividend in December of 2023, putting cash returned to shareholders through dividends at $1.02 billion for the full year. Even with this, we finished 2023 with a conservatively capitalized balance sheet with debt being 7.2% of total capital, down from 14.9% of total capital at the end of 2022.\nWorking capital dynamics were similar in the fourth quarter of 2023 to what we experienced throughout the full year. Accounts receivable were up 7.3%, which is primarily a combination of total sales growth and a shift in mix towards larger customers, which tend to have longer terms. Inventories were down 10.3%, owing primarily to the effects of slower customer demand, the unwinding of inventory layers built a year ago to manage supply constraints, our field and hub operations, sustainably streamlining inventory processes and modest inventory deflation.\nNet capital spending in 2023 finished at $161 million, little changed from the $162 million in 2022 and below our forecasted range of $180 million to $190 million. This shortfall has less to do with deliberate project deferrals than it does the slower business activity reducing the need for certain investments to support immediate growth and timing delays outside our control for certain expenditures. Our net capital spending expectations in 2024 is a range of $225 million to $245 million, which reflects catch-up spending for hub automation and capacity, the substantial completion of an upgraded distribution center in Utah, an increase in FMI spend in anticipation of increased signings, and information technology.\n2023 had its successes. While acknowledging that we didn't hit all our goals, we nonetheless closed the year with a higher installed base of Onsites and FMI devices and a greater proportion of our sales moving through our Digital Footprint. The organization adapted to 1 less selling day and slower growth than originally anticipated, effectively controlling expenses and defending our operating margin. We improved our balance sheet and produced record operating cash, which allowed us to return record capital to our shareholders. Where we fell short of our expectations was in our ability to generate stronger sales growth. However, we are enthusiastic about the leadership changes made to our sales operations in 2023 and regardless of macro conditions, expect these to lead to improved market share gains in 2024. With that, operator, we'll turn it over to begin Q&A.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nBefore we start Q&A, there's a few items I thought I'd share from a conversation we had this morning with our senior leadership from throughout the company. And part of it was sharing with them a little bit of a recap of our Board meetings over the last couple of days and some thoughts on the quarter and some thoughts on 2024, and I just thought I'd share.\nFirst, some thoughts on the P&L. And Holden touched on some of these, but I thought I'd present it maybe in the way we talked about it with our own team internally. First one was when I think of 2023 and then going into 2024, so this is the last year that we've had -- that we'll have some branch closings. Branch closings do 2 things for us. They do free up a little bit of occupancy. What we've found over time is typically when we're consolidating 2 locations into 1, some of that occupancy savings is spent on maybe a larger location for the 2 locations because the business doesn't fit, or as we've seen in the last -- during the COVID period, a lot of buildings that we operated in became really attractive buildings for a lot of local distribution points for a lot of e-commerce. So there is some competition for the space and competition doesn't make it cheaper.\nBut with that said, there's -- we've benefited from some occupancy savings there. Those benefits are going to be behind us, and we need to be thoughtful about that as we enter in 2024. There's a flip side of that coin. Consolidating 2 locations in 1 is a heck of a lot of work, and it's a big distraction to the business, to our customers. And that distraction of our own selling energy, our own local energy is now behind us. And the challenge we put in front of everybody is make sure that's translated into selling activity to grow the darn business.\nThe second, we had the benefit in 2023 of some lower bonus payouts, benefit to the P&L, not a benefit to the recipients. But 2022 was a really good year for us, and a lot of our folks are incented off of simple growth in earnings. And we grew earnings tremendously in 2022, with that falling off as we went into 2023. That contracted the bonuses. We don't anticipate having that benefit in 2024 because we don't anticipate the P&L doing what it did in 2023. And that means we need to be really dialed in on everything else we do so that can re-expand.\nThe final piece, Holden touched on it, some vending depreciation, we had a runoff and then benefited the fourth quarter. The beauty of that is it will also benefit the first quarter and the second quarter and the third quarter until we anniversary that. So that will give us some benefit in 2024. The next 1 was a challenge to everybody on that call, whether you're in sales or not is our focus has to be on everything we're doing. It's helping our branch and Onsite locations hit their goal. In fact, I had to laugh after -- certainly after the call, and I suspect I need to thank John Soderberg for this. But out on the printer, there's a sign, \"Help our brands and Onsite hit their sales goals in 2024.\" Thanks for that, John.\nBut that's where our head is at. We didn't feel good about 2023, and the best way to feel better about it, grow a little faster. My compliments to our team that worked on ESG. A few years ago, we were probably a little bit slower to it, primarily because our operating style, frugality is naturally conserving. And as we stepped into the ESG world, what we really learned is we needed to do a better job telling our story. And I've been pleased to say that while we've maybe formalized up some of our public-facing policies and things like that, most of the efforts we put into it is understanding what we do. It's a lot of work quantifying some things that we do but really telling a better story.\nAnd here in January, I'm pleased to say, for those of you familiar with EcoVadis, that's a rating agency per se for ESG. We had a bronze in the past. Here in January, we were upgraded. We now hold a silver in EcoVadis. I'm not aware of any other North American distribution businesses that have silvers. Perhaps there are some. I'm not aware of any. So my compliments to the team for doing a great job telling our story.\nFinally, earlier this week, I had an opportunity to tour our shop, and I say an opportunity. I've done it before. Tim Borkowski has led a big piece of our manufacturing for 29 years. Retired this week. And Tim is famous for giving you a 20-minute tour but taking 60 minutes to do it because he loves what he does. He loves to explain it. He loves to describe it. Must be an engineering background thing. But I had a really nice visit with him with a handful of us that touring it. And 1 challenge I put out to our regional leadership today is I said, during COVID, we wore them out with virtual tours. And that's kind of gone radio silent in the last 2 years.\nAnd I said to the group, I said, \"When customers see our capabilities, it sells itself.\" We have 1,822 Onsites. We plan to sign close to 400 in the next 12 months. Well, I would think there's -- if just the Onsite each did a tour over the 253, 254 days of the year, that's 7 a day. Let's wear them out. Because right now, our own internal manufacturing capabilities represents between 9% and 10% of our fastener sales. We're really quite good at it. So when customers see that, that makes us special in their eyes. With that, I'm going to shut up and open it up to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Taylor Ranta of the Fastenal Company. Please go ahead, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Ranta Oborski\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to one hour and will start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers. Today's conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today's call is permitted without Fastenal's consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the Internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until December 1, 2023 at midnight Central Time. .\nAs a reminder, today's conference call may include statements regarding the company's future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations, and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully. I would now call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nThank you, Taylor, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our third quarter call.\nI'll start on the reference to the flipbook on Page 3. Conditions remain challenging in the third quarter of '23, reflected in a daily sales growth rate of 4%. Still regardless of the year, we celebrate milestones when they occur. I remember just over 10 years ago, when we hit 10 daily sales for the first time, we recognize that on this call as well as internally to celebrate that milestone. Some years later, we hit 20, here in the month of September, we broke $30 million in sales per day for the first time in our history, and my congratulations to the Fastenal organization for hitting that milestone.\nOur sales growth in the quarter translated into EPS growth or EPS of $0.52, 4.1% growth over the same period last year. Our results reflect the unique profile -- product profile of our business. Fasteners still constitute about 1/3 of our sales. And within that subcategory, about 63% is an OEM-oriented fastener. And that business can be very cyclical because of the production needs of each of the customers we're serving. If you look at the rest of the business, it tends to be much more MRO oriented. Our fastener daily sales, as you've seen in our monthly sales release have decelerated at a faster rate than our non-fastener business as we've gone through the calendar year.\nThe third quarter margin hit was 21%, which matched last year despite the one less selling day. And so earlier, I spoke about the $30 million we do in a day. The quarter had one less day. Many of our -- some of our expenses are tethered, most are not. And so pleased that the team was able to match the operating margin of 21% from last year. But I believe that understates the reality of the performance. If you looked at it on a same-day basis, we believe we would have increased the operating margin because we had roughly $10 million more, about 1/3 of that $30 million in operating income because good chunk of that flows through because of the change in the nature of the expense. The Blue Team, if I think about the last several years, we had a unique opportunity to serve the marketplace because of our pristine balance sheet.\nWhen COVID hit the goal back in 2020, we were able to step forward and secure and purchased and fund with cash, a meaningful increase in inventory primarily centered on safety supplies because our customers and society in general needed something to get through that period, and we were proud to be part of the solution. We were able to do that because of our balance sheet. As the global economy reemerged from the pandemic we saw firsthand, and you saw it in daily news clippings about the congestion that was going on in supply chains around the planet. Again, as supply chains became more rocky and you couldn't rely on how many days it would take to get product. There's a solution to that. It's stock more products. And we beefed up our balance sheet and our cash flow suffered as a result, but I believe our standing with our customers and in the marketplace never perform better because the market could rely on the covenant that Fastenal provided to them in being a great supply chain partner.\nAs we move deeper into 2022 and now in 2023, we've been able to unwind a piece of that. And as a result, on a year-to-date basis, we have converted 121% of our net earnings into operating cash flow. That's our highest performance in a decade that's averaged just shy of 100, about 95%.\nIf I look at it from the standpoint of relative to a year ago, in the quarter, operating cash grew about 51%. Year-to-date, our operating cash has grown 69%. Again, part of that is a reflection of the investments we made to serve our marketplace and our ability to unwind that in the current environment and translate it into cash flow for the organization to serve our shareholders and to serve the business as we move into the future. Our on-site and FMI installed bases and our digital footprint continue to expand. And earlier this year, we did some restructuring, and we announced the elevation of Jeff Watts, the Chief Sales Officer in the organization. We did some restructuring of the sales side of our organization because we wanted to double down on the challenge we had put in place in front of everybody going back to the 2015 time frame, and that was really stepping into what we saw as an untapped opportunity to grow our business faster, and that was to expand our on-site presence. It was earlier this year that for the first time, the number of Onsites in the organization outnumbered the number of branches in the organization, and that delta continues to expand.\nAnd we believe that each of our district managers has the potential in their market to land 2 Onsites per year. And it's our job and part of the restructuring of the sales team was to really decide, hey, we believe it, but we haven't done it. Let's do this thing. We expanded not too many years ago, we were signing 80 Onsites a year and we laid out the plan to get to 400 a year. We expect -- as you see on the next page, we'll do about 350 this year. But we haven't hit that number and we've been kind of stuck.\nNow COVID threw some challenges our way. It's never an easy time to move in with somebody when they're trying to isolate from the rest of the world. And that challenged our ability to grow coming out of COVID. But looking at the opportunity that's out there, I believe we can do that. We need to turn that belief into reality.\nFlipping to Page 4. Speaking of Onsites, we did sign 93 in the quarter. So our active sites are 1,778, 13.5% greater than they were at the end of third quarter of 2022. In our daily sales in those on-sites, excluding transferred business when you open an Onsite is in the low double-digit rates. So we're seeing good growth there. We're just not signing enough. And as I said, we still anticipate signing roughly 350 this year. FMI technology, there we set [indiscernible] goals as well. We said, can we do 100 a day, not 100 quarter, but 100 a day of our weighted device count. We did 5,969 during the quarter [indiscernible] versus 81 a year ago. It's performing really well here. We're not at the 100. The 100 is a goal, and we will push and push and push until we get there. But I'm really proud of what the team is doing, and you see that shine through. When you look at our sales by product line and our monthly and quarterly releases. One thing you do see is our safety business grew almost 10% in the month of September. And a lot of that could be attributed to the success we're seeing in FMI. And it's our anticipation, we'll sign between 23,000 and 25,000 MAUs this year. And that's a combination of FASTBin and FASTVend. E-commerce, we can -- it's still in the scheme of things, a relatively small piece of our business. It's just under 25% but it's up from single digits not too many years. And it currently grows -- it grew about 41% during the quarter. And that's really a case of the marketplace saying to us, we'd prefer to purchase from you this way and our team in the field and our team and technology, building an ever better mousetrap to serve into that market. As I've shared on prior calls, we still have a ways to go on this piece of our business because a chunk of e-commerce, is that unplanned spend, and our goal is to keep making that easier for our team to do in the field.\nFinally, if you roll up FMI and e-commerce, we talk about our digital footprint. How much of our revenue is touching some digital aspect of engagement. We were at 57% in the quarter versus 49.5% a year ago. Our challenge to the team is targeting 60% sometime before we exit this year. And our long-term exetation, is still at that 85% we've talked about in the past that we believe will be part of our digital footprint as we move into the future. In addition to our earnings release, there's several 8-Ks that have gone out around the earnings time, and I thought I'd share just some insight on the 3.\nThe first one, and I believe it went out yesterday evening after market close, we announced as we do typically on a quarterly basis, a dividend, we bounced to $0.35 dividend, which is consistent with the dividend we paid in each of the first 3 quarters of the year. We also announced a few leadership changes. One is, is a press release we put out, one of the individuals that's been very influential in our ability to beef up our inventory during COVID and wrap it back down and overseeing the distribution and transportation teams as well is Tony [indiscernible]. Tony has been with the organization of roughly 20 years, and he's demonstrated through a career and we identified that we lay out his career in the press release, the different roles he's had, but he's demonstrated excellence. And yesterday, I asked the Board of Directors to elevate him to Executive Vice President over operations. So essentially elevating his role in that his responsibility will be largely unchanged from what we had previously, but it's recognizing his performance and what we see in the future of Tony within the organization.\nSecond filing one out. It's a required filing related to one of our officers who has decided to move on to a new chapter in his career. And it's Terry Owen, our Chief Operations Officer. I have known Terry for many years. He's been with the organization. I believe all told, he's been with the organization about 28 years. The official documents say it's 24.5 because he was in the earlier years, part of time with the organization, but then came full time and had a break in service there. But Terry has demonstrated a career of exemplary service to the organization. We've had some conversations in recent months about some aspirations he had in the -- he's looking at the number of years he has left in his career and what he wants to do as he moves into his next chapter life. He discovered an opportunity we thought was quite compelling that would serve his desire for the future as well as his family. Terry relocated to the East Coast of the U.S. several years ago for family reasons. And all I can say that Terry is your good friend. I wish you best of luck in your next endeavor. And thank you for the team that you developed, Tony being one of them, but thank you for the team you developed.\nThe organization has always prided itself on our ability to build leaders and promote from within. And every time we see a person decide to take a new chapter in life, whether that's after retirement or going into a family business or whatever the case might be. We always see another layer of talent right behind that person ready to step in and discover their future and their opportunity. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nThank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on the slide deck on Slide 5.\nTotal sales in the third quarter of 2023 were up 2.4% and adjusting for the fact that we had one fewer selling day in the quarter, our daily sales were up 4%. Frankly, the dynamics of the quarter varied very little from the second quarter of 2023. Macro data points and feedback from the regional leadership continue to point to sluggish demand and a cautious outlook for spending and production. We are certainly encouraged by the improvement in our September daily sales rate to up 5%. However, it seems to have more to do with easing comparisons in certain parts of our business than a clear signal of firming customer demand or brightening outlooks. Dynamics around our products, customers and end markets have also trended similarly over the past 3 and 6 months. Manufacturing grew 6.4% despite soft demand, benefiting from further growth in the Onsite installed base and initiatives in national accounts in the field to target key account plan spend, which is disproportionately manufacturing-oriented. Non-manufacturing was down 1.3%, though the rate of decline moderated as we began to hit easier comparisons in nonresidential construction, reseller and warehousing customers. From a product standpoint, fasteners are relatively weak at down 2% due to their more cyclical profile and rapid pricing moderation.\nIn contrast, nonfastener products remain healthy, due to further growth in our vending installed base and improved comparisons. As it relates to pricing, it remains positive but has come back to a range of 0% to 2% that we consider to be typical under normal economic conditions. We did experience very modest deflation within our fastener product line.\nNow to Slide 6. Operating margin in the third quarter of 2023 was 21%, equaling our margin from the third quarter of 2022. We typically believe that given mid-single-digit daily sales growth, we should be able to defend our margin. However, that we were able to do so despite the headwinds related to the one fewer sales day that Dan described in his prepared remarks, points to what we believe was more effective cost management by the Blue Team relative to the second quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 45.9%, flat in the period from the prior year. Freight remained favorable, reflecting modest leverage of our captive fleet expenses, reduced use of external freight providers, lower fuel and reduced shipping costs. We also benefited from the absence of last year's $3.4 million glove write-down and slightly positive price/cost. These favorable variables match the margin drag related to product and customer mix. The impact of mix was slightly less negative and the impact of price/cost was slightly more positive than anticipated at the second quarter call. We did not take any incremental pricing actions in the period and the favorable price cost in the current period largely regains the negative price cost we discussed in the third quarter of 2022. We expect price cost to trend neutral in coming quarters. SG&A was 25% of sales, up from 24.8% of sales, mostly due to the [indiscernible] we experienced modest payroll leverage with lower incentive pay, reflecting slower growth in the third quarter of 2023 versus the third quarter of 2022. This was more than offset by rising information technology spend, an increase in general insurance costs, increased expenses to maintain our selling-related truck fleet and higher bad debt\nRelative to the second quarter of 2023, the organization tightened its management of discretionary expenses with spending on travel, meals and supplies being down 0.6% year-to-year and continued moderation of growth in our FTE count. Putting everything together, we reported third quarter 2023 EPS of $0.52, up 4.1% from $0.50 in the third quarter of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 7. We generated $388 million in operating cash in the third quarter of 2023 or 131% of net income in the period. Cash generation is traditionally strong in third quarter, though conversion in the current quarter was stronger than it's historically typical. This reflects reduced need for working capital as demand slows down and improvements in inventory. The resulting strong cash flow means our balance sheet remains conservatively capitalized at the end of the third quarter of 2023 with debt ending at 7% of total capital versus 9.4% in the second quarter of 2023 and 14.9% in the third quarter of 2022.\nYear-over-year, accounts receivable were up 5.4%, which is a combination of sales growth and the impact of mix due to faster growth of larger customers, which tend to have longer terms. Inventories fell 9.8%, slower customer demand reduced working capital needs. We are unwinding inventory layers built in late 2021 and early 2022 to manage supply chain constraints. And our field and hub operations have sustainably streamlined inventory processes. Our days on hand fell again to 134.6 days, the lowest since 2002, which reflects improved velocity of inventories through our internal network, a reduction of retail stock in branches and improvements in stocking processes. We reduced our net capital spending range to $180 million to $190 million, down from $210 million to $230 million. This largely reflects timing and deferrals related to hub automation and expansion projects that we do expect to be included in next year's capital spending plans.\nThe third quarter of 2023 profiled very similarly to the second quarter of 2023. We continue to experience stagnant demand, a cyclical shift favoring non-fasteners and a secular shift favoring larger manufacturing-oriented customers. Growth driver performance is not quite where we would like it to be, but it's at levels that continue to support good growth in our installed base, success in providing differentiated value to our customers and further cost and asset efficiency. Operating margin performance remained stable despite the slow growth and our capacity to generate cash to reinvest in the business remains strong. We did begin to experience easier comparisons in certain markets, and our management of discretionary expenses improved [indiscernible] quarter. We continue to believe we are positioned to meaningfully accelerate sales growth when underlying demand improves while sustaining strong profitability and returns.\nWith that, operator, we'll turn it over to begin the Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to hand the call over to Taylor Ranta of Fastenal Company. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nTaylor Ranta Oborski\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nGood morning, everybody, and thank you for our second quarter earnings call. Before I start on Fastenal matters, I'd like to share a message. When I joined Fastenal back in 1996, one of the things that was unique in my joining is that I stepped into the role of Chief Financial Officer, [ Bob Carlin ] offered me the opportunity. And so I joined in an unconventional way in that I didn't start in a branch or in a distribution center and work my way up through the organization. And sometimes when you join an organization that promotes from within, you're not sure kind of reception you'll get when you join.\nOne of the first people I met was [ Colleen Quad ], it was [ Bob Kerlin's ] sister. She had retired in a retirement. She worked for Fastenal a few years in sales support. One of the nicest ladies I ever met, and we lost [ Colleen ] earlier this year. And to her children and grandchildren, you have my condolences and as well as to Bob on the loss of your sister. What a wonderful lady, and we were all blessed to know her.\nWe started back in 67. So our 5 founders aren't in their 20s anymore. And [ Van McCann ] -- [ Henry McConnon ], he goes by Van, he was our first employee. In fact, I think that's how he earned his stake in Fastenal, did well with that stake, and I'm proud of them. He lost his wife Wilma earlier in the year and the same message. Van was -- could not have been more of a welcoming person to me when I joined the organization, and [ here's ] my condolences in the lost of his wife to spring.\nWith that, I'll move on onto the Fastenal quarter. Second quarter '23 is a challenging quarter. Last fall, when we -- or last December, when we had our leadership meetings and our planning discussions for 2023, the ISM had weakened. We knew that 2023 was going to have some slugging aspects to it. We warned -- we cautioned our team. Second quarter and third quarter will be tough quarters to get through and prepare yourself, prepare your teams from the standpoint that we're going to have to manage our expenses really well. We'll have to keep all of our heads skewed on the right way because there's been -- it's been an interesting number of years between tariffs and COVID and congested supply chains and inflation and all this stuff, there's noise, noise, noise. We're going to experience something we have experienced for a number of years, and that's a slowing economy and prepare for what that means and get the muscle memory back.\nBut it was a challenging quarter. Our earnings came in at $0.52, rising about 4.5%. Softer manufacturing activity led our data sales growth to decelerate. We grew 5.9% in the second quarter. We did not leverage. That's an important element of our business. Our sales grew 5.9% but as we're cycling through some mix changes and Holden, touch on a little more detail. Our gross profit dollars grew about 3.6%, and our operating expenses grew 4.1%, and I'm not real good with math, but I know that's not a good combination if you want to leverage your earnings.\nAnd one of the elements is we didn't anticipate it softening quite as much as it did and that 4.1% needed to be a little bit lower. We didn't adjust our variable costs quite quickly enough.\nAs we've seen in prior time frames when the economy is weakening and it affects our ability to grow, the high amount of working capital on our balance sheet really can influence our ability to generate cash and given my old role as CFO, second quarter is a painful quarter for us typically because we have 2 tax payments. And when you're a profitable organization, you operate a lot of business in the United States, you pay a lot of good tax. And so second quarter hits us really hard. And normally, we -- for every dollar in earnings, we generate $0.60 to $0.70 in operating cash flow. I don't recall us ever having a second quarter where we generated more cash -- operating cash flow than earnings perhaps Holden will cite an example where we did. But -- and maybe it was 2009. But that's a strong cash flow as we've ever seen for this time of year.\nAnd it also -- and a chunk of it is from not just what's happening in the economy and the working capital needed to fund receivables and to fund inventory for growth. In the last several years as supply chains were really getting congested, the message that I made very clear to our supply chain folks and our teams, we have a covenant with our customer, and that is worded supply chain partner, we will not let our customers down in their supply chain. If that means we need an extra 15 and extra 30, an extra 45 days of inventory, don't get ahead of yourself, but we need to have inventory to support the business, period. And when the ports on the West Coast of North America were getting congested, the economy is turning back on, everything was getting congested, we beefed up our inventory. We started -- we were harvesting that. We were doing it in the first quarter. We're doing it this quarter. I think the team has done a wonderful job. It means we have capacity now to look at our balance sheet and say, where does it make sense to make strategic investments in inventory.\nI'm not saying there's stuff on the table right now, but that discussion can be had, whereas a year ago and 2 years ago, we couldn't really even think about it because we were focusing all of our energy on something else.\nIn the second quarter, we made some leadership changes. First off, Jeff Watts, who's led our international -- whp joined Fastenal back in 1996, so he's been here for 27 years and started in our Canadian organization when we were -- when we had just a handful of locations in Ontario. He's led our international sales efforts since 2015, and he will oversee all of our sales efforts across the planet. And obviously, we know each other really well. The team in the U.S. -- international knows them really well because he's led that team for quite a few years. But the U.S. team is no stranger to a 27-year employees. So we know each other well, but I believe we'll have greater coordination on our efforts. And Jeff has a very entrepreneurial approach to how he leads a business, and I welcome him and look forward to the success he's going to see.\nTerry Owen, who's been in EVP Operations role, we formalized this role and that he's our Chief Operating Officer. And this bullet was added kind of late in the process. I found out yesterday as a team that I should mention this since we had announced it this quarter. And there's an error in our release. I thought I'd let you know and it's probably not material in the true aspects of life. But it is Terry has been here 28 years, and I know he joined in June of 1999. And if I do the math, I think it's 24. So sorry, we didn't catch that error in our process.\nBut in conclusion, cyclical factors aside, the last several years, we've taken a lot of steps to improve both our labor and our inventory productivity. And I believe this forms an excellent foundation for our ability to generate long-term share gains in the marketplace.\nSwitching to the next page. Onsites, I'll state the obvious. 86 Onsite is a disappointing number. Our aspiration internally has been to drive that to 100 per quarter, 400 per year. That's been our stated aspect mentioned internally. Prior to COVID, we hit 362 and that was a ramp-up from 80 in 2015 to 176 to 270 to 336 to 362 per year. When COVID came along, it really impaired our ability to sign Onsites because the last thing you want when you're worried about people being around you is inviting a bunch of folks of Blueshirt to come in and operate inside your 4 walls. And so we saw that drop dramatically.\nWe recovered to about -- we did 356 signings last year. We broke 102 out of 4 quarters. Perhaps some of the leadership changes we made in the last 60 days created some distraction, perhaps we're not as focused as we should be. But that number needs to be 400 a year or more. And right now, we've adjusted our number. We think we'll probably come in similar to last year, somewhere in the 350s. And with that said, the fact that our Onsites are up, we have 15% more Onsites than a year ago. That's a great number. We're just not building the pipeline the way we need to.\nFMI Technology, that's a different story. So our goal in Onsite is 100 a quarter. Let's get there and then figure out how we take it to 110, 120, but let's get to 100 first. Same with FMI technology, it's not 100 a quarter, it's 100 a day. And I'm pleased to say in the fourth quarter -- excuse me, the second quarter, we did 106 per day. And that's market share gains. That's us going out and planting new flags in new locations to improve the supply chain for our customer, illuminate the supply chain for our customer and us being a great supply chain partner. That's a huge positive. I believe it tells me the marketplace is conceding the space to us. Maybe I'm wrong on that, but I believe it is because we are so far out ahead of the marketplace.\nYear-to-date, I told the Board yesterday we're with the 106 this quarter, we had our Board meeting yesterday, with 106 this quarter, we're at 100 year-to-date. I misspoke, we're actually at 99 but I'm really pleased with what the group is doing there. And the 39.8% of our sales went through our FMI platform in the second quarter. New flash, it was 40% in June. So we hit the number -- we hit 40%. Now we need to get to 45% and 50% but continue to see really nice progress there.\nE-commerce continues to grow handsomely for us and grew about 45% in the quarter. For us, this has been a different journey than other things because a lot of e-commerce is on planned spend. If you think about our FMI Technology, that's all about plan spend. That's stuff you're using daily, weekly, every month in your business and it makes sense to stage it accordingly. E-commerce, a lot of that is stuff that you're having on to order. So it's unplanned. Historically, not a strong suit for us. And I'm pleased to say it's growing to be a bigger piece of our business. It's, as I mentioned, 45%. The EDI portion of it is up 37%, and that's typically larger customers.\nThe web portion of it can be large or small, and that's up almost 70%. And to give you a magnitude of how that's changed, and again, we're not great at this piece of the business, but we can be. But with that said, in 2015, when I stepped into this role, the web portion of it was less than 2% of sales, and we were at $3.8 billion, $3.9 billion of the company back then. So about $75 million going through web sales back in 2015.\nIn 2023 in the second quarter, it was 6.5% of sales. So right now, we're on a 12-month run rate of about $7.5 billion. So that's a business that's approaching $500 million, and we're not that good at it, but we can be. And so it's 6.5x bigger than it was a handful of years ago. And obviously, it's been accelerated by the events of the last few years, COVID is a perfect example. What really accelerated as people do -- some people are working remotely. Some people are ordering a lot more stuff electronically. We're seeing that in our numbers, and we're getting better at it every day.\nAnd when you push the FMI technology and the e-commerce together and you think about our digital footprint, that was 55.3% of sales in the second quarter of '23, was 47.9% a year ago. We thought we could get to 65% this year. We've tweaked it to 60%. I don't know if I completely agree with our language there about FastStock conversions. I think it's really -- part of it is the case of we're doing more and more every day. But some of the activity, because a lot of the FastStock, for example, is going into fastener installs. It's going into OEM production areas, it's going in the MRO production and we're doing more transactions every day. However, the transactions are a little bit smaller because industrial production is slowing down in our business. And so we might be doing more orders.\nThere are just fewer of them. And I'll cite you a few statistics. In January of 2022, our FastStock, we did 234,000 scans of orders through our tool, which is 11,100 every day. So our employees are going out with an Android device and scanning 11,100 planograms every day and generating about a $250 order. Actually, it's closer to 260. And then in January of this year, that 11,100 had grown to 14,700 and between January and June, that 14,700 scans per day is now 16,300. That's a combination of market share gains and conversion of -- instead of going out with a yellow note pad, we're going out with an Android device in scanning bins. And so that's a huge win in our system from efficiency. It's a huge win from a standpoint of ability to take market share.\nBut looking at the numbers, our average order size was $258 in calendar 2022. And in January, that number had dropped to $246. So it was down about 4.7%. And I think there's enough transactions going on there that, that's probably more a tone of the economy than anything else because when you're doing 300,000 a month, it's not a mixed thing. Between January and June, the $246 order dropped about $222, so it's down $24, which is 9.6%. That's primarily activity that's declining in the industrial marketplace. And there might be an element between January and June of a little bit of deflation because there's some fasteners in there, but it's mostly about activity.\nJust thought I'd share those start to get in the weeds. And I will share one last thing before I turn it over to Holden. And that is, again, this FastStock tool, this Android device that we have out there. In October of -- excuse me, in the summer and fall of 2019, we did a beta version out in the Southern California of that device and work through some bugs, work through some bugs and started rolling it out to regions late in the year with a planned 2-year rollout. COVID-hit and we accelerated that rollout, and we rolled it out across the company by June of 2020. So we rolled -- we had a 2-year rollout in 6 months. And today, that's about 12% of our revenue.\nThe -- in October of this year, we plan to roll out what we call our order pad, which will be on the same device. It will be a internal-facing device and use it in beta for -- in the October time frame. If all goes well, our goal would be to roll it out in Q4. And essentially, it's a tool for our personnel when they're out visiting a customer, not only can I take a recurring order, I could easily take a customer asking for something or I can do a search on it, and I can respond to the customer right in front of them. That's a capability we've never had and we plan to have -- we expect to have that by the end of this year for 2024.\nA second piece, that's an internal facing app. We've also developed an external-facing app called [ FastScan ], it's with beta customers right now. Our goal is in August to have that out in the Apple store and the Google Play for customers. If they choose to download that, and that would be a bin stock app for customers. It's primarily smaller customers or customers that might be a few hours from a facility in Montana or in Western Canada, where they can do some bin stock scans themselves, transmit the orders so when we visit, we aren't surprised by a stock out, and it makes for a better supply chain for that customer base. That will be, again, coming out in August.\nAnd depending on what we -- the success we find with our order pad, our goal would be next summer to roll that out in the customer-facing app as well. Again, we're not great at the web portion of our business. It's a $0.5 billion business within Fastenal now, but we can be, and we're building tools to do that because we think that's a better reaction to some of the buying habits that's going on in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. One loose thread there perhaps to pull a little bit. Last time we had cash conversion of this level. It was actually in the second quarter of 2020. For those who don't remember the second quarter of 2020, there was an event occurring at the time that we now know as the pandemic. But I really think it reinforces the point. It took a once-a-century event to create a second quarter that despite several tax payments, produced cash conversion in that 100% range. And the fact that our teams are able to do that in a quarter where thankfully, there has not been anything remotely looking like a pandemic. Again, I think really gets to the the success of the teams in managing kind of the post-pandemic environment. So yes, but it does take a condition of that sort.\nJumping into the details on Slide 5 of the deck. Daily sales increased 5.9% in the second quarter of 2023. Since March, we have seen overall business activity moderate, which culminated in June daily sales growth of up 4.7%. The most meaningful change in trend has occurred in our manufacturing customer. This segment grew 10.4% in the period despite sustained sub-50 PMIs and flat to negative industrial production. This reflects the impact of our investment in Onsite and greater sales focus on key account plan spend which tends to be significant within manufacturing. Even so, we did experience weaker sequential in May and June that represents a macro-driven change from the long string of strong sequentials that we had from 2021 to February of this year.\nAs it relates to pricing, they contributed 190 to 220 basis points to growth in the period, declining approximately 470 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and approximately 100 basis points from the first quarter of 2023. This trend is not a surprise and will likely continue in the second half of 2023.\nOther factors cited in recent quarters, specifically weakness among some large retailer customers, lack of growth in our rest of world geography and contraction in our construction end market remain factors in the current quarter, but the dynamics around these areas were largely unchanged from prior periods. While we continue to pursue key account plan spend in construction, this market has historically had a disproportionate amount of smaller transactional spend where we are currently putting less emphasis. We believe this shift contributes to manufacturing outgrowth, better labor leverage and better asset efficiency.\nWe have experienced manufacturing-driven weak sequentials in 3 of the last 4 months. Regional leadership continues to characterize customer sentiment as cautious with greater scrutiny over operating and capital spending and some mention of slower or deferred orders. As usual, we have limited forward visibility, but most indicators seem to be pointing to the immediate outlook remaining soft.\nNow to Slide 6. Operating margin in the second quarter of 2023 was 21%, down from 21.6% in the prior year. The incremental operating margin was 11%. Gross margin was 45.5%, down 100 basis points in the prior year. This decline is almost entirely due to product and customer mix as we experienced widening sales growth outperformance of non-fasteners over fasteners and of Onsite growth over non-Onsite growth.\nFreight was favorable gross margin, reflecting record freight revenues that allowed for good leverage of our captive fleet, reduced use of external freight providers, lower fuel expenses and reduced shipping costs. The benefits of freight were offset by higher organizational or GAAP expenses. Reductions of purchasing and shipping activities of imported products, stemming from a smoother and more predictable supply chain relative to the year ago period caused higher prior period cost to be relieved from the balance sheet to the P&L. The impact of price cost was immaterial to gross margin in the second quarter of 2023.\nOn the operating expense side, we produced 40 basis points of leverage, which was not sufficient to fully offset the decline in gross margin. This was due entirely to payroll expenses, of which we experienced 60 basis points of leverage, which was related to lower incentive compensation of last year's record level. This was offset by modest deleveraging of both occupancy costs and other expenses.\nThere were 3 distinct elements playing out in our operating margin in the second quarter of 2023. First, I alluded to the GAAP expenses. The GAAP expenses had the convergence of a difficult comparison, aggressive inventory reductions and shortening product order cycles. This alone is a 50 basis point negative impact and is unlikely to repeat by anywhere near the same magnitude in the second half of 2023.\nSecond, certain expenses such as 16% growth in IT spending and 13% growth in cost for FMI devices represent planned and prudent investments in our business, the impact of which is magnified by the slower sales growth environment.\nThird, the [ Blue Team ] did not adjust spending quickly enough to the slower macro environment with the variable cost for meals, travel, supplies, all increasing double digits. Also, while lower incentive compensation produced leverage in the second quarter, we continue to have growth in headcount and part-time hours that exceeds sales growth. I would expect us to tighten this spending appreciably in the third quarter of 2023.\nPutting everything together, we reported second quarter 2023 EPS of $0.52, up 4.6% from $0.50 in the second quarter of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 7. We generated $302 million in operating cash in the second quarter of 2023 or approximately 101% of net income in the period. Traditionally, normal second quarters have a conversion rate in the 60% to 70% range. So this is a strong cash performance relating to a reduction in the use of cash for working capital versus the prior period. This allowed us to reduce debt with debt ending at 9.4% of total capital in the second quarter of 2023, down from 13.7% in the first quarter of 2022 and from 10.9% in the first quarter of 2023 -- I apologize, 13.7% in the second quarter of 2022.\nYear-over-year accounts receivable was up 6.1%, largely tracking sales growth with the impact of mix due to faster growth from larger customers, which tend to have longer terms being offset by improved receivables quality. Inventories fell 6%. This is a function of normalized supply chains, allowing us to unwind inventory layers we had built up in late 2021 and early 2022 to manage that period's product bottlenecks. That process will likely continue, though likely to a lesser degree, throughout 2023. It is also notable that our days on hand fell to 138.5, a level not seen since 2002, which reflects improved velocity of inventory through our internal network, a reduction of retail stock in branches and improvements in stocking processes. We have significant strategic flexibility in inventory at this point.\nWe have retained our range for net capital spending in 2023 of $210 million to $230 million, reflecting higher spending on hub investments, fleet equipment and IT equipment. At the same time, we have deferred certain projects related to slowing demand that suggest our capital spending will be at the low end of the range.\nThe second quarter of 2023 was obviously challenging. We expect to have better cost comparisons and to more tightly control those costs that we can affect in the second half of 2023. Obviously, we have little control over end market demand. Whatever direction that takes over the next 6 months will influence our profitability. However, these shorter-term issues shouldn't cloud the structural improvements to our business.\nThe second quarter saw record labor productivity they create some significant strategic flexibility in our inventory and further improvement in our return on capital, as reflected on Page 9 of the investor presentation. We believe we are positioned to strongly outgrow the market, particularly as the industrial cycle stabilizes and improves. With that, operator, we'll turn it over to begin the Q&A."

Welcome to the Fastenal 2023 First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Taylor Ranta of Fastenal Company. Taylor, you may now begin.\n\nTaylor Ranta Oborski\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 1 hour and will start with a general overview of early results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.\nToday's conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today's call is permitted without Fastenal's consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the Internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until June 1, 2023, at midnight, Central Time.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call may include statements regarding the company's future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations, and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Fastenal Co.\n\nThank you, Taylor, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the first quarter Fastenal earnings conference call. The -- this call is a little different for Holden and I today because we're at the site of our customer expo that just finished up yesterday. And really pleased with the event. A lot of great customer engagement. One thing nice about the event this year is some of the natural things that were occurring, obviously, 2 and 3 years ago, we didn't have an event because of COVID. Last year, we had an event, but we had to limit the attendance and also because of international travel, we had to limit the attendance. This year, we didn't have those restrictions, so we had a great event.\nAnd there were four areas of focus to the theme of the event this year. One was continuing to accelerate our customers' digital transformation to give them better visibility to what is happening inside their four walls, inside their facilities. The second one was really securing their supply chain. The world has seen a lot of change and a lot of impacts to supply chains over the last several years and really allowing our customers the opportunity to think about their supply chains continually in a more strategic way as we move forward.\nThe third was power and productivity. A lot of this digital transformation, understanding the elements of your supply chain. It's also about bringing productivity to your -- whether it's your production floor or some element of your operation, we provide the tools to do that. And then the fourth piece was understanding our customers' goals and sharing with them ways that we can serve their goals when it comes to their journey in ESG. And I think those four points resonated well throughout the event.\nNow moving on to the quarter. So first quarter, we had earnings per share of $0.52, an increase of 10.5% over last year. The team had really strong expense management during the quarter and pleased with the incremental margin we were able to produce despite the fact that as you saw in our monthly numbers, the March daily sales came in a bit softer. We're in now our fifth month of ISM below 50% and it had ticked down in March. And we're seeing that in our business, particularly in the fastener side, the OEM piece of the business. And -- but despite that, really impressed with our team's ability to manage through it.\nAs is -- as we've talked about in prior years, we've done a really nice job of managing pieces of our business if we compare to pre-COVID and post-COVID. And I'm sorry for that beeping in the background. My laptop's here and -- but if you look at operating costs as a percentage of sales, in the first quarter of 2019, operating costs were 27.8% of sales. In the first quarter of 2023, they were 24.6%. And it's really about all the changes we've made to the organization. A, our average branch is larger today than ones back in 2019. More of our business is coming from Onsite. We've done a nice job of digitizing our business to bring efficiencies to it, and you see that shining through.\nThe other piece is as we understand better our engagement with our customer and their needs, and as supply chains have improved globally, we've also been able to not only lower our days on hand of inventory from what we were seeing 1 year ago as we -- in 6 months ago, as we deepened our inventory but where our business was prepandemic. So we've taken about 3 weeks' worth of inventory out of the network over that entire time frame and really impressed with our team's ability to do that.\nFinally, if you manage your business well, manage your expenses well, managing your working capital well, it's a distribution business, you see that show up in your cash flow. So our operating cash flow was $389 million, which was 132% of earnings and was 70% higher than a year ago. And so about $160 million of additional operating cash that we generated in the quarter. Our CapEx -- net CapEx, is very similar in both periods. So a very strong free cash flow, which puts us in a position to invest in the business or return to our shareholders. And we continued that pattern and was able to pay out a nice dividend in the first quarter. And then last night, we just announced the second quarter dividend, and -- of about $200 million a quarter, we're paying out right now in dividends.\nMoving to Page 4 of the [ foot ] book. So Onsite, we signed 89 in the quarter. Active sites finished at 1,674, so about a 16% increase from first quarter last year. If you ignore the transferred sales that come from the branch when we open an Onsite, our Onsite business grew about 20% Q1 to Q1, so strong performance. We remain steadfast in our intention to sign 375 to 400 Onsites this year. Number was a little bit weaker in the first quarter, and most of that we saw in March. And -- but when I think of the engagement going on at the event here the last several days, I feel good about where we're going to be in the next 6 months.\nIf I look at FMI technology, an incredibly strong performance by the team this quarter. We've talked in the past about this idea of we build infrastructure to support 100 signings per day. And during COVID, our numbers dropped from the upper 70s, low 80s neighborhood as we build up towards that ability to sign 100 a day. We dropped down in the 60s. And it's slowly -- start our way back. Last year, in the first quarter, we signed 83 a day. This year, in the first quarter, we signed 92 per day. In the month of March, we signed 99 per day. So really strong performance by the team. And you can see that continuing to expand in our platform. Our FMI for the quarter was 39.4%. In the month of March, we broke 40% for the first time ever. And really pleased, and we feel good about our goal of signing between 23,000 and 25,000 for the year.\nAs we've seen in prior quarters, we continue to see really strong growth in e-commerce. Recall that last fall, that broke 20% of revenue for the first time. I believe this quarter, we're at about 22%. And then finally, if you roll all those pieces together, our digital footprint came in at 54% of sales versus 47% a year ago. And in the month of May -- March, excuse me, we hit 55%. And our goal is to drive that to 65% later in the year. Time will tell if we're able to accomplish that with a long-term goal of -- we believe that number is about 85% of our business is going through some type of digital footprint.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nSenior EVP & CFO\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. Before diving into the details of the quarter on Slide 5, I wanted to build a little bit on Dan's earlier comments in his prepared remarks to offer a little bit of perspective on the overall state of our business.\nIf you recall, simultaneous with the onset of the pandemic in 2020, Fastenal accelerated its technology deployment and shifted the structure and priorities of our sales effort. Those actions are adversely affecting short-term sales, though we continue to grow our Onsite and FMI basis as well as our Digital Footprint penetration, and we continue to achieve historical levels of market outgrowth. This also adds an incremental annual mix-related gross margin pressure.\nHowever, those changes need to be weighed against the benefits of the rest of our business. Relative to the prepandemic business, we have begun to generate meaningful labor productivity and reduced the cost footprint of our facilities. As a result, the incremental margin from the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2023 of 24% is appreciably greater than what we saw from the first quarter of '15 to the first quarter of '19 of 16.2%, and we've improved our capacity for leverage over time. At the same time, from the first quarter of '19 to the first quarter of '23, our inventory days have declined from 175 to 154 days despite inflation and supply chain disruption. And our receivables days have fallen from 56 to 55 days despite growth in our national accounts mix.\nThe Blue Team has sharpened our differentiation in the marketplace while sustainably improving the leverageability of our cost structure and lowering our asset intensity. We're a stronger, more productive business today than we were prior to the pandemic, and that is very clear in these first quarter 2023 results. So let's jump into those.\nDaily sales increased 9.1% in the first quarter of 2023. February storms had a modest 20 to 40 basis point negative impact, while currency was a 70 basis point drag. There are several other items affecting sales. First, pricing continues to moderate. It contributed 290 to 320 basis points to growth in the period, down approximately 290 basis points from the first quarter of 2022 and down approximately 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022. This trend is not a surprise and will likely continue through 2023.\nSecond, we continue to see weakness in several major retailer customers, our international business and our construction and reseller businesses. These dynamics are unchanged since the third quarter of 2022. Our retailer customers have tightened their belts with respect to facilities and labor, which also affected our non-North American business, along with a strong dollar in geopolitical events. Softer construction reflects the conscious decision we made to position our branches to focus on larger key accounts, which is contributing to better labor leverage.\nThird, manufacturing and large accounts continue to perform strongly, reflecting investments in Onsite and changes to our branch structure and sales roles. Even so, we did see a downshift in broader market activity in March as represented by slower DSR growth of 6.8%, including just 2.3% daily growth in fasteners.\nNow 1 month does not make a trend. It's too early to have a good read on April and we don't have a lot of forward visibility. We do continue to anticipate that we will outgrow our marketplace, which frankly isn't growing right now. However, the quarter did finish on a softer note.\nNow to Slide 6. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2023 was 20.2%, up from 20% in the prior year. The incremental margin -- incremental operating margin was 22.7%. Gross margin was 45.7%, down 80 basis points from the prior year. This decline is entirely due to product and customer mix as we experienced widening sales growth outperformance of non-fasteners or fasteners and Onsites over non-Onsites. Price/cost was still negative year-over-year, but narrowed meaningfully versus the fourth quarter. The remaining gap is largely in our other products category, where pricing actions in the first quarter of 2023 only went into place in February while in fasteners lower costing eliminated the negative price/cost we experienced in the second half of 2022.\nGAAP expenses were higher with inbound shipments declining as we adjusted our stocking to reflect a smoother supply chain. And then on the other side of the ledger, contribution to margin from freight was better than anticipated. We saw annual and sequential declines in both container costs and containers purchased on the import side and record freight revenues allowed for good leverage of our captive fleet expenses. These dynamics are likely to persist for the next couple of quarters.\nOn the operating expense side, we generated 20 basis points of leverage from occupancy costs as branch closings over the past 12 months produced a slightly lower facility expense. We generated 80 basis points of leverage from payroll expenses. Total incentive pay for the company in the first quarter of 2023 was the second highest on record for our first quarter. However, with pretax growth in the first quarter of 2023 being roughly 1/3 of the pretax growth in the first quarter of 2022, total incentive pay for the company was down high single digits. Other operating expenses benefited from lower bad debt costs, lower selling-related transportation costs and higher profits from asset sales which was largely offset by higher costs for IT, general insurance and sales-related travel. Putting it all together, we reported first quarter 2023 EPS of $0.52, up over 10% from $0.47 in the first quarter of 2022.\nNow turning to Slide 7. We generated $389 million in operating cash in the first quarter of 2023, or approximately 132% of net income in the period. I'll provide a bit more color in a moment, but this improvement in our conversion rate reflects working capital swinging from a significant use of cash in the first quarter of 2022 to a source of cash in the first quarter of 2023. This strong cash flow allowed us to reduce debt in the period, putting net debt at 10.9% in the first quarter of 2023, up slightly from 10.4% in the first quarter of 2022, but down from 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nYear-over-year, accounts receivable was up 7.3% on higher customer demand and an increase in the mix of larger key account customers, which tend to have longer terms. And this was partly offset by an improvement in receivables quality. Inventories rose 3.2%. Inflation was not a material contributor to inflation growth in the period. Further, as indicated earlier, normalization of global supply chains is allowing us to unwind the layer of inventory that we intentionally built up in late 2021 and early 2022 to manage what had been significant product bottlenecks. We believe the process of rightsizing inventory will continue through 2023 with additional releases of cash as the year progresses.\nNet capital spending in the first quarter of 2023 was approximately $31 million. Our range for net capital spending in 2023 remains $210 million to $230 million, and our first quarter spending being behind that pace reflects timing of expenditures. Over the course of 2023, we expect higher spending on hub investments, fleet equipment and IT equipment.\nWith that, operator, we'll turn it over to you for questions and answers."

Florness\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Fastenal Company\n\nThank you, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call, and Happy New Year.\nIf you -- some highlights on the quarter. I'm on Page 3 of the flip -- of flipbook. So our daily sales grew 10.7% in the quarter, eased a bit from what we've seen in recent quarters, primarily because of tougher comparisons to what we were seeing in the fourth quarter last year, but also some moderating demand. I'm pleased to say that our fourth quarter operating margin remained stable at 19.6% and our ability to generate cash.\nSo we're looking at our cash conversion, it returned to historic levels. And that's really a sign of moderation and the level of inflation that we're seeing in the marketplace. But also a more stable supply chain and the ability to not need -- that for a double negative, not need to expand our stocking levels to ensure a reliable supply line for our customers. So it gives us some flexibility as we go into 2023. Very pleased to see that.\n2022 was a year of milestones and they all centered on $1 billion. So in October, our e-commerce revenues surpassed $1 billion for the first time ever. Our -- and that's on an annual looking at annual milestone. Our international sales exceeded $1 billion. We hit that milestone in the month of November. And as noted in the release this morning, our company-wide net earnings topped $1 billion for the first time ever and that was for calendar 2022.\nWhen I look at that chart on the upper left, it's hard to decide where do you start explaining all the noise you have really over the last 3 years, as we went through COVID, as we emerged from COVID, as we went through supply chain disruptions and an inflationary period. So I chose to not and just compare to 2019 from the standpoint of what was our cumulative sales growth in each of the quarters of this year because I think it tells a more stable story and talks about the things that we've built.\nSo in the first quarter of 2022, we were 28.1% larger than we were in the first quarter of 2019. This expanded to 30% in the second quarter, expanded to about 31% in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we're about 35% larger than we were in the fourth quarter of 2019. Now you shouldn't conclude from that, that, Geez, that expanded 7 points from Q1 to Q4. Because in all -- in full disclosure, 2019 was weakening a bit as we went through the year.\nI would see this as ignoring COVID, ignoring supply chain, ignoring inflation, we're 30% bigger than we were 3 years ago, and I think that's a testament to the business model and to the team executing the model and the marketplace, recognizing Fastenal for what it is, a great supply chain partner to their business. If -- and I'm pleased to say, I think we're exiting the pandemic stronger than we entered.\nThe -- we experienced margin pressure in the fourth quarter, and Holden will touch on that in more detail later in the call. Fasteners were challenging, but we understood what's going on there, and we knew what was coming. The safety, I would say the same thing, it's challenging -- like anything is challenging, but we knew what to expect there. And I think on these first 2 buckets of fasteners and safety, we understood it, and we managed through it quite well. The remaining product lines, a lot of those products, aren't as prevalent in the recurring pattern, the planned spend component of our business, whether it be through the vending portion of FMI or the BIN or the FASTStock portion of FMI. And so it takes different tools and different means to manage that. And we had some challenges there. And again, Holden will touch on a little bit more later in the call.\nWhen I look at the final piece and the reason we were able to maintain a stable operating margin, we've done a really nice job with headcount. We did add a few more people in the fourth quarter than I would have liked to have seen. I suspect some of it is after a period of being really difficult hiring and as it eased throughout the year, there are some spots that we needed to fill, that were filled. But when I look at it in totality for the year, we've really done a nice job. And I'll touch on it a few more -- a little bit more in a few minutes, but we've done a nice job in the last 3 years as well.\nFlipping over to Page 4 of the flip book, the -- Onsite, we had 62 signings in the fourth quarter and finished with 1,623 active sites, so up about 15% from a year ago. The -- if you ignore the sales at transfer over when we opened an Onsite, where it's an existing customer, we grew our Onsite-based revenue in the high teens and reiterate our goal for 2023, our intention is to sign 375 to 400 Onsites next year.\nAnd I'm pleased to see, for us, we often talk about participation inside the organization. Just over 80% of our district managers signed an Onsite back in 2019, and when society closed up and folks weren't as excited about us moving in to stay with them during the day, our -- that participation dropped dramatically as our Onsite dropped in both 2020 and 2021.\nI'm pleased to say in 2022, 80% of our district managers signed at least 1 Onsite. Now would I prefer to see that go to 85% or 90%? Sure, I would. But 80% is a nice threshold to get above again because we have done it once before, and that was in 2019. So my congratulations to the team.\nFMI Technology. We signed 4,730 weighted devices in the fourth quarter, that's 76 per day. A year ago, we were signing 64 per day. And the activity through our FMI Technology platform represented almost 39% of sales in the fourth quarter. That was 35% a year ago and 27% 2 years ago. For 2023, our goal is to sign between 23,000 and 25,000 MEU devices, whether it be FASTBin or FASTVend.\nE-commerce, the next piece of our, what we call, digital footprint, daily sales rose 48% in the fourth quarter. Again, incredible traction in that area. We've really seen that traction move in the last 3 years, partly a function of COVID, and I think a lot of people are seeing those kinds of patterns, but also -- we've gotten better as an organization and our ability to execute on e-commerce, and that's times through the numbers as well. So EDI and punched out catalogs and really large customer-oriented e-commerce was up 45% and our web sales was up almost 60%.\nLooking at our digital footprint. So that's looking at FMI plus the piece of e-commerce that doesn't come from FMI was 52.6% of sales in the fourth quarter, and that was 46.5% a year ago. Our goal is 65% of net sales going through our digital footprint next year. In the interest of full disclosure, that's an aggressive goal, but it's our goal nonetheless.\nIf I flip into Page 5, we put this table in the release last January as well. And it's really intended to show over time what's really happening to our network. And that is, as FMI becomes a bigger piece of our business, as our mix of customers changes, as e-commerce becomes a bigger piece, you rationalize your footprint because you need for a footprint change. So you can see in 2013, we peaked out, and I'm going to start at the bottom of this set of bullets and work my way up.\nSo in 2013, looking at our data, we had a 30-minute access to about 95% of the U.S. manufacturing base. And this is just looking at the U.S. branch network because the Canada follows a similar trend as far as what you've seen in the number of branches, whereas the rest of the planet are continuing to open locations because we're quite young there.\nLooking at the 1,450, which we think is the ultimate number we get to for branch count, the -- in the U.S. and Canada, the U.S. piece of that where we have really good data, we think that 95% drops to about 93.5%, which we think is incredible coverage and puts us in a great position to be a great local supply chain partner and still have a really efficient network. And you're seeing that in our operating expenses over the last few years.\nIf you look at our headcount numbers -- and I touched on it earlier, and I thought I'd share a different view rather than the year-over-year view you have on Page 5 of the earnings release. And that is, again, a 3-year view of what's happening. So our in-market locations from an absolute basis since 2019, our headcount is down about 567 people in the branch and Onsite network, which is about a 4% drop.\nAnd again, things like FMI and rationalizing locations have really allowed us to leverage that. However, our sales headcount is up because every headcount we've reduced has moved into some type of sales role supporting the branch and Onsite network. So I'm pleased to say we were able to realign our resources in that time frame and really be a better growth-driving organization for the long term that aligns with our strategy of a branch and Onsite network.\nThe other thing that should stand out is a year ago, we had 377 more branches relative to Onsite. So we had 1,416 Onsites. We had 1,793. So 377 delta between the 2. At the end of 2022, that delta has contracted to 60. So we have 1,623 Onsites. We have 1,683 branches. I don't know what quarter that flips. But it won't be too much -- too far into our future that we'll actually have more Onsites than branches which has been very much a planned thing within our business over time. Again, the FMI digital footprint helped us leverage our headcount and our rationalization of branches.\nThe other piece that's an important and growing component, we've talked about our LIFT initiative, and we ended the year with just over 17,000 of our vending machines being resupplied out of our LIFT facility, which really allows us to operate more efficiently, ultimately allows us to rationalize some working capital, and our sales team can focus on selling more than managing some of the back-office items in a branch.\nThe final thing, if you look at our headcount over the 3-year period is we've been able to really rationalize our support labor. So we have added folks in the distribution because of LIFT. However, in the -- if I look at DC and manufacturing, we're up 98 people in the last 3 years. So again, that team has done an incredible job of managing their headcount.\nAnd if I look at our support areas in general, 51% of our headcount increase in the last 3 years has been focus going into IT. That's how we're able to do things like FMI, how we're able to do things like LIFT and build the technology to support it. 35% has gone into either a growth driver or into our international team or supporting our sales team and 14% has gone into all other categories combined in the last 3 years. I think that's an organization that dramatically improved itself in the last 3 years as we prepared for the future.\nOne last item -- when you see our release in February, I usually don't get ahead of myself on what's going to be in a future release. One thing to note is in 2022, our team in India added approximately 50 interns, and we ended up hiring 54 of them because a number of those interns told their friends about Fastenal, and they joined the Blue team and they added to our IT group. We saw such great success with that. It's a very efficient way to add folks. Here in early January, we added 96 -- or 98, 1 of the 2. So you're going to see the number grow by about 100 in the month of January in our support infrastructure. Don't conclude from that Fastenal is not managing its headcount. Conclude from that Fastenal is investing in resources to support its technology side.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fastenal Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Starting on Slide 6. Total and daily sales increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which included an up 8% reading in December and represented further deceleration from prior quarters. We attribute this deceleration to slower industrial production, which shouldn't surprise anyone that tracks the purchasing manager index and more difficult growth and pricing comparisons. But even so, significant elements of our business continue to perform well.\nFor instance, manufacturing, which was roughly 73% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, grew 16% and slightly exceeded normal quarterly sequentials. In addition, our largest customers, as reflected by our national accounts program and which approximated 59% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, grew 15%. We believe continued healthy performance in these areas reflect our investments in Onsite and changes to our branch structure and sales roles.\nFeedback from our regional leadership on the outlook entering 2023 remain constructive and largely unchanged from the third quarter of 2022. There are a few areas where we have seen incremental weakness, however. For instance, a handful of our large retailer customers tightened their belts regarding facilities and labor and our non-North American sales softened on a strong dollar and geopolitical events. Now we've made significant investments and seeing enormous growth in these areas over the last few years and the current weakness in our view relates to market-specific factors.\nConstruction revenues were also softer, which reflects the conscious decision we have made to position our branches to focus on larger key accounts, which is contributing to better labor leverage. These 3 areas, large retailers, non-North American markets and construction together, represent more than 15% of sales and went from double-digit growth as recently as the first quarter of 2022 to declining in each case by the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs always, we have limited visibility as it relates to future demand. However, we do believe that our sales initiatives continue to gain momentum and expect good outgrowth in 2023.\nNow to Slide 7. Operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 19.6%, flat from the prior year. We continue to manage operating expenses effectively, producing 120 basis points of SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter of 2022. Occupancy costs are being restrained from strategic branch closures, while initiatives such as digital footprint, LIFT and the changes we've made to our brand strategies are contributing to improved labor leverage, which accelerated in 2022.\nAs Dan indicated in his opening remarks, we were a bit more aggressive with headcount adds that might be prudent given the cloudy manufacturing outlook heading into 2023. However, we think that can adjust quickly, and it is likely annual FTE growth peaked in December or will peak in January before decelerating through the first half of 2023. Although the ultimate level of growth in the marketplace will have it say, we do believe that we can continue to leverage operating expenses in future periods.\nSG&A leverage was offset by a matching 120 basis points decline in gross margin, which was greater than anticipated. Certain factors were familiar. The drag related to product and customer mix widened as non-fastener growth began outpacing fastener growth, which was expected.\nThe price cost drag widened slightly, which is a little more than expected, reflecting some improvement on the fastener side but incremental challenges in other products offsetting this. In fact, we experienced broader product margin pressure in our non-fastener and non-safety products. These categories tend to have a less centralized supply chain and the spend tends to be more unplanned, which when combined with slower demand and a better stock marketplace resulted in broader discounting. We believe this relates more to our actions than the state of the market and have plans to address it in the first quarter of 2023.\nOn the positive side of the margin ledger, we continue to have healthy freight revenues and narrower losses related to maintaining our captive fleets. We had a higher tax rate, reflecting the absence of certain favorable reserve adjustments that benefited the fourth quarter of 2021 than higher nondeductible payroll and state income tax expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our fully diluted share count was also down 0.8% from share buybacks over the last 2 quarters. Putting it all together, we reported fourth quarter 2022 EPS of $0.43, up 7.1% from $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We generated $302 million in operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2022 or approximately 123% of net income in the period. This reflects a typical fourth quarter conversion rate in contrast with the preceding 5 quarters where our conversion rates lagged. This is due to comparisons in the second half of 2021, we began to finance significantly more working capital to navigate supply chain constraints and inflation. We do not expect to have to make a similar incremental investment in 2023, which should produce better cash flow.\nYear-over-year, accounts receivable was up 12.6% on higher customer demand and an increase in the mix of larger key account customers, which tend to have longer terms. Inventories rose 12.1%. The supply chain has largely normalized. Inflation is moderating. And our fulfillment rates are at healthy levels, which is causing our inventory growth to align more closely with growth than was true earlier in the year.\nOur days on hand was 161.5, more than 4 days better than the fourth quarter of 2021 and more than 13 days below the fourth quarter of 2019 despite the challenges in the last 18 months. We continue to identify sustainable efficiencies in how we manage our inventories.\nNet capital spending in 2022 was $162.4 million, a bit below the $170 million to $190 million anticipated at the end of the third quarter, mostly related to project and equipment deferrals. Those deferrals, combined with higher spending on hub investments, fleet equipment and IT equipment, resulted in an anticipated net capital spending range for 2023 of $210 million to $230 million.\nWe finished the fourth quarter of 2022 with debt at 14.9% of total capital, up from 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and unchanged at 14.9% in the third quarter of 2022. Though we had strong cash generation in the fourth quarter of 2022, we were also, again, more aggressive in returning cash to shareholders in the form of $177 million in dividends and $93 million in share buyback. Last night, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2021 to -- I'm sorry, of 2022 to $0.35 in the first quarter of 2023.\nNow before the questions, one quick note. This week, we released our inaugural ESG report, which is accessible through the ESG link found at the bottom of fastenal.com. This report highlights the strong alignment of FAST culture and mission with the environmental and human capital objectives of our stakeholders. I want to congratulate and thank the community of Blue Team members that work to pull this outstanding piece together.\nAnd with that, operator, we'll turn it over to Q&A.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Fastenal Company\n\nBefore we start Q&A, my adder to the Holden's comment on the ESG report, I encourage the folks on this call to read it. Don't wait for the movie. It's a -- I think it's a well-written story in the context of how Fastenal tell its story about how our business and our team have addressed this topic really throughout our history, but communicated in a way that is conscious of the formatting in the structure that society has grown more accustomed to.\nThe other piece that I wanted to highlight is another announcement went out last night, which was, we announced that our international team has surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time during 2022. My congratulations to everybody listening to this call as part of our international team that spans the Americas, Europe and Asia. And to our team in China, where -- your society has opened a bunch more in recent months, recent weeks, I would like to wish you a Happy Chinese New Year. I believe it's the year of the rabbit. And I hope you since I -- sincerely hope you have a nice opportunity to visit with family as societies opened up a little bit more.\nWith that, we open the Q&A."

(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Taylor Ranta of Fastenal Company. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nTaylor Ranta Oborski\n\nFinancial Reporting & Regulatory Compliance Accountant, Fastenal Company\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 1 hour, and we'll start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.\nToday's conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today's call is permitted without Fastenal's consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the Internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until December 1, 2022, at midnight Central Time.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call may include statements regarding the company's future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations, and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Fastenal Company\n\nGood morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We had a good quarter. When I look at the performance of the team, I'm proud to be a member of the Blue Team. The 16% daily sales growth that we experienced in the quarter, we were able to translate that into 19% operating profit growth, and ultimately, we were also able to translate it into strong operating cash flow growth.\nWe grew our cash flow 54% from the third quarter of 2021 to third quarter of 2022, and in the expansion of our ability to generate operating cash relative to our level of earnings, we haven't been able to lay claim to that for over 1.5 years. I believe you have to go back to prior to 2021 where you can see that. And it was really great execution throughout the organization and the fact that supply chains have become a bit more stable.\nAnd that doesn't mean they've become easier. It just means they've become more stable, and you can rely on what you're seeing in your level of safety stock. Doesn't be quite as deep. As far as customer demand, that was stable throughout the quarter. Now September's 2.7% sequential growth versus August does lag the way we look at the historic pattern. And history would say we should be up 3.4%.\nThe real driver of that is if you look at the storms that hit the southeastern United States, Hurricane Ian late in the quarter, essentially pushed some business out of September and into October. The storms likely reduced our sequential DSR by about 0.5%, and so you can do the math on what it would be if that's added back in. But we see it as stable demand.\nAnd in the next bullet, touch on the fact that we are preparing for a softer 2023. So I thought I'd share some thoughts on, what does that mean? Now first off, I remember back in the fall of 2015, I believe it was a Tuesday morning, don't quote me on it. But the day before, we'd our Board meeting, and I learned after that Board meeting that I'd been selected as the next President and CEO of Fastenal. And it was a pretty tough environment for not just the organization but for industrial entities in general.\nAnd the next day, during the Q&A section, I was probably a little more animated than I typically am and I commented on what I saw was the state of the economy. And the next day, my wife informed me that I was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal (inaudible) my mouth. So we're not in that kind of environment. We're not in something where I'm going to proclaim something.\nBut we are preparing for a softer 2023, and a lot of that centers on 2 things. One is something that has nothing to do with 2023. If you'd been on the call I had an hour -- 2 hours ago with our leadership around the planet, I gave them the typical October talk, and that is we are a seasonal business. And if you look at history, history says between September and December, our daily sales typically drop off 12%, 13%.\nAnd I'm going back to the time before COVID and even before some of the tariff period. I'm going back to the 2017 and '16 and '18 numbers. And just looking at sequential patterns, that should not be a surprise to anybody listening to this, that a business that operates in northern North America, (inaudible) northern North America, after you get past Canadian Thanksgiving and get to the U.S. Thanksgiving, get to Christmas, the business slows down. We're preparing ourselves for that.\nWhen we're talking about 2023, it's really about a lot of the numbers we're seeing. And again, they're not numbers that are unique to Ireland. I'm looking at industrial production, and Holden will touch on some of that here later. But looking at industrial production with some of the forecasters are predicting. But the most important feedback that we focus on is what are our regional and district leaders hearing from their customers as far as their confidence going into 2023?\nAnd I'll be honest with the group. That confidence isn't strong. It's not, \"Hey, the sky is falling,\" but the confidence is very, very cautious, and we're preparing for that type of environment. And that means that you're very thoughtful about where you invest. You're very thoughtful about not getting ahead of yourself. Now we've signed a lot of Onsites this year, and that gives us resiliency going to next year, and I'll touch on that in a second.\nBut what it means is you staff for the things you know, but you don't get ahead of yourself on staffing for the things you don't know. And that's the mindset we have going in 2023, whereas a year ago and 2 years ago, we were staffing for both, and it's just a bit of caution in the air.\nLast week, I was traveling in Europe. It's my first trip outside North America since before the pandemic. There's something about -- even this human being is a social creature, and there's a certain energy you get and a certain rapport you can get and a level of communication intimacy you can get by meeting people in person. And it was a wonderful trip. I spent some time with our folks at what we call EHUB, which is our distribution facility up in the Netherlands.\nAnd most of our European leadership were there for that discussion. And then I traveled down to Northern Italy, primarily Lombardi area of Northern Italy, and met with our team there. And what stands out is the last time I visited this group was in fall 2017. How the group has grown, [in not just] our numbers, but grown in talent and business acumen was really impressive.\nAnd despite all the stuff that's going on in Europe over the last 3 years -- actually the globe, but then more specifically Europe in the last 12 months, that business is 80% bigger than what it was in 2019. And that's telling the story in U.S. dollars. If I left it in local currency, it'd be closer to $90.\nAnd I think back when I was there, which was 2 years earlier, we haven't tripled in size, but were pretty close to it. And so it's really a powerful story about the marketplace around the planet has identified in Fastenal what is special about Fastenal over the years, and I'm glad to say that we're replicating that with our team in Europe.\nThe one thing that is a positive -- despite what it looks like in the numbers, it's a positive, and that is the pre-pandemic margin profile of the business has reemerged. And back in 2016 and '17 and '18 when we were really telling the story of how we thought our growth was going to change in the future and those will be much more Onsite driven, it changes the profile of your gross margin, but it also changes the profile of your operating expenses.\nAnd we felt, over time, that was a great trade-off because ultimately, it's about the level of profit and return you can generate. And this is a faster way to grow and a better way to develop your talent and be special in the marketplace. We thought it was, but it was explaining how those dynamics would work.\nMix-driven lower gross margin did occur in the quarter. Strong expense leverage also occurred, very much in line with the story we were telling 5 years ago, and I'm pleased to say that after a period of time where our operating margin was kind of stuck within 20 or 30 basis points of 20% for a number of years. Year-to-date, we've been able to break out of that and move it up to 21% or actually slightly better.\nSo very, very pleased with that. And then finally, I touched on it earlier. Really impressed. I'm the former CFO, so looking at our cash flow statement for the last couple of years, it was tough for Holden. It was tough for Dan, too. And I'm really pleased to say, when I look at the cash flow statement, that for the first time in quite a few quarters, 6, 7 quarters, I can look at the year-over-year numbers and say it's improving.\nOur cash flow is improving. And I believe it has staying power because I look at the things we're doing to create it, the environment that's allowing us to create it and the tools we're deploying to maintain it and elevate it even more, we've never been in a better position to improve our ability to generate cash.\nFlipping to Page 4 of the [foot book]. Onsite signings softened a little bit during the quarter, 86. So total active Onsites is 1,567, up about 15% from a year ago. Our goal for the year of 375 to 400 remains intact. Given where we are, and it's in the early part of October, we expect to be in the lower end of that range.\nFMI Technology. We signed 5,187 weighted devices. That's about 81 per day. A year ago, we signed 75. I'd be lying to you if I didn't say I'd like that number to be closer to 100, and at least starting with a 9, but we're getting good execution. What really stands out is what's happening with that business from the standpoint of the revenue per device, how it's expanding nicely from what we've seen.\nThe FASTBin element of it were putting up really impressive numbers. One of the things I shared with our Board yesterday is if you look at that discrete number of signings per day, a couple of years ago, one of those signings was a FASTBin. Today, it's 15. And so it's rapidly expanding throughout the organization, and really impressed with the way our teams in the field have embraced the technology and the way our customers like the technology, too. You look at eCommerce, daily sales through -- excuse me, and our goal for the year of 2,100 to 2,300 unit equivalents for FASTVend and FASTBin signings remain intact.\nFinally, daily sales for eCommerce rose 50%, and eCommerce is an interesting one because for years, I think back to when I stepped into this role, eCommerce was about 5.5% of our sales. And it has been stuck there. It was stuck in purgatory. And because it wasn't how we went to market, we're a service organization, we're not a catalog-centered organization or an eCom company. We're a supply chain partner.\nAnd part of it was we had to admit to ourselves that's what we are, and that's a beautiful thing. And then how do we play to those strengths? And so we've really, I believe, found a way to make this part of our business. In the quarter, we hit $5 million a day going through eCommerce, and it wasn't too many years ago that we were starting out in that journey. So really impressed with the team.\nThen finally, our Digital Footprint. We've talked about that. It's really about widening the moat, illuminating supply chain for our customer and making supply chain more efficient for both ourselves and our customer. I'm pleased to say that we've grown that to 49.5% of sales in the third quarter versus 43.7% a year ago. And we've talked about our plan, our goal, to hit 52% of our sales running through the Digital Footprint sometime in 2022. That's still our goal.\nIn fact, in the month of September, we came in at 49.9%. So if you would -- excuse me a second, I'll just round it up and say 50% of our business is now the Digital Footprint, and we see that continue to grow as we move forward. The other piece, and this is touching back and I didn't touch on it with the eCommerce a second ago, is not just to have our numbers improved. But one thing we always look at internally is our level of participation.\nIn other words, how much is everybody doing, not just a few leaders in the organization. So if I go back to 2018, 17% of our branches had more than 10% of their sales in eCommerce. 2 years later in 2020, that number had grown to 25% of our branches had more than 10% of their sales in eCommerce. I'm pleased to say in the third quarter of 2022, 52% of our branch and Onsite locations -- excuse me, of our branch locations, had over 10% of their revenue in eCommerce.\nSo this 18% that we hit in the third quarter isn't coming from a few. It's coming from a lot of activity throughout the organization, which means it's becoming part of our DNA. And that's how we found success in vending a decade ago, how we found success in Onsite over the last 5, 6 years, and what we're seeing in eCommerce today.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fastenal Company\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dan. I'll start on Slide 5. Total and daily sales increased 16% in the third quarter of 2022. Growth did decelerate by 200 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and September's DSR growth was below the historical norm. However, a lot of that was due to comparisons. Price contribution in the period was 110 basis points below the second quarter, which we expected.\nRelative to the second quarter of 2022, we also saw difficult government comps that cost us about 20 basis points. Foreign exchange cost us about 10 basis points, and the impact of Hurricane Ian on our Atlantic coastal region cost us about 20 basis points as well as 50 basis points in September. At the same time, we experienced robust 22.6% daily growth in our manufacturing end market, 18.2% daily growth in our fastener product line and 20.8% growth in National Accounts.\nRegional VP feedback had a few more pockets of forward-looking caution sprinkled in, but overall, they also judged business activity in the third quarter to have been very similar to the second quarter, which we believe is a fair characterization of the period. Pricing contributed 550 to 580 basis points to growth in the third quarter of 2022, moderating from the second quarter as we began to grow over the pricing actions that started in the third quarter of last year.\nWhile many commodity indexes have recently fallen from their peaks, global supply chains are filled with product where costing reflects the higher commodities of a number of months ago. It will take several quarters for lower costed product to find its way to the point of use, and we continue to see supplier letters seeking to recover these costs. These variables have supported stable product price levels in the marketplace.\nOverall, the third quarter of 2022 reflected stable demand, stable price levels, but tough comparisons. At this time, we don't have a reason to believe that those conditions will change in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, as always, our visibility into the future is limited and the uptick in caution that our regional VPs are receiving from their customers, while far from universal, is still notable and something we need to watch.\nNow to Slide 6. Operating margin in the third quarter of 2022 was 21%, up from 20.5% in the third quarter of 2021. Our incremental margin was 24.5%. Gross margin was 45.9% in the third quarter of 2022, down 40 basis points from the third quarter of 2021. This quarter's results had a lot of moving pieces. The first piece I'll address is price/cost, which relates specifically to fasteners and was a negative 30 basis point impact on the period.\nOver the past 15 months, the Blue Team has done a remarkable job defending our profitability in an environment where fastener costs were rising as much as 30%. At this stage of the cycle, the marketplace is less receptive to further price increases even as higher cost product is still being imported. As I indicated earlier, product pricing in the marketplace is stable, and there are tenuous signs of product inflation easing. The timing of product flows suggest that while price/cost may remain negative for a couple of quarters, the magnitude is likely to moderate going forward.\nThe second piece impacting gross margin is a write-down, this time of nitrile gloves, which pulled gross margin down 20 basis points. This is very similar to the glove write-down we had in the first quarter of 2021 -- sorry, mask write-down that we had in the first quarter of 2021 in that it derives from decisions that we made during the pandemic to support our customers. And with the stresses of the pandemic waning, the value of our inventory relative to the market became inflated. We believe this is a discrete event specific to the third quarter.\nThe third piece is customer and product mix, which was 40 basis points dilutive based mostly on relative growth from our National Accounts and Onsite Customers, which I believe everyone understands is an anticipated byproduct of our growth strategies. These 3 impacts were partly offset by continued strong growth in freight revenues of 30.6%, which is narrowing losses related to maintaining our captive fleet and leverage of organizational expenses as higher volumes absorbed overhead.\nWe achieved 110 basis points of operating expense leverage in the third quarter of 2022. The largest contributor to this leverage was occupancy expenses, which reflects our branch rationalization. We also achieved leverage over employee-related costs due to primarily lower health care expenses and, to a lesser degree, moderating annual growth in total compensation expense.\nWe also leveraged other operating expenses with lower bad debt expense, lower general insurance costs and higher asset sales being only partly offset by higher selling-related transportation costs driven mostly by higher fuel prices. Putting it all together, we reported third quarter 2022 EPS of $0.50, up 17.4% from $0.42 in the third quarter of 2021.\nTurning to Slide 7. We generated $258 million in operating cash in the third quarter of 2022 or approximately 91% of net income in the period. This still trails the conversion we might normally expect in the third quarter, reflecting the ongoing impact of steps taking with working capital to support our customers. However, this was the first time in 6 quarters that our conversion has improved year-over-year.\nAs product availability in our hubs has reached our goal, we have been able to slow our inventory build even as improvement in the supply chain has allowed us to slightly shorten domestic and import ordering cycles. These factors should improve cash conversion rates in future periods. Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 17% on strong customer demand and an increase in the mix of larger key account customers, which tend to have longer terms.\nInventories rose 19.8% continuing to reflect, on an annual basis, strong customer demand, higher inflation and our hub inventory build. However, an improving supply chain and moderating inflation impact contributed to a sequential improvement in our days on hand from 161 days in the second quarter of 2022 to 157 days in the third quarter of 2022. This continues to trend roughly 10 days below the pre-pandemic level despite the challenges in the last 15 months, which reflects increasing and sustainable efficiencies in how we manage our inventories.\nNet capital spending was $44 million in the third quarter of 2022, mostly flat with the third quarter of 2021. Year-to-date, net capital spending was $121 million, up 13% due mostly to increased spending for FMI hardware, hub automation and upgrades and IT equipment. We are reducing our 2022 net capital spending to a range of $170 million to $190 million, down from $180 million to $200 million. This reflects slightly lower FMI spending, slightly lower vehicle spending on continued availability issues and higher asset sales.\nWe returned cash to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $178 million in dividends and $95 million in share buyback. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the third quarter of 2022 with debt at 14.9% of total capital, up from 11% in the third quarter of 2021 and 13.7% in the second quarter of 2022.\nWith that, operator, we'll turn it over to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Taylor Ranta of Fastenal Company. Please go ahead, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Ranta Oborski\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. This call will last for up to one hour, and we'll start with a general overview of our quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.\nToday's conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today's call is permitted without Fastenal's consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the Internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations home page, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until September 1, 2022, at midnight Central Time.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call may include statements regarding the company's future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations, and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Fastenal Company\n\nThank you, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us for today's earnings call. Life -- who you choose to surround yourself in life gives you freedom to do a lot of things and to find success with others. And one thing I found on this call is that holding such a fine job with sharing with the investment community, particularly the sell-side analyst community, the trends you're seeing in the business, that -- it affords me the opportunity to be a bit more philosophical and talk to our shareholders, but also talk to the employees of Fastenal on this call.\nI suspect for most people listening on this call, the reason you're looking at our earnings release today and looking at participating in this call is you want to see what breadcrumbs might come out of it as far as where the economy is going. Spoiler alert: we've often said that our visibility to the future is about 8 hours, and most of it comes from -- what we're hearing from our customer, the anecdotes that come through, what we're seeing in some of the trends in the business. So we get an indicator, and we try to share those as we see them. But we don't have a backlog in the traditional sense. We are a just-in-time supply chain partner to our customers, and things time through as they occur.\nSo here are some things that have occurred in our business. First off, our travel has expanded. If I look at our travel in the year-to-date and 2022 and ignore for a second 2020 and 2021, our travel is about 12% below where it was in 2019. In the second quarter, our travel is about 18% higher than it was in 2019, and that's measured in dollars. And as you know, for those of you who have bought an airplane ticket recently or done any kind of travel, things have not gotten cheaper.\nSo I suspect that means we're probably still down from 2019, but the expense is up because of the inflation inherent in travel today. But what that means is the most societies have entered into the endemic stage of COVID-19. Not all. And what that means, we're finding our new normal, and I'm pleased to say travel is resuming. And that's one of the ways we engage with our customer.\nOur Fastenal culture is one of -- we trust each other. We work every day to build our own talent pool, and we promote from within. An integral part of that is the idea of human interaction and our ability to teach and learn from each other every day, and it's, frankly, more efficient when you can have in-person conversations. But we have adapted. If you went into a Fastenal branch today versus 2019, you'd see a different branch.\nYou see many locations where we've changed what the front room looks like. You've seen many locations where we either have reduced hours or we don't have an open front door anymore because we've really morphed into more and more of a supply chain partner and more product that's going out the back door than ever before. In markets where we have a larger construction presence or we have a meaningful walk-in business and the local team sees that as their means to serve the market, they might be open.\nBut in many markets, we've changed that format, and it allows us to find success in an era when it's more difficult to hire and because it's a more efficient labor model in our business. I'm also -- the folks that aren't in a branch or on-site. Obviously, folks that work in a distribution center or manufacturing division or drive a truck never had the opportunity to work remote. But since the first half of 2021, we've been largely in the office, working in a different fashion than we did 3 years ago, but finding success together.\nWe were able to better engage with our customer. and some of the stuff we're going to talk about Onsite, et cetera, were a reflection of that. But in April, we held our first in-person customer expo since 2019, and it was a great event. We had great engagement with the customers that were there. We did have to limit some geographies just from the hassle of travel and some of the COVID restrictions, but we found really good successful events that we held back in April.\nHiring remains challenging. However, our trends and applications received have improved. In fact, if I use 2019 as the benchmark, in 2020, post-COVID starting, our applications coming in were down close to 40%. In 2021, our applications using 2019 as a benchmark were down about 36%. In the first 5 months of this year, they're down about 18% from what we saw in 2019.\nAnd I'm pleased to say in the last 3 months, applications coming in every month are about 10% below where they were in 2019. I consider that a huge win and a sign that people are more comfortable and ready to get back to work and to build their career and to build their future. And that's just an element of that in our business.\nWe have effectively managed marketplace disruption. It's made supply chains more expensive than prepandemic and elongated. And you're seeing that in -- if you look at our balance sheet, look at our cash flow. First 6 months of this year, between a combination of inflation and the fact that it takes longer for products to physically move, we have a deeper supply of inventory, and that supply of inventory is more expensive, and you're seeing that in our balance sheet. And again, you're seeing that in our cash flow if that inventory is building and turning.\nWe're pleased with the fact that we have the balance sheet to withstand that and we can make that covenant with our customer that we are your supply chain partner and we will serve your needs. We did that before COVID. We did that during COVID, and we're doing that today in whatever stage of COVID you do care to call this.\nFinally, this is our earnings release. And for the quarter, we grew our sales 18%, and our pretax profit grew just under 21%. Demand is generally healthy. But there were some signs of softening in May and June, and we'll delve into that as we go through this call.\nOnsites. We signed 102 Onsites in the second quarter. We did -- we signed 106 in the first quarter. The last time we signed 100 plus in a quarter, it was back in 2019. I believe it was the first quarter. This is the first time we've ever signed 100 plus in 2 consecutive quarters. And I think there's a number of things going on there. Again, the marketplace sees value in our Onsite model. In an era where it's more difficult to hire and more difficult to manage supply chain, I believe our Onsite model is even a better option for our customer in the marketplace.\nAnd I think that's shining through in our signings. Obviously, the fact that we had a customer event in April, while it didn't help the first quarter number, I think it was an element in the second quarter number. And we remain committed to strong signings for second -- for all of 2022. And we see this as a means to take market share faster and a hedge on whatever the economy might do in the months and years to come.\nFMI Technology continued to have industry-leading signing levels, albeit not maybe at the level we'd like. Our internal goal is always to get that number to 100 per day. And during the quarter, we were at 86, an improvement from what we saw in the first quarter, but not where we'd like it to be. And our aspirations here are very high, and that signs through on our expectations. We did, given where we are year-to-date, adjust our expectations for the year. Previously, we had indicated 23,000 to 25,000 signings. We think that number is more in the neighborhood of 21,000 to 23,000, and that's a machine equivalent unit basis.\nE-commerce continues to grow nicely. It rose 53% in the second quarter of 2022, and our large customer-oriented EDI was up 53%, whereas our web sales were up 51%. And you combine those 2, e-commerce was about 17.1% of sales in the second quarter. Finally, our digital footprint. We've talked about that in prior calls. It's our ability to manage supply chain more efficiently and illuminate that supply chain for our customers. That increased and was 47.9% of sales in the second quarter, 48% in the month of June.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fastenal Company\n\nThank you, Dan. All right. Starting on Slide 5. Our total and daily sales increased 18% in the second quarter of '22. A stronger dollar reduced growth by 60 basis points, and currency-adjusted growth was consistent from the first to the second quarter. In contrast to the first quarter, however, we did experience a softening intraquarter trend in the second. That softening was not particularly deep, and if the level of economic activity that we experienced exiting the second quarter were sustained, we feel good about the rest of the year.\nI might characterize it through this prism: the percentage of our branches that are growing. 72% in May and June is not as good as 76% in March and April, but on its own, it's pretty good. Nor was the softening that we experienced particularly broad. We experienced it largely in areas that directly touch consumers as well as construction while our core capital goods and commodity-related markets remain strong with healthy backlogs. As we've said before, we experienced demand in real time, and we lack much visibility in how demand will trend through the second half of 2022.\nPricing contributed 660 to 690 basis points to growth in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting carryover of broad pricing actions taken over the last 12 months, the timing of opening of contractual windows and tactical SKU-based actions based on supplier actions. Most costs remain elevated but not worsening. As a result, while we expect price levels to be stable in the third quarter of 2022, we expect the contribution to growth to moderate as we begin to grow over the start of more aggressive pricing actions from the third quarter of last year.\nThe supply chain picture is unchanged from the first quarter. Challenges with availability persist, but we and our customers are managing them more effectively. Labor market tension seems to have eased some as reflected in our strong FTE additions in the second quarter of 2022. So disruptions persist, but the chaos surrounding them has receded, resulting in a more predictable business environment.\nNow to Slide 6. Operating margin in the second quarter of 2022 was 21.6%, up from 21.1% in the second quarter of 2021. Our incremental margin was 24.2%. A couple of trends are at play in the period. First, we saw a moderation in the growth of certain expenses, such as incentive pay, profit sharing and health care costs that are subject to early cycle resets. As expected, this produced improved operating expense leverage. It also contributed to the second trend, which is a further gradual migration toward a pre-pandemic margin profile with a mix-related gross margin pressure more than offset by stronger operating leverage.\nGross margin was 46.5% in the second quarter of 2022, flat versus the second quarter of 2021. Product margin was modestly down with a wider negative impact from product and customer mix, a slightly lower fastener margin more than offsetting higher non-fastener product margin. This is offset by stronger organizational leverage and sustained strength in volumes absorbed overhead. This absorption slightly exceeded my expectations in the period.\nThe impact of freight on margin is neutral, with higher fuel and shipping costs being offset by good leverage related to a 37.5% increase in freight sales. Pricing actions continued to match higher costs, yielding a neutral price/cost dynamic in the quarter. We achieved greater operating leverage in the second quarter of 2022 with an operating expense to sales ratio being 40 basis points improved to 25%. We achieved 60 basis points of leverage over occupancy related to a 10% reduction in our traditional branch count and the effect of what has been, to this point, relatively slow expansion of our vending install base.\nWe also achieved modest leverage over total employee expenses. FTE growth continues to lag sales growth and health care expenses were lower, which more than offset an increase in employee incentive payouts and profit sharing expense growth. Other operating expenses reflected increases in selling-related transportation costs, including fuel and further increases in spending on travel and supplies. Putting it all together, we reported second quarter 2022 earnings per share of $0.50, up 19.7% from $0.42 in the second quarter of 2021.\nNow turning to Slide 7. We generated $151 million in operating cash in the second quarter of 2022, which is roughly 53% of net income in the period. Traditionally, second quarter conversion rates are low due to the timing of tax payments. As in the first quarter, the current quarter's conversion was below historical norms due to the impact of strong sales growth, supply chain constraints and high inflation on our investment in working capital. We view the lower conversion rate as reflecting our commitment to supporting our customers.\nYear-over-year, accounts receivable was up 21.5%. This reflects strong customer demand and an increase in the mix of larger key account customers, which tend to have longer terms than our smaller customers. Inventories were up 25.4% and inflation accounted for half of the total increase, a proportion that continues to moderate as the flow of physical products into our hubs continues, supporting strong product availability and fulfillment rates.\nThe twin disruptions on inflation and supply chain have created an additional level of inventory value. Despite that, our 161 days on hand in the second quarter of 2022 is more than 10 days below the days on hand in the second quarter of 2019 prior to the pandemic, which reflects increasing and sustainable efficiencies in how we manage our inventories.\nNet capital spending was $43 million in the second quarter of 2022, up 37.8%. Year-to-date, net capital spending was $76 million, up 24.4% due most significantly to increased spending for FMI equipment and hub automation and upgrades. We continue to anticipate 2022 net capital spending in a range of $180 million to $200 million. However, the combination of slower FMI signings and continued supply chain challenges for transportation and IT equipment suggests there is a downward bias to our net capital spending budget.\nWe returned cash to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $178 million in dividends and $49 million share buyback. While our opportunistic approach to share buyback is unchanged, our Board did approve an 8 million share increase to our authorization, leaving us with 10.2 million shares authorized for repurchase. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the second quarter of 2022 with debt at 13.7% of total capital, up from 12.3% in the year-ago period and 11.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWith that, operator, we'll turn it over to Q&A."

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Fastenal Company\n\nThank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our Q1 earnings call. Before I start, I thought I'd just share a few tidbits from a conversation I had this morning with our regional business unit leaders, our regional vice presidents and our VPs of the business. And I started that by sharing last evening or late yesterday afternoon, my wife and daughter returned from a week long band trip to Florida, marching band. And as with most high school trips, it involved a -- well, if you're coming from Winona that is, it involved a 26-hour bus ride down last Wednesday and a 26-hour bus ride back. And I saw a bunch of haggard kids and a handful of haggard adults to get off the bus yesterday about 4:00. And when we got home that evening, I was watching the video, I don't like to watch myself on video, but it's a necessary evil to make sure you present as good a message you can and present it in a style that isn't too painful to watch.\nAnd my wife commented on it, and I think she probably was commenting partly, in fact, she was kind of tired from the bus ride. She thought it was a pretty under-inspiring video. And she had no problem telling me that. And she said, for the last 2 years, you come home, you talk about things that people are doing at Fastenal, things you see from the leaders and everybody within the organization and how impressed you are. And in your video, you just had a great quarter and your video doesn't speak to that at all. It sounds like you're in the middle of COVID, it's kind of disappointing. And after brushing my pride off, I got in this morning and I led our regional -- our leadership now, just how damn proud I am of the quarter they just put out. But more important than that of what they've done in the last 2 years and all the hard work as we transition from tariffs to COVID and worrying about our own human safety and the safety of others to the surge in demand for products, that pivoted into a supply chain globally that completely fell apart and how did we manage through that to support our customers and their needs, and more recently, managing through the chaos that is inflation.\nFrankly, the first bullet on the flip book says that has the statement good execution, there's a typo there. That should say great execution. I think the Fastenal Blue Team did an unbelievable job in the last 2 years, and I think that extended into this quarter, and I'm really proud to be associated with them. Even yesterday in our Audit Committee call, we were picking on Holden a little bit, but he's been kind of crabby lately. And it's kind of refreshing you have a really good quarter and your CFO was kind of crabby and he was talking about our cash flow. And he wasn't pleased with it, and I said to him, I said, Holden, take a look at the last 6 years, and look at our growth and look at what our operating cash flow to earnings was in our strongest year, I think it was at 93%. I think that was first quarter of 2018 might have been '17, and it costs money to grow a distribution business, and that money is spent in working capital. And that gets amplified when you have heavy inflation like we're seeing right now. So I'm glad you're irritated and irritable. I can't imagine being right now when you come home from work. But thanks to what you're doing, but don't be too hard on everybody.\nSo flipping to the book here. The net sales grew 20.3% in the first quarter. Our pretax profit grew 28%. There was some amplifying effects. Last year's weather in the Texas and Oklahoma area in February hurt our sales hurt the economy, quite frankly. And then we had a mass write-down. And -- but adjusting for those, this is our strongest top and bottom line growth that we've experienced in a decade. It's really been since we were recovering from the '08, '09 in the 2011, 2012 time frame that we saw the growth that we're seeing right now. So really pleased with the performance.\nAnd in the last 2 years, so since the pandemic started, we've put in a lot of energy to deploy technologies and strategies to just improve our efficiency. And that served us really well because the environment has restrained our ability to add labor, add energy into the organization, but it hasn't hurt our ability to grow sales and also to continue the branch consolidation process that we started 6, 7, 8 years ago. So very strong performance there. The supply chains in markets remain tight. However, conditions have stabilized. We're getting more product on the shelf to support the needs, which makes the business less chaotic. And we are seeing an uptick in applications coming in. And I'm hearing it mostly anecdotally from our regional leaders, but they're seeing more and more people willing to come back and do the workforce and apply for jobs. Part of that is probably a function of our #1 recruiting area is 4-year state colleges and 2-year tech colleges as they have come back in full force, that group of people are looking for opportunities for their future.\nOur international business reached a milestone. In the month of March, we broke -- we exceeded $100 million in sales for the first time. And next week marks 2 steps towards normalcy in our world. One is our customer expo, our selling event is returning to an in-person format after 2 years of not occurring in person. And that will be Tuesday, Wednesday next week. And then next Saturday, we'll hold our annual meeting in person after 2 years of the sanitized video or on air version, which is, frankly, less than satisfying in a community like this where we get a good local turnout at the event.\nFlipping to Page 4 of the book to comparison to the 2020 to 2022 period, and this will be the last quarter that we put this table in because, obviously, as we exit this quarter and enter the new quarter, our 2-year comparison falls square into the COVID period, so it becomes less than meaningful. But we thought we'd continue it as we've done the last 3 quarters. I think the only thing that should jump out on here is at least jumps out for me is the fact that our operating and administrative expenses have dropped from 26.7% of sales 2 years ago to 25.5% of sales today as we've worked to make the organization more efficient. And really probably we were able to accomplish this during the distraction of the last 2 years. One item that's probably a little bit misleading in here, it shows our gross profit is actually flat in that 2-year period.\nIt's actually down slightly. January and February of 2020 were a bit higher. And as we entered the COVID period in March of 2020, we started selling bulk quantities of masks and things like that at a lower margin and it actually pulled our margin down to 46.6%, just trying to express full disclosure there.\nFlipping to Page 5. When people get more confident of where we are today and there's less chaos in the world, and you're more comfortable engaging with others, we always felt that our growth drivers would see an uptick and we had to just get through this COVID period. Well, our on-site saw that uptick. We signed 106 in the quarter, finishing with 1,440. So we're up 12% from the number of active sites we had a year ago. And we continue to do the healthy business thing, and that is, just like we've done with our branches over the last decade, you challenge every business unit is that on-site performing to what you need it to be for both our customer and for us.\nSometimes, we run into situations where we take a customer that was doing $25,000 or $30,000 a month of sales in a branch and we double that, and maybe we even triple that. But we get to the point where we kind of get stuck at a number, let's say it's $70,000, $80,000 a month. We always have to evaluate what is the best solution there for the customer and for our ability to serve that business. And sometimes it's pulling it back into the brand. Sometimes it's the case, the customer runs out of space for us. Sometimes, and we've seen this in the last 6 months, particularly, we have some customers that are consolidating some of their operations, and we've had a few on-sites that have closed but we pick it up somewhere else or consolidates was an on-site we have somewhere else. And -- but we think it's a great business, and we're really pleased at what we saw in the first quarter with signings, and we're excited about that customer event next week and what it means to keep this thing going.\nFMI technology, it's about bringing better visualization and service ability to the point of use. It started with bending a decade plus ago, and we've expanded with a bunch of other technologies. A year ago, we were signing 74 a day. This quarter, we signed 83 a day. We ended the quarter stronger than we started the quarter. And for Onsite and for FMI, our plans, our goals for the year remain unchanged. So the FMI technology now represents 35.5% of sales. A year ago, it was 28.7% and 2 years ago, it was 26.4%. We're going to keep driving that.\nE-commerce, 55.6% growth in the first quarter of '22. And like our international group, our e-commerce team also hit a milestone. In March, we exceeded $100 million in revenue for the first time. It's not too many years ago, I think it was 2011, when we pointed out the fact that international was now 10% of the company but still a relatively small piece. And e-commerce was something we dabbled in, but it really wasn't a thing. Times have changed in the last decade and now both of them are $100 million a month businesses.\nFinally, if you roll up our FMI technology in our e-commerce, we talk about our digital footprint. We hit 47% of sales in the quarter, 39.1% a year ago, 34.9% 2 years ago. Our goal is to hit 55% of sales at some point later in the year. And we still believe that long term, that has the potential to be 85% of sales, and we're gearing our supply chain and have been gearing our supply chains to support that kind of business in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fastenal Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. So I'll be starting on Slide 6. Total sales increased 20.3% in the first quarter of 2022. If you adjust for the extra selling day in the period, sales increased by 18.4%. Both periods were impacted by adverse weather and the net effect contributed 50 to 100 basis points to the growth in the period. I'm not going to recite all the numbers that are on this page because we basically experienced consistent growth across all major product categories, our large and our small customers in most end markets. The main exception to this broad-based strength were government customers, which fell 6.2% year-over-year, but I would point out that they were up nearly 50% from pre-pandemic levels. And I think that really reflects sustained share gains across that customer set. So as always, our business does not carry a lot of forward visibility, but our field sales force continues to maintain a very positive outlook about their markets.\nPricing contributed 580 to 610 basis points to growth in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting actions taken over the last 9 months to offset inflation. Input costs have mostly stabilized at high levels with a few notable exceptions. For instance, higher nickel prices will flow through to stainless steel fasteners while higher oil prices will affect the cost of fuel for our captive vehicle fleet and the cost of overseas shipping services. As described on this page, this is -- these are relatively smaller pieces of our business. which we believe we can address through targeted pricing on stainless steel fasteners and surcharges for transportation-related increases. Price contribution should remain high in the second quarter of 2022 before running into tougher comparisons in the second half of 2022.\nThe last thing I'll say about the marketplace is, it is still grappling with supply chain and labor constraints as well as high prices for inputs and products. What is changing is we and our customers are more effectively managing this environment. This is reflected in a higher growth driver signings and improving internal supply chain and relatively strong FTE additions in February and March. So while these disruptions persist, the chaos surrounding them has receded, resulting in a more predictable business environment.\nNow to Slide 7. Operating margin in the first quarter of 2022 was 21%, up from 19.8% in the first quarter of 2021 and good for an incremental margin of 27.1%. While the absence of last year's write-down of masks favorably impacted the year-over-year compare, even adjusting for this, our incremental margin was a solid 24.4%. Gross margin was 46.6% in the first quarter of 2022, up 120 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021. Half of this increase relates to the absence of last year's mask write-down, the next largest contributor was safety product margin, which increased significantly even excluding the effect of the write-down. In the year earlier period, we were still supplying COVID-related supplies to key customers under supply commitments that we had entered into at the start of the pandemic, which had lower margins. Those commitments have since expired and COVID-related product margins have returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nA smaller contributor was a narrower loss on freight service to our branches as strong daily sales growth and freight sales of 37% provided improved cost leverage. Our price/cost remained largely neutral to gross margin in the quarter. Product and customer mix was a roughly 10 basis points negative impact to gross margin with a drag produced by strong Onsite and national account sales having a slightly greater impact than the positive effect of favorable fastener mix. Our operating leverage was modest in the first quarter of 2022, with an operating expense to sales ratio being 10 basis points better at 25.5%. We achieved 60 basis points of leverage over occupancy expenses related to a 10% reduction in our traditional branch count and the effect of what has been to this point, relatively slow expansion of our vending installed base.\nWe also achieved good leverage over employee base pay. While we are encouraged by the February and March growth in our FTE employee base, the tight labor market continues to produce FTE growth that is lagging sales. These areas were mostly offset by strong employee incentive payouts, higher profit-sharing expenses, higher health care costs, higher travel expenses and, to a lesser degree, rising fuel costs. If you put it all together, we reported first quarter 2022 EPS of $0.47, up 27.8% from $0.37 in the first quarter of 2021.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We generated $230 million in operating cash in the first quarter of 2022, which is roughly 85% of our net income in the period. Traditionally, first quarter conversion rates exceed net income. However, a combination of robust customer demand supply chain constraints and high inflation put a premium on product availability and investment in working capital. As a result, we view the lower conversion rate as reflecting our commitment to supporting our customers. as supply chain constraints and inflation rates ease, we expect to see improved conversion rates as we go through the year. Year-over-year, accounts receivable was up 25.9%. This reflects strong customer demand and an increase in the mix of traditional manufacturing and construction customers, which tend to have longer terms versus the prior year period. Inventories were up 22.6%. Inflation accounted for roughly 2/3 of the total increase. That's significant, but it is a decline from the fourth quarter of 2021 when inflation accounted for roughly 80% of the rising inventory and that is the result of an accelerating flow of physical products in to our hubs, which is improving product availability and fulfillment rates.\nNet capital spending in the first quarter of 2022 was $33 million, up from $30 million in the first quarter of 2021, with increased spending for FMI equipment, hub automation and upgrades and IT equipment. Quarterly capital spending level should pick up through the balance of the year as vehicle availability improves and hub projects advance. As a result, we continue to anticipate 2022 net capital spending in a range of $180 million to $200 million, which is unchanged from the prior quarter. We returned cash to shareholders in the quarter in the form of $178 million in dividends. And from a liquidity standpoint, we finished the first quarter of 2022 with debt at 10.4% of total capital, down from 12.7% in the year ago period and 11.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our revolver remains available for use. With that, operator, we'll turn it over for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ellen Stolts of Fastenal Company. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nEllen Stolts\n\nFinancial Reporting & Regulatory Compliance Manager, Fastenal Co.\n\nWelcome to the Fastenal Company 2021 Annual and Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call will be hosted by Dan Florness, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Holden Lewis, our Chief Financial Officer. The call will last for up to 1 hour, and we'll start with a general overview of our annual and quarterly results and operations, with the remainder of the time being open for questions and answers.\nToday's conference call is a proprietary Fastenal presentation and is being recorded by Fastenal. No recording, reproduction, transmission or distribution of today's call is permitted without Fastenal's consent. This call is being audio simulcast on the Internet via the Fastenal Investor Relations homepage, investor.fastenal.com. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website until March 1, 2022, at midnight Central Time.\nAs a reminder, today's conference call may include statements regarding the company's future plans and prospects. These statements are based on our current expectations and we undertake no duty to update them. It is important to note that the company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from anticipated results are contained in the company's latest earnings release and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we encourage you to review those factors carefully. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness.\n\nDaniel L. Florness\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Fastenal Company\n\nThank you, Ellen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter earnings call. Before I start, I wish -- like to make sure my mind is cleared of things so I can focus on the quarter, and I thought I'd share a personal story. And that is a little after 5 this morning, I received a text from my wife, her father, Glenn Gustafson, also known as Gus, had passed away at the age of 90. And there wasn't a trip that he made to Winona -- he was in Eastern Wisconsin, the south of Green Bay. It wasn't a trip that he made to Winona owner where he won't tell me how many Fastenal trucks he met on the road or he won't beam with pride when he would drive by pierce manufacturing in Wisconsin, see those shiny fire trucks, knowing that the Blue team with a whole bunch of vending machines were inside that facility, helping pierce manufacture those fire trucks.\nThis will be my first earnings call in 26 years, where I won't be able to share tidbits of Gus after the call. And I just want to let us know, Gus, I love you and you will be missed and restate the packers will figure out a way to win this weekend without you.\nWith that, a bit on the fourth quarter. So our sales -- we grew about 13% in the fourth quarter. We had 1 less business days. We grew almost 15% on a daily basis. And the quarter was gaining momentum as we went through it with December growing at 16.5%. We leveraged our income statement and our operating margin grew almost 14%. And the quarter really reflects strong underlying demand, good execution on pricing, improved product availability in our supply chain. And in full disclosure, probably the benefit of fewer holiday-related shutdowns that would be typical for this period.\nIt often gets a little bit dizzying trying to make comparisons in 2021 to the prior year given all the wild COVID swings. So I thought I'd share a few vantage points by looking at a 2-year comparison. When we started the year, Q1 was up just over 8% from 2 years earlier. And that was a reflection of a weaker environment, a lot of uncertainty. I'm pleased to say that as we went through the year, that picked up. In the second quarter on a 2-year basis, we were up just over 10%. In the third quarter, on a 2-year basis, we were up 13%. In the fourth quarter, we were up 20%. And if you look at it on a daily basis, we were up almost 22%. So very pleased with how the year was strengthening within our business as it progressed.\nOur gross margin recovered from 2020 as we expected, and it's down from 2019 as we expected. As Holden has shared on earlier calls, the way we're growing the business and the way the mix is changing, does cause our gross margin to decline over time. Again, it's a mix function. And -- but it also causes our operating expenses to drop over time. And we think it's a very effective way to grow the business for our customers, for our employees and for our shareholders.\nOn a 2-year basis, our operating profit grew faster than sales, which really speaks to greater productivity that I touched on a moment ago and very effective cost control on the part of the Blue Team throughout the organization. When we talk and look at the impacts of COVID-19 and how we think about it on a future basis, we now consider COVID-19 to be merely an ongoing element of our global business environment. And like all of society, we have to learn how to live with it.\nThe first step for us is recognizing it for what it is. It's a serious virus, but we -- but our approach is not one of fear and chaos. It's an approach to sharing the facts of our customers and our employees, what we're doing and how we're handling it day to day. I can share with you at the end of last year, cumulatively, we've had 3,400 cases within the Fastenal family over that almost 2-year period.\nSince year-end, that 3,400 has grown to 4,000 and as we've had about 600 cases in the first 2 weeks of the month, about 400 of those occurring last week. If patterns in January mirror what we saw after Thanksgiving in the United States, I would expect our numbers to drop off in the next couple of weeks and to move back to kind of that 40, 50 to 60 cases per week that we've seen before, and time will tell if patterns repeat themselves.\nThe -- again, the biggest focus that we've had in is sharing facts with our employees. We have renovated aggressively our facilities, the air handling to make the air cleaner in all of our facilities quite frankly, not just for COVID but for flu season in general. And it's one way of addressing the comfort for everybody in the business. The growth driver details are laid out on Page 5, and we continue to see expansion in sales through our digital footprint, which was 46.4% of sales in the fourth quarter versus 37% in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAgain, on Page 4, this is just a comparison to 2019, I thought it would be helpful for folks looking at the call. And what emerges for me is a business that exits this 2-year period stronger as an organization than we entered this 2-year period. I think which bodes well for our business as we move into the future. And one thing I think that's probably understated in these comparisons, when you're looking at the sales growth in our operating income growth, in other words, how did we leverage and how did we improve the business. The third 3-month period on a 2-year basis is actually slightly understated in our strength because we have 1 less business day and when you do $25 million a day, a lot of that gross profit flows right to the P&L and that 25.9% operating income growth would have been meaningfully stronger.\nFlipping to Page 5. Holden, I've been stealing his thunder in recent weeks. Based on a comment he made to an investor on a call, I participated in some months back. And he said, in 2020 and 2021, our customers asked Fastenal for different things than in prior years. If you look at prior years, our customers were increasingly asking us to move in with them and be on site and provide resources right in their facility rather than from a few miles away. They also asked us to deploy technology to help their businesses be more efficient. Initially, it was vending. Now it's a combination of vending, bins and what we call FAST Stock, our mobility application, or more broadly our FMI technology. But it's really about helping customers be more successful inside their facilities.\nAs you see from these (inaudible) charts, our Onsite signings and our FMI device signings have been meaningfully impacted by COVID over the last 2 years. However, we feel our opportunity for the future is untainted by this. And if anything, it's strengthened because the definition of who is the potential customer has expanded dramatically during this time frame. So the one thing that I think should jump out because of our brand's footprint, one thing that's for us has always been a relatively small piece is the e-commerce component within our technology platform.\nAnd I'm pleased to say that our customers are embracing that more and more and that's partly a function of the times, and maybe it's partly a function of us embracing it to. But our web sales were up almost 50%. Our EDI was up 47.8% and combined, it was up about -- e-commerce was up 48% in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nPage 6 is a new start as Holden to put in. And it stemmed from a question one of our Directors had in preparation for the Board meeting. It was really looking at the fact that we've closed a lot of branches over the last 6, 7 years. And where do you see that going to? And most of those closures have really occurred in our most mature market, United States and, to a lesser degree, up in Canada. But in those 2 markets combined, we've seen the same pattern.\nSo our branch network peaked out in that 2013 time frame. At that point in time, if you would have started in one of our branches, and would have hopped in a vehicle and drove 30 minutes, our network would have touched about 95% of the U.S. manufacturing base. I don't have that exact statistic for Canada. So you bear with me, please. But today, that number is about 94% as we've rationalized our network. And we believe that ultimately, our branch network in the U.S. and Canada will be about 1,450 locations. So there's a few more to consolidate, and that will be about a 93.5% coverage rate on the manufacturing base in the United States.\nAs I mentioned on the previous page, our business has evolved, and one of those elements is e-commerce. So in March of 2020, we broke 10% of sales going through e-commerce for the first time in our history. As we exit 2021, that number is now 15% of sales. As I mentioned on the previous page, from Q4 to Q4, our volume in e-commerce is up about 48%. And in that 2-year period from Q4 of '19 to Q4 of 2021, so going back before COVID started, we are up 105% in our e-commerce business. And it's really a reflection of our customer base is embracing this way of ordering products from us. But our thrust is, first and foremost, with FMI technology. If there's a discernible pattern to the usage of this product within a customer's facility, most businesses, most distribution businesses focused on how do I make that an electronic order.\nWe look at it and say, Well, if there's a discernible pattern, why are you even ordering the first place. Your supply chain partners should make it available when you need it. And that's what our FMI technology is all about. With that, I'll switch it over to Holden.\n\nHolden Lewis\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Fastenal Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dan. Turning to Slide 7. As indicated, our sales were up 12.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021. On a same-day basis, sales were up 14.6%, which includes up 16.5% in December. The period still had difficult COVID-related comparisons with government daily sales down 35.7% and safety and janitorial products being up only 3.5% and down 3.5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result, we believe total growth in the period understates the strength we are seeing in our traditional manufacturing and construction customers.\nDaily sales for our fastener products increased 24.2%. And if we look at sales, excluding the COVID-affected safety and janitorial products, our daily sales would have been up 21.1%. Outside of government and warehousing, this strength was experienced broadly across our end markets, consistent with macro data points such as the PMI and industrial production. We believe the period was also boosted by fewer holiday-related shutdowns and somewhat improved availability of non-fastener products.\nPricing contributed 440 to 470 basis points to growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, up from 230 to 260 basis points in the third quarter of 2021. This reflects good execution on actions taken during the year to mitigate cost inflation. Higher costs will remain a challenge in the first half of 2022. While certain metals prices seem to be plateauing for the moment, most remain at high levels, products imported into our hubs in the first quarter of 2022 will have a higher cost and shipping costs continue to rise.\nWe do not currently have any broad pricing events queued up for the first quarter of 2022, but we'll be addressing specific product and product categories, particularly fasteners to offset higher costs expected in the first quarter. We expect hub product availability to improve in the first quarter of 2022 and be more stable through the year, which should be a benefit to our customers who are still struggling with availability. However, this reflects shipment timing and our willingness to procure a supply of product several months longer than normal. The supply chain otherwise remain strained. Labor markets remain tight, though we have seen some improvement in our ability to hire in markets with less restricted on-premises recruiting policies.\nNow to Slide 8. Operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 19.6%, up 10 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Our dynamics in the quarter mimic the full year with gross margin rising off of 2020's product-driven low margin and operating expenses being deleveraged as cost reset off of 2020's artificially low level. The gross margin was 46.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2020. This relates to 2 items. First, we experienced strong absorption of overhead and on strong product demand and growth. This exceeded our expectations largely due to the strong accelerating volumes in the period. Second, our safety product margin improved as lower-margin COVID-related PPE was a smaller proportion of total safety sales versus last year, and the margin on those products increased.\nThe impact of product and customer mix in the fourth quarter of 2021 was immaterial as the favorable effect of strong fastener growth nearly matched the negative effect of relatively fast on-site growth. As the gap between fastener and non-fastener growth narrows as seems likely in 2022, this drag is likely to widen to 40 to 50 basis points. Higher pricing continued to largely match higher costs, yielding a neutral price cost in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOur fourth quarter 2021 exit rate and first quarter 2022 plans suggest pricing will remain elevated in the first half of 2022 and sustain a neutral price/cost relationship. The increase in gross margin was partly offset by operating expenses growing faster than sales. This primarily relates to cost resets, which are typical of the first year of any recovery, but exacerbated in 2021 due to the unique COVID-related cost restraints that existed a year ago.\nTo provide perspective, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we had 4 SG&A cost reset categories, incentive pay, health insurance, fuel and travel. We're spending collectively increased 35% and which produced about 120 basis points of deleverage in the period. On the remainder of our costs, most notably occupancy as we continue to rationalize the branch network than IT as we leveraged our strong growth, we achieved 40 basis points of leverage.\nWhat should not be lost is the degree to which we improved our operating expense leverage in 2019 to 2021 as detailed on Page 4 of this presentation. The first quarter of 2022 will still have COVID-related comparisons, albeit moderating aside from last year's mass write-off, but comparisons will mostly normalize in the second quarter. At that point, provided volumes remain healthy in 2022, moving past the initial reset year, combined with continued productivity gains from further penetration of our digital footprint and our branch initiatives should generate improved SG&A leverage. Putting it all together, we reported fourth quarter 2021 EPS of $0.40, up from $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nNow turning to Slide 9. Operating cash flow was $156 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, down 51% year-over-year and representing 68% of net income. For the full year, operating cash flow was $770 million, down 30% and representing 83% of net income. We continue to believe our model produces a conversion rate north of 100% of net income. Additions to working capital caused us to fall short of this goal in 2021.\nYear-over-year, accounts receivable was up 17%. This reflects strong customer demand and a shift from PPE buyers last year and toward traditional customers this year that slightly blended up days outstanding. Inventory was up 13.9%. Though about 80% of that was from inflation. Growth in product for stock remains modest, given supply chain constraints. The rate of sell-through as product becomes available and ongoing efforts to clean out slow-moving hub and branch inventory, closed branches and shift our stocking focus in the field. We have a considerable amount of imported product in transit, and we expect to see product availability, particularly for fastener, improve in the first and second quarters.\nIn the current environment where product availability is a key differentiator. We view our investments in working capital as an effective means of utilizing our balance sheet to support customer service and growth. We finished the fourth quarter of 2021 with debt at 11.4% of total capital, down from 12.9% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. We utilized roughly $25 million of our $700 million revolver to have ample liquidity continue to be available.\nNet capital spending in 2021 was $148 million. In 2022, we anticipate net capital spending in the range of $180 million to $200 million. This increase is committed to both upgrading and investing in new automation at a couple of hubs, higher spending on FMI devices to support expected higher signings and additional manufacturing capacity. That is all for our formal presentation. So with that, operator, we'll turn it over to you for questions."

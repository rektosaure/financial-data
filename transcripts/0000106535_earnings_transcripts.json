[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2025 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $80 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $40 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $217 million for the quarter.\nOur third quarter performance reflects solid execution by our teams against a very challenging market backdrop. Notwithstanding recent headwinds, we remain well positioned to navigate the current environment given our deeply embedded OpEx culture and competitive cost structure. We've done considerable work over the last several years to align our strategy with the cyclicality of our businesses. As a result, Weyerhaeuser is a much stronger company today than at any point in recent history. And we continue to demonstrate the durability of our portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility of our capital allocation framework across market cycles. Looking forward, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that support growth for our businesses, and we're ready to capitalize on opportunities as market conditions improve.\nBefore getting into the businesses, I'd like to provide an update on recent actions to further optimize, improve and grow our Timberlands portfolio. Our recent Timberlands transactions are summarized on Page 18 of our earnings slide.\nIn the third quarter, we completed two high-quality acquisitions totaling $459 million. This includes our previously announced transaction for timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia and another acquisition of exceptional timberlands in Washington state. Additionally, in the third quarter, we advanced three divestiture packages of noncore timberlands, one of which closed earlier this month, and the other is under contract and scheduled to close later in the fourth quarter. These two transactions will result in $410 million of expected cash proceeds by year-end. We anticipate closing the third divestiture in early 2026, and expect total proceeds from all divestitures to exceed the cash outlay required for our recently completed acquisitions.\nThese transactions represent strategic opportunities to improve the quality and value of our portfolio. As we've demonstrated over the last several years, we're committed to active portfolio management across our timber holdings and it remains disciplined and nimble in our approach to growing the value of our timberlands. Through this process, we've achieved the multiyear timberlands growth target we announced in September of 2021. Over a similar period, we've also returned a substantial amount of cash back to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase and announced a compelling engineered Wood Products growth opportunity, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nMoving forward, we will continue to evaluate capital-efficient opportunities that enhance the return profile of our timberlands while also balancing other levers across our capital allocation framework to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Additionally, in the third quarter, we completed the sale of our Princeton mill in British Columbia for $85 million. In September, we received $61 million of the proceeds in conjunction with the closing of the sawmill portion of the deal. We expect to receive the remainder of the transaction proceeds over the coming months following the transfer of associated timber licenses in the province. It's worth noting that our other lumber operations in Canada are not affected by this transaction, and we continue to serve our customers from our 2 sawmills in Alberta.\nTurning now to our third quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9. Timberlands contributed $80 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $148 million, a $4 million decrease compared to the second quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $9 million. Log pricing in the domestic market faced downward pressure in the third quarter as supply remained ample, and mills continue to carry elevated log inventories and navigate a very challenging lumber market. As a result, our average domestic sales realizations decreased moderately compared to the second quarter. Per unit log and haul costs increased in response to higher elevation harvest activity that's typical this time of year, and forestry and road costs were slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were moderately higher and exceeded our initial plan for the quarter, largely driven by fewer operational restrictions given a relatively light wildfire season.\nMoving on to our export business to Japan. Log markets in Japan softened somewhat in the third quarter in response to ongoing consumption headwinds in the Japanese housing market. As a result, our customers' finished goods inventories increased and log prices decreased. Despite this dynamic, our customers remain well positioned relative to imported European lumber, which continues to face headwinds in the Japanese market. For the quarter, our average sales realizations for export logs to Japan were moderately lower and our sales volumes were moderately higher, largely due to the timing of vessels.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was $74 million, a $5 million increase compared to the second quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated slightly in the third quarter as log supply increased with drier weather conditions and as mills further adjusted to weaker lumber markets. In contrast, Southern fiber markets were relatively stable outside of a few localized regions impacted by recent mill closures. On balance, takeaway for our logs remained steady given our delivered programs across the region. That said, our average sales realizations decreased slightly in response to a higher mix of fiber logs from increased thinning activity.\nGiven favorable weather conditions, our fee harvest volumes increased slightly compared to the prior quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were lower and forestry and road costs were comparable. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly due to the higher sales volumes, resulting from the seasonal increase in harvest activity that is typical in the third quarter.\nTurning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $69 million to third quarter earnings and $91 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter EBITDA was $52 million lower than the prior quarter, but $28 million higher than our initial outlook for the segment, largely driven by the timing and mix of real estate sales. It's worth noting that real estate markets have remained healthy year-to-date, and we continue to benefit from strong demand and pricing for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. Notably, our average price per acre has steadily increased in 2025 and reached its highest quarterly level since late 2022.\nI'll now turn to our Natural Climate Solutions business. First, on our carbon capture and sequestration project with Occidental Petroleum, which is expected to reach first injection in 2029. In the third quarter, Occidental announced the formation of a joint venture for the construction and operation of pipeline infrastructure between regional customers in the CO2 storage facility in Livingston, Parish, Louisiana. This represents another important milestone associated with our CCS project and underscores the importance of selecting sophisticated counterparties with strong technical, commercial and project development expertise.\nTurning quickly to Forest Carbon. We have now received approval on our fourth project and currently have 5 additional projects under development. We continue to see solid demand for our credits given our commitment to developing projects that meet a high standard for quality and integrity. For 2025, we still expect a significant increase in credit generation in sales relative to the last couple of years. And overall, we remain on track to reach $100 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Natural Climate Solutions by year-end.\nI'll note here that we are excited to go into much more detail on our Natural Climate Solutions business, including multiyear growth targets at our upcoming Investor Day in December.\nNow moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Excluding a special item associated with the sale of our Princeton mill, earnings for Wood Products was a $48 million loss in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $8 million, a $93 million decrease compared to the second quarter. These results reflect extremely challenging lumber and OSB prices in the quarter, which reached historically low levels on an inflation-adjusted basis.\nStarting with lumber. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $48 million loss as several ongoing headwinds persisted across the North American market. The framing lumber composite began the third quarter on a slight upward trajectory, largely supported by improving Western SPF pricing and broader concerns around the pending increase in duties on Canadian lumber. As the quarter progressed, demand softened seasonally and buyer sentiment turned much more cautious. In addition, the supply-demand imbalance worsened in response to elevated shipments of Canadian lumber into the U.S. market, ahead of the increasing duties. Collectively, these dynamics drove composite pricing significantly lower through the balance of the quarter.\nIt's worth noting that we have seen pricing stabilize and move slightly higher for certain species over the last several weeks. At this point, the industry has largely worked through the excess lumber volume that entered the U.S. prior to Canadian duties moving higher. Although we do expect the typical seasonal softening of demand as we enter the colder winter months, leaner inventories, combined with elevated duties and the new 232 tariffs should support product pricing and bridge the market until we start ramping up for next year's building season.\nFor our lumber business, production volumes decreased by approximately 3% compared to the second quarter. This reflects our election in September to slightly moderate production across our mill set in response to the softer demand environment as well as the volume impacts associated with the closing of our sale of our Princeton mill late in the quarter. As a result, our sales volumes were slightly lower compared to the second quarter, and unit manufacturing costs were higher. Our average sales realizations decreased by 11% in the third quarter and were generally in line with the framing lumber composite. Log costs were moderately lower.\nNow turning to OSB. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $3 million loss, primarily driven by weaker product pricing in response to subdued residential construction activity. Following a steady decline for most of the year, the OSB composite stabilized in August and was generally range-bound for the balance of the quarter, albeit at a much lower level than the prior quarter average. For our OSB business, average sales realizations decreased by 18% compared to the second quarter. Our sales volumes were comparable to the second quarter. Unit manufacturing costs and fiber costs were moderately lower. I'll note that pricing has remained stable through October. And similar to lumber, we do expect demand to improve early next year as we approach the spring building season.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA was $56 million, which was comparable to the second quarter. It's worth noting that third quarter results included a onetime $7 million benefit from insurance proceeds associated with the fire at our MDF facility in Montana earlier this year. As for the performance of our EWP business, we continue to align our production with customer demand and single-family homebuilding activity, both of which softened somewhat in the third quarter. As a result, our sales volumes decreased for most products compared to the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs increased. Notably, our average sales realizations for solid section and I-joist products were comparable to the prior quarter. And raw material costs decreased primarily for OSB web stock.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the second quarter, largely due to a decrease in sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. In the third quarter, we generated $210 million of cash from operations and ended the quarter with approximately $400 million of cash and total debt of just under $5.5 billion. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remains solid, notwithstanding the challenging market backdrop, and we are well positioned to navigate a range of market conditions.\nShare repurchase activity totaled $25 million in the third quarter, and as of quarter end, we had completed approximately $150 million of share repurchase activity for the year. Capital expenditures were $125 million in the third quarter, which includes $32 million related to the construction of our EWP facility in Monticello, Arkansas. As we previously communicated, the total investment for the facility is expected to be approximately $500 million to be incurred through 2027.\nFor full year 2025, we anticipate approximately $130 million of investments for Monticello. And as a reminder, CapEx associated with this project will be excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted FAD as used in our cash return framework.\nExcluding CapEx for Monticello, we have lowered guidance for our typical CapEx program to a range of $380 million to $390 million in 2025. It's worth noting that we are always evaluating our capital allocation levers and have the flexibility within our framework to make adjustments in response to market conditions, alternate uses of cash and to fund growth opportunities.\nGiven the timing of cash inflows and outflows associated with recently announced timberland transactions and typical liability management activities, we took advantage of the beneficial rate environment in third quarter to secure a 3-year $800 million term loan with an effective interest rate of 4.3%, and we used $500 million of the proceeds to prepay a portion of our 2026 maturities.\nThird quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $30 million compared to the second quarter primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 19 and updates to full year outlook items are presented on Page 20. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $30 million lower than third quarter of 2025, largely driven by lower sales volumes and realizations in the West.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Log demand in the domestic market remains soft at the outset of the fourth quarter as mills continue to work through elevated log inventories and navigate a challenging lumber market. That said, log supply typically moderates into the winter months, which should provide some support for log pricing as the quarter progresses. On balance, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the third quarter. Our fee harvest volumes are expected to decrease largely due to fewer working days in the fourth quarter and the pull forward of volume over the summer with minimal wildfire-related operational restrictions. Our per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower and forestry and road costs are expected to decrease seasonally.\nMoving to our log export program to Japan. As Devin mentioned, log inventories have expanded in the Japanese market in response to ongoing consumption headwinds. As a result, we expect softer demand for our logs in the fourth quarter and lower sales volumes compared to the prior quarter. That said, we anticipate our Japanese log sales realizations to be slightly higher, largely driven by freight-related benefits. It's worth noting that we expect demand for our logs to improve over time as inventories normalize in the Japanese market and as our customers continue to take market share from competing imports of European lumber.\nTurning to the South. Sawlog markets remain muted as mills continue to navigate lower pricing and takeaway of lumber and work through elevated log inventories. However, we anticipate a slight uptick in log demand as supply decreases seasonally into the winter months. In contrast, fiber markets are expected to remain relatively stable outside of a few localized regions impacted by recent mill closures. On balance, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region, and we anticipate our sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to decrease seasonally and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be higher. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be moderately lower due to seasonal wet weather conditions, and we anticipate slightly lower sales realizations due to mix.\nMoving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Real estate markets have remained healthy year-to-date, and we have capitalized on strong demand and significant premiums to timber value. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA to approximately $390 million, an increase of $40 million from prior guidance. We now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 25% to 30% for the year, and we remain on track to reach $100 million of EBITDA from our Natural Climate Solutions business by year-end. For the segment, we expect fourth quarter earnings before special items to be approximately $5 million lower and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $15 million lower than the third quarter of 2025 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.\nTurning to our Wood Products segment. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we expect fourth quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly lower than the third quarter of 2025. We anticipate a slightly softer demand environment for Wood Products in the fourth quarter as housing and R&R activity typically moderates into the winter months. Looking further out, we would expect demand to increase into next year's spring building season and more broadly as the macro environment improves. Composite pricing for lumber and OSB has been relatively stable through October. That said, pricing for both products remains at historically low levels on an inflation-adjusted basis and slightly below third quarter averages.\nFor our lumber business, we slightly reduced our production at the end of the third quarter in response to the softer demand environment and have maintained a similar operating posture through October. Assuming we continue with this reduced posture for the remainder of the quarter, combined with the effect of the Princeton sale, our lumber production would be approximately 10% lower quarter-over-quarter. As a result, we anticipate lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be comparable to the prior quarter and log costs are expected to decrease moderately. Looking forward, we will continue to ensure our operating posture is aligned with driving optimal financial performance.\nFor our OSB business, we expect sales volumes and fiber costs to be comparable to the third quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be higher due to planned annual maintenance outages that are typical in the fourth quarter. For our engineered wood products business, we continue to align our production with customer demand, which is most notably tied to single-family home building activity. As a result, we anticipate lower sales volumes for most products compared to the third quarter, with our average sales realizations and raw material costs expected to be comparable. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the third quarter.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Starting with housing. Overall, housing activity has remained lackluster this year with total starts hovering around 1.3 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and single-family starts below 1 million units. Based on conversations with our homebuilder customers, the biggest issues continue to be ongoing affordability challenges and weaker consumer confidence. While mortgage rates have declined to the low 6% range, many potential homebuyers remain on the sidelines given elevated uncertainty about the economy, inflation and employment. The ongoing government shutdown is likely also not -- also having an impact on overall sentiment. All said, consumers have been less inclined to jump into the housing market in 2025, given all the noise in the broader macro environment.\nMoving forward, it seems we could see some of the tariff-related concerns easing over time. We might also get additional support from the Fed on interest rates in the coming months. And hopefully, the government shutdown will end soon. Perhaps clarity in these areas could alleviate some of the uncertainty that's been weighing on consumers in the housing market. And while I suspect we'll see the typical seasonal pattern of slowing construction activity over the winter months, we do expect to improve as we approach next year's spring building season.\nOver the longer term, our outlook on housing fundamentals remains favorable, supported by strong demographic tailwinds and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. In addition, there seems to be a growing appreciation that government policies need to better accommodate building activity to address housing shortages across the country. All of this will ultimately support healthy demand for housing over time.\nTurning to the repair and remodel market. Activity has been softer this year compared to 2024, largely driven by many of the same factors impacting the residential construction market, namely lower consumer confidence, higher interest rates and concerns around the trajectory of the economy. We've also seen less R&R activity in response to lower turnover of existing homes given higher mortgage rates and the lock-in effect.\nLooking forward, while we do expect seasonal moderation in R&R activity around the holidays, we're optimistic that demand will recover as interest rates move lower and consumer confidence improves. In addition, we think the dynamic around deferral of large discretionary projects over the last few years will ultimately serve as a tailwind as the macro environment improves. And longer term, many of the key drivers supporting repair and remodel activity remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nIn closing, I'm extremely proud of the focus and resilience demonstrated by our teams in the third quarter. Despite the challenging market backdrop, we continue to execute against our strategy and demonstrate the durability of our portfolio and capital allocation framework across market cycles. Our financial position is strong, and we continue to capitalize on strategic opportunities to enhance the value of our portfolio. And looking forward, we maintain a favorable outlook on the longer-term demand fundamentals that support growth in housing, repair and remodel and climate solutions. And we remain focused on driving operational excellence, serving our customers and creating long-term value for our shareholders. And finally, we look forward to connecting with many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on December 11. Davie and I will be joined by other members of our senior management team to present a detailed overview of our strategic growth plan, enterprise capabilities and financial targets through 2030. For those of you who plan to attend the event virtually, please visit our website to register in advance for the live webcast.\nAnd with that, I think we can open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2025 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $87 million or $0.12 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $336 million, a slight increase over the first quarter of 2025. These are solid results in light of the current challenging market backdrop. And I'm pleased with the operational performance delivered by our teams.\nBefore getting into the businesses, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth opportunity within our Southern Timberlands portfolio. As we announced in May, we're acquiring 117,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in North Carolina and Virginia or $375 million. This acquisition represents a unique off-market opportunity to enhance our footprint in a strong and growing sawlog and fiber market in the U.S. South. These timberlands are strategically located proximate to existing Weyerhaeuser Timberlands and mill operations in the region and are expected to deliver immediate and sustained portfolio-leading cash flows within our Southern Timberlands business.\nWith an average annual free cash flow yield of 5.1% over the first 5 years, and that's a timber only number. In addition, we see significant optionality to capture upside from alternative value opportunities over time. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter, and the cash outlay for the transaction is expected to be predominantly sourced from divestitures of noncore timberlands, and we anticipate completing these transactions in a tax-efficient manner.\nAs we've demonstrated over the last several years, we are committed to active portfolio management across our timber holdings and have remained disciplined in our approach to growing the value of our timberlands including through targeted acquisitions as well as divesting of nonstrategic acreage. Upon closing of our latest North Carolina and Virginia acquisition, we will have achieved the multiyear target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of investments by the end of 2025.\nWe've also grown our lumber capacity and are moving forward with the compelling engineered wood products growth opportunity in Arkansas, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. And importantly, we've returned a significant amount of cash back to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase over this period.\nLooking forward, we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that enhance the return profile for our timberlands and provide upside potential through our real estate and ENR business and we'll balance these activities with other levers across our capital allocation framework to drive superior long-term value for shareholders.\nTurning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $88 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $152 million, a $15 million decrease compared to the first quarter, largely driven by higher costs in our Western operations, which are typical in the spring and summer months.\nTurning to the Western domestic market, log demand was healthy at the outset of the second quarter, given seasonally lower log supply and steady takeaway of lumber. As the quarter progressed, log supply improved seasonally but demand waned as mills responded to a softening lumber market and elevated log inventories. As a result, log prices were strongest in April and trended lower for the balance of the quarter.\nGiven these dynamics, our average domestic sales realizations decreased slightly relative to the first quarter and fee harvest volumes were comparable. Our per unit log and haul costs increased as we made the seasonal transition to higher elevation sites and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher.\nMoving on to our export business to Japan. Log markets in Japan were stable in the second quarter. Demand for our logs continued to benefit from lower shipments and inventories of imported European lumber in the Japanese market, which has allowed our customers to take market share. As a result, our average sales realizations for export logs to Japan increased moderately compared to the first quarter. However, our sales volumes were moderately lower due to the timing of vessels.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was $69 million, a slight decrease compared to the prior quarter. Despite a reduction in log supply resulting from wet weather conditions, southern sawlog demand was muted in the second quarter as mills continue to align production with lower pricing and takeaway of lumber. In contrast, demand for our fiber logs improved as mills transition from spring maintenance outages. In general, takeaway for our logs remained steady given our delivered programs across the region, and our average sales realizations increased slightly compared to the first quarter.\nGiven the weather than normal conditions, our forestry and road costs and fee harvest volumes were lower than our initial expectations. That said, our harvest volumes increased slightly compared to the prior quarter. Per unit log and haul costs increased moderately. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly due to lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions.\nTurning now to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources business on Pages 9 and 10. Real Estate and ENR contributed $106 million to second quarter earnings and $143 million to adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter EBITDA was $61 million higher than the prior quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of real estate sales. We continue to benefit from healthy demand for real estate properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nTurning briefly to our Natural Climate Solutions business. During the second quarter, we received approval on our third forest carbon project and currently have 6 additional projects in progress. We continue to see solid demand for our credits given our commitment to delivering and developing projects that meet high standards for quality and integrity. For 2025, we still expect a significant increase in credit generation and sales relative to the last couple of years, and we remain on track to reach $100 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Natural Climate Solutions business by year-end.\nNow moving to Wood Products on Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products contributed $46 million to second quarter earnings and $101 million to adjusted EBITDA. Starting with lumber. After a steady increase in the first quarter, the framing lumber composite peaked in early April and trended lower through late June. This was driven by cautious buyer sentiment in response to elevated macroeconomic uncertainty and a softer-than-expected spring building season. Across the North American regions, pricing for Western SPF lumber has steadily increased since mid-May, largely as a result of concerns around the upcoming increase in duties on Canadian shipments to the U.S.\nOver the same period, pricing for Southern yellow pine lumber decreased significantly as supply outpaced demand. This dynamic was compounded by adverse weather conditions in certain southern geographies which impacted building activity in the second quarter. That said, Southern lumber prices have shown signs of stabilization in recent weeks.\nFor our lumber business, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $11 million, a $29 million decrease compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by lower product pricing and slightly higher log costs. Our average sales realizations decreased by 2% in the second quarter which was largely in line with the framing lumber composite. Our sales volumes increased and unit manufacturing costs were comparable.\nFinally, on lumber, I'll make a few comments on the recent announcement to sell our Princeton mill in British Columbia. While these decisions are never easy to make, we think this is the best outcome for our Princeton operations. The buyer is local with deep roots in the region, and we expect a seamless transition that will position the facility for future success in a challenging operating environment. The purchase price is approximately CAD 120 million and includes the mill, all associated timber license assets in British Columbia and the value of working capital, which will be subject to customary purchase price adjustments at closing.\nWe expect the mill portion of the transaction to close in the third quarter and the forest tenures to follow over the ensuing months. Upon closing, we expect to recognize a gain on the sale and incur a tax liability of approximately CAD 15 million.\nI do want to express my deep appreciation to our dedicated employees who contributed to the success of our Princeton operation over the years and to the local community who has been incredibly supportive of our operations and people. It's worth noting that our other operations in Canada will not be affected by this transaction, and we will continue to serve customers from our 2 lumber mills in Alberta.\nSo now turning to OSB. Benchmark pricing for OSB decreased significantly in the second quarter, largely driven by softening demand from new home construction activity and ample supply. Pricing did stabilize by quarter end and has remained steady through July. For our OSB business, adjusted EBITDA was $30 million, a $29 million decrease compared to the first quarter primarily due to lower product pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 12%, which was favorable to the OSB composite. This is largely due to the length of our order files, which results in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our sales volumes and fiber costs were slightly higher compared to the prior quarter and unit manufacturing costs increased due to additional downtime for planned annual maintenance.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA was $57 million, a slight increase compared to the first quarter. This was driven by a seasonal increase in sales volumes across all products and lower raw material and unit manufacturing costs. Notably, our second quarter EWP results reflect an improvement in operating posture at our MDF facility in Montana, which experienced a multi-week outage in the first quarter. These favorable drivers were partially offset by lower average sales realizations across most EWP products as new home construction activity was softer than our initial expectations coming into the second quarter.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter as seasonally higher sales volumes were offset by lower pricing for commodity and EWP products.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. In the second quarter, we generated $396 million of cash from operations. We ended the quarter with approximately $600 million of cash and total debt of just under $5.2 billion. Share repurchase activity totaled $100 million in the second quarter, representing our highest quarterly level since late 2022. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $25.74. In May, we completed our previous $1 billion share repurchase program, which was authorized in September of 2021 and announced a new $1 billion authority going forward.\nReflecting on our cash return actions since the beginning of 2021, including dividends and share repurchase, we've returned more than $5.7 billion of cash back to shareholders. Over a similar period, we've continued investing in our businesses at a meaningful level, deployed capital towards strategic growth opportunities and improved our balance sheet. These are notable achievements that underscore the durability of our portfolio and the flexibility of our capital allocation framework across market cycles. Looking ahead, our new authorization provides capacity for future opportunistic share repurchase activity and represents an important ongoing lever for driving long-term value for our shareholders.\nCapital expenditures were $107 million in the second quarter, which includes $22 million related to the construction of our EWP facility in Monticello, Arkansas. Specific to Monticello, the project is on track, and we broke ground on the facility in June. As we previously communicated, the total investment for the facility is expected to be approximately $500 million which will be incurred through 2027. For full year 2025, we anticipate approximately $130 million of investments for Monticello.\nAnd as a reminder, CapEx associated with this project will be excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted FAD as used in our cash return framework. Excluding CapEx for Monticello, we have lowered guidance for our typical CapEx program from $440 million to approximately $400 million in 2025. It's worth noting that we are always evaluating our capital allocation levers and have the flexibility within our framework to make adjustments in response to market conditions, alternate uses of cash and to fund growth opportunities.\nSecond quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 14. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $22 million compared to first quarter primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO.\nLooking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 17 and updates to full year outlook items are presented on Page 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $10 million lower compared to the second quarter of 2025, largely driven by lower sales realizations and higher costs in the West. As a reminder, results for our Timberlands business are generally at their lowest level in the third quarter, given seasonal dynamics.\nTurning to the West. We expect domestic log demand and pricing to face downward pressure in the third quarter as mills continue to carry elevated log inventories and navigate a softer lumber market. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. However, limitations on log supply during wildfire season and the effect of increased duties on Canadian lumber imports could drive more favorable pricing as the quarter progresses.\nWe anticipate seasonally higher forestry and road costs as we do a significant amount of this work over the summer months and per unit log and haul costs are expected to increase given higher elevation harvest activity that's typical this time of year. Our fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher compared to the second quarter.\nBriefly on our log export program to Japan. Imports of European lumber have been lower year-to-date relative to 2024, allowing our customers to take market share. As a result, we anticipate steady demand for our logs in the third quarter. Our sales volumes are expected to increase moderately, largely due to the timing of vessels and our average sales realizations are expected to increase slightly.\nTurning to the South. We expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter as log supply improves with drier weather conditions. In contrast, Southern fiber markets are expected to remain relatively stable outside of a few localized regions with softer demand due to reduced capacity or elevated log inventories.\nOn balance, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region, and we anticipate our sawlog pricing to be comparable to the second quarter. That said, our average sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly, largely due to a higher mix of fiber logs from increased thinning activity. Given favorable weather conditions, we anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be slightly higher compared to the second quarter.\nOur forestry and road costs are expected to increase as weather than normal spring conditions resulted in certain activities shifting to the third quarter. And per unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable. In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and we anticipate moderately lower sales realizations due to mix.\nMoving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the segment, we continue to expect full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $350 million, which includes our target to reach $100 million of EBITDA in our Natural Climate Solutions business. That said, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $80 million lower and earnings will be approximately $60 million lower than the second quarter of 2025 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For context, it's common for our real estate results to be more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year.\nIn our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the second quarter of 2025 excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Given the softer-than-expected demand environment over the last several months, composite pricing for lumber and OSB declined steadily during the second quarter. As a result, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for both products are moderately lower than the second quarter averages. Notably, we have seen signs of stabilization in composite pricing over the last several weeks.\nLooking ahead, we expect demand for both products to remain at current levels into the third quarter. That said, duties on Canadian lumber shipments to the U.S. are expected to increase meaningfully. This dynamic, along with lean channel inventories could provide some support for North American lumber pricing in the coming months, and potentially serve as a catalyst for incremental substitution towards Southern Yellow Pine.\nIn addition, on the demand side, we could see an increase in repair and remodel activity in the south as temperatures moderate into the fall and more broadly should the Fed cut interest rates. For our lumber and OSB businesses, we expect sales volumes and unit manufacturing costs to be comparable to the second quarter. Log and fiber costs are expected to be slightly lower.\nFor our Engineered Wood Products business, we continue to anticipate close alignment between product demand and single-family homebuilding activity, which has been softer than expected year-to-date. As a result, we expect lower sales volumes for most products in the third quarter and slightly lower average sales realizations as previously determined price adjustments take effect in certain markets. Raw material costs are expected to decrease primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the second quarter.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Starting with housing. After a reasonably solid first quarter, housing starts have softened over the last few months, total starts averaging 1.3 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis in the second quarter and single-family starts below 1 million units. While the broader economy appears to be holding up reasonably well, the combination of weaker consumer confidence in elevated mortgage rates has been a headwind for housing activity.\nAs a result, the spring building season was softer than we were expecting at the outset of the year and I suspect we'll continue to see some choppiness in the housing market in the near term. Based on conversations with our homebuilder customers, the biggest issue right now is consumer confidence and general uncertainty around trade policy inflation and unemployment.\nThat said, there are potential catalysts for improvement in the second half of the year. For example, we now have clarity on the tax bill and we could see additional trade deals emerge in the coming days and weeks, providing more certainty around trade and tariff policy. We might also get some support from the Fed on interest rates later this year. So we'll have to see how these things play out, but clarity in these areas could alleviate some of the uncertainty that's been weighing on consumers.\nBut putting current market conditions aside, the longer-term fundamentals remain intact for a strong housing market, supported by favorable demographic tailwinds and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. In addition, the inventory of existing homes for sale will likely remain below historical levels given elevated rates.\nAnd on a positive note, there seems to be a growing appreciation that government policies need to better accommodate building activity to address housing shortages across the country. All of this will ultimately support healthy demand for housing in the years to come.\nTurning to the repair and remodel market. Activity has been softer year-to-date relative to 2024, largely driven by many of the same factors impacting the residential construction market. In addition, R&R activity continues to be impacted by lower turnover of existing homes given higher mortgage rates and the lock-in effect. In the near term, we'll likely continue to see more muted R&R environment until consumer confidence improves and interest rates move lower.\nI would note, however, that we typically see a seasonal uptick in repair and remodel activity in the South as temperatures moderate into the fall. And looking further out, we continue to expect favorable demand fundamentals for R&R activity, including significantly increased levels of home equity and an aging housing stock. In addition, we've largely worked through the pull forward of projects that occurred during the pandemic and in fact, are now seeing deferrals of R&R projects. So this should be a tailwind for repair and remodel activity as the macro environment improves.\nIn closing, we delivered solid operating performance in the second quarter, notwithstanding the challenging market backdrop. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning meaningful amounts of cash back to shareholders, while also capitalizing on strategic portfolio opportunities. Notably, we significantly increased our share repurchase activity in the second quarter and we continue to enhance the value of our timberlands portfolio with high quality and strategically located acreage.\nLooking forward, we're well positioned to navigate a range of market conditions in the near term, and we remain confident in the longer-term demand fundamentals that support our businesses. Our balance sheet is strong, and we continue to focus on driving operational excellence, serving our customers, enhancing our unmatched portfolio and creating long-term value for shareholders through our disciplined and flexible capital allocation framework.\nWith that, I think we can open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nThank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2025 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $83 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $328 million, a 12% increase over the fourth quarter of 2024. These are solid results considering elevated macroeconomic uncertainty in the first quarter, and I'm pleased with the operational performance delivered by our teams.\nTurning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $102 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $167 million a $41 million increase compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by stronger domestic sales realizations in the West. Turning to the domestic market in the West. Log demand was healthy in the first quarter as mills responded to strengthening lumber prices and seasonally lower log supply. As a result, pricing for our grade logs increased our average domestic sales realizations were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter.\nOur domestic sales volumes increased moderately as we strategically shifted logs to domestic customers and pause shipments to China, given the recent ban on U.S. log imports. Fee harvest volumes were moderately higher and per unit log and haul costs decreased as we made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower.\nMoving to our Western export business. In Japan, demand for our logs improved in the first quarter. This was largely driven by a recent decrease in shipments and inventories of imported European lumber, which has allowed our customers to increase market share. As a result, our sales volumes for export logs to Japan were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter, and average sales realizations were slightly higher.\nIn China, Log demand moderated in the first quarter in response to reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given this dynamic, coupled with improving Western domestic market conditions we elected to significantly reduce volumes into China during the quarter. In early March, we paused all shipments in response to Chinese regulators announcing an immediate ban on log imports from the U.S. As a result, our sales volumes decreased significantly compared to the fourth quarter, and average realizations were moderately lower. It's worth noting that the log ban had a minimal impact on our first quarter results and we don't anticipate this being a material headwind to our Western business in the near term.\nGiven our diverse customer base, we were able to shift volumes to other buyers for our Western logs. I'll also note that we had reduced our China export program in the quarters leading up to the log band, primarily due to ongoing consumption headwinds in the region and improving Western domestic market conditions.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands decreased by $3 million as log markets were largely stable compared to the fourth quarter. Southern sawlog demand remained muted in response to ample log supply and mill is continuing to align capacity with lower takeaway of finished goods. In contrast, Southern fiber markets were generally balanced. In general, takeaway for our logs remained steady in the first quarter given our delivered programs across the region.\nAs a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and per unit log and haul costs were also comparable. Forestry and road costs were slightly higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter due to slightly higher sales realizations and volumes.\nTurning now to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 9 and 10. Real Estate and ENR contributed $56 million to first quarter earnings and $82 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $6 million higher than the fourth quarter largely driven by the timing and mix of real estate sales. Real Estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we continue to capitalize on steady demand and pricing for HBU properties with significant premiums to timber value.\nI'll now turn to our Natural Climate Solutions business and cover some exciting news on one of our previously announced carbon capture and sequestration agreement. Earlier this month, Occidental Petroleum announced an important milestone associated with our CCS project in Livingston, Parish, Louisiana. They've signed a 25-year offtake agreement for approximately 2.3 million metric tons of CO2 per year from a third-party facility that's being constructed in the region. The emitting facility is expected to be operational in 2029 and subsurface injection of CO2 should commence around that time. This is an important step for our CCS project with Oxy and represents tangible progress in advancing Weyerhaeuser's growth in the CCS space.\nIn addition, this underscores the importance of selecting sophisticated counterparties with strong technical, commercial and project development expertise. Now moving on to Wood Products on Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products contributed $106 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $161 million, which was comparable to our fourth quarter results. Starting with lumber.\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA was $40 million, a $19 million improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Although buyer sentiment remains cautious, the framing lumber composite increased moderately in the first quarter largely driven by supply constraints from previously enacted curtailments and closures across the North American market, combined with a slight seasonal improvement in building activity into the spring months. Pricing was further supported by concerns and speculation around tariffs on Canadian supply, particularly SPF lumber products.\nI'll also note that we've seen a steady increase in southern yellow pine lumber prices since January. For our lumber business, average sales realizations increased by 5% in the first quarter, largely in line with the framing lumber composite. Our sales volumes increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter and unit manufacturing costs were slightly lower as production levels increased. It is worth noting that both sales volumes and unit manufacturing costs were slightly unfavorable to our initial outlook for the quarter. This was primarily driven by temporary operational impacts from winter weather in January and a somewhat softer demand environment in the more uncertain macro backdrop. Our log costs were moderately higher, primarily for Western Logs.\nTurning to OSB. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $59 million, a $4 million decrease compared to the fourth quarter. Benchmark pricing for OSB entered the first quarter on a downward trajectory, largely in response to elevated channel inventories and slower building activity in the winter months. As the quarter progressed, demand and pricing improved slightly in anticipation of the spring building season, but later reversed as buyers weighed the potential impacts of tariffs on the economy and housing demand. This dynamic has persisted into April.\nFor our OSB business, average sales realizations decreased by 1% in the first quarter, which was favorable to the OSB composite. This is largely due to the length of our order files, which results in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Given the softer demand environment, our sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. Unit manufacturing costs and fiber costs were slightly higher.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA was $53 million. a $16 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. I'll note that we experienced a multi-week outage at our MDF facility in Montana as a result of a fire event in February. This impacted our first quarter EWP results by approximately $11 million. The facility resumed partial production in mid-March and is now back to a more normal operating posture. We plan to make up most of the lost volume over the course of 2025.\nMoving to our full EWP segment. Average sales realizations for most products were comparable to slightly higher than fourth quarter averages. Our sales volumes decreased in the first quarter, primarily for MDF and solid section products whereas I-joist volumes were comparable. Unit manufacturing costs were lower for most product categories, excluding MDF and raw material costs were higher.\nTurning to the overall demand environment. Although our EWP sales volumes and pricing held up reasonably well in the first quarter, demand was softer than our initial expectations. That said, we have seen a slight uptick in our order files over the last several weeks, and we do expect our sales volumes to increase seasonally in the second quarter.\nMoving forward, demand for EWP products will remain closely aligned with new home construction activity, particularly in the single-family segment. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We ended the first quarter with $560 million of cash and total debt of just under $5.2 billion. First quarter share repurchase activity totaled approximately $25 million. And as of quarter end, we had completed approximately $925 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization.\nWe returned $152 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which we increased by 5% to $0.21 per share during the quarter. This marked the fourth consecutive year of increasing our sustainable base dividend by 5% or more. We continue to believe that our dividend framework, combined with opportunistic share repurchase and enhances our ability to drive long-term value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across market cycles.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $93 million, which includes $16 million related to the construction of our EWP facility in Arkansas. As we previously communicated, CapEx associated with this project will be excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted FAD as used in our flexible cash return framework. In the first quarter, we generated $70 million of cash from operations. It's worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build.\nDuring the quarter, we refinanced $210 million of high coupon debt at maturity by issuing a $300 million variable rate term loan. We have no additional debt maturing in 2025. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remains strong, and we are well positioned to navigate a range of market conditions.\nUnallocated items are summarized on Page 14. Adjusted EBITDA for unallocated decreased by $13 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 17.\nIn our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $15 million lower compared to the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to the seasonal increase in forestry and road costs in our Western operations. Turning to the West. We anticipate steady log demand in the domestic market in the second quarter as mills respond to improving lumber takeaway as we get deeper into the spring building season. At the same time, log supply is expected to increase as weather conditions improve seasonally. Given these dynamics, we expect a fairly balanced domestic log market and stable pricing for Douglas fir logs.\nThat said, we anticipate our average domestic sales realizations will be slightly lower compared to the first quarter, largely due to mix. We expect our fee harvest volumes to be slightly higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions. Forestry and road costs are expected to be higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to increase slightly as we move to higher elevation sites.\nBriefly on our log export program to Japan, as Devin mentioned, shipments and inventories of imported European lumber have decreased, which has allowed our customers to take market share. As a result, we expect steady demand for our logs in the second quarter. That said, we anticipate lower sales volumes compared to the first quarter due to the timing of vessels. Our average sales realizations are expected to increase moderately.\nTurning to the South. On balance, we're expecting Southern log prices to be relatively stable during the quarter and our average sales realizations to be comparable to the first quarter. Log inventories were ample at the outset of the second quarter, but we expect a slight improvement in sawlog demand as mills respond to the recent uptick in pricing and takeaway of lumber.\nIn addition, we anticipate improving fiber demand through the quarter as mills transition from spring maintenance outages. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be higher due to drier weather conditions that are typical in the second quarter, and we anticipate moderately higher per unit log-in haul costs.\nIn the North, our sales realizations are expected to be moderately higher compared to the first quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower given spring breakup conditions.\nMoving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We continue to see solid demand for real estate properties and expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $50 million higher and earnings will be approximately $40 million higher than the first quarter of 2025 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.\nFor the full year, we maintain our adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately $350 million for the segment, which includes our target to reach $100 million of EBITDA in our Natural Climate Solutions business. We now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 30% to 40% for the full year. In our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2025, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB as sales volumes increased seasonally across our Wood Products businesses.\nAfter a slower-than-expected start to the spring building season, I'll note that we are seeing signs of improving demand in certain end markets particularly from the treater segment in the U.S. South. In addition, order files for our EWP products have improved over the last several weeks.\nAs shown on Page 18, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the first quarter average. This is largely in response to the steady increase in pricing for Southern yellow pine lumber products. Conversely, for OSB, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are moderately lower compared to the first quarter average. For our lumber business, we expect slightly higher sales volumes and log costs compared to the first quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be comparable.\nFor our Oriented Strand Board business, we anticipate slightly higher sales volumes and fiber costs. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to increase due to more downtime for planned annual maintenance compared to the first quarter.\nTurning to our Engineered Wood Products business. We anticipate slightly higher sales volumes for all products in the second quarter and comparable average sales realizations. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be lower primarily driven by increased production at our MDF facility in Montana, which has returned to more normal operating levels. And raw material costs are expected to be moderately lower. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter as sales volumes increased seasonally.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Dave. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets, starting with housing. For the first quarter, housing held up reasonably well with total starts averaging nearly 1.4 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and single-family starts averaging around 1 million units in the quarter.\nHowever, homebuilder sentiment waned somewhat as the quarter progressed, and prospective buyers turned more cautious in response to elevated uncertainty surrounding tariffs in the broader economy. This cautious sentiment continued into April as trade policy actions accelerated and markets experienced elevated volatility. Given these dynamics, the spring building season has gotten off to a softer start than we were expecting at the outset of 2025.\nMoving forward, the housing market will ultimately be determined by the state of the economy and whether the employment picture remains healthy. If the U.S. economy and employment hold up reasonably well, there is no reason we cannot still experience a solid housing market in 2025. Further, if mortgage rates move down over the course of the year, we could even see some upside in housing activity.\nIn the near term, however, I suspect we'll see some choppiness in the housing activity as trade negotiations continue and the economy adjusts to these policies. But putting the current environment aside, we remain bullish on housing over the long term. supported by strong demographic tailwinds, a vastly underbilled housing stock and historically low existing home inventories.\nTurning to the repair and remodel market. Despite the seasonal decrease in activity that's typical in the winter months, R&R activity held up reasonably well in the first quarter. Underlying demand fundamentals remain solid, and we're seeing the typical pickup in activity as the weather improves. That said, we are still experiencing some headwinds in this market, namely higher interest rates and fewer existing home transactions due to the lock-in effect and more recently, weakening consumer confidence.\nAs we look forward, while repair and remodel activity may experience a little turbulence here in the near term as the economy adjusts to tariff actions, we do expect demand to pick up as the year progresses. And as we look out over the medium to long term, many of the drivers for R&R activity are still very much in place, including significantly increased levels of home equity and an aging housing stock.\nIn addition, we've largely worked through the pull forward of projects that occurred during the pandemic and in fact, are now seeing project deferrals for R&R projects. So this should be a tailwind for repair and remodel activity as the macro environment improves.\nIn closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the first quarter. In addition, we increased our quarterly base dividend for the fourth consecutive year and recently reached an important milestone in our CCS agreement with Occidental in Louisiana. Looking forward, we're well positioned to navigate a range of market conditions in the near term and we remain confident in the longer-term demand fundamentals that support our businesses.\nOur balance sheet is strong, and we continue to focus on driving operational excellence, serving customers capitalizing on strategic opportunities and creating long-term value for our shareholders through our disciplined and flexible capital allocation framework.\nWith that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin. .\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $396 million or $0.54 per diluted share on net sales of $7.1 billion. Excluding special items, full year 2024 earnings totaled $384 million or $0.53 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $81 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $294 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter.\nI'll start this morning by expressing my sincere gratitude to our Weyerhaeuser employees for their solid execution and dedication in 2024 in what was a very challenging market backdrop. Through their collective efforts, we continue to serve our customers, delivered industry-leading operating performance and drove meaningful improvements across each of our value levers in the investment thesis. Notably, we grew our timberlands through acquisitions in Alabama, announced plans to expand our engineered wood products portfolio, advanced our Natural Climate Solutions business and captured additional operational excellence improvements.\nWe also increased our base dividend by more than 5% and returned $735 million of cash to shareholders based on our 2024 results. including $153 million of share repurchase. I'm incredibly proud of these accomplishments, all of which support our growth strategy and drive long-term value for our shareholders. Before moving into the business segment results, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth initiative within our EWP business, which is summarized on Page 24 of our earnings slides.\nAs we announced in the fourth quarter, we plan to invest approximately $500 million to build a state-of-the-art Timberstrand facility in Arkansas. Timberstrand is a proprietary and versatile engineered wood product with applications in residential, industrial and mass timber end markets. The new facility will address an underserved and growing market for the product in the U.S. South and showcases Weyerhaeuser's innovation in Wood Products.\nNotably, we combined institutional expertise from our existing Timberstrand facility in Canada with extensive research and development to enable manufacturing of the product with Southern Yellow Pine as the primary feedstock. Given its location in Arkansas, the new facility will deliver seamless integration with our existing Timberlands and distribution network. In fact, approximately 80% of the raw material sourcing for the facility will come from Weyerhaeuser of the timberlands, resulting in an excellent new outlet for our southern fiber logs in the region.\nConstruction of the facility will begin this year with startup expected in 2027. Once fully operational, the facility will add 10 million cubic feet of production, doubling Weyerhaeuser's Timberstrand offering and increasing total company EWP capacity by approximately 24%. In addition, the facility is expected to generate over $100 million of annual adjusted EBITDA, with additional upside from portfolio integration benefits.\nWe're excited to bring this new facility online and look forward to expanding our footprint and workforce in Arkansas. With that, I'll now turn to our fourth quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10. Timberlands contributed $62 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $126 million, a slight increase compared to the third quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the third quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market. Log demand improved in the fourth quarter as mills responded to strengthening lumber prices and a seasonal reduction in log supply across the system.\nAs a result, pricing for grade logs increased as the quarter progressed and moved substantially higher in December. That said, our average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter due to mix. Our sales volumes to domestic customers increased moderately as we reduced shipments to our customers increase moderately as we reduce shipments to customers in China.\nPer unit log and haul costs were comparable to the third quarter and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly lower, largely due to fewer working days in the fourth quarter. Moving to our Western export business. In Japan, log markets remained soft in the fourth quarter due to ongoing consumption headwinds and elevated inventories of finished products for our customers.\nAs a result, our sales volumes and average realizations for export logs to Japan were slightly lower compared to the third quarter. However, inventories and shipments of European lumber imports decreased as the quarter progressed, allowing our customers to pick up market share. As a result, we expect stronger demand for our Japanese export logs in the first quarter.\nIn China, despite ongoing consumption headwinds, log markets remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter and demand from our strategic customers was steady. That said, our sales volumes into China were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to our domestic customers. Our average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands increased by $2 million compared to the third quarter. Southern sawlog markets remained muted in the fourth quarter as log supply was ample and mills continued to align capacity with lower takeaway of finished goods. This was partially driven by the seasonal reduction in lumber demand around the holidays. In contrast, Southern fiber markets were generally stable. On balance, takeaway for our logs remained steady given our delivered programs across the region, and our average sales realizations increased slightly compared to the third quarter, largely driven by a higher mix of grade logs.\nOur fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs increased in the fourth quarter as operating activities in certain regions shifted from the prior quarter due to wet weather conditions. Per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the third quarter. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter, largely driven by higher fee harvest and sales volumes given favorable weather conditions.\nTurning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 11 and 12. In the fourth quarter, Real Estate and ENR contributed $46 million to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $76 million, and largely in line with third quarter results. For the full year, the segment generated $349 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance and $29 million higher than our initial outlook.\nThese results were largely driven by solid demand and pricing for HBU properties in our real estate business, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. They also reflect a significant year-over-year increase in contributions from our Natural Climate Solutions business.\nAs shown on Page 23, full year adjusted EBITDA for NCS was $84 million, a 79% increase compared to 2023, primarily driven by strong contributions from our conservation, mitigation banking and renewables business, where we continue to see solid demand. In Forest Carbon, we achieved notable milestones in 2024, including the approval and credit issuance from our second project located in the U.S. South and a new issuance of credits from our project in Maine.\nIn the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 50,000 credits in the voluntary market. We continue to see strong demand and premium pricing for our credits given our commitment to developing projects that meet high standards for quality and integrity. Looking forward, our Forest Carbon pipeline is developing rapidly, and we currently have 7 additional projects in progress.\nFor 2025, we expect a significant increase in credit generation and sales relative to the last couple of years. In renewables, demand continues to increase for large-scale solar development and we're well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as markets continue to expand. We've signed approximately 70 agreements for potential solar projects across our portfolio and our first solar site commenced operations in the fourth quarter, and we have 2 additional sites currently under construction.\nWith respect to wind, operations commenced on our seventh site in December and we expect an additional project to come online in the coming months. Turning briefly to our carbon capture and sequestration business. We continue to work closely with the developers on our 3 announced agreements and are in discussions with new counterparties for additional projects. While the time line for CCS and the permitting queue in particular has extended beyond our initial expectations, we remain confident that projects will ultimately be developed and continue to expect CCS to be a meaningful contributor to our NCS growth strategy over time.\nSo in summary, we continue to make excellent progress in our Natural Climate Solutions business, and we remain on track to reach $100 million of adjusted EBITDA by the end of this year. As we've said all along, early growth has largely been supported by our existing businesses. That said, we expect 2025 NCS results to include a meaningful increase in contributions from Forest Carbon credits. As we look beyond 2025, we see additional upside across the carbon and renewables businesses as those markets continue to develop.\nWe built a world-class team with deep technical expertise and strong commercial focus, and we continue to believe there is no company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser. Now moving to Wood Products on Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $106 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $161 million, a 77% increase compared to the third quarter, largely driven by an increase in lumber and OSB pricing.\nStarting with lumber. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $21 million, a $50 million improvement compared to the third quarter. Benchmark prices entered the fourth quarter on an upward trajectory, largely driven by supply constraints from recent curtailments and closures across the North American market, combined with a slight increase in demand as buyers replenish lean inventories.\nAs the quarter progressed, demand signals moderated given typical seasonal slowdowns in building activity over the winter months. As a result, benchmark pricing declined slightly through year-end and has remained relatively stable in January. For our lumber business, production volumes were moderately higher in the fourth quarter as we returned to a more normal operating posture following market-related production adjustments in the prior quarter.\nOur sales volumes were comparable to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 9% in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable and log costs were slightly lower. Turning to OSB. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $63 million, $24 million increase compared to the third quarter. Average benchmark pricing for OSB increased by 16% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by resilient demand from single-family construction activity and limited open market supply.\nOur average sales realizations increased by 5% compared to the prior quarter, with the relative difference largely due to the length of our order files, which results in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our sales volumes were moderately higher and unit manufacturing costs were moderately lower as production levels increased given less downtime for planned annual maintenance. Fiber costs were comparable to the prior quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products delivered $69 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of $8 million compared to the third quarter. Demand for EWP products was steady at the outset of the fourth quarter, given favorable weather conditions for homebuilding activity but softened seasonally as the quarter progressed. On balance, our sales volumes increased slightly compared to the third quarter, largely attributable to solid section products. Our average sales realizations decreased for most products as previously determined price adjustments took effect in certain markets.\nOur unit manufacturing costs improved compared to the third quarter and raw material costs were slightly lower for most products. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the third quarter, largely due to seasonally lower sales volumes, primarily in December. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and full year 2025 outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $218 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to $1 billion. We ended the year with just under $700 million of cash and gross debt of $5.1 billion.\nAdjusted funds available for distribution totaled $567 million in 2024. And as summarized on Page 19, we returned $735 million back to shareholders based on 2024 results and actions. This includes our quarterly base dividends, which we increased by 5.3% in 2024 and $153 million of share repurchase activity during the year. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $28 million, and we have now completed approximately $900 million under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization.\nEntering 2025, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. It's worth noting that although our cash generation in 2024 was lower than the last couple of years due to challenging market conditions, we continue to demonstrate the durability of our portfolio and the flexibility of our capital allocation framework across market cycles.\nIn addition to returning a meaningful amount of cash back to shareholders in 2024, we continued investing in our businesses and deployed capital towards strategic growth opportunities. These are notable achievements given the headwinds our industry faced in 2024 and a direct result of the actions we've taken over the last several years to make Weyerhaeuser a stronger and more valuable company. Looking forward, our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remains strong, and we are well positioned to drive further advancements across all of our capital allocation levers.\nFourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $15 million compared to the third quarter. This was primarily attributable to an increase in variable compensation expense and a charge in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO, partially offset by a slight benefit in liability classified share-based compensation.\nKey outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2025 are presented on Pages 25 and 26. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $20 million higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, largely driven by higher sales volumes and realizations in the West.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. As Devin mentioned, pricing for domestic grade logs increased substantially in December, and we've seen additional upward momentum in January. This is being driven by healthy demand for logs in the domestic markets as mills navigate seasonally lower log supply and the prospect of improving lumber takeaway ahead of the spring building season. Given this dynamic, we expect higher domestic sales volumes and realizations compared to the fourth quarter.\nAbsent weather-related disruptions, we expect our fee harvest volumes to be slightly higher in the first quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be slightly higher.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, inventories and shipments of imported European lumber have decreased, allowing our customers to take market share. We expect this dynamic to continue through the first quarter. As a result, demand for our logs is expected to improve, and we anticipate higher sales volumes and realizations compared to the fourth quarter.\nIn China, log demand is expected to moderate in the first quarter in response to reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given this dynamic, coupled with improving Western domestic market conditions, we expect to significantly decrease our sales volumes into China during the quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter.\nTurning to the South. Despite ample log inventories, Southern sawlog demand is expected to improve slightly as mills navigate the risk of log availability challenges resulting from wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter. In contrast, we expect fiber markets to remain fairly stable. On balance, we expect our average sales realizations to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are also expected to be comparable, and we anticipate slightly higher per unit log and haul costs.\nIn the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter, and we anticipate moderately higher sales realizations. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2025, we expect total company fee harvest volumes of approximately 35.5 million tons, which is slightly higher than 2024. From a regional perspective, we anticipate the South and North will be slightly higher than last year, and the West will be comparable.\nMoving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate steady demand for our real estate properties in 2025 and continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. In our Natural Climate Solutions business, we expect to reach $100 million of adjusted EBITDA by year-end. And as Devin mentioned, we anticipate a meaningful increase in contributions from forest carbon credit sales in 2025.\nFor the segment, we expect full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $350 million. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be between 35% and 45% for the year. First quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2024.\nTurning to our Wood Products segment. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. It's worth noting that adverse weather conditions in January resulted in temporary downtime at several of our wood products facilities. We have since resumed normal operations and expect to capture affected volumes as the quarter progresses.\nAs Devin mentioned, demand for wood products has softened into the winter months, which is typical for this time of year. That said, we expect market conditions and demand to improve from current levels as we head into the spring building season. Benchmark prices for lumber have been fairly stable since early December as supply and demand have approached a more balanced state. As for OSB, benchmark pricing entered the first quarter on a downward trajectory largely due to elevated channel inventories and seasonally softer demand.\nAs shown on Page 27, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the fourth quarter average. For OSB, our current realizations are comparable to the fourth quarter average, while quarter-to-date realizations are moderately higher. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and lower unit manufacturing costs.\nLog costs are expected to be slightly higher, primarily for Western and Southern logs. For our Oriented Strand Board business, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter. Fiber costs and unit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly higher.\nTurning to our Engineered Wood Products business. we expect improving demand heading into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate slightly higher sales volumes for most products in the first quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the prior quarter and raw material costs are expected to be slightly higher, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter as demand improves into the building season.\nI'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 26. In 2025, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $270 million. For taxes, we expect our first quarter and full year effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. Additionally, we anticipate moderately lower cash taxes relative to our overall tax expense.\nFor pension and post-employment plans, our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense is expected to be approximately $75 million. We do not anticipate any required cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2025 but expect approximately $20 million of required cash payments for all other plans. As for capital expenditures, we expect our typical CapEx program to be approximately $440 million in 2025, which includes $120 million for timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $310 million for Wood Products and $10 million for planned corporate IT system investments.\nThis excludes the investment required in 2025 for the construction of our new EWP facility in Arkansas. The total investment for this facility is expected to be approximately $500 million and will be incurred between 2025 and 2027. As we've previously communicated, capital expenditures associated with this project will be excluded for purposes of calculating the company's annual adjusted FAD as used in our flexible cash return framework.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Starting with housing. Despite elevated mortgage rates for most of the year, single-family construction activity remained resilient in 2024 with starts increasing by 7% over the prior year. This was supported by healthy, underlying demand for housing, a limited inventory of existing homes on the market and incentives used by the homebuilders to offset affordability challenges. .\nIn contrast, multifamily starts decreased by approximately 25% in 2024, largely driven by higher interest rates and the wave of new units that came to market over the last 18 months. As we enter 2025, mortgage rates remain elevated, we'll likely continue to see some volatility with rates as the markets weigh potential impacts from policy decisions from the new administration as well as future Fed decisions on rates.\nNotwithstanding the rate environment, we're expecting new home construction to improve somewhat compared to last year. For the single-family segment, there are a few underlying dynamics that support our view. First, from a buyer psychology perspective, mortgage rates in the 6% to 7% range are increasingly being viewed as the new normal, which is a different mindset from a few years ago.\nSingle-family starts reached 1 million units in 2024, a respectable level given the rate environment. We expect this positive trend for single family to continue into 2025, given solid underlying demand for housing with upside potential if mortgage rates move meaningfully lower. Second, while we do expect to see more sales activity in the existing home market, the lock-in effect will largely remain in place, which will continue to support steady demand for new home construction.\nAnd finally, we believe the larger, public builders will continue to navigate buyer affordability challenges and are well positioned to increase production to meet pent-up demand. With respect to multifamily construction, we expect headwinds to persist in the near term as the market digests the latest wave of supply. But we could see a modest increase in activity in the back half of the year, which would be a tailwind for total housing starts.\nSo in summary, we should see some improvement in the housing market for 2025, assuming the economy and consumer remain healthy. And our longer-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock.\nTurning to repair and remodel, activity was softer in 2024 compared to the last couple of years. This was largely driven by a significant reduction in the buying and selling of existing homes, which is normally a catalyst for R&R activity. In addition, inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates weighed on the consumer sentiment, particularly for lower end do-it-yourself projects. As for 2025, we're expecting repair and remodel activity to improve slightly compared to last year.\nThat's based on our view that we'll see an uptick in existing home sales, which should increase demand for repair and remodel projects over the course of 2025. In addition, I think we've now worked our way through the pull forward of projects that occurred during the pandemic so this should be less of a headwind for R&R going forward.\nLooking further out, many of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain firmly intact, including an aging housing stock. And I'd also note, there is a fairly significant amount of home equity that can be tapped for repair and remodel projects. As rates come down, this could be a meaningful tailwind for the segment.\nFinally, I'll provide an update on the progress we've made against the multiyear targets we announced at our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 21, we've made meaningful advancements on all fronts. Starting with our portfolio. Following our recent acquisitions in Alabama, we're now more than 3/4 of the way through our $1 billion Timberlands growth target. We've grown our Natural Climate Solutions business to $84 million of adjusted EBITDA.\nIn terms of our operating performance, we've captured $117 million of margin improvements over the last few years, a notable achievement given the inflationary and market-related headwinds we faced during this period. Additionally, through the third quarter of 2024, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products manufacturing business, and maintain the #1 position in EBITDA per acre in Western Timberlands.\nOn the ESG front, we remain committed to net 0 by 2040 and have showcased leadership in carbon integrity by publishing our carbon credit and greenhouse gas inventory principles. And finally, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning meaningful amounts of cash back to shareholders. by increasing our quarterly base dividend by more than 5% annually and returning more than $5.3 billion of cash back to shareholders from 2021 through 2024. I'm extremely proud of the progress we've made against our strategic targets. Looking forward, we're committed to further advancements across each of these areas and are well positioned to achieve our multiyear goals by year-end.\nSo in closing, while 2024 was an extremely challenging year in many of our key markets, particularly lumber, I'm pleased with how the organization navigated this environment and executed well across our businesses. I believe this is a testament to our people and our strategy. Entering 2025, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to capitalize as market conditions improve. We remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unmatched portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation.\nWith that, I think we can open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and DavI'd Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $173 million or $0.24 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 billion. Excluding a special item, we earned $154 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $410 million, a 16% increase over the first quarter.\nIn these are solid results, and I'd like to thank our teams for their continued focus and operational performances. Through their efforts, adjusted EBITDA improved across each of our business segments compared to the prior quarter, a notable achievement in light of numerous market-related challenges, particularly in the lumber market. Before getting into the businesses, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth opportunity within our Southern Timberlands portfolio.\nAs we announced yesterday, we are acquiring approximately 84,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in Alabama for $244 million. The collective acreage was sourced through multiple transactions, one of which closed in the second quarter for $48 million. The remaining transactions are under contract and expected to close later this year subject to customary closing conditions. These acquisitions represent an attractive opportunity to expand our footprint in one of the strongest inland sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S.\nThese are highly productive and mature timberlands strategically positioned to demonstrate immediate synergies with existing Weyerhaeuser operations. In addition, they're expected to generate portfolio leading cash flow and harvest tons per acre within our Southern Timberlands business. As highlighted on Page 18 of our earnings slides, we've demonstrated meaningful progress toward our multiyear Timberlands growth target. Including these transactions, we will have completed approximately $775 million against our target and are on track to reach $1 billion of strategic timberlands acquisitions by the end of 2025.\nTurning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $81 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, a slight improvement compared to the first quarter, largely driven by increased sales volumes out of the West. Starting with the Western domestic market, Log prices faced downward pressure in the second quarter as mills carried elevated log inventories and continue to navigate a softening lumber market.\nIn addition, log supply was ample given the seasonal improvement in weather conditions and recent mill curtailments reduced log takeaway in the region. As a result of these dynamics, our average domestic sales realizations decreased slightly compared to the first quarter. Given favorable operating conditions, our fee harvest volumes were moderately higher, and domestic sales volumes improved as demand for our logs remained stable despite softer end markets. Per unit log and haul costs increased and forestry and road costs were slightly higher.\nMoving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan were stable in the second quarter, and demand for our logs was steady. Suppliers of European lumber into Japan continue to face shipping and cost headwinds, which has provided our customers an opportunity to pick up market share. For the second quarter, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan increased slightly. Sales volumes increased significantly, partially due to the timing of vessels. In China, log consumption increased modestly following the Lunar New Year holiday and log inventories at the ports declined steadily in the second quarter.\nThat said, log takeaway waned as the quarter progressed. On balance, log demand was solid from our strategic customers in the region, and we significantly increased our sales volumes into China during the second quarter. Our average sales realizations were slightly lower compared to the first quarter. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was comparable to the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated in the second quarter, largely in response to elevated mill inventories, a seasonal increase in log supply and reduced consumption as mills adjusted to lower pricing and takeaway of lumber.\nIn contrast, Southern Fiber markets were generally stable as supply and demand returned to a more normalized state. On balance, takeaway for our logs remained steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher and per unit log in haul costs were comparable.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions. Turning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $59 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $102 million, an $8 million increase compared to the first quarter, partially driven by higher royalty income from construction materials within our Energy and Natural Resources business.\nIn our real estate business, we continue to benefit from solid demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. That said, our average price per acre declined sequentially due to the mix of acres sold in the quarter. I'll now make a few brief comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We continue to see strong demand for large-scale solar development and signed additional agreements in the second quarter.\nIn total, we now have over 70 agreements for potential solar projects, covering more than 130,000 acres across the U.S. South. Turning to Forest Carbon. We are advancing several projects through the development pipeline and expect to have 2 new projects in the U.S. South approved later this year. These projects, in combination with our main pilot project are expected to generate over 100,000 credits in 2024.\nLooking forward, we're encouraged by the growing support for the voluntary carbon markets and are uniquely positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for high-quality credits. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Excluding a special item, Wood Products contributed $171 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $225 million, a 22% improvement over the first quarter, largely driven by an increase in OSB pricing as well as higher sales volumes and lower costs in lumber and EWP.\nStarting with lumber. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was an $8 million loss with soft pricing as the primary headwind. Average benchmark pricing for lumber decreased by 5% compared to the first quarter. Despite solid single-family housing starts thus far in 2024, and other end markets for lumber, particularly the repair and remodel and multifamily housing segments have been more muted recently. As a result, lumber supply continued to outpace demand and buyer sentiment remained cautious in the second quarter.\nAlthough this dynamic is being felt across the North American lumber market, it's been more acute in Southern Yellow Pine given softness in treater and multifamily demand, which are proportionately larger markets in the South compared to other regions. For the lumber business, our average sales realizations decreased by 2% in the second quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately higher, partially due to increased production following winter weather disruptions in the first quarter.\nUnit manufacturing costs and log costs were both lower in the second quarter. Before moving to OSB, I'll make a few comments on our recent decision to indefinitely curtail operations at our sawmill in New Bern, North Carolina. These are always difficult decisions given the impact on employees, their families and the local community. So we did not take this decision lightly. New Bern is the smallest mill in our portfolio at 100 million board feet of capacity.\nUnlike other facilities across our mill set for a variety of reasons, we haven't invested meaningful capital in New Bern. So its cost structure was relatively challenged, making it very difficult in the current pricing environment. Given these variables, along with New Bern's limited integration with our fee timberlands, we didn't see a clear path to achieving sufficient financial results to keep the mill running. As a result, we've commenced an orderly wind down of operations and expect the mill to be fully curtailed in the third quarter.\nI do want to thank our New Bern team for their contributions to the company as well as the local community for their support over the years. We're working to minimize the impact of the curtailment by providing employment opportunities in other parts of our operations or transition services to affected employees. As for the remainder of our mill set, we are very focused on running efficiently and controlling costs. Given our deeply ingrained OpEx culture and relative position on the cost curve, we firmly believe that we're better positioned to operate through the commodity cycle than most of the industry.\nNevertheless, in light of current market conditions, we expect to reduce our lumber production by 5% to 10% in the third quarter. This will take place across our mill set and is inclusive of the new burn curtailment. And looking forward, we will continue to assess our performance, customer commitments and broader portfolio integration as we evaluate the need to further optimize our lumber operations.\nSo now turning to OSP. Adjusted EBITDA [indiscernible] million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher average sales realizations. Benchmark pricing for OSB began the quarter at elevated levels, but moved significantly lower as the quarter progressed largely in response to the softer-than-expected demand during the spring building season and elevated channel inventories.\nPricing stabilized by quarter end and has remained steady into July. Notwithstanding this volatility, average OSB composite pricing was 6% higher compared to the first quarter, while our average realizations were 13% higher. This relative difference was largely due to the length of our order files, which results in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our production and sales volumes and unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the first quarter and fiber costs improved slightly.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $6 million compared to the first quarter. Given solid single-family construction activity, VWP market experienced a slight seasonal improvement in demand at the outset of the second quarter before stabilizing into the summer months. As a result, our sales volumes were higher across all products in the second quarter, and sales realizations were comparable for most.\nUnit manufacturing costs improved sequentially and raw material costs moved lower for solid section products but higher for I-joist primarily related to OSB web stock. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million compared to the first quarter as lower commodity margins offset higher sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash with approximately $200 million earmarked for the remainder of the Timberland acquisitions we announced yesterday.\nOur balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong, and we are well positioned to navigate a range of market conditions. In the second quarter, we generated $432 million of cash from operations and capital expenditures were $91 million. We returned $146 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which was increased in the first quarter by 5.3% to $0.20 per share.\nIn addition, we returned $50 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the second quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.96, and as of quarter end, we had completed approximately $850 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we'll continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nSecond quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $6 million compared to the first quarter primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. The outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million to $30 million lower than the second quarter of 2024, largely driven by lower sales volumes and realizations in the West.\nFor context, results for our Timberlands business are generally at their lowest level in the third quarter, given seasonal dynamics. Turning to our Western Timberland operations. We expect domestic log demand and pricing to face downward pressure in the third quarter as mills continue to carry elevated log inventories and navigate a challenging lumber market. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter.\nOur fee harvest volumes will be slightly lower as we have made the seasonal transition into higher elevation operations, which generally have lower productivity. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher in the third quarter and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, we anticipate continued steady demand from our customers in the third quarter. As a result, our sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter.\nThat said, we anticipate a moderate decrease in our average sales realizations given ongoing consumption headwinds in the Japanese log market and the effects of a strengthening yen against the dollar. In China, log demand is expected to moderate in the third quarter in response to lower consumption levels and an increase of log inventories at the ports. As a result, our sales volumes to China are expected to be lower compared to the second quarter, and our average sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly.\nIn the South, we expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter as log supply remains ample, and mills further adjust to lower pricing and takeaway of lumber. In contrast, Southern fiber markets are expected to remain stable with slight upside as the quarter progresses. On balance, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, we expect our sales realizations will be comparable to the second quarter.\nGiven favorable weather conditions in the third quarter, we anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable and forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher. In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and our sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we have capitalized on steady demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to approximately $330 million, $10 million higher than prior guidance. We continue to expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 45% for the year. And we remain on track for a year-over-year increase in contributions from our Natural Climate Solutions business as we continue to advance toward our 2025 target.\nFor the third quarter, we expect earnings will be approximately $10 million lower and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $30 million lower than the second quarter due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be lower compared to the second quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB.\nBenchmark prices for lumber and OSB have been fairly stable in July after decreasing for most of the second quarter. For lumber, buyers remain reluctant to build inventories and supply continues to outpace demand. For OSB, supply and demand are currently more balanced, yet buyer sentiment has turned more cautious as we've transitioned beyond the spring building season.\nAs shown on Page 20, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately lower than the second quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are significantly lower than the second quarter average. For our lumber business, as Devin mentioned, we expect to reduce lumber production by 5% to 10% in the third quarter inclusive of the New Bern curtailment.\nAs a result, we anticipate lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs compared to the second quarter. Our log costs are expected to be slightly lower. For our OSB business, we expect lower production volumes and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs due to the planned annual maintenance outages that are typical in the third quarter. However, we anticipate our sales volumes to be comparable.\nOur fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the third quarter, primarily in Canada. In our Engineered wood products business, we continue to see steady demand for our products given solid single-family construction activity. As a result, we expect our sales volumes to be comparable to the second quarter. We anticipate moderately lower sales realizations, primarily for plywood and MDF products.\nRaw material costs are expected to be lower in the third quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter due to a decrease in commodity realizations. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Starting with housing. Despite a softer-than-expected spring building season, our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged from the last quarter. The single-family segment is holding up reasonably well, covering around 1 million units year-to-date, and notwithstanding elevated mortgage interest rates, single-family construction activity continues to be supported by healthy underlying demand for housing, a limited inventory of existing homes on the market and actions taken by the larger public homebuilders to offset affordability challenges.\nIn contrast, the multifamily segment has been more challenged given the significant amount of new supply entering the market this year on top of elevated supply in 2023 and the impact of higher rates on new projects. Moving into the second half of 2024, we're still expecting solid single-family building activity with potential upside if mortgage rates come down as the year progresses. And that's consistent with what we're hearing from our homebuilding customers. In contrast, we expect multifamily to remain soft through year-end and into 2025. Longer term, our view on housing fundamentals continues to be favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to the repair and remodel market. Activity has been softer year-to-date, particularly in the do-it-yourself segment. However, the Professional segment is still holding up relatively well. To a certain extent, persistent inflationary pressures are weighing on consumer sentiment and spending. We're also seeing some near-term headwinds from fewer people buying and selling homes in the current environment.\nBut as we think about the back half of 2024, we are expecting fairly steady repair and remodel activity, albeit at levels below the last several years and would expect demand to increase when interest rates move lower and consumer sentiment improves. And longer term, many of the key drivers supporting solid repair and remodel activity remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nSo in closing, our teams delivered solid operating performance in the second quarter, and we continue to make meaningful progress on multiyear growth targets to enhance our timberlands portfolio and advance our Natural Climate Solutions business. Although near-term market conditions have moderated, we maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that support growth in housing, repair and remodel and natural climate solutions. And with our unmatched portfolio of assets, our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we're well positioned to execute against our strategy and navigate a range of market conditions.\nWe remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and innovation and are committed to serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value for our shareholders. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions."

    "content": "Q1 2024 Weyerhaeuser Co Earnings Call\n\nQ1 2024 Weyerhaeuser Co Earnings Call\n\nWYNYSEAPR 26, 10:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGreetings, and welcome to the Weyerhaeuser First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $114 million or $0.16 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $352 million, a 10% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. These are solid results, and I'm pleased with the operational and financial performance delivered by our teams.\nTurning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $80 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $144 million, which was comparable to the fourth quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared to the prior quarter. Starting with the Western domestic market. Adverse weather conditions in January temporarily impacted log supply and demand across the region. As the quarter progressed, log supply in the system increased as weather conditions improved. Several recent mill curtailments primarily in Oregon also added to log availability in the region.\nDespite this dynamic, the market remained fairly balanced due to healthy log demand and improvements in lumber pricing. As a result, pricing for our logs was comparable to the fourth quarter. That said, our average domestic sales realizations decreased slightly, largely driven by a lower percentage of grade logs in our mix. For the quarter, our domestic sales volumes were significantly higher as we strategically shifted logs to domestic customers. Fee harvest volumes were moderately higher and per unit log and haul costs were significantly lower. As we made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower.\nMoving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan were stable in the first quarter. Despite ongoing consumption headwinds, demand for our logs remained steady as our customers benefited from lower volumes of competing European lumber imports. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately lower due to the timing of vessels. In China, log inventories at the ports grew in the first quarter as a result of reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday and increased log imports from New Zealand. However, log takeaway improved as the quarter progressed. Despite steady demand for our logs, our sales volumes into China were significantly lower in the first quarter as we intentionally flexed log sales to the domestic market. Our average sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands decreased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated somewhat in the first quarter largely in response to elevated mill inventories and ample log supply. In contrast, Southern fiber markets were stable in the first quarter as supply and demand trended to a more balanced state. Given these dynamics, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were also comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes decreased slightly in the first quarter. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million compared to the fourth quarter as sales realizations increased moderately. Fee harvest volumes were moderately lower in the first quarter, largely driven by the early onset of spring breakup conditions.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $60 million to first quarter earnings and $94 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $27 million higher than the fourth quarter primarily attributable to an increase in real estate acres sold. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remained elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to benefit from solid demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nNow for some comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. In February, we announced an exploratory agreement with Lapis Energy to pursue carbon capture and sequestration projects across 5 potential sites in the U.S. South. The agreement represents a unique opportunity to scale our CCS offerings. To date, we've entered into 3 CCS agreements covering up to 7 sites across our Southern timber holdings. And we remain focused on developing new projects and intend to enter into additional agreements over the next few years.\nTurning to forest carbon. On the heels of our first approved project in Maine, we're advancing 2 projects in the U.S. South that are expected to be completed later this year. Combined, these 3 projects are expected to generate over 100,000 credits in 2024 and we intend to sell these credits into the voluntary market. Looking forward, we have several additional projects in the development pipeline and continue to see strong demand for high-quality credits.\nLastly, I'll make a few comments on the progress we're making on our renewable energy business with a specific focus on solar. Given our unmatched portfolio in the U.S. South, we are uniquely positioned to drive meaningful value across our land base as demand for large-scale solar development increases. In total, we've signed over 60 agreements for potential solar projects covering more than 100,000 acres across 11 states. Notably, we recently signed sizable agreements in Georgia and Mississippi, and currently have several projects in late stages of development with one expected to be operational later this year. We've been very selective in choosing the counterparties to these agreements and have built an outstanding portfolio of projects with experienced and successful developers and utilities. Looking forward, we continue to see strong demand as this market continues to develop and we expect to sign additional agreements over the next several years.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $128 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $184 million, a 16% increase from the fourth quarter. Starting with lumber. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $5 million loss but improved by $29 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by a slight increase in sales realizations. Adverse weather conditions in January and cautious buyer sentiment weighed on the lumber market at the outset of the first quarter. As the quarter progressed, demand signals improved slightly, particularly for Western SPF and Douglas fir species. This drove modest pricing improvements through mid-March. In contrast, southern lumber markets faced persistent headwinds during the quarter, given weather-related challenges, a moderation in demand and ample supply of finished products.\nFor the quarter, our average sales realizations increased by 4% compared to the fourth quarter, largely in line with the framing lumber composite. Our sales volumes decreased slightly, partially driven by winter weather disruptions early in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs increased slightly and log costs were slightly lower. OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $14 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in product pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB was relatively stable through February, but increased significantly in March. This improvement was largely driven by lean inventories, supply limitations and resilient demand from new home construction activity. As a result, our average sales realizations increased by 4% compared to the fourth quarter, while the average OSB composite pricing increased by 13%.\nThis relative difference was largely due to our extended order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our production and sales volumes were slightly higher in the first quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved. Fiber costs were slightly higher. Adjusted EBITDA for engineered wood products decreased by $18 million compared to the fourth quarter. Primarily due to a decrease in average sales realizations as previously determined price adjustments took effect in certain markets. Our sales volumes for solid section products were comparable to the fourth quarter, while I-joist volumes were lower. Both unit manufacturing and raw material costs increased for most products in the first quarter. A couple of things worth noting for context regarding our engineered wood products in Q1.\nFirst, we did ship somewhat higher EWP volumes to customers in the fourth quarter of last year after having been on allocation for most of 2023. And consequently, customer inventories were slightly elevated entering the new year. Also, while single-family construction activity remained resilient, we experienced the typical seasonal pattern in EWP demand in the first quarter. That all being said, we expect healthy demand from the single-family segment as we get further into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate higher sales volumes and stable sales realizations from our EWP business in the second quarter. In distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter largely driven by an improvement in commodity realizations and margins.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with approximately $900 million of cash and total debt of just under $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. In the first quarter, we generated $124 million of cash from operations. It's worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $79 million, which is a typical level for the first quarter. We returned $146 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which we increased by 5.3% to $0.20 per share during the quarter.\nThis is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. During the quarter, we also returned $102 million to shareholders through the payment of our supplemental dividend, which was associated with our 2023 financial results. First quarter share repurchase activity totaled approximately $50 million. And as of quarter end, we have completed nearly $800 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. First quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $22 million compared to the fourth quarter partially attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 18.\nIn our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2024. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations, we expect steady to increasing log demand in the domestic market in the second quarter as mills respond to improving lumber takeaway as we get deeper into the spring building season. That said, log supply is expected to increase as weather conditions improve seasonally. On balance, this should translate to a fairly stable domestic log market. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to be comparable to the first quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions in the second quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are also expected to be higher.\nMoving to the export markets. In Japan, we anticipate stable log markets and steady demand from our customers in the second quarter. As a result, we expect our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan to be comparable to the first quarter. Our sales volumes are expected to increase, largely due to the timing of vessels. In China, we expect a modest increase in construction activity and log consumption following the Lunar New Year holiday. And given steady log demand from our strategic customers, we expect to significantly increase our sales volumes into China in the second quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the first quarter.\nMoving to the South. Log inventories were elevated at the outset of the second quarter, and log supply is expected to increase seasonally. As the quarter progresses, we expect sawlog demand to remain relatively stable and fiber demand to soften in response to increased annual maintenance outages. On balance, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, we expect our sales realizations will be comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be higher due to drier weather conditions that are typical in the second quarter and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the north, our sales realizations are expected to be moderately higher than the first quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower given spring breakup conditions.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, we are still seeing solid demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to and earnings will be approximately $10 million lower than the first quarter of 2024 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we maintain our adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately $320 million for the segment, which includes a year-over-year increase in contributions from Natural Climate Solutions as we continue to advance toward our 2025 target for that business. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2024, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB.\nThis is largely driven by improved sales volumes across our Wood Products businesses and favorable cost for lumber. I will note that we do expect demand for wood products to remain healthy, supported by improving housing and repair and remodel activity as we move further into the spring. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are slightly higher than the first quarter average. That said, the framing lumber composite has trended lower over the last several weeks. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are significantly higher than the first quarter average. As Devin mentioned, our extended order files result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. As a result, most of the OSB price improvement that we saw in March will be captured in our second quarter realizations.\nFor our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the second quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be slightly lower. For our OSB business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher than the first quarter with comparable unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the second quarter. In our Engineered Wood Products business, we anticipate higher sales volumes across all products. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. Raw material costs are expected to be higher primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher compared to the first quarter due to increased sales volumes and stronger commodity realizations.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets, starting with housing. On balance, our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged. Despite elevated mortgage interest rates, the single-family segment remains solid and continues to be supported by strong overall demand for housing, a limited inventory of existing homes on the market and actions taken by the large homebuilders to offset affordability challenges. In contrast, activity in the multifamily segment has moderated given the elevated interest rate environment and the recent and upcoming influx of multifamily units entering the market. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business than multifamily.\nFor the first quarter, housing starts averaged 1.4 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis with single-family starts holding up well. However, we do think homebuilding activity in the first quarter was impacted to some degree by various weather events across the U.S. So the spring building season has been a little slower to kick into high gear. As we move deeper into 2024, we're still expecting healthy demand for housing, particularly in the single-family segment. That's consistent with what we are hearing from our homebuilding customers. And longer term, our view on the housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbilled housing stock.\nTurning to repair and remodel. Activity has been a little softer to start off the year, particularly in the do-it-yourself segment. Moving forward, we expect R&R activity to pick up somewhat as weather conditions improve and continue to believe that demand will ultimately be supported by prospective homebuyers that elect to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in the current rate environment. And beyond 2024, most of the key drivers supporting solid repair and remodel demand remain intact including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. So in closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the first quarter. We also continue to make progress toward our multiyear targets by increasing our quarterly base dividend and signing our third CCS agreement.\nLooking forward, we're encouraged by the strong underlying fundamentals that will drive long-term growth for housing and repair and remodel demand and natural climate solutions. And given our unmatched portfolio of assets, we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on these opportunities well into the future. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and we remain focused on driving peer-leading performance across our businesses, serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value and returns for our shareholders. With that, I think we can open it up for questions."

Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nSo in closing, our performance in 2023 reflects solid execution across our businesses. As we enter 2024, we're encouraged by resiliency in the housing market and maintain a favorable long-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and we remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions.\nAnd finally, we continue to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by more than 5% annually and returning nearly $4.6 billion of cash to shareholders based on our results from 2021 through 2023. We're incredibly proud of these accomplishments, all of which have made Weyerhaeuser a stronger and more valuable company. Looking forward, we remain committed to driving continued improvements across each of these areas and are well positioned to achieve our strategic targets by year-end 2025.\nFinally, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we've made against the multiyear targets we announced during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 21, we've made notable advancements on all fronts. Starting with our portfolio, we've more than -- we're more than halfway to our $1 billion Timberlands growth target, and we've increased Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 114% since the inception of that business. In terms of our operating performance, we've made progress against all of our OpEx priorities and have captured $77 million of margin improvements over the last 2 years. Additionally, through the third quarter of 2023, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products businesses and are #1 in EBITDA per acre in Western Timberlands. On the ESG front, we're making progress on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and have committed to net zero emissions by 2040.\nTurning to repair and remodel. Activity in the fourth quarter remained steady, and barring significant weather disruptions, we expect a similar level of repair and remodel demand in the first quarter. As for 2024, we believe the underlying demand fundamentals are incrementally more positive compared to last year, supported by otherwise prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home and a higher mortgage rate environment, combined with a healthier economy. And based on recent trends, we think activity will be more heavily weighted toward the Pro segment versus DIY. Looking beyond 2024, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nGiven the tailwinds from last year, along with improving mortgage rates and a more favorable macro environment, our outlook for single-family housing demand in 2024 is more optimistic relative to this time last year. And that aligns with what we are hearing from our homebuilder customers. We are, however, somewhat less optimistic about the multifamily segment in the near term, largely driven by the recent and upcoming influx of multifamily units entering the market. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business than multifamily. All in all, we're more positive on the housing setup for 2024 and believe we should see an uptick in demand for our products. And our longer-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock.\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets and touch briefly on our multiyear targets. Starting with housing. Despite elevated mortgage interest rates for most of the year, the housing market remained resilient in 2023, particularly in the single-family segment. This was supported by a limited inventory of existing homes on the market, combined with the homebuilder's ability to offer mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives and underpinned by a strong overall demand for housing.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nTurning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2023 capital investments totaled $440 million plus $7 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital for 2024 will be comparable at approximately $440 million, which includes: $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs; $310 million for Wood Products; and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\nFor pension and post-employment plans, our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense was $45 million in 2023. For 2024, we expect this expense will be comparable to 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2023 was $20 million. In 2024, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan, and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $20 million.\nI'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 25. Our full year 2023 interest expense was $280 million. For full year 2024, we expect interest expense will be approximately $275 million. Turning to taxes, our full year 2023 effective tax rate was approximately 12%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 13% and 16% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid $63 million for full year 2023, which was lower than our tax expense, excluding special items due to the timing of U.S. and Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2024 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense.\nTurning to our Engineered Wood Products business. We expect improving demand heading into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes in the first quarter, primarily for solid section products. Our average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower for most products as previously determined price adjustments take effect in certain markets. Raw material costs are expected to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by an increase in commodity realizations and higher sales volumes.\nFor our oriented strand board business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter with slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. As shown on Page 26, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are slightly higher than the fourth quarter averages.\nTurning to our Wood Products segment. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB have increased from lower levels in the fourth quarter but have remained fairly stable over the last several weeks. As the quarter progresses, we expect improving market conditions and demand for both products heading into the spring building season. Excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings before special items to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating conditions improve. Log costs are expected to be slightly lower, primarily in Canada.\nMoving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate steady demand for our real estate properties in 2024 and continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. In our Natural Climate Solutions business, we anticipate a significant increase in EBITDA in 2024 as we continue to advance toward our $100 million target. For the segment, we expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $320 million. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $15 million higher primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.\nTurning to the South. Despite ample log inventories, Southern log markets are expected to be fairly stable in the first quarter as mills respond to a seasonal reduction in log supply and the prospect of increased demand for finished goods. As a result, we expect our average sales realizations to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter, and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter, and we anticipate moderately higher sales realizations due to mix. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2024, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35.5 million tons, with all regions delivering slightly higher volumes compared to 2023 levels.\nIn China, log demand is expected to moderate in the first quarter in response to reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given this dynamic, coupled with improving Western domestic market conditions, we expect to significantly decrease our sales volumes into China during the quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, we expect to deliver higher sales volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter. This is largely in response to measures taken by one of our customers to increase production following a fire at their sawmill in the third quarter of last year. With a more balanced Japanese log market and improving conditions in the Western domestic market, we anticipate slightly higher average sales realizations for our export logs into Japan in the first quarter.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations, we expect steady log demand in the domestic market in the first quarter as mills respond to seasonally lower log supply and the prospect of improving lumber takeaway ahead of the spring building season. Given this dynamic, we expect higher domestic sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter. That said, we anticipate a slight decrease in our overall and our average domestic sales realizations largely driven by a lower mix of grade logs. Absent weather-related disruptions, we expect our fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. And forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities.\nFourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $8 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2024 are presented on Pages 24 and 25. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $102 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. In December, we repaid our $860 million, 5.2% private note at maturity and also closed on a 5-year $250 million variable rate term loan. This completes a series of transactions over the course of the year, along with our $750 million bond issuance in May to refinance approximately $1 billion of debt. We ended the year with gross debt of $5.1 billion, consistent with our total as of the prior year-end, and we have no further debt maturities until 2025.\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. I'll begin with key financial items which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $288 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $1.4 billion. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $783 million to shareholders based on 2023 results, which includes $125 million of share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $15 million, and we have now completed approximately $750 million of activity under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Entering 2024, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased $15 million compared to the third quarter, largely driven by a decrease in commodity realizations and seasonally lower sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2024 outlook.\nEngineered Wood Products delivered $104 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of $21 million compared to the third quarter. Sales realizations for most products decreased slightly as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. I would note, however, that pricing remains quite healthy on a historical basis. Sales volumes were lower for most products compared to the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower demand and improving supply across the EWP market. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and raw material costs increased primarily for OSB web stock.\nAs we enter 2024, market conditions are starting to improve, and we expect stronger performance from our lumber business in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB was $73 million, a decrease of $45 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to lower product pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB began the quarter on a downward trajectory but stabilized by the end of October and increased through year-end. This improvement was largely driven by lean inventories, supply limitations and a resilient demand from new home construction activity. As a result, our OSB pricing exited the quarter at a higher level than where we entered. However, our fourth quarter average realizations decreased by 17% compared to the prior quarter. Our sales volumes and fiber costs were comparable to the third quarter, and unit manufacturing costs were moderately lower.\nThat said, buyer sentiment and product pricing started to improve toward the end of the year, following stronger-than-expected housing starts data and positive signals from the Fed on the trajectory of interest rates. Our fourth quarter performance was further impacted by a decrease in production levels, which resulted in lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs. This was largely driven by a combination of taking additional holiday downtime at our Pacific Northwest mills, a period of downtime at our mill in British Columbia and operating challenges at certain facilities. Market conditions were particularly challenging in the Northwest in the fourth quarter, given the more rapid decline in lumber pricing compared to log prices.\nSo now moving on to Wood Products on Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $105 million to earnings before special items in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $159 million, a 52% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by lower commodity pricing. Starting with lumber. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $34 million loss. Weaker product pricing was the primary driver as the framing lumber composite posted its lowest quarterly average in a number of years. Our average sales realizations decreased 14% compared to the third quarter. This was driven by cautious buyer sentiment and ample lumber supply in the North American market.\nAs we think about the future, we remain focused on growing our NCS business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025, and we see significant future upside as markets continue to develop, particularly in carbon and renewables. And with the work we've already completed and the prospects of advancing NCS across our expansive timberland holdings, we have a lot of conviction that there is no company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser.\nAs we look back over the last several years, I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made in our Natural Climate Solutions business and the leadership we've demonstrated along the way. We were the first company in our space to embark on this journey in a comprehensive manner and had delivered notable accomplishments across all of our NCS businesses. And in the process, we built a world-class team with deep technical expertise and a strong commercial focus. We've laid the foundation to develop and advance our NCS offerings in-house, allowing Weyerhaeuser to capture the vast majority of the economics associated with these opportunities. And we've quickly established a peer-leading position in emerging carbon markets.\nTurning to our carbon capture and sequestration business. We continue to see solid progress being made on the projects we've announced with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Exxon, and both are expected to be online in late 2025 or 2026. Moving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality CCS developers on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future.\nI'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on Page 23, our full year adjusted EBITDA was $47 million. This represents a 9% increase compared to 2022 and a 114% increase since the inception of this business in 2020. For 2023, we achieved solid contributions from conservation, mitigation banking and renewables, and demand for these businesses continues to grow. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our forest carbon business in 2023, including the approval of our pilot project in Maine and the monetization of the initial credits from this project. These credits were sold in the fourth quarter at a strong price and demonstrate our commitment to offering only the highest quality credits to the market. Looking forward, we expect the new issuance of credits from our Maine project later this year. Further, we're developing additional forest carbon projects within our U.S. timberlands. We anticipate receiving approval on 2 projects in the U.S. South in early '24 and intend to monetize additional credits in the voluntary market this year.\nTurning now to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate and ENR generated $320 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance. In the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $50 million to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, a $27 million decrease compared to the third quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased from the prior quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to see stable interest from buyers for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nTurning to the South. Southern sawlog and fiber markets softened slightly in the fourth quarter, largely in response to ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced demand for finished goods. Despite these market dynamics, demand for our logs remained steady, given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations and fee harvest volumes were comparable to the third quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were also comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower.\nIn China, log supply into the region has adjusted to lower consumption levels, and the market was largely balanced in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were comparable to the third quarter. Given steady demand from our Chinese customers, coupled with moderating market conditions in Western domestic market, we significantly increased our sales volumes into China in the fourth quarter.\nMoving to the Western export business. In Japan, despite ongoing consumption headwinds, inventories of European lumber imports have largely normalized, and the Japanese log market returned to a more balanced state in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the third quarter. Our Japanese sales volumes were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and continued to be impacted by reduced shipments to a customer that sustained fire damage at one of its sawmills in the third quarter of last year. That said, this customer has implemented plans to recover most of the lost production, and we continue to shift volume to other customers in Japan. As a result, we expect to increase our export volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter.\nOur domestic sales volumes were lower in the fourth quarter as we shifted volume to China to capture higher-margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs were moderately higher and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly lower compared to the third quarter.\nWith that, I'll now turn to fourth quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Excluding special items, Timberlands contributed $77 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $143 million and results across all Timberlands regions were comparable to the third quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market, log demand and pricing faced downward pressure at the outset of the fourth quarter as mills adjusted to a softening lumber market and worked through elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, lumber takeaway improved slightly and log supply decreased seasonally. Despite lower log prices during the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the third quarter, largely driven by an increased mix of grade logs.\nAs highlighted on Page 22, we're progressing nicely against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $530 million towards our goal, including announced acquisitions in Washington, the Carolinas and Mississippi.\nBefore moving on to business segment results, I'd like to comment briefly on the purchase and sale transactions that we completed in the fourth quarter, which included the acquisition of high-quality timberlands in the Carolinas and Mississippi and the divestiture of less strategic acreage in upstate South Carolina. These transactions represent a unique opportunity to further optimize our Southern Timberlands portfolio with high-quality, highly productive acreage that is well integrated with our existing operations. And these transactions were structured in a tax-efficient like-kind exchange, resulting in a net cash inflow of $7 million. The gain was recorded on the sale transaction and reported as a special item in the fourth quarter.\nAnd given the design of our framework, we retain 20% to 25% of our adjusted FAD annually, all of which can be utilized as we evaluate future capital allocation levers, including strategic growth opportunities. We continue to believe this framework is a powerful differentiator, one that enhances our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a variety of market conditions and also delivers an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders.\nAs summarized on Page 20, upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will have returned $4.6 billion in total cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchase since the first full year of our new cash framework in 2021. It's worth noting that although our adjusted FAD in 2023 was lower than the last couple of years due to challenging market conditions, we continue to demonstrate that our cash return framework is both sustainable and appropriate for the company's portfolio and the cash flow that we generate from our businesses across market cycles. Notably, we increased our base dividend by 5.6% in 2023 and returned additional cash through share repurchase in our supplemental dividend. The additional cash was fully funded within our framework and required no balance sheet or portfolio actions to cover our return commitment.\nAs highlighted on Page 19 of our earnings slides, we generated $986 million of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2023. We announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.14 per share. When combined with our quarterly base dividend of $0.76 per share, we're returning total dividends to shareholders of $0.90 per share. Including $125 million of shares repurchased during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $783 million of total cash to shareholders based on 2023 results or approximately 80% of 2023 adjusted FAD, which is at the high end of our annual target payout range.\nI'll start this morning by thanking our employees for their solid execution and performance in 2023. Through their collective efforts, we delivered industry-leading operating performance, continued to serve our customers and drove meaningful advancements across our multiyear targets. As we enter 2024, we're well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and remain focused on driving superior long-term value for our shareholders.\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $839 million or $1.15 per diluted share on net sales of $7.7 billion. Excluding special items, full year 2023 earnings totaled $749 million or $1.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $219 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding a net after-tax benefit of $98 million for special items, we earned $121 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $321 million.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\nThank you, Rob.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $239 million or $0.33 per diluted share on net sales of $2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $509 million, a 9% increase from the second quarter. These are solid results, and I'm proud of the performance delivered by our teams during the quarter. .\nTurning now to our third quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $78 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $143 million, a $29 million decrease compared to the second quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes in our Western and Southern operations and lower average sales realizations for Western export volumes.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $22 million compared to the second quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market, log supply was ample in the third quarter as the typical seasonal influx of logs from nontraditional timber owners came to market. Despite this dynamic, domestic log markets remain fairly balanced as mills maintained steady demand driven by higher pricing and takeaway of lumber early in the quarter and mills building log inventories to mitigate potential supply risks in the peak of wildfire season.\nOur average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the prior quarter. As expected, during the warmer and drier months, we transitioned to higher elevation and lower productivity harvest operations. Additionally, although wildfire activity was limited on our timberlands, dry conditions across the Pacific Northwest resulted in harvest restrictions in certain areas. As a result, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were moderately lower compared to the second quarter. Our forestry and road costs were seasonally higher and per unit log and haul costs were lower.\nMoving to our Western export business. In Japan, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continued to weigh on the Japanese log market. That said, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the second quarter, largely driven by stable log pricing in the Western domestic market. Our Japanese sales volumes decreased in the third quarter. This was partially due to reduced shipments to a customer that sustained fire damage at 1 of its sawmills during the quarter. While the mill is being rebuilt, our customer is in the process of adding shifts in production at different facilities and expects to recover most of the lost production from the damaged operations. It will likely take several quarters for this customer to ramp up the additional production. As a result, we're expecting lower shipments to Japan over the next several quarters. During this period, we expect to shift volume to other customers in Japan and the Western domestic market.\nIn China, despite steady decreases in log inventories at the ports and a reduction in log supply, the Chinese log market continued to be impacted by reduced consumption in the third quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China decreased moderately compared to the second quarter. While demand for our logs continues to be steady, our sales volumes were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to the domestic market to capture higher-margin opportunities.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands decreased by $6 million compared to the second quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated slightly in the third quarter and fiber markets continued to soften, largely in response to elevated mill inventories, a seasonal increase in log supply and reduced demand for finished goods, particularly for pulp and paper products. As a result, our average sales realizations decreased slightly compared to the second quarter. Despite these market dynamics, demand for our logs remained steady, given our delivered programs across the region. However, certain geographies did experience wetter-than-normal conditions at the outset of the quarter, resulting in moderately lower fee harvest volumes compared to the second quarter.\nPer unit log and haul costs were comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the second quarter due to significantly higher sales volumes resulting from a seasonal increase in harvest activity that is typical in the third quarter. Our sales realizations were moderately lower due to mix.\nTurning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $56 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $94 million, a $24 million increase compared to the second quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre decreased compared to the second quarter, but remains elevated compared to historical levels, as we continue to benefit from healthy demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nI'll now make a few comments on an exciting third quarter achievement in our Natural Climate Solutions business. I'm pleased to report that we received approval from ACR for our first forest carbon credits in Maine. The project covers approximately 50,000 acres has an initial issuance of nearly 32,000 credits and is expected to generate 475,000 credits over a 20-year crediting period. I want to thank our team for the exceptional work and diligence in completing this initial project and building the foundation to scale this business as the market continues to mature. Our goal is to develop and bring to market forest carbon projects that generate meaningful carbon additionality with measurable climate benefits.\nThis initial project is an important milestone for Weyerhaeuser and demonstrates our commitment to offering only the highest quality credits. Looking forward, we are developing several additional forest carbon projects within our U.S. timberlands, including 2 in the South slated for approval in the first half of 2024.\nAs we've demonstrated since launching our Natural Climate Solutions business, Weyerhaeuser is uniquely positioned to lead in this space given our expertise and unmatched Timberlands portfolio. We've established a target to grow this business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025, and we've made solid progress to date towards that target. And beyond 2025, we see significant upside from natural climate solutions as markets continue to develop, particularly in the carbon and renewables businesses. And from our perspective, there is no other company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $277 million of earnings in the third quarter and $328 million of adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter EBITDA was a 21% improvement from the second quarter, largely driven by an increase in OSB sales realizations.\nBefore diving into the business results, I would like to take a moment to highlight the operating performance improvements that we've made in our Wood Products segment over the past several years. To illustrate the point, for the first half of 2023, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products businesses. I'm incredibly proud of the work that our teams have done and for their unwavering commitment to our operational excellence initiatives, innovation and the successful delivery of our ongoing strategic capital investments. Through these efforts, we've positioned our Wood Products business to deliver industry-leading performance.\nAs we've demonstrated over the last several years, this has allowed our Wood Products business to generate significant cash flow for Weyerhaeuser. And despite a moderation in product pricing of late, this business remains well positioned to navigate through a range of market conditions and will continue to enhance our competitive advantage as a company, 1 that supports our commitment to returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders and enhancing the value of our portfolio over time.\nTurning now to lumber results. Adjusted EBITDA was $58 million in the third quarter, a 14% increase over the prior quarter. Benchmark pricing for lumber entered the third quarter on an upward trajectory, supported by improving demand, relatively lean inventories and the prospect of supply disruption is following an early start to the wildfire season in Canada. By late July, however, demand has softened as supply concerns dissipated and buyer sentiment turned more cautious due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.\nDespite lean inventories, orders were largely limited to necessity purchases throughout the quarter, and benchmark prices trended lower. For the quarter, our average sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter. Our sales volumes were slightly lower resulting from reduced production at several mills, partially driven by temporary operating disruptions. Log costs were moderately lower compared to the second quarter, and unit manufacturing costs were comparable.\nAdjusted EBITDA for OSB increased by $81 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the increase in commodity pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB increased sharply at the outset of the third quarter supported by resilient demand for new home construction activity, lean inventories and supply concerns resulting from annual maintenance outages that are typical in the fall. Pricing remained elevated until mid-September, and then decrease through quarter end as buyer sentiment turned cautious in response to weaker-than-expected housing starts in August as well as general concerns about the economy and the prospect of additional supply coming to market.\nFor the quarter, our average sales realizations increased by 39% compared to the second quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately lower in the quarter. [ Unit ] manufacturing costs were slightly higher due to planned downtime for annual maintenance. Fiber costs improved slightly during the quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA was $125 million, a decrease of $19 million compared to the second quarter. Strong demand for EWP products, which are primarily used in single-family home building applications, kept most of our EWP products on extended lead times for the entire third quarter. As a result, our sales volumes increased slightly compared to the second quarter, primarily for solid section products. Our average sales realizations for most products decreased slightly as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. It's worth noting that our current EWP prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher in the third quarter, and raw material costs increased primarily for OSB web stock.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA was $31 million in the quarter, a $3 million decrease compared to the second quarter, driven by lower EWP realizations in certain markets and lower sales volumes for some products. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and third quarter financial performance before moving into our fourth quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $523 million of cash from operations in the third quarter and ended the period with approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which includes amounts raised in our May debt issuance that prefunded the majority of our 2023 maturities. .\nIn July, we used a portion of the debt issuance proceeds to repay $118 million of notes at maturity. Total debt at quarter end was approximately $5.7 billion, including $860 million that matures in December. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $99 million, which is a typical level for the third quarter and we remain on track to invest approximately $440 million of capital for the full year. We returned $138 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend and remain committed to growing this by 5% annually through 2025. In addition, we returned $25 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the third quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $32.67 and as of quarter end, we had completed $733 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization.\nLooking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nAs highlighted on Page 18, adjusted funds available for distribution for the third quarter totaled $424 million, and we have generated $894 million of adjusted FAD year-to-date. Third quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $13 million compared to the second quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO.\nLooking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the third quarter of 2023.\nTurning to our Western Timberland operations, we expect log demand in the domestic market to soften in the fourth quarter as mills adjust to lower pricing and takeaway of lumber and work through elevated log inventories. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the third quarter, absent weather-related log supply disruptions. Our fee harvest volumes in forestry and road costs are expected to be comparable in the fourth quarter and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately higher.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, we are expecting fewer export shipments into the Japanese market over the next several quarters in response to the operational disruption experienced by 1 of our customers in the region. As a result, we expect fourth quarter sales volumes to be moderately lower compared to the third quarter. Our Japanese log sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher.\nIn China, log supply into the region has adjusted to lower consumption levels and the market is trending toward a more balanced state. As a result, we anticipate fairly stable pricing for our log shipments into China for the balance of the year. For the quarter, our average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter average. Given steady demand for our logs coupled with moderating conditions in the western domestic market, we expect to increase our sales volumes into China in the fourth quarter.\nIn the South, we expect stable log markets in the fourth quarter as mills maintain healthy log inventories ahead of weather conditions that are typical in the winter months. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and per unit log-in haul costs are also expected to be comparable, and we anticipate seasonally lower forestry and road costs in the fourth quarter.\nIn the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the third quarter. We anticipate slightly lower sales realizations due to mix.\nTurning to real estate, energy and natural resources; real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we've capitalized on steady demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are revising our guidance for full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to $310 million, an increase of $10 million from prior guidance. We continue to expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.\nFor our Wood Products segment, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be moderately lower compared to the third quarter of 2023 excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter on a downward trajectory, resulting from cautious buyer sentiment in response to a seasonal reduction in housing construction activity and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. However, benchmark prices for OSB have stabilized in the last couple of weeks.\nAs shown on Page 20, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are lower than the third quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect moderately higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter and slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be comparable to the third quarter.\nFor our oriented strand board business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher compared to the third quarter with slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to our Engineered Wood Products business, as Devin mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for EWP products given resilient single-family construction activity year-to-date. As a result, our order files are extended well into the fourth quarter, and product pricing is expected to be fairly stable through year-end. For the quarter, our average sales realizations are expected to be lower compared to the prior quarter average. Our sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower, primarily for solid section products resulting from an increase in planned downtime for annual maintenance in the fourth quarter. However, we anticipate an increase in sales volumes for I-joist products.\nRaw material costs are expected to be slightly higher compared to the third quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be lower compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in commodity realizations. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged, although we have seen some recent headwinds in the multifamily segment, in response to increasing interest rates. Importantly, however, the single-family segment has remained resilient year-to-date. In fact, despite the elevated mortgage rate environment, single-family starts increased 3% quarter-over-quarter and new home sales were up in September. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business relative to multifamily. .\nIn the near term, we continue to believe that the underlying housing demand is solid. Even at higher interest rates, we expect single-family demand to hold up reasonably well given the limited inventory of existing homes on the market combined with the homebuilders ability to offer mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives.\nThat said, buyer sentiment will continue to be influenced by affordability challenges brought about by increased mortgage rates and elevated home prices, as well as the state of the overall economy. As a result, we continue to anticipate a choppier housing market in the near term relative to the last couple of years. I will note, however, our long-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock.\nTurning to the repair and remodel market. Activity remains steady in the third quarter and has held up well year-to-date, although we're likely to see a seasonal reduction in repair and remodel activity over the winter months, we believe underlying demand fundamentals are solid, supported by prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment. And looking beyond 2023, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nIn closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the third quarter. We also achieved an important milestone in our Natural Climate Solutions growth program with the approval of our first forest carbon credits. And looking ahead, although near-term market conditions have moderated, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that support our businesses. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and we remain focused on maintaining our industry-leading operating performance serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value and returns for our shareholders. With that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements. As forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $230 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of $2 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $238 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $469 million in the second quarter. This is a 19% increase from the first quarter and was largely driven by an increase in wood products commodity pricing and strong EWP sales volumes.\nNotwithstanding elevated mortgage rates, we've been encouraged by resilient demand for new home this year, which provided a nice tailwind for our Wood Products business in the second quarter. We delivered solid results in the quarter, and I'd like to thank our teams for their collective efforts and focus on safety, operational excellence and continuing to serve our customers. Before moving into our business results, I'd like to comment briefly on a Timberlands transaction we completed earlier this month.\nAs we reported yesterday, we acquired 22,000 acres of high-quality Timberlands in Mississippi for approximately $60 million. This acquisition is comprised of highly productive timberlands strategically located to deliver immediate synergies with existing Weyerhaeuser timber and mill operations. With a mature age class and well stock timber inventory, we expect these timberlands to generate strong cash yields. Additionally, the acquisition offers incremental real estate and natural climate solution opportunities in the future. This transaction is a great example of our ongoing efforts to enhance our portfolio with high-quality, well-managed timberlands that generate solid returns for our shareholders.\nAs highlighted on Page 22 of our earnings slides, we continue to make great progress against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $360 million against this target, including the recent Mississippi transaction and the acquisitions in the Carolinas and Washington, which were completed in 2022.\nTurning now to our second quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $104 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a $16 million decrease compared to the first quarter. This was largely driven by lower average sales realizations for export logs in the West.\nTurning to the Western domestic market. Favorable weather conditions during the quarter supported increased log supply across the region. Log demand improved as mills returned to more normalized operating levels in response to strengthening lumber prices and later in the quarter, took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories ahead of wildfire season. These dynamics kept log prices fairly stable during the second quarter, and as a result, our average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly higher than the first quarter as a result of favorable operating conditions. Domestic sales volumes were significantly higher as we intentionally shifted logs to the domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs improved in the second quarter and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher.\nMoving to our Western export business. In Japan, log markets continued to soften in the second quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were lower compared to the first quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. As we look forward, we expect European lumber inventories in Japan to normalize in the coming months, which should increase demand for our Douglas Spur logs into the Japanese market later in the year.\nIn China, log markets softened in the second quarter in response to an influx of log supply from New Zealand combined with the reduction in log takeaway at the ports. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were lower compared to the first quarter. Our sales volumes were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to the domestic market.\nTurning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was $79 million, a slight reduction compared to the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets remained fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improved with drier conditions and Mills bolstered log inventories following weather-related challenges in the first quarter. In contrast, Southern fiber markets softened in response to elevated inventories of logs and finished goods at mills as well as lower overall demand for pulp and paper end market, in products. Given favorable operating conditions, our thinning activity increased in the second quarter, resulting in a higher mix of fiber locks.\nAs a result, our average sales realizations were slightly lower compared to the first quarter, and our fee harvest volumes were comparable. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower, primarily due to lower fuel prices and forestry and road costs were seasonably higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions.\nTurning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $52 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million, a $19 million decrease compared to the first quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased significantly in the second quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to benefit from healthy demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nI'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in May. In the second quarter, we completed the third-party audit process and submitted the project to the American Carbon Registry for final approval. Once approved, we expect an initial issuance of approximately 30,000 credits in year 1, and we're currently developing 2 additional projects in the U.S. South. We remain focused on positioning our credits to capture the highest value possible in the marketplace.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $218 million of earnings in the second quarter and $270 million of adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter EBITDA was an 82% improvement from the first quarter largely driven by an increase in lumber and OSB sales realizations and strong sales volumes for engineered wood products. Starting with lumber. Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million in the second quarter, a $43 million increase over the prior quarter and largely driven by improved sales realizations. Benchmark pricing for lumber held fairly stable in April and May as sentiment remained cautious. Buyers mostly limited orders to necessity purchases despite lean inventories. By mid-June, overall sentiment and benchmark pricing improved in response to stronger housing activity, perceived risks to supply from Canadian wildfires and announced mill curtailments also bolstered buying activity in June. For the quarter, the framing lumber composite was comparable to the first quarter while our average sales realizations increased by 6% with the relative outperformance driven by our regional mix and product mix.\nOur sales volumes were moderately higher compared to the first quarter as our Northwest mills returned to more normalized operating levels. Log costs were slightly lower, primarily for Western logs and unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB increased by $15 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the increase in commodity pricing, slightly offset by higher unit manufacturing costs related to planned and unplanned downtime. Benchmark pricing for OSB entered the second quarter on an upward trajectory, largely driven by lean inventories and steady demand from new home construction activity. As the quarter progressed, buyer sentiment and benchmark pricing continued to improve as Canadian wildfires disrupted supply and in response to improving residential construction activity. As a result, the OSB composite pricing increased by 21% compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 11%. This relative difference was largely due to our extended order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations.\nOur production and sales volumes were moderately lower in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher due to planned downtime for annual maintenance and a temporary period of unplanned downtime related to wildfire activity near one of our facilities in Alberta. Fiber costs improved slightly during the quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $62 million or 76% compared to the first quarter. This result is directly tied to improving demand for EWP products which are primarily used in single-family home building applications. As a result, our production and sales volumes were significantly higher for most products in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved significantly for solid section and I-joist products. That said, our average sales realizations were lower for most products as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. It's worth noting that our current EWP prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. Raw material costs decreased for all products in the second quarter.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $12 million compared to the first quarter, a 55% improvement as the business benefited from strong EWP sales volumes in the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16.\nWe generated $496 million of cash from operations in the second quarter and ended the period with approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt at quarter end was approximately $5.8 billion. In May, we took advantage of attractive capital market conditions and issued $750 million of debt due in 2026 and at a coupon of 4.75%. This debt issuance prefunded the majority of our 2023 maturities. And due to the shape of the yield curve, we were able to reinvest these cash proceeds in the interim at interest rates in excess of the bond coupon. As a result of this transaction, our full year 2023 interest expense will increase by $10 million to approximately $280 million. That said, this increase will be more than offset by the interest income earned on the invested issuance proceeds.\nIn mid-July, we used a portion of the debt issuance proceeds to repay our $118 million, 78% note at maturity, and we intend to use the remainder of issuance proceeds towards our December 2023 maturity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $81 million. We returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased in the first quarter by 5.6% to $0.19 per share. In addition, we returned $50 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the second quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.59 and as of quarter, our $1 billion authorization.\nLooking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. As highlighted on Page 18, adjusted funds available for distribution for the second quarter totaled $415 million, and we have generated $470 million of adjusted FAD year-to-date. Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19.\nIn our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than the second quarter of 2023.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand was steady at the outset of the third quarter in response to improved pricing and a way of lumber and as mills continue to build inventories ahead of wildfire season. That said, absent fire-related disruptions in the region, log supply is expected to remain ample as the quarter progresses, largely driven by a seasonal influx of logs from nontraditional timber owners. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. As is typical during the warmer and dryer months, we have transitioned in the higher elevation operations, which generally have lower productivity.\nAs a result, our fee harvest volumes will be moderately lower in the third quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher as we do a significant amount of this work during the summer months and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower, partly due to a decrease in fuel prices.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on the Japanese log market. That said, we anticipate our Japanese sales volumes will increase compared to the second quarter due to the timing of vessels, and we expect our sales realizations to be comparable. In China, elevated log imports from New Zealand and reduced log consumption continued to have an impact on the Chinese log market. We expect these conditions to persist through the third quarter. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be lower compared to the second quarter, and we anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we flex logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities.\nIn the South, we expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter and fiber markets to soften further. This is being driven by a seasonal increase in log supply, elevated mill inventories and softening demand, particularly for pulp and paper products. That said, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. Our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter and will include a higher mix of fiber logs as increased spinning activity continues. With a higher percentage of fiber logs, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter.\nPer unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable and forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher. In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and our sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Demand for our real estate properties remain steady, and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the third quarter, we expect earnings will be slightly higher and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment and now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year.\nFor our Wood Products segment, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the third quarter on an upward trajectory, supported by improving demand relatively lean inventories and the prospects of supply disruptions following an early start to wildfire season in Canada. As shown on Page 21, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are well above the second quarter averages. Assuming this pricing dynamic remains intact for the balance of the third quarter, we expect our Wood Products financial results to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter of 2023. That said, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we anticipate third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower than last quarter.\nFor our lumber business, we expect moderately higher production and sales volumes in the third quarter and slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. For our oriented strand board business, we expect production and sales volumes to be comparable to the second quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly higher and fiber costs are expected to be comparable.\nTurning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we continue to see improving demand for EWP products, and this has extended our order activity well into the third quarter. As a result, we expect our sales volumes to increase slightly compared to the second quarter. Notwithstanding this dynamic, we anticipate slightly lower sales realizations as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. That said, third quarter EWP prices are expected to remain substantially above pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to adjust in response to demand signals from the homebuilding segment, which has seen more strength of late, particularly for single-family construction.\nRaw material costs are expected to be higher compared to the second quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the second quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may now begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2023 Earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Weyerhaeuser Co.\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $151 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $395 million, a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. These are solid results, and I'm pleased with the operational and financial performance delivered by our team despite various market and weather-related challenges throughout the quarter. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $120 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $188 million, a 25% increase compared to the fourth quarter.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA increased $33 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by increased sales volumes in domestic and Chinese markets and lower per unit log and haul costs. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales realizations. Turning to the Western domestic market. Demand and pricing for domestic logs faced downward pressure at the start of the first quarter. Mills reduced consumption in response to lower pricing and takeaway of finished products, and we're carrying elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, log consumption increased as end market demand improved, but log supply was constrained by consistent winter weather conditions. This dynamic drove log inventories to lower levels and cause log pricing to stabilize. For the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were significantly lower than the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volume as well as per unit log and haul costs improved in the first quarter as we return to full run rate operations following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter.\nFirst quarter harvest activity included a portion of the deferred volume resulting from the work stoppage, and we remain on track to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume in 2023. Forest and road costs were also seasonally lower. Moving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan continued to soften in the first quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were moderately lower compared to the fourth quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. In China, log inventories at the ports declined during the quarter and daily takeaway increased as construction activity improved following the Lunar New Year and in response to the recent lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. As a result, log demand from our customers remained solid in the first quarter. Our sales volumes increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter and we intentionally flexed additional volumes to China to take advantage of improving market conditions in the first quarter.\nOur average sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter aided by improved ocean freight rates and a favorable exchange rate. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands increased $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. Despite reduced log consumption in response to lower finished product pricing and demand, southern sawlog and fiber markets remain fairly balanced during the first quarter as log supply was constrained by wet weather conditions. As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes increased slightly despite the adverse weather conditions. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower in the first quarter, and forestry and road costs were slightly higher. Adjusted EBITDA in the North was comparable to the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. And Real estate and ENR contributed $53 million to first quarter earnings and $89 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $43 million higher than the fourth quarter primarily due to a significant increase in real estate acres sold, partially offset by a decrease in royalty income from our Energy and Natural Resources business. Similar to prior years, our real estate activities in 2023 and are more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remained elevated compared to historical levels, as we continue to benefit from steady demand for HBU properties. Despite broader macroeconomic headwinds, buyers continue to seek the safety of hard assets, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $95 million of earnings in the first quarter and $148 million of adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 25% reduction from the fourth quarter, largely driven by continued softening in wood products pricing. Regarding the lumber and OSB markets, benchmark prices for both products entered the first quarter showing signs of stabilization after receding in the back half of 2022. Pricing for both products increased slightly through early February in response to stronger-than-expected demand for housing and buyers replenishing lean inventories. The increase was more pronounced for lumber as supply concerns weighed on the market following a series of mill curtailment announcements, particularly in British Columbia. As the quarter progressed, overall buyer sentiment remains cautious. As adverse weather impacted homebuilding in several regions and in response to ongoing concerns about inflation and the economy. Despite lean inventories, orders were limited to necessity purchases through quarter end, and benchmark prices for both products were generally range bound. I would note, however, that prices for both products have trended higher as we've moved into the second quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our lumber business was comparable to the fourth quarter. Both the framing lumber composite pricing and our average sales realizations decreased 9% in the first quarter. Our sales and production volumes increased significantly versus the fourth quarter which was impacted by the work stoppage at our Northwest mills. Reliability also improved across the system. With increased production in the quarter, unit manufacturing costs improved significantly. Log costs were comparable to the fourth quarter. OSB adjusted EBITDA decreased by $32 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 20% in the first quarter, largely in line with OSB composite pricing. Sales volumes were significantly higher as production volumes increased from less planned downtime for annual maintenance and transportation networks improved following adverse weather conditions late in the fourth quarter. Unit manufacturing costs and fiber costs improved moderately during the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Engineered Wood Products decreased by $28 million compared to the fourth quarter due to softening demand for EWP products. As a result, our sales and production volumes and average sales realizations were lower for most products in the first quarter. That said, we have seen a recent uptick in our order activity and our current realizations remain above pre-pandemic levels. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the fourth quarter and raw material costs decreased primarily for OSB web stock. Adjusted EBITDA for distribution was comparable to the fourth quarter as higher volumes and lower operating costs were offset by a decrease in realizations for EWP and commodity products. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of approximately $5 billion. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong. And we reinforced our flexibility in the first quarter by extending the maturity of our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to 2028. In the first quarter, we generated $126 million of cash from operations. It's worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million, which is a typical level for the first quarter.\nWe returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased by 5.6% to $0.19 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. During the quarter, we also returned $660 million to shareholders through the payment of our supplemental dividend, which was associated with our 2022 financial results. We returned $35 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the first quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $31.25 and as of quarter end, we have completed nearly $660 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nFirst quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $6 million compared to the fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination in LIFO and as well as the absence of nonrecurring health care and workers' compensation items that were benefits in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023. Beginning with our Western Timberlands operations, domestic log markets were fairly tensioned at the outset of the second quarter, driven by improved pricing and takeaway of finished products, leaner than normal log inventories and log supply constraints due to persistent winter weather conditions. As the quarter progresses, we expect further improvement in log demand and an increase in log supply as the weather improved seasonally. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to remain fairly stable throughout the second quarter. That said, we anticipate the quarterly average will be lower compared to the first quarter as log prices have fallen since the beginning of the year. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions in the second quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower, partly due to lower fuel prices.\nMoving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on log demand and pricing. We expect these conditions to persist through the second quarter. As a result, our Japanese sales volumes and realizations are expected to be lower compared to the first quarter. That said, we expect European lumber inventories to normalize as the year progresses, which should increase demand for our logs in the Japanese market. In the meantime, we are shifting a certain amount of logs to our internal mills to capitalize on domestic market conditions. In China, construction activity and log consumption continued to improve following the Lunar New Year and the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. That said, log imports from New Zealand have increased significantly following the disruption in the first quarter due to Cyclone activity. This dynamic is likely to put downward pressure on log pricing until excess inventories are cleared. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter. We anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we direct logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities. In the South, we expect sawlog markets to remain fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improves with drier weather conditions and mills bolster inventories in response to weather-related challenges in the first quarter. Southern fiber markets are expected to soften as a result of end market demand and pricing. Despite improving weather conditions, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter largely driven by a higher mix of fiber logs as thinning activity increases following wet weather conditions earlier in the year. With a higher percentage of fiber logs we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter.\nPer unit log and haul costs are expected to decrease slightly as a result of lower fuel prices, and forestry and road costs are expected to increase seasonally. In the north, our sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower than the first quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect earnings will be comparable to and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2023, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for both lumber and OSB have been fairly stable quarter-to-date, but we are seeing signs of increased demand for wood products as we get further into the spring building season, while channel inventories remain lean. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the first quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are slightly higher than the first quarter average. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the second quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating rates at our Northwest mills return to a more normalized level, reliability improves across the system and inflationary pressures continue to ease.\nLog costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the first quarter, primarily for Western and Southern logs. For our oriented strand board business, sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. We expect slightly lower production volumes and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs due to more planned downtime for annual maintenance in the second quarter. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly lower. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we have seen an uptick in order activity quarter-to-date, and we expect steady demand as the quarter progresses. As a result, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes for most products compared to the first quarter. That said, sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. We anticipate moderately lower raw material costs for most products, including for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter due to improved sales volumes. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVP of IR, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.\nPlease review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $1.9 billion or $2.53 per diluted share on net sales of $10.2 billion. Excluding special items, our full year 2022 earnings totaled $2.2 billion or $3.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.7 billion for the year.\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $11 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding an after-tax charge of $160 million for the special items, we earned $171 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $369 million. This is a 37% decrease from the third quarter and was largely driven by further softening in Wood Products markets as cautious sentiment continued to weigh on the near-term housing and macroeconomic outlook.\nI'll begin this morning by expressing my appreciation to our employees for their strong execution and performance in 2022. Notwithstanding a number of supply chain disruptions and dynamic market conditions over the course of the year, our teams operated safely, continue to serve our customers and drove meaningful improvements across our businesses. Through their efforts, we delivered our second highest annual adjusted EBITDA on record and are well positioned to navigate a more challenged market environment entering 2023.\nAdditionally, as highlighted on Page 20 of our earnings slides, we generated more than $2.3 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2022, again, demonstrating strong cash generation capability in combining our unmatched portfolio of assets with industry-leading operating performance.\nWe announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on February 27 to holders of record on February 15. When combined with our quarterly base dividend of $0.72 per share, we're returning total dividends to shareholders of $1.62 per share, including $550 million of shares repurchased during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $1.75 billion of total cash to shareholders based on 2022 results or 75% of 2022 adjusted FAD, which is in line with our annual targeted payout range of 75% to 80%.\nAs summarized on Page 21. We've now completed the second full year of our new cash return framework. Upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will returned more than $3.8 billion in total cash to shareholders based on 2021 and 2022 results through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchase. We continue to believe this framework will enhance our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a range of market conditions and deliver an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders.\nMoving forward into 2023, our cash return commitment will continue to be supported by our sustainable quarterly base dividend which we intend to grow by 5% annually through 2025, as outlined in our cash return framework on Page 19, we plan to supplement our base dividend with an additional return of cash as appropriate to achieve our targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. And as demonstrated in 2021 and 2022, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental cash dividend or opportunistic share repurchase.\nWith that, I'll now turn to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $86 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $150 million, an $18 million decrease compared to the third quarter. This was largely driven by lower sales realizations in the West. For the full year, Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by 13% compared to 2021. These were strong results, and I am extremely proud of the focus and resiliency demonstrated by our teams in 2022.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log markets softened at the outset of the fourth quarter, driven primarily by lower lumber pricing and ample log supply in the system. This drove domestic log pricing to lower levels early in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, log supply into the market became more constrained, resulting from a seasonal reduction in log availability. This dynamic resulted in a temporary period of log price stability into December.\nFor the quarter, our average domestic realizations were moderately lower than the third quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were higher as the business quickly returned to full run rate operations following the resolution of our work stoppage. We plan to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume from the work stoppage in 2023. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower compared to the third quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were comparable.\nTurning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs was strong in the fourth quarter as our key customers sought to replenish lean inventories resulting from our work stoppage. That said, our export sales volumes to Japan were slightly lower as work stoppage-related impacts to our export program were disproportionately higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations were significantly lower as broader log markets soften in Japan due primarily to an oversupply of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced housing activity. Log demand from our China customers was solid in the fourth quarter, and our export sales volumes increased significantly compared to the lower levels in the third quarter when we intentionally kept more volume in the domestic market to capture higher-margin opportunities.\nOur average sales realizations were significantly lower in the fourth quarter as broader Chinese log market softened due to lower consumption resulting from COVID disruptions and challenges in the Chinese real estate market.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter. Similar to the last several quarters, notwithstanding adequate log supply and softening finished product pricing, Southern sawlog and fiber markets remained fairly stable during the fourth quarter. Log demand was steady as mills continue to carry higher inventory levels to mitigate potential risks from supply chain and weather challenges.\nAs a result, our sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes were slightly higher as weather conditions remained generally favorable for most of the quarter. Forestry and road costs decreased slightly and per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the third quarter.\nOn the export side, our Southern program to China remains paused due to ongoing phytosanitary rules imposed by Chinese regulators. While it's unclear when this issue will be resolved, we continue to have a positive longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to China. And in the interim, we will continue to grow our export business into India and other Asian markets.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter due to significantly higher sales volumes as weather conditions were favorable. Our sales realizations decreased moderately.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate ENR generated $329 million of adjusted EBITDA. Slightly higher than our revised full year guidance and 11% higher than 2021. This was driven primarily by exceptionally strong demand for HBU properties in 2022, as well as robust energy and natural resources activity for much of the year.\nIn the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $24 million to earnings, excluding a $10 million noncash impairment charge resulting from the planned divestiture of legacy coal assets, the segment earned $34 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, a decrease of $14 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a reduction in real estate acres sold. Although HBU demand has moderated somewhat in response to broader macroeconomic concerns, we continue to see steady interest from buyers seeking the safety of hard assets in an inflationary environment.\nNotably, we delivered our highest average price per acre for all of 2022 on our land sales in the fourth quarter. These are high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nI'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on Page 13, full year adjusted EBITDA from this business was $43 million, a 13% increase compared to 2021. Growth during the year was primarily driven by conservation activity with ongoing contributions from our mitigation banking and renewable energy businesses. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our emerging carbon businesses in 2022, including the announcement of our first 2 Carbon Capture and Storage agreements, one of which was announced in the fourth quarter in partnership with Denbury.\nSimilar to our agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures announced earlier in 2022, the Denbury project will take several years to begin production, and we expect both projects will come online in 2025 or 2026.\nMoving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers of Carbon Capture and Storage on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future.\nTurning briefly to forest carbon offsets, we're nearing completion of our pilot project in Maine and expect third-party approval soon. This project serves as a proof of concept for Weyerhaeuser and positions us well to advance additional forest carbon projects in 2023.\nWith these exciting developments, we continue to see multiyear growth potential from our Natural Climate Solutions business and maintain our target of reaching $100 million per year of EBITDA by the end of 2025.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 14 through 16. Wood Products contributed $147 million to fourth quarter earnings and $197 million to adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 50% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by continued softening in Wood Products markets and lower product pricing. For the full year, our Wood Products business generated over $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA, and our engineering Wood Products business established a new annual EBITDA record. Additionally, our distribution business generated the highest annual EBITDA in over 15 years. These are outstanding results, and I'm proud of our team's ability to deliver this level of performance, notwithstanding numerous challenges in 2022.\nTurning to some commentary on the Lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark prices for Lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter, showing signs of stabilization after falling for much of the third quarter. As the quarter progressed, both markets exhibited cautious buyer sentiment resulting from a softening housing market in addition to broader concerns about the economy and inflation. Buyers maintained lean inventories and limited orders to necessity purchases through year-end. This drove benchmark prices lower for both lumber and OSB in the fourth quarter. As a result, -- the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 24% compared to the third quarter and the OSB composite pricing decreased by 20%. That said, benchmark pricing for both projects -- products stabilized in January as buyers reentered the market to replenish lean inventories.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our Lumber business decreased by $80 million compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 11% in the fourth quarter with relative outperformance compared to the benchmark, resulting primarily from our regional and product mix. Our sales and production volumes decreased significantly compared to the third quarter. These decreases resulted from a combination of the work stoppage-related impacts in the Northwest, adverse weather conditions in December and challenged reliability at several mills during the quarter. As a result, unit manufacturing costs increased significantly during the quarter. Log costs were modestly lower, primarily for Western logs.\nSpecific to our Northwest mills, which resumed operations in November following the work stoppage, much of the lumber we sold in the fourth quarter was manufactured using logs purchased in the third quarter when log prices were higher. As a result, margins compressed and are expected to remain lower until we work through the higher-cost log inventories and log prices in the Northwest adjust to reflect current lumber pricing levels.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $47 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter. Production volumes were comparable. However, sales volumes decreased slightly, resulting from weather-related disruption challenge -- weather-related transportation challenges in Canada late in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs decreased moderately and fiber costs were slightly lower in the quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA decreased by $56 million compared to the third quarter. This result is directly tied to recent softening in demand for EWP products which are primarily used in single-family home building applications. Although we often see demand for engineered wood products slow somewhat during the winter months, the broader slowdown in the housing market in Q4 caused more of a pullback than ordinarily would be the case. As a result of this dynamic, our sales volumes decreased for all products compared to the third quarter. Production volumes were also lower as we elected to take temporary holiday downtime at several EWP facilities during the quarter.\nOur sales realizations decreased for all products, except for I-joists, which were comparable to the third quarter. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable in the fourth quarter, and raw material costs were moderately lower primarily for OSB web stock.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $18 million compared to the third quarter largely driven by lower sales volumes, primarily for EWP products.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2023 outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2023 outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 18.\nWe generated $167 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $2.8 billion, our second highest full year operating cash flow on record. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $1.75 billion to shareholders based on 2022 results, which includes $550 million of share repurchases.\nFourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $146 million and we have approximately $375 million of remaining capacity under the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in the third quarter of 2021. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $662 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity, and we ended the year with approximately $5 billion of gross debt. Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 17.\nUnallocated adjusted EBITDA increased by $16 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO as well as benefits resulting from lower-than-expected health care expenses and increased discount rates on workers' compensation obligations.\nIn the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which was approximately $420 million of our Canadian pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. The contract purchase was funded from our Canadian pension plan assets with no company cash contribution required. As a result of the transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $205 million noncash pretax settlement charge. This transaction is the latest in a series we have executed to reduce our pension plan obligations. Since we began these efforts in 2018, our pension obligations have decreased from $6.8 billion to $2.3 billion as of year-end 2022.\nKey outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2023 are presented on Pages 23 and 24. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Beginning with our Western Timberland operations, domestic log markets entered the first quarter showing continued signs of softening as a result of lower pricing and takeaway of finished products, along with elevated log inventories at mills. Regional log supply has improved compared to the fourth quarter and is expected to remain ample for the majority of the first quarter, notwithstanding winter weather disruptions. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter.\nOur fee harvest and domestic sales volumes are expected to be significantly higher in the first quarter as we have returned to full run rate operations following the work stoppage, which affected one month of operations in the fourth quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities.\nMoving to the export markets. Demand for our logs remained steady as customers in Japan and China work to build finished product inventories in preparation for seasonally stronger construction activity in the second quarter. We expect to significantly increase our export sales volumes to both markets compared to the fourth quarter, which was affected by one month of reduced export activity resulting from our work stoppage, but we also expect to shift additional volume to China to take advantage of higher-margin opportunities. That said, our export sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter as broader log markets continue to soften, resulting from the headwinds Devin previously mentioned.\nIn the South, we expect log demand to remain fairly steady in the first quarter, although grade and fiber markets are showing signs of slight softening as we enter 2023, particularly fiber markets in the East. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower due to seasonally wet weather in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs and forestry and road costs are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter.\nIn the North, fee harvest volumes and sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter.\nTurning to our full year harvest plan. For 2023, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35 million tons. In the West, we anticipate our harvest volumes will be moderately higher than 2022 as we plan to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volumes resulting from our work stoppage. We expect our Southern harvest volumes to increase moderately compared to 2022 as we resume a more normalized level of activity following reduced harvest levels resulting from adverse weather conditions, primarily in the third quarter of 2022. We expect our Northern harvest volumes will be slightly higher year-over-year.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, HBU demand has moderated somewhat in response to broader macroeconomic concerns. That said, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nWe expect full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for this segment. Consistent with previous years, we anticipate our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year.\nFirst quarter earnings before special items are expected to be approximately $10 million higher than the fourth quarter, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $35 million higher, primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales.\nTurning to our Wood Products segment. As Devin mentioned, buyer sentiment remains cautious. That said, benchmark prices for Lumber and OSB have stabilized in January as buyers reentered the market to replenish lean inventories. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for Lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter.\nFor Lumber, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and significantly lower unit manufacturing costs as we resumed operations in our Northwest mills following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter. We also anticipate improved reliability across the system. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower primarily for Western logs.\nFor OSB, we expect sales and production volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter due to less planned downtime for annual maintenance and improved transportation networks following extreme winter weather in December. We expect fiber costs and unit manufacturing costs to be lower compared to the fourth quarter.\nAs shown on Page 25, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for Lumber and OSB are both moderately lower than the fourth quarter averages. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect significantly lower sales realizations in the first quarter resulting from softening demand for EWP products. Sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower for solid section products while I-joists sales volumes are expected to be moderately higher.\nWe anticipate significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock.\nFor our distribution business, we are expecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter due to lower margins for all products.\nI'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 24. Our full year 2022 interest expense was $270 million. This represents a $43 million reduction from the prior year, largely due to the strategic refinancing transaction we completed in the first quarter of 2022. For full year 2023, we expect interest expense will be unchanged at approximately $270 million.\nTurning to taxes. Our full year 2022 effective tax rate was approximately 20%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 12% and 14% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.\nFor cash taxes, we paid $566 million for full year 2022, which was slightly higher than our tax expense, excluding special items, due to the timing of Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2023 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense.\nFor pension and post-employment plans, the year-end 2022 funded status improved by approximately $100 million, primarily due to higher discount rates compared to year-end 2021. Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense was approximately $50 million in 2022. We expect to record a similar total at approximately $50 million of expense in 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2022 was $24 million. In 2023, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million.\nTurning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2022 capital spend totaled $462 million plus $6 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital spend for 2023 will be approximately $440 million, which includes $110 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $315 million for Wood Products and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments.\nI'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Davie. As we begin to wrap up this morning, I'll make a few brief comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets.\nResidential construction activity has clearly softened from the peak levels of 2022, particularly in the single-family segment. As we enter 2023, our sentiment remains cautious for new and existing homes is being driven by numerous ongoing headwinds. Most notable is the affordability challenge brought about by increased mortgage rates, combined with significant increases in home prices over the last 2 years. In addition, we believe buyer psychology is being influenced by uncertainty related to the trajectory of mortgage rates, general concerns about the economy and falling home prices in many markets. As a result, we anticipate a more challenged housing market compared to the last couple of years, particularly in the first half of 2023. That being said, there are some signs recently that the environment may be improving.\nMortgage rates have ticked down from recent highs. Homebuilder sentiment improved in January and mortgage application activity has picked up over the last several weeks. Additionally, the labor market remains fairly strong overall and household balance sheets are generally in good shape. There are still plenty of people who want to home and can still get a mortgage, but many buyers are likely to remain on the sidelines until we see some improvements, but at the very least some stabilization in certain macroeconomic and housing-related trends.\nI will note, however, that despite what may be a period of choppiness in the near term, our longer-term view on the housing fundamentals continue to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock.\nTurning to repair and remodel. Activity in the repair and remodel market remained fairly stable in the fourth quarter and continue to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment continued to soften from the elevated levels of the last couple of years and has returned to a more normalized pre-pandemic level. In the near term, we expect stable demand from the repair and remodel segment albeit perhaps at a slightly lower level than what we've seen over the last couple of years.\nLooking out beyond 2023, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact and support our more bullish long-term outlook, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock.\nNow before we move into questions, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we made in 2022 against the multiyear targets we set out during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 20 -- Slide 22, we're progressing well on all fronts. Last year, we deployed approximately $300 million on Timberland acquisitions, including our Carolinas transaction. We grew our Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 13% compared to 2021 and announced our first 2 carbon capture and storage deals and we remain on track to grow this business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025.\nLast year, our teams captured approximately $40 million of margin improvements across our businesses and also made meaningful progress against our other OpEx priorities. I'm extremely pleased with this result, considering the inflationary pressures we experienced in 2022. We made progress against our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. And finally, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by 5.9% and returning $1.75 billion to shareholders based on 2022 results.\nSo in closing, our performance in 2022 reflected solid execution across all of our businesses. Entering 2023, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong. We have a competitive cost structure, and we are well positioned to navigate through a range of market conditions. We'll remain focused on servicing our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation.\nSo with that, I think we can open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nVP of IR, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation, slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning is Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer, and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $310 million or $0.42 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $583 million in the third quarter. This is approximately 52% lower than the second quarter and was largely driven by further softening in lumber and OSB pricing as cautious sentiment weighed on the near-term housing and macroeconomic outlook.\nAdditionally, and to a lesser degree, third quarter results were also impacted by the work stoppage in our Washington and Oregon wood products and timberlands operations. The work stoppage commenced on September 13 and impacted our 4 lumber mills in the Northwest as well as a portion of our Western Timberlands operations. I'm pleased to report that as of last night, we've resolved the work stoppage, and we'll begin resuming operations next week.\nI want to acknowledge how important these jobs are to our employees, their families and our communities and how difficult this situation has been for all involved. We appreciate everyone who worked diligently over many months to come to an agreement that is fair and competitive for our employees, and importantly, that we believe is sustainable for our company throughout the business cycle.\nWith the work stoppage resolved, we're focused on welcoming our employees back, supporting our customers and returning to full operating capacity in the Northwest as quickly as possible. We currently expect to ramp up to full operating posture over 7 to 10 days after returning to work.\nWith that, I'll now turn to our third quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $107 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $168 million; a $3 million increase compared to the year ago quarter. And third quarter EBITDA decreased by $51 million compared to the second quarter. This was largely driven by lower sales volumes in the West, resulting from (inaudible) stoppage late in the quarter as well as lower average realizations in the West, partly due to less export volume being shipped in the quarter.\nTurning to the Western domestic market. Despite lower lumber pricing, log markets remained fairly stable in the third quarter as log demand was steady and log supply in certain areas was somewhat constrained by harvest and haul capacity. Although Weyerhaeuser did not experience these challenges, the impacts kept log markets tension for most of the quarter. As a result, our third quarter domestic sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter.\nNotwithstanding favorable weather conditions, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes decreased compared to the second quarter as a result of the work stoppage that commenced in mid-September.\nIt's worth noting that our Western log and haul activities are operated by a combination of Weyerhaeuser employees and outside contractors. As a result, a portion of our contract harvest and haul operations continued through the work stoppage. Our forestry and road costs were seasonally higher compared to the second quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were lower.\nTurning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs softened somewhat in the third quarter due to a number of factors, including an increase of European lumber imports into Japan. Japanese log sales volumes decreased significantly compared to the second quarter due to the timing of shipments, combined with the reduction in log export activity resulting from the work stoppage. Sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. In China, demand for our logs softened modestly in the third quarter due to the ongoing impacts from disruptions in the Chinese real estate market as well as pandemic-related lockdowns.\nDespite softer demand, log inventories at the Chinese ports declined steadily from the elevated levels reported earlier in the year, as log supply headwinds persisted. These include restrictions on Australian log imports, Russia's ban on log exports and a reduction in European wood flow into China. Average sales realizations for our China export logs decreased moderately compared to the second quarter, and sales volumes were significantly lower as we continue to intentionally shift volume to the domestic market to capture better margin opportunities. Our third quarter sales volumes to China were further impacted by a reduction in log export activity resulting from the work stoppage.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter and year ago quarter. Despite adequate log supply and softening finished product pricing, Southern sawlog and fiber markets remained stable for the majority of the third quarter as mills maintain steady demand to mitigate risks from ongoing supply chain challenges. As a result, our sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter.\nFee harvest volumes were also comparable as weather conditions were better than expected in certain geographies and affected our harvest activity for a portion of the third quarter.\nForestry and road costs were seasonally higher and per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the second quarter. On the export side, our log exports to China out of the U.S. South remain paused due to ongoing rules imposed by Chinese regulators to address potential phytosanitary concerns on imported pine logs. As a result, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills in the India market during the third quarter. We continue to view this as a temporary headwind and maintain a positive longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to China and other Asian markets.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the second quarter due to significantly higher sales volumes resulting from the seasonal increase in harvest activity that is typical in the third quarter. Our sales realizations were comparable.\nTurning to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 9 and 10. Real Estate and ENR contributed $48 million to third quarter earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the year ago quarter, but $47 million lower than the second quarter, primarily due to a reduction in real estate acres sold partially offset by an increase in royalty income from our Energy and Natural Resources business.\nSimilar to recent years, our 2022 real estate activity has been heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Although activity is moderating in response to broader macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to see steady demand for HBU properties as buyers continue to seek the safety of hard assets, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nRegarding our Natural Climate Solutions business, we continue to engage with high-quality developers for renewable energy and carbon capture and storage opportunities across our acreage. And we're encouraged by the recent passage of the inflation Reduction Act, which should drive incremental demand for these markets and further support our Natural Climate Solutions growth strategy. Additionally, we continue to advance our forest carbon pilot project in Maine and are well positioned for project approval over the next few months.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products contributed $344 million to third quarter earnings and $395 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $517 million lower than the second quarter, largely driven by the decrease in lumber and OSB pricing during the quarter.\nStarting with the lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the third quarter having stabilized from significant declines earlier in the year as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. Buyer sentiment improved slightly following a brief decline in mortgage rates and in response to solid June housing starts data. This dynamic continued through most of July, resulting in a steady increase in benchmark pricing for both products.\nBy early August, buyer sentiment once again turned cautious resulting from rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing affordability concerns and in response to unfavorable July housing starts data. Buyers remain cautious through the end of the quarter, largely limiting orders to necessity purchases. While OSB prices stabilized in September, lumber prices moved gradually lower throughout the end of the quarter.\nAlthough for context, it's important to note that lumber and OSB prices each remained at healthy levels on a historical basis. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased by $271 million compared to the second quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 28%, while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 30%.\nOur sales and production volumes decreased moderately compared to the second quarter largely driven by the impact of the work stoppage at our Washington and Oregon mills. Unit manufacturing costs were higher during the quarter and log costs decreased moderately.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $231 million compared to the second quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 41%, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 44%. Our sales and production volumes decreased slightly compared to the second quarter due to downtime for planned annual maintenance.\nThird quarter sales volumes were further impacted by ongoing rail challenges in Canada. Unit manufacturing costs were higher in the quarter and fiber costs were comparable. Engineering Wood Products adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7 million compared to the second quarter. Sales realizations were higher for most products in the third quarter, and we remained on allocation for most products throughout the quarter. Sales and production volumes were lower for most products due to downtime for planned annual maintenance. Sales volumes were further impacted by ongoing transportation challenges in Canada and labor constraints at certain facilities. Unit manufacturing costs were higher in the third quarter, and raw material costs were significantly lower primarily for OSB web stock.\nIn distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7 million compared to the second quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes for EWP and Specialty Products. Despite the quarter-over-quarter reduction, this was the strongest third quarter adjusted EBITDA result on record for our distribution business.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.\n\nDavid M. Wold\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will be covering key financial items and third quarter financial performance before moving into our fourth quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated approximately $560 million of cash from operations in the third quarter and nearly $2.7 billion year-to-date.\nWe ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of just over $5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $94 million, which is a typical level for the third quarter. We returned $133 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend and remain committed to growing this by 5% annually through 2025.\nWe also returned $145 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. And as of quarter end, we had $523 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically.\nAdjusted funds available for distribution for the third quarter totaled $468 million, as highlighted on Page 17, and we have generated approximately $2.4 billion of adjusted FAD year-to-date. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD.\nAs demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase. While our return of cash for fiscal year 2021 was achieved mostly through base and variable supplemental cash dividends, our share repurchase activity this year has been more active. As a result, we anticipate share repurchase will represent a larger portion of our 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD cash return this year.\nThat said, as a result of the strong cash generation throughout this year, we still expect a meaningful supplemental dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2023.\nKey outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 18. As Devin mentioned, we will soon be returning to normal operating levels in our Washington and Oregon lumber and Timberlands businesses. That said, our fourth quarter outlook includes work stoppage impacts through October, followed by a 7- to 10-day ramp-up period to return to full operating capacity. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the third quarter.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand softened at the outset of the fourth quarter, resulting from reduced takeaway of finished products and elevated log inventories at mills. Regional log supply has improved from the prior quarter and is expected to remain ample for the majority of the fourth quarter, notwithstanding adverse weather conditions or supply chain constraints. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be significantly lower compared to the third quarter.\nOur fee harvest and domestic sales volumes are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter largely driven by impacts of the work stoppage, and we now anticipate our full year harvest volumes in the West to be slightly lower than 2021. This reduction in volumes from prior guidance represents a harvest deferral that we expect to capture over several quarters after returning to normal operations.\nPer unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities.\nMoving to the export markets, we expect steady demand for our logs in the fourth quarter. As Devin mentioned, the work stoppage resulted in a temporary reduction in our log export activity. As a result, we expect lower export sales volumes compared to the third quarter. Additionally, we anticipate sales realizations for our export logs to be lower in the fourth quarter. In the South, we expect log demand to remain steady in the fourth quarter as mills continue to maintain elevated inventories to mitigate risks from ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges.\nAs a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher as weather conditions have improved from the prior quarter. Because of better-than-expected weather conditions in the third quarter, we now anticipate our full year harvest volumes in the South to be slightly higher than 2021 compared to our prior outlook of moderately higher volumes. We expect slightly higher forestry and road costs in the fourth quarter and comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, fee harvest volumes are expected to be moderately higher compared to the third quarter. We anticipate significantly lower sales realizations due to mix. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the third quarter due to timing and mix of real estate sales and lower royalty income in our Energy and natural resources business. We continue to anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $325 million, and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 35% to 40% for the full year.\nFor our Wood Products segment, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the third quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. Following the reduction in pricing during the third quarter, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter showing signs of stabilization.\nBuyers are maintaining inventories at or below target levels as sentiment remains cautious. In October, benchmark prices for lumber continued on a slight downward trajectory for the majority of the month before stabilizing and increasing slightly. Benchmark prices for OSB have remained fairly stable through October.\nAs shown on Page 20, for both lumber and OSB, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are moderately lower than the third quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect significantly lower log costs in the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the work stoppage in our Western mills in October, and we anticipate comparable unit manufacturing costs.\nFor our oriented strand board business, we expect slightly higher sales volumes and significantly lower unit manufacturing costs, primarily due to less downtime for planned annual maintenance during the fourth quarter. Fiber costs are expected to be comparable to the third quarter.\nFor our Engineered Wood Products business, we expect lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter. We also expect lower sales realizations for most products compared to the third quarter with solid section and I-joists pricing coming off record highs. This will be partially offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock.\nAs a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be lower in the fourth quarter, but still higher than any quarter in 2021. For our distribution business, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the third quarter due to lower sales volumes and realizations for most products.\nI'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Over the last several months, we've continued to see softening in new residential construction activity from the peak reported in April, particularly in the single-family segment.\nThere have been notable reductions in new and existing home sales and home builder sentiment has turned more negative. Consequently, we expect near-term housing outlook to remain less favorable compared to the last couple of years, largely driven by several ongoing headwinds, including a rapid increase in mortgage rates, housing affordability challenges, high inflation and growing concerns about the economy.\nThat all being said, homebuilder backlog should offer some additional support for building activity and wood products demand for the remainder of 2022 and into early 2023. And longer term, we continue to have a favorable view on housing fundamentals, given strong demographic trends, a significantly underbuilt housing stock, a healthy labor market and solid household balance sheets.\nTurning to repair and remodel. Despite softening in the housing market, repair and remodel activity remained fairly stable in the third quarter and continue to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment has continued to come off the recent pandemic peaks returning to a more normalized pre-pandemic demand level. Although lower home sales activity ordinarily would be a drag on repair and remodel spending, we may, in fact, see some incremental spend on repair and remodel projects as homeowners elect to invest in remodeling projects in their existing homes if they're priced out of purchasing a new home in this more challenged mortgage rate environment. This should provide near-term support for additional repair and remodel activity, especially from the professional segment.\nFurther, we remain optimistic on longer-term fundamentals supporting the repair and remodel segment, including an aging housing stock and favorable home equity levels. We expect these dynamics to support steady repair and demand for the balance of 2022 and into next year with activity levels comparable to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the third quarter despite increasing macroeconomic headwinds. And I'm incredibly proud of the continued focus and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. Their collective efforts have generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion and adjusted funds available for distribution of $2.4 billion.\nAlthough near-term market conditions have moderated, we maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that support our businesses. Looking forward, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong. We have a competitive cost structure, and we are very well positioned to navigate through a full range of market conditions. We remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for our shareholders through an unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation.\nNow before we move to questions, I would like to briefly provide some details to help quantify the work stoppage impacts to our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. I'm sure that would have been a question, so we'll just go ahead and cover that now.\nStarting with Timberlands, it is important to note that the decrease in volume during this period is merely deferred, not lost. We will capture this deferred volume over the next year or so. And in the meantime, that volume will continue to grow on the stump. Additionally, I'd point out that in any given period, we have a base level of spend for items such as forestry, silviculture and roads that we maintain to ensure that we capture long-term value. So we've continued to incur those costs during the course of the work stoppage, which means our margins will be significantly lower during this period, but margins will then increase above typical levels in the future period when we ultimately harvest that volume.\nTaking all of that into consideration, the work stoppage resulted in approximately 360,000 tons of deferred volumes in the third quarter compared to our original plan. This translated to an EBITDA impact of approximately $25 million. But again, most of that will be recovered in future periods when the deferred log volume is harvested next year.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Western Timberlands EBITDA will decrease by approximately $50 million from the third quarter, with approximately half of that decrease attributable to deferred volume from the work stoppage and the other half due to expected lower average sales realizations during the quarter due to general market conditions. We expect approximately 500,000 tons of deferred volumes in the fourth quarter resulting from the work stoppage.\nFor Wood Products, the work stoppage lowered production volumes by approximately 60 million board feet in the third quarter, and we expect around 170 million board feet of impact in the fourth quarter. Given the more rapid pace of price erosion in lumber versus logs in the West, which compresses margins until log prices adjust accordingly, the last lumber production in September and October hasn't had a material impact on EBITDA in the third or fourth quarters.\nSo with that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Taylor, you may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.\nPlease review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm very pleased to welcome David Wold to the call. David became our Chief Financial Officer in May. He previously served as our Chief Accounting Officer and brings 20 years of significant accounting, financial and strategic acumen to the CFO role. He's demonstrated outstanding leadership since joining Weyerhaeuser in 2013, and I'm excited to have Davie on our senior leadership team and to partner with him as we execute on our long-term strategy.\nThis morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $788 million or $1.06 per diluted share on net sales of $3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.2 billion in the second quarter. We delivered strong results across each of our businesses, and I'd like to thank our teams for their exceptional work and continued focus as we continue to navigate dynamic market conditions. Through their collective efforts, we've generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion, our strongest first half EBITDA results on record.\nTurning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $153 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $219 million, a decrease of $28 million from the prior quarter.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $21 million compared to the first quarter. Western domestic log market softened slightly in the second quarter as mill inventories recovered at the outset of the quarter and lumber prices declined considerably from elevated levels earlier in the year. As a result, our second quarter domestic log sales realizations were moderately lower compared to the first quarter but remained high relative to historical pricing levels. While log supply in the Western system was ample at the outset of the quarter, it became constrained by unseasonably wet weather as the quarter progressed, which drove mill inventories to below target levels by quarter end, particularly in Oregon. These adverse weather conditions resulted in a moderate reduction in our fee harvest volumes compared to the first quarter. Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher, and per unit log and haul costs increased significantly in the second quarter as we transition into higher elevation logging units.\nTurning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the second quarter. Lumber imports from Europe into Japan continue to be restricted by ongoing global shipping challenges for most of the quarter. This dynamic continued to drive increased market share for our customers and robust demand for our logs. As a result, our Japanese sales realizations were moderately higher compared to the first quarter. Our sales volumes increased significantly, resulting from strong demand and timing of ships.\nIn China, log inventories at the ports declined slightly in the second quarter, resulting from improved takeaway as pandemic-related lockdowns started to ease. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be limited by global logistical challenges and port congestion. Additionally, log supply into China continues to be impacted by restrictions on Australian logs, Russia's recent ban of log exports to China and disruptions of European wood flow resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a result, demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter, and our sales realizations for China export logs increased moderately. Our sales volumes to China, however, decreased significantly as we continue to intentionally shift volume to the domestic market to support our domestic customers and capitalize on favorable margin opportunities.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA decreased by $5 million compared to the first quarter. Notwithstanding weakening lumber and OSB pricing and a seasonal increase in log supply, Southern sawlog markets remained favorable during the second quarter as mills maintained elevated inventories to mitigate risks from ongoing transportation challenges. Fiber markets experienced a similar dynamic. As a result, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were moderately higher as seasonal weather patterns transitioned to drier conditions. Forestry and road costs were seasonably higher and per unit log and haul costs increased significantly, primarily for fuel-related costs.\nTurning to our Southern export business. Our log exports to China remain temporarily paused due to the new phytosanitary regulations on pine logs put in place last year by Chinese regulators. We remain optimistic that this headwind for pine exports to China will be transitory and still maintain a constructive, longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to that market. In the meantime, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills in the U.S. South and look to grow our India export market.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions, partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations for most products.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $65 million to second quarter earnings and $107 million to adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $9 million lower than the first quarter, primarily due to the timing and mix of properties sold, but was $16 million higher than the year ago quarter. Notwithstanding the recent macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to capitalize on favorable demand for HBU properties as buyers seek the safety of hard assets in an inflationary environment, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nNow for a brief comment on Natural Climate Solutions. Following our announced agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures in March for our first carbon capture and storage project in Louisiana, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers as this market continues to emerge. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in Maine and are working towards project approval by year-end.\nMoving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $863 million to second quarter earnings and $912 of adjusted EBITDA. Compared to the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $321 million as lumber and OSB prices declined considerably from elevated levels earlier in the year. These are outstanding results considering the ongoing supply chain headwinds faced by our teams in the second quarter.\nStarting with the lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the second quarter on a downward trajectory as demand for homebuilding and repair and remodel soften and buyers reined lean inventories given uncertainty in the markets. Despite lean inventories throughout the channel, sentiment was cautious as buyers assessed downside risk of elevated price levels and were reluctant to build inventories in a dynamic pricing environment. By late April, benchmark pricing for both products stabilized as buyers took steps to replenish inventories to prepare for the spring building season and in response to strong April housing starts data.\nThis dynamic continued through mid-May, at which point, buyer sentiment once again turned cautious resulting from rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing affordability concerns and the prospects of a possible recession. This drove benchmark prices downward through late June before stabilizing at the end of the quarter as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. Despite the substantial reduction in lumber and OSB prices during the quarter, benchmark prices for both products remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic historical averages.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased by $289 million compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 25% in the second quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 32%. Our sales volumes increased significantly due to seasonal inventory drawdowns and improved production. Log costs increased slightly, primarily for Canadian and Southern logs, and unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher during the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $60 million compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 14% in the second quarter, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 34%. This relative outperformance was largely a result of order files that lag rapidly declining OSB prices. Our sales volumes increased slightly, resulting from improved production. Unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher in the quarter and fiber costs were comparable.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million compared to the first quarter and established a new quarterly EBITDA record. Sales realizations were significantly higher for most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. Production volumes were significantly higher for most products as veneer supply improved. As a result, sales volumes increased for most products in the second quarter.\nIn distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $24 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to lower margins resulting from the commodity price correction. The distribution team did a terrific job in managing inventories in this dynamic pricing environment.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.\n\nGeorge Leon Staphos\n\nMD and Co-Sector Head in Equity Research, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today and an honor to be serving as the CFO during such an exciting time in our company's history. I look forward to capitalizing on the opportunities in front of us and working with our incredible teams to continue driving growth for our businesses and superior long-term value for our shareholders.\nThis morning, I will be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16.\nWe generated over $1.1 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and more than $2.1 billion year-to-date. This represents our highest first half operating cash flow on record, surpassing the previous record established just last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of just over $5 billion.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $81 million, which is a typical level for the second quarter. We returned $138 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $36.23. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $670 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically. We also returned $134 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which was increased in the first quarter by 5.9% to $0.18 per share.\nAdjusted funds available for distribution for the second quarter totaled $1.1 billion, as highlighted on Page 18, and we have generated over $1.9 billion of adjusted FAD year-to-date. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase.\nSecond quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $66 million compared to the first quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to an $18 million noncash benefit for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO in the second quarter compared to a $59 million noncash charge in the prior quarter. The benefit was driven by a decrease in log and lumber inventories from elevated levels at the end of the first quarter.\nKey outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings before special items, and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the second quarter but moderately higher than the third quarter of 2021.\nTurning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand was favorable at the outset of the third quarter, particularly in Oregon, as mills sought to bolster inventories prior to wildfire season. Log supply has improved following a period of unseasonably wet weather in the second quarter and is expected to remain elevated for the majority of the third quarter. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be moderately lower in the third quarter, absent fire-related disruptions in the region. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower as fuel prices have decreased. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the second quarter.\nMoving to the export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs is expected to soften in the third quarter due to a number of factors, including a recent increase of European lumber imports into Japan and a weakening Japanese housing market. As a result, our Japanese log sales realizations are expected to decrease moderately from the second quarter, and sales volumes are expected to decrease significantly.\nIn China, although log consumption has improved slightly as pandemic-related lockdowns have eased, log demand is expected to soften in the third quarter, resulting from elevated log inventories at the ports and a reduction in construction activity during the summer rainy season. As a result, our sales realizations on log imports into China are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. We anticipate our sales volumes will be lower as we continue to flex logs to our domestic customers to capture the highest margin.\nIn the South, log demand in the third quarter is expected to remain stable as the mills continue to mitigate risks from ongoing transportation challenges by maintaining elevated inventories. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the second quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher in the third quarter as weather conditions remain favorable. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher, and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs.\nIn the North, sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources. Consistent with prior years, we expect our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower than the third quarter of 2021 due to a decrease in acres sold year-over-year. As Devin mentioned, Real Estate markets have remained strong year-to-date, and we have capitalized on strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are revising our guidance for full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to $325 million, an increase of $25 million from prior guidance. Additionally, we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 30% to 40% for the year.\nFor our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the second quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. Following a substantial reduction in pricing during the second quarter, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the third quarter having stabilized as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. This dynamic continued throughout July, resulting in a steady increase in benchmark prices for both products.\nAs shown on Page 21, for both lumber and OSB, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are significantly lower than the second quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect comparable sales volumes in the third quarter and moderately lower log costs. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be comparable.\nFor our oriented strand board business, we expect slightly lower sales volumes and significantly higher unit manufacturing costs due to planned annual maintenance outages. Fiber costs are expected to be comparable.\nFor our Engineered Wood Products business, we expect significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. We anticipate this will be partially offset by lower sales realizations, primarily for plywood products. Sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products are expected to be comparable. Our sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs will be slightly higher as a result of planned annual maintenance outages in the third quarter.\nFor our distribution business, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the second quarter due to lower sales realizations for most products.\nI'll wrap up with a few additional comments on our total company financial items, all of which are summarized in our full year 2022 outlook update on Page 20.\nAs a result of the debt refinancing transactions executed in the first quarter, we now expect our full year interest expense to be $275 million, a $30 million decrease from prior guidance. Each year, in the second quarter, we finalize prior year-end estimates for pension assets and liabilities. As a result, we recorded a $67 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense.\nFinally, we now anticipate our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be $460 million due primarily to the acceleration of equipment orders with extended lead times for future planned capital projects. There is no change to our previously announced multiyear guidance of $420 million to $440 million of annual capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin, and I look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Second quarter housing starts averaged 1.65 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, a 4% reduction compared to the first quarter. While April housing starts reached the highest monthly level since 2006, activity softened as the quarter progressed. Housing permits in the second quarter averaged 1.73 million units, a 7% reduction compared to the quarter.\nAs we look out at the rest of the year, we do expect some softening in residential construction relative to earlier in the year, primarily as a result of the rapid increase in mortgage rates, ongoing housing affordability concerns, high inflation and concerns over a possible recession. We've already started seeing impacts from these headwinds with the reduction in new and existing home sales in recent months and through the most recent homebuilder sentiment data. However, as always, context is important.\nTo that end, I would note that we are still expecting housing starts and demand for wood products to be above pre-pandemic levels in 2022 despite these near-term challenges. Homebuilders have a significant backlog of houses to complete and we expect this backlog will support construction activity in the back half of 2022. And importantly, we remain constructive longer term on housing demand fundamentals given favorable demographic trends of significantly underbuilt housing stock, a healthy labor market and solid household balance sheets.\nTurning to repair and remodel where activity remained fairly stable quarter-over-quarter and continued to be supported by favorable demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment softened slightly in the second quarter as consumer sentiment turned cautious resulting from the recent macro uncertainties. That said, as the housing market enters a period of relative softening, this should result in more people remaining in their existing homes. And with healthy household balance sheets, favorable home equity and an aging housing stock, we continue to expect steady demand from the repair and remodel segment with activity above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn closing, our teams are delivering strong operational and financial results. Year-to-date, we've generated $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $1.9 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution. Looking forward, we remain constructive on long-term demand fundamentals that support our businesses, notwithstanding the recent macroeconomic headwinds. Our financial position is exceptionally strong and we remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading operating performance across our businesses. We are very well positioned to navigate these dynamic market conditions and to generate long-term value for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I think we can open it up for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin.\n\nAndy Taylor\n\nThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $771 million or $1.03 per diluted share on net sales of $3.1 billion. Excluding special items relating to our debt refinancing actions, we earned $978 million or $1.31 per diluted share.\nOur employees once again delivered phenomenal operational and financial results in the quarter, notwithstanding persistent supply chain, transportation and pandemic-related disruptions. Their collective efforts helped the company achieve its strongest first quarter adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.5 billion. This represents a 122% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021.\nTurning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $182 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $71 million compared to the fourth quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by 77% compared to the fourth quarter. Western domestic log markets were favorable through the first quarter, driven by strong demand as mills sought to capitalize on unseasonably high lumber prices. As a result, our domestic sales realizations were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter.\nOverall log supply in the Western system was plentiful during the quarter due to favorable weather conditions as well as increased volumes from other landowners in response to strong log pricing. This drove log inventories at the mills to above target levels by the end of the quarter, particularly in Oregon. Our fee harvest volumes were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter and per unit log and haul costs were lower as we made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations.\nForestry and road costs were seasonally lower in the quarter. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the first quarter. High North American lumber prices combined with global logistics challenges, particularly with respect to port congestion and shipping container shortages continued to limit the availability of imported lumber into Japan. These dynamics are driving strong demand for our customers locally produced lumber in Japan and increased demand for our imported logs.\nAs a result, our Japanese log sales realizations in the first quarter increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter. Sales volumes were slightly lower due to the timing of vessels. The Russia-Ukraine conflict did not have a material impact on our log export business into Japan during the first quarter. However, we do ultimately expect a reduction in Russian and European wood supply into Japan as a result of the conflict, which will likely bolster demand for our log exports into the Japanese market over time.\nIn China, log inventories at the ports have remained elevated coming out of the Lunar New Year, and we're seeing lower takeaway as a result of ongoing pandemic-related disruptions in the country. Notwithstanding these headwinds, end-market demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter due largely to supply disruptions into China. Imports of lumber and logs into China continued to be impacted by global logistical challenges, port congestion and restrictions on imported Australian logs.\nImports were further constrained in the first quarter as Russia commenced its previously announced ban on log exports. And later in the quarter, European log supply was also disrupted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a result, our sales realizations for China export logs increased slightly in the quarter. Our sales volumes to China, however, decreased significantly as we intentionally shifted volume to the domestic market to support our domestic customers and capitalize on strong Western log prices.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding ample log supply and improving log inventories as the quarter progressed, Southern sawlog markets remained favorable in the first quarter as mills sought to benefit from the strong lumber and panel pricing environment. Fiber markets were also favorable as mills bolstered inventories from the lean levels experienced at the outset of the quarter.\nAs a result, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes in forestry and road costs were seasonally lower in the first quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were moderately higher, primarily for fuel-related transportation costs. Regarding our Southern export business, our log exports to China remain temporarily paused as a result of recently adopted and fairly restrictive rules implemented by Chinese regulators to address potential phytosanitary concerns on imported pine logs.\nIn response, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills and the India export market during the first quarter. We continue to maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to China and other Asian markets. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million compared to the fourth quarter due to improved sales realizations across all products. Fee harvest volumes were seasonally lower in the first quarter.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $81 million to first quarter earnings and $116 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $67 million higher than the fourth quarter due to the timing of real estate transactions.\nSimilar to the last few years, our real estate activities in 2022 are more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to benefit from strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value.\nNow for a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. In March, we announced an agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures to pursue our first carbon capture and storage project. This partnership combines more than 30,000 acres of Weyerhaeuser's uniquely positioned subsurface ownership in Louisiana with Oxy's proven technical expertise in the management and sequestration of carbon dioxide. It will take several years to bring this project into production, and we expect that will come online in 2025 or 2026.\nThis project represents an important milestone in our previously announced plan to grow our Natural Climate Solutions business. We expect to announce additional carbon capture and storage agreements as we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage.\nMoving now to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $1.2 billion to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $716 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 138% improvement. This represents the second highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record for our Wood Products business. These are exceptional results considering the ongoing transportation and supply chain headwinds faced by our teams in the first quarter.\nI want to specifically recognize our supply chain and logistics teams for their continued focus and resolve while navigating these challenges. Starting with lumber and OSB markets, benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the quarter on an upward trajectory as demand for homebuilding and repair and remodel remained favorable and supply constraints persisted due to supply, transportation and labor-related challenges in addition to winter weather disruptions.\nThis dynamic continued for most of the quarter, driving lumber and OSB prices once again to near record high levels. Demand softened somewhat late in the quarter as many buyers paused to assess downside risk with elevated price levels and to evaluate the potential impacts of rising mortgage rates on the housing market. Lower-than-expected take away from home centers also impacted demand to some extent in the quarter.\nDespite generally lean inventories heading into the spring building season, buyers remained cautious through the end of the quarter, with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory in a dynamic pricing environment. As a result, lumber and OSB prices peaked and started on a downward trajectory in March. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business increased by $453 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 232% improvement.\nOur average sales realizations increased by 76% in the first quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing increased by 81%. Production volumes increased moderately, resulting from less planned downtime and weather-related downtime. Sales volumes were slightly lower, driven by ongoing transportation challenges. This dynamic resulted in an expansion of inventory levels during the quarter.\nLog costs were significantly higher, primarily for Western logs. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business increased by $216 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 123% improvement. Our average sales realizations increased by 61% in the first quarter while the OSB composite pricing increased by 94%. This relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lag surging OSB prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions primarily in Canada. Our production volumes improved slightly in the first quarter, resulting from less downtime for planned maintenance.\nAs a result, sales volumes increased moderately compared to the fourth quarter notwithstanding significant transportation headwinds in Canada in January and February. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher in the quarter and fiber costs were significantly higher. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $22 million compared to the fourth quarter, surpassing last quarter's record by 19%.\nSales realizations improved in the first quarter and we benefited from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-Joist products. This was partially offset by moderately higher raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock and resin.\nProduction volumes were moderately lower for solid section and I-Joist products driven in large part by tight veneer supply and pandemic-related staffing challenges early in the quarter. As a result, sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $32 million compared to the fourth quarter, an 80% improvement as the business experienced strong demand and captured improved margins across all products.\nBefore turning the call over to Nancy, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth opportunity within our Southern Timberlands business. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire approximately 81,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in North and South Carolina for approximately $265 million. This is a unique opportunity to enhance our portfolio with highly productive and well-managed timberlands, which are located in some of the best coastal markets in the U.S. South and strategically positioned to deliver operational synergies with our existing timber and mill footprint.\nThis acquisition offers extremely attractive timberland attributes and is expected to deliver portfolio leading cash flow and harvest tons per acre within our Southern Timberlands business. Additionally, we expect to capture incremental benefits from real estate and natural climate solutions opportunities over time. The transaction is expected to close later in the quarter and represents an exciting milestone in our multiyear strategy to grow the value of our Timberland portfolio through disciplined investments.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.\n\nNancy S. Loewe\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $957 million of cash from operations in the first quarter. This is an increase of over $460 million from the fourth quarter and is our highest first quarter operating cash flow on record. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $5.1 billion.\nAt the end of February, we initiated a series of transactions to further enhance our strong financial position by effectively refinancing $900 million of debt. This included the issuance of $450 million of notes due in 2033, with [3.375%]coupon and $450 million of notes due in 2052 with a 4% coupon.\nThe net proceeds plus cash on hand were then used to close cash tender offers for $931 million of principal on notes with considerably higher rates. We incurred a net after-tax charge of $207 million related to premiums and unamortized debt issuance cost and debt discount in connection with the early debt repayments, which is included in our first quarter as a -- results as a special item. These actions enabled us to capitalize on favorable interest rates prior to the most recent increase by the Fed, resulting in a meaningful reduction in the weighted average coupon in our debt portfolio while also smoothing and extending the weighted average maturity.\nOverall, our annualized interest savings will be approximately $38 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, which is typical in the first quarter. We returned $121 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $37.87. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $800 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program.\nWe will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. We also returned $134 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased by 5.9% to $0.18 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025.\nAdjusted FAD for the first quarter totaled $850 million, as highlighted on Page 18. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase.\nFirst quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $31 million compared to the fourth quarter. This decline was primarily attributable to a $59 million noncash charge for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO in the first quarter due to the elevated levels of high-value inventory.\nAs seasonal inventory levels are reduced in the second quarter, we do expect to record a noncash benefit for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the first quarter but still higher than any other quarter since the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTurning to the Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand softened somewhat at the outset of the second quarter in response to ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced takeaway of finished products as lumber prices retreated from historically high levels. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to be lower in the second quarter, but still substantially higher than any quarter in 2021.\nForestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are also expected to increase. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the first quarter. Moving to the export markets, in Japan, demand for our logs remained strong as imported lumber continues to be restricted by global shipping challenges and more recently, in response to wood flow disruptions, resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As a result, our Japanese sales volumes are expected to increase significantly compared to the first quarter.\nWe anticipate our second quarter sales realizations to be comparable to the strong levels experienced in the first quarter. In China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs remains favorable as imports of lumber and logs from other countries continue to be constrained. As a result, our sales realizations on log imports into China are expected to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter.\nWe anticipate our sales volumes to be significantly lower as we continue to flex logs to our domestic customers to capture the highest margin. In the South, despite the pullback in lumber and OSB pricing at the outset of the quarter and a seasonal increase of log supply, log demand remains stable as mills maintain elevated inventories to mitigate risk from ongoing transportation challenges. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the first quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher as seasonal weather patterns transition to drier conditions.\nSimilar to the West, forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and we anticipate moderately higher per unit log and haul costs. In the North, due to product mix, sales realizations are expected to be significantly higher than the first quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Real estate markets remained strong heading into the second quarter and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect net earnings will be comparable to an adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the second quarter of 2021. We expect an increase in acres sold and a higher basis year-over-year due to the mix of properties we anticipate to sell. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the first quarter, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB.\nDemand for our products remain favorable heading into the spring building season, supported by strong new residential construction and professional repair and remodel activity. As Devin mentioned, supply continues to be constrained by transportation challenges and inventories through the channel remain lean. Despite these dynamics, benchmark pricing for lumber and oriented strand board entered the second quarter on a rapid downward trajectory as buyers continue to assess downside risk of elevated price levels and we're reluctant to build inventories in this dynamic pricing environment.\nBy late April, benchmark pricing for both products stabilized as buyers took steps to replenish inventories to prepare for the spring building season. As shown on Page 20, for lumber, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are significantly lower than the first quarter average. For OSB, our current realizations are comparable and quarter-to-date realizations remain higher than the first quarter average due to the length of our order files.\nFor our lumber business, we expect improved production volumes and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs in the second quarter. Sales volumes are expected to improve significantly with increased production as well as higher seasonal inventory drawdown. We anticipate moderately lower log costs compared to the first quarter, primarily for Western logs. For our OSB business, we expect moderately higher sales volumes compared to the first quarter, resulting from higher production volumes and improving transportation networks, primarily in Canada.\nUnit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly lower and fiber costs are expected to be comparable. For our engineered wood products business, as we continue to capture the benefit of price increases announced in February, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-Joist products. We anticipate this will be completely offset by significantly lower sales realization for our plywood products. Our sales and production volumes are expected to be significantly higher in the second quarter as veneer supply continues to improve. We anticipate this will be partially offset by significantly higher raw material costs primarily for OSB web stock.\nAnd for our distribution business, we're expecting adjusted EBITDA to be significantly lower than the first quarter, primarily due to reduced commodity margins. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Nancy. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. First quarter housing starts averaged 1.75 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 5% over the fourth quarter. Activity dipped slightly in January, driven by winter weather and pandemic-related labor challenges, but improved as the quarter progressed. March housing starts totaled nearly 1.8 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest monthly level since 2006. Housing permits in the first quarter averaged nearly 1.9 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, surpassing last quarter by 7% and surging to its highest quarterly average since before the Great Recession.\nAlthough these results demonstrate strong underlying demand for new home construction, the cycle time between starts and completions continues to be extended as homebuilders face ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor availability challenges and rising material costs. Additionally, we do expect increasing mortgage rates and higher inflation to have some impact on the housing market.\nHowever, notwithstanding these headwinds, our customers continue to see strong demand and remain optimistic for new home construction in 2022, and we remain constructive on near-term and longer-term housing demand fundamentals given favorable demographic trends, a significantly underbuilt housing stock, a strong labor market and elevated household balance sheets.\nTurning to repair and remodel. We continue to see favorable activity from large professional projects in the first quarter, representing a continuation of the strong demand signal we saw from this segment in 2021. Demand from the Do-It-Yourself segment softened modestly in the first quarter, largely driven by concerns over the return of near record high lumber prices. Overall, our long-term outlook for repair and remodel continues to be favorable, supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and historically low supply of new and existing homes for sale.\nIn closing, we delivered our strongest first quarter financial performance on record and I'm incredibly proud of our employees for their continued dedication and resilience. We continue to make meaningful progress towards the multiyear growth targets we announced at our Investor Day last September and remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading performance across our operations.\nOur balance sheet is strong. And with $850 million of adjusted FAD generated in the first quarter, 2022 is off to a great start. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver considerable long-term value and superior returns for our shareholders.\nWith that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions."

Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call.\nWe will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.6 billion or $3.47 per diluted share on net sales of $10.2 billion. Excluding special items, our full year 2021 earnings totaled $2.5 billion or $3.37 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was a record $4.1 billion, more than 86% increase over full year 2020.\nFor the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $416 million, or $0.55 per diluted share on net sales of $2.2 billion. Excluding a total after-tax benefit of $49 million for special items, we earned $367 million or $0.49 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $674 million.\nI'll start this morning by thanking our employees for an exceptional year. Through their collective efforts, Weyerhaeuser delivered its strongest financial performance on record. Each of our businesses executed remarkably well. The team has maintained a safety focus and continue to serve our customers, all while navigating persistent operational and market challenges. I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2021, which further positioned the company to drive superior long-term value for our shareholders.\nNotable 2021 highlights include delivering record adjusted EBITDA from our Wood Products business of $3.4 billion, a 120% increase over 2020, capturing more than $70 million of company-wide operational excellence improvements, optimizing our timberlands holdings through strategic transactions in Alabama and Washington, launching our Natural Climate Solutions business with a growth target to achieve $100 million of annual EBITDA by year-end 2025, publishing the company's inaugural peer-leading carbon record, establishing a leadership position amongst our North American peers in setting a science-based greenhouse gas reduction target, strengthening our balance sheet by paying down an additional $375 million of debt and increasing our share repurchase authorization to $1 billion.\nIn addition, as highlighted on Page 19 of our earnings slide, we generated more than $2.6 billion of adjusted FAD in 2021, further demonstrating the strong cash generation capability of our unmatched portfolio of assets and industry-leading operating performance.\nBased on our 2021 results, we announced this morning that our Board of Directors has declared a supplemental cash dividend of $1.45 per share payable on February 28 to holders of record on February 18. This supplemental dividend represents the final installment of our cash return to shareholders based on 2021 results.\nWhen combined with our 2021 quarterly base dividend of $0.68 per share and the onetime interim supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share that was paid in October, we are returning a total of $2.63 per share of dividends to shareholders based on 2021 results, which equates to a 75% of 2021 adjusted FAD.\nIncluding the $100 million of shares repurchased in 2021, Weyerhaeuser is returning more than $2 billion of total cash to shareholders based on 2021 results or 79% of 2021 adjusted FAD, which is at the upper end of our commitment of returning 75% to 80% of FAD on an annual basis.\nMoving forward in 2022, we remain committed to returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders. This will continue to be supported by our sustainable quarterly base dividend which, as previously announced, we intend to grow by 5% annually through 2025. As outlined in our cash return framework on Page 18, we will supplement our base dividend with an additional return of cash, as appropriate, to achieve our targeted annual payout of 75% to 80%. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental cash dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase. We continue to believe this flexible and sustainable cash return framework will enhance our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to our shareholders across a variety of market conditions.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides.\nTimberlands contributed $110 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $11 million compared to the third quarter.\nFor the full year, Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% compared to 2020. These strong results were delivered despite persistent weather-, transportation- and pandemic-related challenges in 2021, and I would like to specifically recognize our Western Timberlands team for their exceptional work managing through the salvage operations resulting from the 2020 Oregon fires. As of year-end, we've completed substantially all of the planned salvage harvest.\nIn the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared to the third quarter. Western domestic log market showed signs of improvement at the outset of the fourth quarter following a brief softening in demand in September. As the fourth quarter progressed, log demand further improved as mills sought to capitalize on rapidly increasing lumber prices. While log supply in the Western system was sufficient as the quarter began, it became constrained later in the quarter, particularly in Oregon, as a result of supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions. Despite this dynamic, our fee harvest volumes increased slightly compared to the third quarter.\nWith lower log inventories and limited regional log supply as the quarter progressed, we increased the volume of fee logs to our internal mills, resulting in modestly lower third-party domestic sales volumes compared to the third quarter. This is a great example of how we leverage our integrated business model to effectively navigate and capitalize on temporary market disruptions.\nOur average sales realizations in the West were comparable to the third quarter but increased each month and ended the year at their highest levels of 2021. Per unit log and haul costs decreased in the fourth quarter, as did forestry and road costs.\nTurning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the fourth quarter as persistent global supply chain disruptions, a shortage of shipping containers and strengthening U.S. domestic lumber markets reduced the availability of imported lumber into Japan. This dynamic continued to drive solid demand for locally produced Japanese lumber and for our imported logs to support that domestic production. As a result, our Japanese log realizations in the fourth quarter increased slightly compared to the third quarter. Sales volumes were modestly lower due to timing of vessels.\nIn China, end-market demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter despite lower-than-expected overall Chinese consumption and elevated log inventories at the ports. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be impacted by global shipping container availability and the ban on Australian logs. As a result, our sales volumes to China increased significantly compared to the third quarter. Sales realizations for our China export logs decreased slightly and ocean freight rates improved during the quarter.\nMoving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased by $4 million compared to the third quarter. Southern sawlog and fiber markets continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter despite ample log supply resulting from dryer weather conditions. Mill inventories returned to normal levels in most geographies during the quarter, but log demand remained strong across the south as mills sought to capitalize on rising lumber and panel pricing and focused on bolstering log inventories heading into the first quarter. As a result of these dynamics, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the third quarter and fee harvest volumes were modestly higher. Per unit log and haul costs increased slightly in the quarter, primarily for transportation costs.\nTurning now to Southern export, which remains a small component of our overall operations. During the fourth quarter, Chinese regulators implemented new rules for imported pine logs to address potential phytosanitary concerns. These regulations imposed additional costs and administrative requirements. As a result, we paused our Southern pine log exports to China. And consequently, our export log volumes to China decreased significantly compared to the third quarter. In response, we redirected logs to domestic mills and significantly increased our export log volumes to India in the fourth quarter. We are optimistic that this headwind for pine exports to China will be transitory and still maintain a constructive, longer-term outlook for our Southern export business.\nIn the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $2 million compared to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes were significantly higher, resulting from favorable weather conditions and robust log demand as mills built inventory. Sales realizations increased slightly primarily for hardwood logs.\nTurning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. Real estate and ENR contributed $36 million to fourth quarter earnings and $49 million to adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $11 million lower than the third quarter due to the timing of transactions. Similar to 2020, our real estate activity in 2021 was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year.\nFor the full year, the segment generated $296 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance and 23% higher than 2020. Despite a year-over-year reduction in acres sold, full year earnings increased by 144% compared to 2020 due to the mix of properties sold. And average sales prices increased by more than $2,000 per acre, a 120% increase. These results underscore the strength of the HBU market in 2021, the quality of our properties and our team's ability to capitalize on these strong markets to deliver significant premiums to timber values.\nNow I'll make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business which we launched in 2021. As shown on Page 22, full year adjusted EBITDA from this business increased by 73% compared to 2020, driven primarily by growth from existing businesses in our portfolio, including mitigation and conservation as well as renewable energy. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in Maine and we continue to look to seek approval in 2022. We're also advancing discussions with high-quality developers of solar, wind and carbon capture and storage projects across our ownership. We continue to see multiyear growth potential from these businesses and maintain our target of reaching $100 million of annual EBITDA by the end of 2025.\nMoving to Wood Products, Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $466 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items and $517 million to adjusted EBITDA. Our EWP business established a new quarterly adjusted EBITDA record in the quarter, surpassing the prior record established just last quarter by 50%.\nFor the full year, our lumber, OSB and EWP businesses established new annual EBITDA records, and our distribution business generated the highest annual adjusted EBITDA in over 15 years. This is all notwithstanding ongoing challenges resulting from supply chain-, transportation-, weather- and pandemic-related disruptions. This is truly exceptional performance, and I'm extremely proud of the resiliency, flexibility and determination exhibited by our teams as they navigated multiple headwinds in 2021.\nIn the fourth quarter, demand remained unseasonably strong across our Wood Products businesses, driven by continued strength in new residential home building and repair and remodel activity as well as favorable weather conditions for construction for the majority of the quarter.\nStarting with the lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber prices entered the quarter on an upward trajectory driven by strong home building and repair and remodel demand. In contrast, OSB markets remained fairly balanced for the first 2 months of the quarter, resulting in relatively flat composite pricing. Both lumber and OSB pricing increased at a rapid pace starting in December as supply was disrupted by a myriad of factors, including major flooding in British Columbia that disrupted transportation and supply chain networks across Western Canada; labor challenges exacerbated by the Omicron variant, which impacted industry-wide mill operations, log supply and transportation carriers; and significant weather events that further impacted transportation and log supply in the Northwest and Canada in December. Channel inventories of both lumber and OSB ended the year in a lean position with continued strong demand.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our lumber business increased by $77 million compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 15% in the fourth quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing increased by 40%. This relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lagged surging lumber prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions.\nOur sales volumes decreased significantly in the fourth quarter, resulting from weather-related transportation challenges in Canada and lower inventory drawdown compared to the third quarter. Production volumes were modestly lower and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher, resulting from weather-related events in the Northwest and Canada, including 1 week of downtime at our Princeton mill following the flooding event in British Columbia.\nAdjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $168 million compared to the third quarter. Despite a rapid increase in pricing in December, our average sales realizations decreased by 29% in the fourth quarter, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 20%. Similar to lumber, this relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lagged surging OSB prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions.\nOur sales volumes decreased slightly compared to the third quarter, resulting from weather-related transportation challenges in Canada. Production volumes and unit manufacturing costs improved in the quarter due to less downtime for planned maintenance. Fiber costs were moderately higher in the quarter.\nEngineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $38 million compared to the third quarter, a 50% improvement. Raw material costs were significantly lower, primarily for OSB web stock. Sales realizations improved for most products, and we continue to benefit from previously price increases for solid section and I-joists. Sales and production volumes were lower for most products as a result of planned annual maintenance during the quarter and the impacts of COVID-related staffing shortages.\nIn Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $18 million compared to the third quarter, an 82% improvement as the business captured improved margins, primarily for lumber and OSB, partially offset by seasonally lower sales volumes.\nI'd like to now turn to operational excellence. In 2021, our teams captured more than $70 million of margin improvements, meeting our $50 million to $75 million target, while also making meaningful progress against our other OpEx priorities, including with respect to creation, cost avoidance, driving efficiencies and cross-business synergies throughout the company. This was a remarkable accomplishment when considering the numerous challenges facing our business in 2021. Once again, our people demonstrated unwavering focus and exceptional teamwork to deliver innovative and creative solutions to overcome obstacles and drive OpEx across the company.\nIn addition, I'm pleased with how well our employees continue to drive cross-business OpEx that improved margins in both Timberlands and Wood Products. These efforts optimized internal log deliveries to Weyerhaeuser mills to maximize value and avoid out-of-log downtime. And our teams worked together across our businesses to ensure that we maximize the recovery value from our salvage operations in Oregon.\nAs we look forward to the future, we're targeting another $175 million to $250 million of OpEx improvements across our businesses between 2022 and 2025. And I look forward to sharing more about our key initiatives and results in the years ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items in our first quarter and 2022 outlook.\n\nNancy S. Loewe\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nThank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items, the fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2022 outlook.\nI'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $494 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to approximately $3.2 billion, our highest full year operating cash flow on record. As Devin mentioned, we're returning over $2 billion to shareholders based on 2021 results, which includes $100 million of share repurchases.\nFourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $74 million at an average price of $37.60. This leaves us with approximately $926 million of the remaining capacity as of year-end 2021 under the $1 billion program we announced in the third quarter. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which nearly $1.1 billion is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced this morning that will be paid in February. We ended the year with total gross debt of $5.1 billion. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, we repaid our $150 million 9% note at maturity, and we have no additional maturities until 2023.\nFourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Fourth quarter unallocated adjusted EBITDA decreased by $24 million compared to the third quarter. This decline was primarily attributable to higher-than-expected health care expenses, partially due to pandemic-related deferrals of nonessential medical treatment from 2020 into 2021.\nKey outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2022 are presented now on Pages 20 and 21. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter.\nBeginning with our Western Timberlands operations, domestic log demand continues to be favorable as mills capitalize on strong lumber pricing. We anticipate this dynamic continuing for most of the first quarter. As a result, our average domestic sales realizations are expected to be significantly higher than the fourth quarter.\nAs Devin discussed, we have substantially completed our salvage harvest operations in Oregon. In addition, we have made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. As a result, we expect our first quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter, with lower per unit log and haul costs and seasonally lower forestry and road costs.\nMoving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remains favorable, and we anticipate our first quarter sales realizations will be moderately higher than the fourth quarter with comparable sales volumes.\nIn China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable in the first quarter as imports of lumber and logs from other markets continue to be constrained. We expect our first quarter sales volumes to be comparable to the fourth quarter, partially offset by slightly lower sales realizations.\nIn the South, despite log inventories near target levels, log demand continues to be strong as mills position to benefit from strong lumber and panel pricing and build inventory to avoid potential disruptions from wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter. We anticipate comparable sales realizations and seasonally lower forestry and road costs. This is expected to be offset by slightly higher per unit log and haul costs and slightly lower fee harvest volumes due to seasonal wet weather patterns.\nIn the North, sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter due to mix, with slightly lower fee harvest volumes resulting from a seasonal reduction in harvest activity.\nTurning to our full year harvest plan. For the full year 2022, we expect total company fee harvest volume to increase to approximately 34.5 million tons.\nIn the West, we anticipate our harvest volumes will be slightly higher than 2021 as salvage harvest operations in Oregon are substantially complete.\nWe expect our Southern harvest volumes to increase moderately as we resume a more normalized level of activity following reduced harvest levels in 2021 resulting from persistent adverse weather conditions.\nSimilar to 2021, we expect our Northern harvest volumes will be moderately lower year-over-year due to softening fiber markets in New England.\nTurning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Demand for our real estate properties remains strong, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. We expect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for this segment.\nSimilar to 2021, we anticipate our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in real estate acres sold.\nFor our Wood Products segment, demand remains favorable, supported by strong new residential home building and repair and remodel activity. As Devin mentioned, channel inventory started the year in a lean position and supply continues to be constrained by persistent transportation, supply chain and COVID-related labor challenges. This dynamic is expected to continue for most of the first quarter and has driven lumber and OSB benchmark pricing to unseasonably high levels quarter-to-date.\nExcluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter.\nFor lumber, we expect improved production volumes and unit manufacturing costs in the first quarter with slightly lower sales volumes resulting from ongoing transportation disruptions. Log costs are expected to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter primarily for Western logs.\nFor oriented strand board, we anticipate improved production volumes in the first quarter, driven by less planned maintenance and modestly higher sales volumes. We expect this will be partially offset by moderately higher fiber costs.\nAs shown on Page 23, our current and quarter-to-date sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board are both significantly higher than the fourth quarter average.\nFor engineered wood products, we expect comparable sales realizations to the fourth quarter, and sales and production volumes will be higher, resulting from less planned maintenance in the first quarter.\nFor our distribution business, we are expecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter due to moderately lower sales volumes.\nSo I'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 21. Our full year 2021 interest expense was $313 million. Due to the additional debt reduction during 2021, we anticipate interest expense will be $305 million for the full year 2022.\nTurning to taxes. Our full year 2021 effective tax rate was 21.5%, excluding special items, driven by the higher percentage of total income coming from our taxable REIT subsidiary. For first quarter and full year '22, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 19% and 23% before special items and based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.\nFor cash taxes, we paid a net $609 million for full year 2021, which included a $95 million tax refund received in the fourth quarter, which was associated with our 2018 voluntary pension contribution. Excluding this tax refund, our cash taxes were in line with our tax expense. Our 2021 cash taxes were slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the timing of Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2022 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense.\nFor pension and post-employment plans, the year-end 2021 funded status improved by nearly $500 million as a result of favorable asset returns and higher discount rates compared to year-end 2020. Discount rates increased by approximately 40 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. Our noncash nonoperating pension and post-employment expense was $19 million in 2021. We expect to record approximately $60 million of expense in 2022.\nCash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2021 was $59 million. In 2022, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $30 million.\nTurning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2021 capital expenditures totaled $441 million, which was slightly below our guidance due to supply chain and contract labor constraints experienced during the fourth quarter. We expect total capital expenditures for 2022 will be approximately $440 million, which includes $110 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs; $320 million for Wood Products; and $10 million for planned corporate IT system investments.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.\n\nDevin W. Stockfish\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Weyerhaeuser Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Nancy. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets.\nU.S. housing activity continued at a strong pace in the fourth quarter, with total housing starts averaging more than 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits averaging more than 1.7 million units.\nFor the full year, total housing starts were nearly 1.6 million units, representing a 16% increase over 2020 and the highest annual level since 2006.\nThese increased levels of housing activity are notable, considering the persistent supply chain and labor challenges that homebuilders faced in 2021. Notwithstanding the recent uptick in mortgage rates and ongoing affordability concerns, both our near-term and longer-term housing outlook remain optimistic and is supported by encouraging housing demand fundamentals, including favorable demographics, a decade of underbuilding and historically low inventory for new and existing homes.\nTurning now to repair and remodel activity, which strengthened in the fourth quarter. Demand continued to be strong, bolstered by large professional R&R projects, which remained healthy for most of 2021, and a resurgence of smaller do-it-yourself activity following a period of temporary weakness in the summer months.\nAs we enter 2022, our outlook for repair and remodel activity continues to be positive, with demand supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and healthy household balance sheets.\nIn closing, our 2021 financial performance was among the best in our company's history, and I'm incredibly proud of our employees and their efforts to achieve these outstanding results.\nAdditionally, in 2021, we continued to drive improvements across each of the value levers of our investment thesis. We made great progress on upgrading our portfolio, improving our operating performance, building on our ESG leadership and demonstrating a commitment to disciplined capital allocation.\nLooking forward, we've announced a series of multiyear targets that will drive additional growth and deliver superior value for our shareholders. With our unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance, strong balance sheet and supportive macro tailwinds, we're well positioned to capitalize on favorable demand fundamentals, generate strong cash flows, grow our company and return significant amounts of cash to shareholders.\nAnd now I'd like to open the floor for questions."

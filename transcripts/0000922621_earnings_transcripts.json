This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording.\nNow I would like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Please proceed.\n\nScott W. Beilharz\n\nVP of Capital Management & IR, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our third quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Pelkowski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.\nFor information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the safe harbor statement in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC filed yesterday and in the related press release. This prerecorded call is the property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company.\nWith that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. As we start today's call, I want to share an important update regarding our financial strength rating. In September, A.M. Best adjusted the financial strength rating of the property casualty members of Erie Insurance Group from A+ (Superior) to A (Excellent). While that change was disappointing, it's important to note that an A excellent rating is still one of the strongest in the industry. A.M. Best pointed to Erie's solid balance sheet, [ good ] operating performance, a favorable business profile and strong risk management practices. This feedback from A.M. Best is reflected in our financial position, particularly our surplus, which remains extremely robust at $9.6 billion.\nThe rating change primarily reflects profitability challenges we've discussed in past calls related to large underwriting losses, driven by more frequent and severe weather events and increased claims severity in both auto and homeowners. Provide a bit of background, severe weather-related events in 2023 and 2024 were nearly double historical levels, contributing to Erie's elevated underwriting losses. That trend has continued into 2025, where a fast-moving hailstorm earlier this year caused $370 million in insured losses, the single largest weather event in our company's history.\nAt the same time, claims severity in both auto and homeowners grew faster than our rate increases even as we work to keep pricing competitive for our mutual customers. We continue to take a measured, steady approach to rate adjustments, and that means it takes a bit longer to fully see the benefits of these changes. The bottom line is that the past few years marked by inflation and weather volatility have been some of the most challenging in our history.\nI'm confident in the actions we've been taking to bring our profitability back to more stable levels, which are already taking hold, reflected in our third quarter results.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski, to share more on those results. Julie?\n\nJulie Marie Pelkowski\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. This quarter marks a meaningful step forward in Erie's return to profitability. As Tim touched on, our consistent focus on underwriting discipline and pricing actions is beginning to deliver the results we've been working toward. After a first half impacted by elevated catastrophe activity, the more typical lower weather events of the third quarter provided a clearer view of our core performance from a profitability perspective.\nSo starting with the results of the exchange and the insurance operations we manage. The exchange's direct written premiums grew 7.6% in the quarter and 10.1% year-to-date. The average premium per policy increased 10.7%, reflecting the cumulative impact of rate increases over the past 2 years.\nPolicy growth remained flat year-over-year, increasing 0.2%, while retention was 89.1% at the end of the third quarter. While policy growth has moderated, consistent with broader industry trends, we're confident the balance of rate adequacy and retention positions us well for long-term profitable growth. Also, we're introducing an enhanced auto product with more competitive rates and growth potential that Tim will expand on in a few minutes.\nFrom a profitability perspective, the third quarter combined ratio was 100.6% compared to 113.7% in the same quarter last year. On a year-to-date basis, the combined ratio was 108.6% compared to 113.4% in the same period of 2024. These results reflect steady, measurable progress toward restoring sustainable profitability. As a reminder, catastrophe events in the first half of the year significantly affected our reported loss ratios. The low level of weather events in this quarter highlight the adequacy of our rate levels and the improvement in profitability of our core book.\nPolicyholder surplus is up over $300 million for the year, bringing total surplus to $9.6 billion, as Tim mentioned. This growth demonstrates the strengths of our capital position and our ability to withstand volatility while continuing to deliver long-term value to our policyholders.\nShifting to the results for Indemnity. Net income for the third quarter was $183 million or $3.50 per diluted share compared to $160 million or $3.06 per share in the third quarter of 2024, a 14% increase. For the year, net income was $496 million or $9.48 per diluted share compared to $448 million or $8.57 per diluted share in the first 9 months of 2024, an 11% increase. Operating income grew to $209 million, up 16% from the same quarter last year, primarily driven by higher management fee revenue. Operating income grew to $559 million, up almost 10% for the year, primarily driven by management fee revenue as well.\nManagement fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased 7.3% to $825 million for the quarter and 9.5% to $2.4 billion for the year, in line with the Exchange's premium growth. On the expense side, commissions increased 9.7% to $462 million in the third quarter and up 12% to almost $1.4 billion year-to-date, driven by higher base commission expense in line with premium increases as well as increased agent incentive compensation.\nNon-commission expenses decreased 6.2% in the third quarter to $181 million, reflecting lower administrative and other expenses as well as lower sales and advertising expenses, all of which were partially offset by investments in information technology and underwriting costs.\nNon-commission expenses increased 2.8% for the year to $556 million, reflecting increased investments in information technology, increased underwriting costs as well as customer service costs, partially offset by administrative and other expenses, primarily due to decreased personnel costs. Investment income for the quarter totaled $22 million, up 10% from last year, reflecting higher yields and higher average balances. Investment income for the year totaled $61 million, up 25.2% from last year, primarily from net investment income. As always, we take a measured approach to capital management, maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nAnd for the first 9 months of 2025, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $190 million in dividends. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim.\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, Julie. As Julie mentioned, we're excited to introduce an enhanced auto product that we're confident, will have a positive impact on our competitive position. ErieSecure Auto has the pricing sophistication of our rate lock product without the lock. That means more competitive rates and greater opportunity for growth.\nSince launching the pilot in Ohio in August, we've seen this product have impressive impacts on submitted applications and direct written premium in that state. We plan to deploy the product in December to agents in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia, additional states to follow through the mid next year.\nSecure Auto is just one of the actions we're taking to bring profitability back to more normal levels. It's also just one of the product enhancements and rollouts on the horizon as we continue to modernize our technology platforms and respond to changing agent and customer needs. As we focus on the future with new products and technology, our 100-year commitment to service is, as always, at the forefront, and the ongoing strength of that commitment has been recognized by several industry accolades this year, including several in this past quarter.\nInsurance was ranked first in small business insurance, customer satisfaction in J.D. Power's 2025 U.S. Small Commercial Insurance Study, 25 points above the industry average and the best-in-class for price, for coverage, ease of doing business and people. We were also named to Forbes list of America's Best Insurance Companies 2026, earning recognition across multiple product categories, including auto, homeowners, renters, term life and permanent life.\nIn addition, Newsweek and Plant-A Insights Group named Erie one of America's Greatest Companies 2025, recognizing our financial strength, innovation, sustainability and ethics. Finally, Erie was again recognized among the top employers in Pennsylvania on Forbes list of America's Best in State Employers 2025 for the sixth consecutive year. Building on earlier recognition as one of America's Best Large Employers and Best Employers for college grads.\nAs we near the end of our 100th year in business and look ahead to 2026, our focus remains clear: strengthening profitability, delivering an exceptional service and investing in the technology and products that will shape Erie's next century. We faced difficult cycles before, and each time we've emerged stronger.\nThanks to our dedicated employees and trusted agents who are committed to delivering superior service and protection, this time will be no different. Thank you for listening in today and for your interest in Erie."

And thank you all for listening in ay. Before we get into our financial update for the second quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes sharing some insights into the information security event our company recently experienced.\n\nOn June 7th, our IT team identified unauthorized network activity. Consistent with our incident response plans, the team took immediate action and initiated a proactive network outage and system shutdown.\n\nThis was a necessary step to protect our systems and data, and thankfully, it was effective. After a thorough forensics investigation conducted by independent cybersecurity specialists, there is no evidence that any sensitive personal information, financial records, or legally protected data was breached by the threat actor during our incident.\n\nOur recovery process was supported by some of nation's leading cybersecurity specialists, and was conducted with an intentional, phased, and prioritized method. This complex recovery process took time to ensure that systems and applications were restored safely and securely.\n\nWhile that work was underway, teams from across the company moved quickly to implement workarounds for critical processes like claims handling and to mobilize our workforce to step outside their normal duties to support.\n\nBy July 7th, one month after the outage, the majority of our systems were back up and running. I'd like express my appreciation to the employees and agents who worked tirelessly to recover our systems safely and to keep our operations going.\n\nFrom every area of company, and from both employees and agents, I saw a willingness to do whatever it took to get through this situation, and to uphold our promise of service.\n\nThat is never what we expected to be dealing with in our 100th year of business, but incidents like this one are an unfortunate reality of doing business in today's world.\n\nOur information security protocols along with our technical and physical safeguards are aligned with the best practices of the insurance industry. However, this incident shows that no organization is completely immune to such attacks.\n\nCyber criminal groups and information security incidents are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and even the most well-protected organizations can be impacted. Safeguarding our systems and the information we have continue be top priorities, and we're already implementing what we learned from this incident to further strengthen our cybersecurity protections.\n\nNow, let's turn to the financial performance of the past quarter. Here to share the details is Chief Financial Officer Julie Pelkowski. Julie?\n\nThank you, Tim. And good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, while the cyber incident caused a challenging end to our second quarter, we're certainly proud of how quickly teams mobilized to ensure we were able to provide our policyholders with best-in-class service, albeit under less-than-ideal circumstances.\n\nGiven the diligent implementation of our business continuity protocols, we do not believe there has been a material impact to our statements of financial position, income, or cash flows as a result of this incident.\n\nStarting with the results of the ERIE Insurance Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, from a growth perspective, as we've seen in recent quarters, the significant rate increases we implemented in 2023 and 2024 continue to drive the exchange's direct written premium growth.\n\nThe exchange's direct and assumed written premiums grew by nearly 9.2% in the second quarter of 2025 and 11.4% in the first half of 2025, compared to the same respective periods in prior year.\n\nThe rate impact is evidenced in the increase in our average premium per policy of 11.9%. We saw policies enforce growth of 1.7%, and our policy retention ratio remained strong at 89.7%.\n\nThe more adequate rates are continuing to drive improvement in the exchange's non-catastrophe loss ratio. However, from a seasonality perspective, we generally see higher weather losses in the first half of the year.\n\nWe saw this trend hold true as the exchange's combined ratio was 116.9 in second quarter of 2025 compared to 115.9 in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nWith catastrophic weather events contributing 20.7 points and 16.2 points in those same respective periods. The year-to-date combined ratio was 112.6 in 2025 compared 111.1 in the first six months of 2024.\n\nIn the first six months, catastrophic weather events contributed 18.5 points versus 12.7 points in the same period of 2024. These catastrophe losses were experienced in March, April, and May, the spring months that generally have the highest experience of weather events in our geographic footprint.\n\nThe other months in the six-month period experienced combined ratios below 100%. As I highlighted during our last call, if you reference the investor supplement that is published on our website, if we excluded catastrophe losses, as well as the effects of prior accident year reserve development, our direct current year non-catastrophe loss ratio would have been 94.6% and 95.1% in the second quarter and first six months of 2025, respectively.\n\nIn summary, while our rate increases contribute to profitability improvements, they are being masked by the more significant catastrophe losses we experienced in 2025 compared to last year.\n\nThe exchange's underwriting losses were partially offset by investment returns, which resulted in a slight decrease in policyholder surplus from 9.3 billion at December 2024 to 9.2 billion at June 2025, which held steady from March of 2025.\n\nShifting to the results for NDEMNITY, net income was 175 million or $3.34 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2025, compared 164 million or $3.13 per diluted share in the second quarter 2024.\n\nYear to date, INDEMNITY net income was 313 million or $5.99 per diluted share, compared 289 million or $5.52 per diluted share at this time last year.\n\nOperating income increased in the second quarter nearly 5% to almost 200 million compared to the second quarter 2024, bringing our year to date, 2025 operating income to 350 million, which was an increase of almost 7% compared to the first half of 2024.\n\nThe main driver of these increases continues to be higher management fee revenue resulting from the growth in the exchange's direct written premium. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased 8.3% to 824 million in second quarter of 2025 compared to second quarter of 2024, and nearly 11% to 1.6 billion in the first half of the year compared to this time last year.\n\nTotal cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased by $54 million, or 9.1%, for the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nThe first half of 2025 saw an increase of 132 million or 11.5% when compared with the first half of 2024. Commission expenses are the largest driver, increasing almost 44 million or just over 10% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and nearly 105 million or 13.1% in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period of 2024.\n\nNon-commission expenses for the second quarter increased nearly 11 million or 6.1%, primarily driven by higher information technology costs and sales and advertising expenses. Year to date, 2025 non-commission expenses grew almost 27 million or 7.7% compared to the first half of 2024.\n\nThis was primarily driven by increased information technology costs, as well as higher underwriting and policy processing, sales and advertising, and customer services expenses. Personnel costs within each of these expense categories were impacted by increased healthcare costs compared to 2024.\n\nIncome from investments totaled almost 20 million compared to earnings of nearly 14 million in the second quarter of 2024. Net investment income was just over 20 million in the second quarter compared to almost 16 million in the same period last year.\n\nTotal investment income in the first half of 2025 was 39 million compared 29 million in first half of 2024. Net investment income for the first half of 2025 drove most of this improvement, contributing 8 million dollars compared to 2024.\n\nAs always, we take a measured approach to capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. For the first six months of 2025, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $127 million in dividends.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nThanks, Julie. The cybersecurity event and system outage occupied much of our attention over the past quarter. But we also celebrated several notable milestones achievements and accolades.\n\nIn April, several members of our leadership team capped off ERIE's 100th anniversary week with a visit to the NASDAQ headquarters in New York City to ring the opening bell.\n\nThis was to celebrate both our 100th year in business and the 30th anniversary of ERIE INDEMNITY's listing on the NASDAQ. It was a remarkable moment representing the azing growth and success our company has achieved since its humble beginnings in 1925.\n\nAnother example of this success came in May when we announced the creation of the ERIE urance Foundation. A private charitable foundation that will create long-term sustainability for charitable contributions and grant making.\n\nAfter launching the initiative and seeing the Foundation's endowment, ERIE Indemnity Co, as the management company for ERIE Insurance, plans to donate $100 million.\n\nMany of the company's charitable giving funds and activities previously coordinated by the Giving Network will be consolidated under this separate 501(c)(3) foundation. This will enable the foundation's board of directors and officers to direct the entity's investment decisions, charitable strategy, and grant funding.\n\nThe $100 million seed gift from Erie Indemnity will build a charitable legacy for years to come, as the initial gift can be invested and grow.\n\nThis support of our communities is part of our larger commitment to putting service above all else. Service is at the heart of ERIE's unique value proposition, and recent recognitions show that our customers continue to experience it firsthand.\n\nEarlier this year, ERIE was named the highest rated auto insurance provider by Consumer Reports. As the highest rated carrier out of 36 of the nation's top carriers with rankings based on factors like premiums, claims, coverage, and policy clarity.\n\nConsumer Reports is an independent nonprofit member organization that works side by side with consumers for truth, transparency, and fairness in the marketplace including recognition of our value proposition was a big win for us, and it will hopefully prompt more consumers to consider us for their insurance needs.\n\nTo round out this quarter's recognitions are strong financial standing was validated in June when ERIE moved up 52 spots on the 2025 Fortune 500 list.\n\nERIE roved its position from 376 to 323 on the list of America's largest insurance. So this on total revenue for the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nThis marks the 22nd year Erie has been named to the Fortune 500, alongside some of the most well-known and successful companies in this country. Over the course of the last century, we've never stopped delivering on the promise of our founders made in the earliest days of the company: to put service and people above all else.\n\nThis commitment has helped us establish a reputation for exceptional service that consistently ranks higher than the rest of the insurance industry. It's also helped us weather countless challenges over the years, including the one we just experienced.\n\nThank you to our loyal and committed employees and agents for upholding our promise of service; to our shareholders for your continued trust and support; and to our policyholders for placing your trust in us."

Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before we dive into our first quarter results, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge a truly historic milestone for Erie Insurance. A few days ago, on April 20, we marked the 100th anniversary of our company's founding. When I reflect on this milestone, it's amazing to think about the impact this company has had over the past century.\nProtection and peace of mind for millions of policyholders; stable and successful careers for tens of thousands of employees and agents; millions of dollars and thousands of hours of time contributed to our communities; and a century of innovation, resilience and service. It's an extraordinary achievement that speaks to the strong foundation that was built 100 years ago and our commitment to the values and business principles of our founders.\nSeemingly, we've been celebrating this milestone with ways to connect to those values. Last month, we provided each employee $100 to contribute to a charity of their choice. So far, nearly $0.5 million has been allocated to various nonprofits across our geographic footprint.\nOf course, as we look back to what brought us here, we're also focused on what's ahead. We're taking actions to remain competitive in this complex and constantly evolving business landscape, and I'm confident in the strategic approach we're taking to long-term growth and stability.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski, to share details on our first quarter financial performance. Julie?\n\nJulie Marie Pelkowski\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, this past week, Erie Insurance celebrated a significant achievement, its centennial celebration. For 100 years, Erie has operated with a focus of being Above all in Service, a timeless differentiator from our competitors.\nOur foundation of financial strength and keeping the human touch at the center of everything we do has helped us to navigate countless challenges and weather many ups and downs, particularly in more difficult times such as significant weather events and uncertain economic and market conditions.\nSo let's start by discussing the first quarter performance of the Erie Insurance Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. The significant rate increases we implemented in 2023 and 2024 continue to drive the Exchange's direct written premium growth. Direct and assumed written premiums grew by nearly 14% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year. The rate impact is evidenced in the increase in our average premium per policy of 13.2%.\nNow that our rates are at more adequate levels, we're seeing the impact of the increased competitiveness of those rates. Policies in force grew 3.2% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024, which is lower than 4.8% for the total year 2024, but more in line with growth experienced prior to pandemic-related disruptions. Our policy retention ratio decreased slightly to 89.9%.\nThe significant rate actions I've mentioned were the primary lever we were pulling on to improve the profitability of the Exchange. We continue to see improvement in our non-catastrophe loss ratio for the Exchange. However, in March 2025, we experienced a significant catastrophe loss that contributed 13 points to the Exchange's total first quarter catastrophe losses of over 16 points. This drove the increase in our first quarter combined ratio. The Exchange's first quarter combined ratio was 108.1%, an increase over 106% in the first quarter of 2024.\nAs you can see in the investor supplement that was published yesterday on our website, if we excluded catastrophe losses as well as the effects of prior accident year reserve development, our direct current year non-catastrophe loss ratio would have been 95.4% in the first quarter of 2025.\nThe Exchange's underwriting losses in the first quarter were partially offset by investment returns, which resulted in a slight decrease in policyholder surplus from $9.3 billion at December of 2024 to $9.2 billion at March 2025.\nShifting to the results for Indemnity. Net income was $138.4 million or $2.65 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2025 compared to $124.6 million or $2.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2024. Operating income increased 9% to more than $151 million for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024.\nManagement fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased over 13% to $755 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year. The total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $77 million or about 14% for the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\nOur largest expense, our commissions, grew $61 million or about 16% for the first quarter. This growth was driven by the increase in direct written premiums of the exchange, and to a lesser extent, agent incentive compensation. Non-commission expenses for the first quarter grew just over $16 million or about 9%. The biggest driver of this growth was an $11 million increase in our technology investments due to higher hardware, software and personnel costs as well as a decrease in the amount of professional fees capitalized.\nWe also saw an increase in underwriting and policy processing costs of $3 million and customer service costs of about $2 million. Personnel cost increases across all expense categories were impacted by increased compensation in the first quarter of 2025, including higher estimates for incentive plan awards compared to 2024.\nWhen looking at our investment operations, it's important to note that during periods of heightened market uncertainty, we have always maintained a long-term perspective and a focus on our strategic objectives for the Erie Insurance Group portfolios. Investment income in the first quarter of 2025 was $19.5 million compared to $15 million in the same period of 2024 driven by growth in our net investment income of $4 million.\nAs always, we take a measured approach to capital management and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first 3 months of 2025, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders almost $64 million in dividends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Julie. The entire insurance industry is feeling the effects of external pressures related to economic instability, the dynamic political environment and an increase in severe weather. The results Julie just reported, however, confirm that we're responding appropriately and effectively, setting the stage to address the immediate challenges ahead and to build long-term sustainability for both the company and for our agents.\nA key part of our response involves technology. In past calls, I've talked about our progress in modernizing our legacy platforms. One of the more significant achievements over the past quarter was the continued rollout of Business Auto 2.0. After a pilot in Indiana in the second half of last year, the product has been released to Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois and Tennessee in late January.\nBusiness Auto 2.0 supports our refreshed and enhanced Business Auto product with an improved quoting and processing experience and the ability to have vehicles from multiple states on one policy. It also provides access to online account for customers and features an auto-pay option. Rollout to the remainder of our footprint is expected to continue through the third quarter. Our modernization efforts are wide scale and ongoing, so you can be sure to hear more updates on our progress in upcoming calls.\nAs Julie detailed earlier, we've experienced some very costly claims already this year. The losses incurred from the severe storms throughout our footprint in March have even surpassed those of Hurricane Helene, the September storm that flooded the Southeast, causing widespread destruction and fatalities. Catastrophes like these are devastating to our customers and damaging to our profitability. But it's in these circumstances that our biggest strength, exceptional service, really shines through.\nWhen I reflect on where we are today, celebrating 100 years in business, I'm proud that we have kept our promise of service at the forefront of everything we do, and I'm excited to begin our second century of service and success. Thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in Erie"

It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie's fourth quarter and year-end results for 2024. 2025 is an exciting year at Erie Insurance as we celebrate our centennial. H.O. Hirt and OG. Crawford opened the doors of Erie Insurance Exchange on April 20, 1925, after selling $31,000 of stock in Erie Indemnity Company as the managing attorney, in fact.\nWithin the first year, H.O. and OG brought in just under $50,000 in premiums from nearly 1,400 policyholders and established a surplus of almost $37,000. It's amazing to think that today, Erie Insurance Exchange has amassed close to $12 billion in premium, more than 7 million policies in force and just over $9 billion in policyholder surplus.\nAnd Erie Indemnity just experienced net income of $600 million in 2024. This growth and success are no doubt, testaments to the value proposition we offer delivered by our dedicated employees and our agents.\nToday, we face challenges and changes that are quite different from those of our founders, but we are adapting and responding in a way that aligns with our founding principles, which guide us to put people in service above all else. I'll share some examples of recent strides we've made to adapt to some of those changes in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski, who will provide an overview of our financial results. Julie?\n\nJulie Marie Pelkowski\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In 2024, Erie Indemnity Company continued to experience strong operating performance, driven by growth for Erie Insurance Exchange. Direct written premiums of the Exchange grew 16% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and over 18% for the full year 2024 compared to the respective periods in the prior year.\nThese results were primarily driven by the more significant rate increases that had been taken to combat higher loss costs caused by increased severity and weather events. The Exchange's total average premium per policy grew over 13% in 2024 compared to 2023. Policies in force grew a solid 4.8% to over $7 million in 2024, although slowing from the significant growth of 6.9% in 2023.\nPolicyholder retention also remained strong at 90.4%. As stated in previous calls, because we write 12-month policies, it takes 24 months for the related premium to be fully earned into our financial results.\nAs expected, the Exchange's profitability experienced improvements driven by the higher earned premiums as the more significant portion of rate increases were realized in 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the combined ratio was 105.7 an improvement from 111.4 in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFrom a total year perspective, the combined ratio for the Exchange ended at 110.4, nearly 9 points better than the 2023 combined ratio of 119.1. Coupled with the impact from rate increases, the Exchange has seen stable frequency. And while there are still pockets of higher severity, overall severity trends have been moderating.\nCatastrophe losses from weather events were also lower in 2024 despite the impacts of Hurricane Helene that added 1.6 points to the 2024 combined ratio. Overall, catastrophe losses contributed 9.6 points to the 2024 combined ratio compared to 12.6 points in 2023.\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Exchange experienced declines in policyholder surplus driven by the severity and weather events we've been discussing. With the more significant rate actions taking hold in 2024, policyholder surplus stabilized this year, remaining at $9.3 billion at year-end, similar to the beginning of the year.\nNow let's turn to the Indemnity Company and the positive results for both the fourth quarter and year-end. Net income was $152 million or $2.91 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to nearly $111 million or $2.12 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nNet income was just over $600 million or $11.48 per diluted share in 2024 compared to just over $446 million or $8.53 per diluted share in 2023. Operating income in the fourth quarter increased a little over $40 million or 31.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFor the total year, Indemnity experienced an increase in operating income of just over $156 million or 30% compared to 2023. When looking at our revenue growth, management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased over $97 million or 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and $452 million or 18.5% for the total year compared to 2023.\nThese increases in both the fourth quarter and total year were in line with the respective increases in the direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange. From an expense standpoint, the total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $57 million or 11.4% for the fourth quarter and $301 million or 15% for the total year 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nOur most significant cost of operations, our commission expenses grew $51 million in the fourth quarter, while the total year commission expenses increased $253 million. The higher commissions in both periods were driven by the increase in direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange.\nNoncommission expenses for the fourth quarter grew just over $6 million, while the total year noncommission expenses grew $48 million. The $6 million fourth quarter increase was driven by increased underwriting and policy processing costs of nearly $5 million, $3 million in additional information technology investments and $2 million in higher customer service costs.\nThese increases were offset by lower sales and advertising expenses of $2 million and lower administrative and other costs of $1 million. The increase in total year noncommission expenses of $48 million included increased underwriting and policy processing expenses of $18.5 million.\nSales and advertising expenses increased by almost $8 million, driven by higher agent-related and community development costs. Administrative and other costs increased $14.5 million due to increased personnel costs, charitable contributions and professional fees.\nCustomer service costs also increased $9 million due to increases in both personnel costs and credit card processing fees. These increases were offset by lower overall information technology costs for the year of over $1 million due to decreases in professional fees and personnel costs.\nIncome from investments for the fourth quarter totaled almost $21 million compared to $10 million in the same period last year. The fourth quarter of 2024 saw an increase of $7 million in net investment income as well as a decrease in net impairment losses of $7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIncome from investments totaled over $69 million for 2024 compared to just $29 million for total year 2023, primarily driven by a $25 million increase in net investment income. Contributing to this increase was a $13 million improvement in our limited partnership results and higher net realized and unrealized gains of $9 million compared to 2023.\nFinally, in 2024, we paid our shareholders over $237 million in dividends. And in December of last year, our Board approved a 7.1% increase in the 2025 regular quarterly cash dividend for both our Class A and Class B shares.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Tim.\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, Julie. Earlier in the call, I mentioned the challenges and changes we've been facing, and we're certainly not alone. The volatility of the economy, the climate and the legal landscape are impacting our entire industry. And of course, the pace of technology continues to demand more of our resources and attention.\nModernization of our technology platforms and processes has been a key initiative for the past 2 years. It's foundational to our future growth and geographic expansion, and it's directly tied to one of our highest current priorities, expense management.\nI'm pleased to share that at the end of 2024, we had successfully migrated multiple legacy systems to modern platforms. We still have a lot of work ahead to continue this migration and to sunset legacy systems, but we're pleased with our progress to date.\nSeveral legacy platforms have been migrated to the cloud, a technology infrastructure that is more stable, secure and efficient. And the modernization efforts have also led to enhancements to our products, services and related digital and data capabilities.\nThis includes a new billing platform that has been implemented with 2 recent rollouts, the expansion of workers' compensation and the launch of Business Auto 2.0. You may recall that in 2023, we launched a refreshed workers' compensation platform. This paved the way for the recent expansion of workers' comp coverage to adjacent states.\nCommercial customers domiciled the states within Erie's footprint can now include employees who work primarily in Delaware and Vermont on their Erie workers' comp policy. Additional states are expected to be added soon.\nBusiness Auto 2.0 supports our refreshed and enhanced commercial auto product with an improved quoting and processing experience and the ability to have vehicles from multiple states on one policy.\nAfter being successfully piloted in Indiana, and incorporating recommended improvements from stakeholders, Business Auto 2.0 will move ahead for full rollout in the first half of 2025.\nBefore we close, I'd like to mention a couple of third-party recognitions Erie received in the last quarter. In November, Erie was recognized as a top 100 employer for workplace culture for the second consecutive year by the American Opportunity Index. The annual employer study measures how effective America's largest companies are at developing talent to drive business performance and advance individual careers.\nAnd in December, Erie's Future Focus internship program was named to the Rising Insurance Star Executive list of the industry's 50 best Leadership programs for the fourth consecutive year. More than 100 interns from 40 different colleges and universities participated in the program last year.\nFinally, I'm excited to share that 2 of our senior leaders have been promoted to Executive Vice Presidents. Sarah Shine, a 25-year employee of Erie, has been appointed Executive Vice President of Customer Service and Experience; and Cody Cook, a 22-year employee of Erie has been appointed Executive Vice President of Claims.\nAs tenured employees who have served in both business and support functions, they each bring great institutional knowledge and valuable perspective to our executive team. I'm excited to have Cody and Sarah serving in these important executive roles as we begin our 100th year and set our strategy for the future.\nThank you all again for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie."

This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Pelkowski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed, and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current view about future events.

These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.

Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the second quarter of 2024. As we reached the halfway point of our 99th year in business, I'm excited to share that we also reached a significant milestone for Erie Insurance Exchange, 7 million policies in force. Our last milestone of 6 million policies in force was reached in 2021, and adding 1 million policies to our book of business in just 3 years is no small feat. To give you a sense of scale, it took our company more than 60 years to reach our first million and just 3 to get from 6 million to 7 million. So this recent milestone is no doubt a testament to our hardworking agency force and dedicated sales and underwriting teams.\nOur impressive growth in customer retention, which stands at just over 91% for personal and commercial lines combined, underscore the strong value proposition we offer. Putting service above all else is always our top priority and customers notice. That's why we hold true to the principles that have shaped our success for almost 100 years while continuously adapting for what's ahead.\nI'm also pleased to share that Erie ranked #376 on the 2024 Fortune 500 list of the largest American corporations. We moved up 38 spots from last year's ranking of 414. The 2024 list marks our 21st year in the Fortune 500, alongside some of the most well-known and successful companies in the country.\nHere to share some insights into our financial performance for the second quarter is Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski. Julie?\n\nJulie Marie Pelkowski\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Erie Insurance Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, continued to experience strong growth in the second quarter of 2024, driven by steady new policy growth and solid retention, as Tim just mentioned. In addition, incremental improvements continues to be realized from our more significant rate increases. These increases have had the most impact when addressing our profitability challenge.\nWith these efforts, the Exchange's direct written premium grew 20% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, with year-to-date growth through June 2024 at that similar 20% level. From a seasonality perspective, we generally see higher weather losses in the first half of the year. We saw this trend holds true as the Exchange's combined ratio was 115.9% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $118.9 million in the second quarter of 2023, with catastrophic weather events contributing 16.2 points and 16.9 points in those same respective periods.\nWorth noting is the more significant improvement in our year-to-date combined ratio of 111.1% in 2024 compared to 120.8% in the first 6 months of 2023.\nIn these first 6 months, catastrophic weather events contributed 12.7 points versus 15.7 points in the same period of 2023. We did experience an improvement in our non-catastrophe loss ratio in the first 6 months of 2024 compared to 2023 of 72.2 points versus 73.8 points, respectively.\nAdditionally, in 2023, higher severity drove adverse development on prior accident years, increasing the combined ratio by 2.9 points. In 2024, moderating severity trends resulted in favorable development on prior accident years, improving the combined ratio by 2 points.\nIn summary, our rate increases are having the desired impact. And with lower weather events and moderating severity in the first half of 2024, we have seen a profitability improvement compared to the same period in 2023.\nOur policyholder surplus dropped slightly from $9.5 billion in March 2024, although we maintained a strong surplus position consistent with our December 2023 level of $9.3 billion as of June 2024.\nShifting to the results for Indemnity. Net income was $164 million or $3.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $118 million or $2.25 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, Indemnity net income was $289 million or $5.52 per diluted share compared to $204 million or $3.90 per diluted share at this time last year.\nOperating income increased in the second quarter nearly 42% to over $190 million compared to the second quarter of 2023, bringing our year-to-date 2024 operating income to $329 million, which was an increase of almost 35% compared to the first half of 2023. The main driver of these increases continues to be higher management fee revenue resulting from the Exchange's significant direct written premium growth.\nManagement fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased 20.1% to nearly $761 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, and nearly 20% to $1.4 billion in the first half of the year compared to this time last year.\nTotal cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $73 million or 14% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The first half of 2024 saw an increase of $154 million or 16% when compared with the first half of 2023. Commission expenses continued to be the largest driver, increasing almost $69 million or roughly 20% compared to the second quarter of 2023, and nearly $136 million or almost 21% in the first half of 2024 compared to the same respective period of 2023, again, related to the substantial growth in the direct written premiums of the Exchange.\nNon-commission expenses for the second quarter grew just over $4 million or 2.4%. This was driven mainly by production costs such as underwriting reports and customer service costs, partially offset by lower information and technology spend compared to the second quarter of 2023. Year-to-date 2024 non-commission expenses increased just over $18 million or almost 6% compared to the first half of 2023. This was driven by underwriting and policy processing expenses as well as administrative and sales and advertising expenses.\nTechnology spend was lower in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023, partially offsetting these increases due to higher capitalized labor in 2024.\nIncome from investments totaled almost $14 million compared to earnings of nearly $12 million in the second quarter of 2023. Net investment income was just over $16 million in the second quarter compared to almost $14 million in the same period last year. Total investment income in the first half of 2024 was $29 million compared to $7 million in the first half of 2023. Net investment income for the first half of 2024 drove most of this improvement, contributing $32 million compared to $16 million last year, mainly due to a loss generated from limited partnerships in 2023 of almost $11 million.\nAdditionally, we generated net realized gains in 2024, while in 2023, we experienced net realized losses.\nAs always, we take a measured approach to capital management, and we maintained a strong balance sheet. And for the first 6 months of 2024, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $118 million in dividends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Julie. Earlier in the call, I talked about our long-standing commitment to being above all on the service. That means treating customers with care and compassion and handling their needs quickly and effectively. It also means giving them the ability to interact with us in the ways they prefer. To do that, we need to equip our agents with the tools, resources and capabilities to ensure customers have a positive experience. Much of the work we've been doing over the first 6 months of 2024 has been focused on just that. We've made several enhancements to our customer and agent-facing platforms, and have made significant progress in our technology modernization journey.\nOne example of an enhancement is the added ability for agents to set up car rentals for policyholders during the first notice of loss process. Now customers don't need to make a separate call to secure a rental, and it streamlines the process for our agents and first notice of loss teams.\nSince rolling out to all states in June, agents have set up nearly 2,000 rentals, and they rated the ease of effort to do so at 9 out of 10. We also continue to modernize our legacy technology platforms, having successfully migrated 4 additional applications to the cloud in the first half of the year. In addition, we recently decommissioned an outdated platform for data disaster recovery and moved to a new environment. This has resulted in notable improvements in replication and recovery times and reduce costs. Much more work is ongoing in our efforts to migrate to more modern platforms, reduce expenses and continuously improve the experience and satisfaction of our customers and agents. At the same time, we're looking at leveraging the emerging technologies and capabilities related to artificial intelligence.\nWe recently established an AI Center of Excellence dedicated to exploring potential AI use cases across the enterprise, targeting implementation where appropriate based on our business and operational strategies. More than 20 use cases are currently being explored, with many more in the queue.\nWe know AI has a lot of potential benefits, particularly in improving efficiencies and reducing expenses, but we are taking a measured approach to ensure we're harnessing the power of AI responsibly and in the best interest of Erie and our stakeholders, and most importantly, to use it in a way that enhances our ability to provide the human touch rather than to replace it.\nInvesting in technology is critical to our future. We also understand that investing in our communities is important. In April, Erie Insurance awarded 24 grants totaling nearly $900,000 for nonprofits to help provide and expand educational programs to school aged children as part of Pennsylvania's Educational Improvement Tax Credit Program. And in June, we announced a $1 million gift to the United Way of Erie County to help launch the organization's community schools model at Erie High School. With this funding from Erie and other community partners, United Way will hire community school directors for Erie High School and provide inside-the-school support that includes health, mental health, vision and dental care, clothing and personal hygiene items and expand the learning and enrichment programs.\nI'm also pleased to share that through our Charity Challenge golf events in Erie and Allentown, Pennsylvania, we've now raised more than $2 million for nonprofits in those communities since 2010. This here's tournaments alone raised nearly $200,000 for 40 charities in the Erie and Allentown areas.\nAs I close our call for the second quarter, I'd like to thank our employees and agents for their tireless dedication to Erie and our commitment to being above all in service. I'm confident in our strength and stability amid continued external pressures, and I'm proud of the massive amount of work that's underway to move us into the future.\nThank you, as always, to our shareholders, for your trust and support, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie's performance for the first quarter of 2024. Last week, on April 20, we marked the 99th anniversary of our company's founding on April 21, and we held our annual medium shareholders in person in the Thomas B. Hagan Building. At that meeting, I reflected on a remarkable journey Erie Insurance has been on for nearly a century. To young men, [ HaledonOc Crawford ], open the doors to the Erie Insurance in 1925 and brought in less than $30,000 in net premiums after the first year.\nToday, Erie's business has grown more than $10 billion in premium and almost 7 million policies in force, covering 12 states plus the District of Columbia with more than 6,500 employees and more than 14,000 independent agents. I'm humbled and proud to be leading the company, and I'm confident in our position in the industry and our financial stability as we enter our 100th year of business.\nI'll share some first quarter updates on our business and workplace in a few minutes. But first, let's look at our financials. In our last call, we reported that weather-related claims were up significantly in 2023, which had a negative impact on our combined ratio. So far this year, we're starting to see a turnaround and our ratio is headed in the right direction.\nI'll now turn it over to Julie to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Julie?\n\nJulie Marie Pelkowski\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In 2023, we talked about our proactive approach to addressing the profitability challenge experienced by the exchange and that the most significant impact would come as a result of the higher rate increases that were taken. We anticipated a larger impact from these rate increases in 2024, given the fact that we have 12-month policies.\nContinued incremental improvement from rate increases, coupled with weather events that were lower in severity compared to the first quarter of last year drove an improvement in profitability in the first quarter of 2024. Our combined ratio in the first quarter was 106% compared to 122.7% in the first quarter of 2023. Other events contributed to 9 points to the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2024 versus 12.6 points in the same period last year.\nThe rate increases continue to contribute to significant growth for the exchange as well. During the first quarter, direct and assumed written premium of the exchange increased 19%. Strong new growth continues with new business premium growing 32.4% compared to the same period last year. Total policies in force grew 7.1%. We also maintained a solid policy retention ratio of 91.2%. The continued strong premium growth along with high retention and a more favorable combined ratio resulted in the policyholder surplus of the exchange growing $180 million in the quarter to $9.5 billion as of March 31, 2024.\nShifting to the results for Indemnity. Net income was $125 million or $2.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2024 and compared to $86 million or $1.65 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Operating income in the first quarter increased over 25% to almost $139 million compared to the first quarter of 2023. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased 19.3% to just over $665 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, in line with the increase in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange.\nThe total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $81 million or 17.3% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The most significant portion of our expenses are commissions, grew $67 million for the first quarter, driven by the increase in direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange.\nNon-commission expenses for the first quarter grew just over $14 million, driven primarily by increased personnel costs and agent-related costs. The significant growth in the exchanges premium drove increases in our production support cost as well, such as underwriting and policy processing.\nTechnology investments continue, although overall technology costs were lower as more development costs were capitalized in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nIncome from investments totaled $15 million compared to a loss of nearly $5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Net investment income was nearly $16 million in the first quarter compared to just $2 million in the same period of last year due to increased limited partnership earnings and higher bond income.\nAs always, we take a measured approach to capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first 3 months of 2024, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $59 million in dividends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Julie. As I've mentioned in previous calls, migrating our legacy technology platforms has been a top priority for us and it continues to be in 2024. I'm pleased to share that we successfully modernized more than 1/3 of the legacy applications we've had in place, and we're also working to sunset those older systems as appropriate. This work is tied directly to another key priority, expense management. Upgrades and newer platforms can eliminate many of the inefficiencies and beliefs created by the older systems.\nOne example of a process that's recently been tightened thanks to modernization is with the [ desperate new method ] of inspection for claims. Best review process often resulted in long cycle times for customers, agents and employees due to a lack of data integration, causing delays or opening estimates. Now agents and customers can use the photo appraisal role and list an established direct repair program or DRP shops within our online account to determine the appropriate method of inspection during their auto claims. This results in faster claims times, often cutting days out of the process.\nThe pace of change is a topic that both challenges and energizes us, whether we're talking about platforms, processes, products or on people. If you regularly tune into our earnings calls, you may recall that last year, we announced a new approach, we'd be taking to our hybrid workforce starting in 2024. Hybrid employees who make up roughly 60% of our workforce now have a bank of 52 remote workdays to use each year when they choose. Since beginning this new approach in January, we're pleased with how it's helping to create greater vibrancy in our offices and collaboration across teams.\nWe continue to learn and make changes to further improve the in-office experience for employees, including new conference room technology and facility improvements and to support our sustainability efforts, we're installing energy costs across our home office campus to track and share the performance of each building, including electricity, natural gas and water consumption. Employees will be able to see how Erie compares to other commercial buildings with similar usage and size, helping us stay accountable for our energy use and keeping in top of mind for our workforce.\nSustainability is one aspect of our commitment to being a good corporate citizen. We also continue to invest in the communities where we do business, helping us to build trust and relationships and reinforce our commitment to service. Recently, we announced 24 grants totaling close to $1 million for education-focused nonprofits as part of Pennsylvania's education improvement tax credit program. The ramp will help nonprofits offer and expand educational programs to prekindergarten to 12th-grade students, in particular, low income underserved and minority students in Northwest Pennsylvania. Paris donated more than $11 million through the EITC program since it began in 2001.\nAnd in support of revitalization work underway in our hometown in Panera, Pennsylvania, Erie insurance recently provided a $1 million loan with plans to provide an additional support in the future for a project that will transform from Erie's tallest building, the Renaissance Center at Penton State. Funds will help with plans to renovate this downtown landmark into an upscale hotel with space for restaurants, offices and public gatherings.\nThis is an exciting project for Erie and complements the other work and investments underway downtown that we've also supported. It's all aimed at creating a vibrant community to work and live so we can continue to attract and retain diverse and high-quality talent that will position us for success in our next century.\nI feel a great sense of pride for where we are today. We're poised to move into our next century with a strong employee and agency force and impressive book of business and robust and contemporary technology platforms and prepared to weather continued challenges through thoughtful and proactive planning and we're devoted to keeping our long-standing principles live in ways that will continue to set us apart in the future.\nAs always, I'd like to thank you for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie."

This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now I'd like to introduce your host for the call, Vice President of Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz.\n\nScott W. Beilharz\n\nVP of Capital Management & IR, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our fourth quarter and year-end results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Pelkowski, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.\nFor information on important factors that may cause such differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-K filing with the SEC filed yesterday and in the related press release.

It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company.\nWith that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie's fourth quarter and year-end results for 2023. We're proudly moving closer to celebrating a century of service, and we're doing so as a company with $10 billion in premium, a milestone reached in the fourth quarter of 2023. This came in a year of both record-setting growth and significant challenges.\nWe saw net income for Erie Indemnity Company reaching an all-time high of more than $446 million, and growth for Erie Insurance Exchange hit a 20-year high of 17%, helping us hit that $10 billion mark and moving us towards 7 million policies in force.\nWith all that said, we've certainly been feeling the negative effects of the economic and environmental pressures that continue to impact our industry. Weather-related claims rose to nearly 70,000 in 2023 compared to roughly 50,000 in 2022. Even with the typical decline in weather-related claims in the second half of the year and overall claims severity leveling out, we ended the year with a combined ratio of 119.1%, 3 points higher than year-end 2022. We've responded to the tough market conditions through rate increases, and we're also reinforcing our focus on underwriting standards and partnering with our independent agents on individualized profitability action plans where appropriate.\nThis multipronged approach is aimed at improving the combined ratio over time. In addition, we've placed a greater emphasis on managing expenses across the enterprise and expect to see long-term savings through our work to modernize legacy technology platforms and to introduce new digital capabilities.\nI'll share an update on recent progress with those modernization efforts in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to introduce Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski who will provide a deeper review of our financials. Julie?\n\nJulie Marie Pelkowski\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Throughout 2023, we've discussed how weather events and severity were the primary drivers of the profitability challenge for the exchange. As Tim mentioned, we've taken action on several fronts aimed at improving profitability. We are starting to see the benefits of the more significant rate increases taken recently with more to come.\nAs a reminder, our policy span 12 months, unlike most of our competitors, so it takes longer to realize the benefits. We haven't yet seen a slowdown in new business growth and our retention levels remained strong at 91.2% despite these rate increases.\nPolicyholder surplus ended at $9.3 billion at December 2023. While this was lower than where we started the year, we did see a positive turn in the fourth quarter with surplus increasing $203 million. Again, the combined ratio for the year ended at 119.1%, which was an improvement from September year-to-date given the fourth quarter experienced a lower level of weather events and more moderate severity growth.\nTurning to the results for indemnity. Net income was almost $111 million or $2.12 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $65.5 million or $1.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. 2023 total year net income was just over $446 million or $8.53 per diluted share compared to $299 million or $5.71 per diluted share in 2022.\nOperating income in the fourth quarter increased nearly $46 million or 56.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the total year, indemnity experienced an increase in operating income of $144 million or 38.3% compared to 2022. Both periods saw revenue growth outpace expense growth.\nFrom a revenue perspective, management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased over $98 million or 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and over $354 million or 17% for the total year compared to 2022. These increases in both the fourth quarter and total year were in line with the respective increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange. Main driver of the premium increase was that the exchange was continuing to experience substantial growth in new business premium, which grew over 43% in the fourth quarter and almost 38% for the year compared to the same respective prior year periods.\nFrom an expense perspective, the total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased just over $54 million or 12.2% for the fourth quarter and almost $216 million or 12% for the total year 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. Our most significant cost of operations are commission expenses, grew $53 million for the fourth quarter, while the total year commission expenses increased $169 million.\nThe higher commissions in both periods were driven by the increase in direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange. Noncommission expenses for the fourth quarter grew $1 million, while the total year noncommission expenses grew $47 million. The fourth quarter increase was driven by additional investments in both technology of $3 million and customer service of nearly $1 million, offset by lower sales and advertising costs of over $2 million.\nTim will provide greater detail on our technology and customer service deliveries in a couple of minutes. The increase in total year noncommission expenses was due to additional investments in technology of almost $19 million and higher administrative and other expenses of $20 million driven by higher personnel costs.\nSo the growth in number of policies led to an increase in underwriting and policy processing costs of $9.4 million. Our investments generated almost $10 million in pretax income in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nFor the total year 2023, pretax income from investments was $29 million compared to $600,000 for 2022. Finally, in 2023, we paid our shareholders $222 million in dividends. Also, in December of last year, our board approved a 7.1% increase in the 2024 regular quarterly cash dividend for both our Class A and Class B shares. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Julie. The rapid pace of technology and changing consumer behaviors have heightened a sense of urgency to modernize our platforms and introduce new digital capabilities. As I mentioned earlier, we know it's important to long-term expense savings, and it's critical to our ability to offer innovative and customer-centric products and services. That's why we made modernization one of our top priorities in 2023.\nA notable example of progress is the migration of several legacy platforms to the cloud, a technology infrastructure that is more stable, secure and efficient. Largest cloud conversion to date was our Erie Claims Center platform, which is now seeing a 75% reduction in system outage time and significantly reduced costs.\nIn our third quarter call, I shared that we launched a pilot for refreshed workers' compensation platform starting in Indiana. Since that time, our teams have successfully rolled out the platform in every state in our footprint, the refresh introduces full policy servicing capabilities, online account for commercial customers and a new billing platform that allows customers the ability to manage their automatic payments.\nOther significant progress was made in the enhancement to our claim status portal, a valuable tool that puts important claims information at the fingertips of agents and customers. In 2023, more than 75 different enhancements were made to the platform to improve the user interface and to make the information provided by the tool more robust.\nNearly 100% of auto claims handlers and more than 70% of the property claims handlers are using the tool to share important updates with agents and customers, helping claims can handle faster and more efficiently.\nThese modernization efforts are continuing in 2024 and beyond, and we're embracing agile ways of working to help us work faster, improve our speed to market and deliver the capabilities demanded by today's marketplace, that spirit of innovation is also behind the investments we're making through Erie's strategic ventures.\nThis venture capital arm of Erie Indemnity Company formed in 2022, focuses on investing in the personal and commercial insurance value chain. And recently, we announced 3 initial start-up investments. Wagmo, which offers tech-enabled pet wellness and insurance. Roots Automation, which leverages artificial intelligence to automate manual and time-consuming insurance processes and Trust & Will an online estate planning platform.\nThese initial investments are adjacencies that have the potential to deliver value to Erie, our agents and policyholders. In addition to capital, the start-up companies also benefit from Erie's industry expertise. We look forward to continuing to build our portfolio to support more visionary entrepreneurs and help bring innovative products and services to the market.\nAs I mentioned earlier in the call, weather claims have been up and significantly over the prior year, which makes accolades like those we recently received from J.D. Power even more meaningful. In December, J.D. Power ranked Erie, the best in home insurance customer satisfaction coming in, #1 for both homeowners and rental insurance. Erie's score of 856 on J.D. Power's 1000-point scale, was 37 points higher than the Homeowners Insurance segment average for 2023. And both our ranking and score improved during a year when the study cited overall homeowner satisfaction is flat compared to the previous year.\nThis recognition comes on the heels of two other first place rankings from J.D. Power in 2023, one for property claims experience and another for independent agent satisfaction in personal lines. I'd like to express my gratitude to our agents and frontline employees from claims, first notice of loss and customer care operations continuing to be above all in service, even in and especially in these demanding times.\nThank you all for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie."

Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into our financial results for the third quarter, I'd like to share some details around the recent announcement we made related to our approach to hybrid work. We began to return to on-site work last year, we acknowledge we would need to learn and adapt. We knew we'd likely evolve as we experiment with new ways of working following the pandemic. Now, after more than a year of working on a variety of hybrid arrangements, we've learned we need a more consistent approach to how and where we work. We believe it's important to increase the opportunities for employees to work together in person to collaborate and learn from one another.\nThis helps us build stronger bonds with our colleagues and ultimately, stronger teams. We also know that in-person interaction is important to our business. For building the relationships vital to our business model and for upholding our service promise to customers and agents. At the same time, we recognize employees have come to value the flexibility hybrid arrangements offer. With all that considered, we landed on a balanced and innovative approach. It increases opportunities for in-person interactions while giving employees more choice over when they work remotely.\nStarting in January, employees and hybrid roles will be given in a lot in the 52 days to work remotely each year. Employees will work on site in our offices on days that they are not using in a lot of remote day. This revised approach will help preserve distinct relationship aspects of our business and the vibrant Erie workplaces that support our collaboration, creativity and success.\nAnd now let's turn to our financial performance for the third quarter of 2023. With respect to the Erie Insurance Exchange, inflation and weather-related events continue to adversely impact our combined ratio. Our year-to-date net combined ratio climbed from 120.8% through the first 2 quarters to 121.9% by the end of September. Positive investment income was not enough to offset underwriting losses resulting in a surplus decline of 6% since the second quarter.\nHowever, we remain very strong financially with an overall surplus position of $9.1 billion. Like many other carriers, we've been taking rate increases to improve our profitability. These increases, along with an upsurge in customer shopping in response to rising industry rates have contributed to the 20-year high for growth in our direct written premium. That growth, which is over 16% year-to-date, is previously supported by strong retention of 91% for personal and commercial lines combined. With that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Julie Pelkowski, for a more detailed review of our financials.\n\nJulie Marie Pelkowski\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, the third quarter was similar to the first 2 quarters of this year. We are still being impacted by weather-related events across our footprint, and we continue to experience an elevated combined ratio due to inflationary pressures. That said, I am pleased to share that during the third quarter, the A.M. Best rating agency once again affirmed our A+ Superior rating for financial strength.\nNow let me get into the details at hand for the quarter. As I noted, weather challenges continued in the third quarter, somewhat unexpectedly. Typically, storm activity diminishes in the second half of the year, but our footprint experienced two significant wind events in the early part of the third quarter. Catastrophe losses in the quarter also increased due to adverse loss development associated with prior storms occurring earlier this year. Non-catastrophe property claim severity continued to grow in both personal and commercial lines albeit at a more moderate rate than 2022.\nPersonal auto severity increases of 6% in 2023 are about half the level they were in 2022, while commercial auto and homeowner severity increase remain about 10%. To combat the increase in the combined ratio, we continue to take rate increases tightened underwriting guidelines and implement strategic agency management practices. Keep in mind that our policies span 12 months, and we will see a much more significant benefit next year from those increases as they are realized. Even with these rate increases, we are still maintaining high levels of retention, which is complementing our new business growth. For the year, we've increased new business premium more than 36% and total premium more than 16%.\nWith respect to the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the third quarter was 17.6%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which grew almost 40% over the prior year. With a net combined ratio for the quarter of 124%, the Exchange's policyholder surplus decreased to $9.1 billion, down nearly $1 billion from December 31.\nNow shifting to Indemnity. In the third quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $131 million or $2.51 per diluted share compared to $84 million or $1.61 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2022. For the first 9 months of 2023, net income was $335 million or $6.41 per diluted share, compared to $233 million or $4.46 per diluted share for the same period in 2022. Operating income increased 39% or $42 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the third quarter of 2022. Indemnity also saw an increase in operating income of 33% or $98 million for the first 9 months of this year, compared to the first 9 months of 2022.\nIndemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $97 million or 17.7% in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the third quarter of 2022. For the first 9 months of 2023, Indemnity saw an increase of $256 million or 16.2% compared to the same period of 2022. The Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $1.5 million in the third quarter and $3.5 million in the first 9 months of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022.\nTurning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services, commissions increased $45 million in the third quarter and $116 million in the first 9 months of 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases in agent compensation in both periods were driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation. Non-commission expenses increased nearly $13 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to 2022 and underwriting and policy processing expenses increased almost $3 million, primarily related to increased underwriting report costs. Information technology costs increased by almost $1 million, driven by increased professional fees. Also, administrative and other expenses increased just under $10 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, driven by increases in personnel costs and professional fees.\nFor the first 9 months of 2023, Indemnity saw an increase in non-commission expenses of nearly $48 million. Expenses were primarily driven by increases in technology investments of almost $16 million, including professional fees, hardware, software and personnel costs. Underwriting and policy processing expenses increased just over $9 million due to increased reporting, personnel and postage costs. Administrative and other costs increased over $20 million due to an increase in personnel costs.\nOverall, personnel costs were impacted by increased compensation, including higher estimated costs for incentive plan awards. This was partially offset by lower pension costs compared to 2022, due to an increase in the discount rate. The increases in incentive plan costs were driven by improved, direct written premiums and policies in force growth and a higher company stock price at September 30, 2023, compared to September 30, 2022. Investment income before taxes totaled just over $12 million in the third quarter compared to a loss from investments before taxes of nearly $1 million in the same period of 2022.\nFor the first 9 months of 2023, we recorded investment income before taxes of $19.2 million compared to $300,000 in the first 9 months of 2022. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. For the first 9 months of 2023, our financial performance enabled us to pay our shareholders over $166 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Julie. As we head into the last part of the year, we continue to make progress in our journey to modernize our legacy platforms and enhance our digital capabilities. In September, we launched a pilot for our refreshed workers' compensation platform. The refresh introduces full policy servicing capabilities on our float application and service platform, the introduction of online accounts for our commercial customers and a new billing platform that allows customers to manage their account.\nThe enhanced platform is being piloted in Indiana, who plans to roll it out in additional states before the end of this year. We're also seeing positive impacts of some of the digital enhancements made earlier in the year. Our agents ask for more capabilities to connect with customers through our online account platform. Now, thanks to updates made to our claims staff as a portal earlier in the year, customers and agents have important claim status information at their fingertips along with many other options, including online auto ID cards and paperless invoicing. In our third quarter, we've seen customer engagement and claim status grew by 8% compared to last year at this time. We believe this consistent growth will continue into 2024.\nBefore we close, I'd like to make note of several recent accolades for our business and our workplace. [indiscernible] has recognized Erie, on its 2024 list of America's best insurance companies. Of the 84 companies on the list, Erie was 1 of only 5 to make a rankings in all 5 categories. Erie was ranked first in permanent life, 5th in Term Life, 6th in auto, 7th in renters and 8th in homeowners. Erie was also recently named to Newsweek's list of America's Best Customer Service 2024, in the categories of homeowners and life insurance. These rankings were based on customers' likelihood to recommend, as well as criteria like customer focus, quality of communication, professional competence, range of services and accessibility.\nInvestor's Business Daily has listed in Erie on its 2023 most trusted financial companies list. The list is based on a survey that asks consumers to rate their financial service providers on attributes they said are most important to them. Erie ranked #2 in both auto and home insurance and 13th overall. On the workplace side, 3 of our employee affinity networks earned 2023 Diversity impact awards from the Global Employee Resource Group network. This is the world's largest network of employee resource groups, business resource groups and diversity councils dedicated to making measurable progress on diversity, equity and inclusion. Fred Johnson, Vice President of the Wisconsin branch and executive sponsor of Erie's African-American affinity network was also one of six recipients of the network's Diversity impact Executive Sponsor of the award for a third straight year.\nFinally, our future focus internship program has been named to the rising insurance Star executive list of the industry's 50 best internship programs for the third consecutive year. The future focus program has helped launch the careers with hundreds of current Erie employees who started these interns and it continues to serve as an important talent pipeline. This past summer, more than 100 interns from 50 different colleges and universities worked in departments across the company.\nAs always, thank you again for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of Erie Indemnity Company. With that, we move on to Tim's remarks. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie's performance for the second quarter of 2023. The executive team and I have spent a lot of time over the past few months connecting with our various stakeholders, with agents at our annual branch meetings across our footprint and at our combined agency task force meeting here in Erie, with employees at our open door, leader forum and claims recognition meetings and with investors at our annual meeting with shareholders held in April.\nA frequent topic of discussion at these recent gatherings has been the challenges the industry continues to face. Inflation, supply chain issues and an increase in severe weather are among the most pressing, and we're certainly feeling the effects of them so far in 2023. That's reflected in our combined ratio, which now stands at 120.8% compared to 113.7% for the first half of 2022. Both personal and commercial lines continue to experience an increase in severity for property, auto and uninsured and underinsured motorist claims, although costs are growing at a more moderate pace than the prior year. Year-to-date, personal auto claims severity is up 6% compared to last year and 21% since 2021.\nWeather and catastrophe losses are also on the rise. Hail, wind and tornadoes have been battering areas across our footprint in the first half of the year. Through June of 2023, catastrophe event claim counts were up nearly 70% compared to 2022, and catastrophe claims contributed 16% of the combined ratio at the end of the second quarter compared to 10% in 2022. While many of the external factors impacting the combined ratio are out of our control, we're taking actions within our control to bring it down to more favorable levels. Chief Financial Officer Julie Pelkowski will be talking more about some of those strategies in just a few minutes.\nAnd despite the factors impacting our combined ratio, our overall performance picture is strong, especially in our growth and retention numbers. Overall, policies in force are up 5.2% with personal lines reaching its highest growth in 20 years at 5.5%. Retention is also strong at 90.8% for personal and commercial lines combined, with retention for personal auto, which stands at 92.3%, approaching an all-time high. This impressive growth and the loyalty demonstrated by our policyholders is a testament to the strong value proposition we offer.\nOur recent ranking on the Fortune 500 list for the 20th consecutive year, this year at #414 is yet another. All said, we are confident in our overall financial stability as we continue to navigate the challenges of today's world. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Julie Pelkowski to offer a closer look at our financials. This is Julie's first earnings call since taking the reins as Erie's Chief Financial Officer in May. Welcome, Julie.\n\nJulie Marie Pelkowski\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Over the course of my 25-year career with Erie, I have had the pleasure of working across several different disciplines that have prepared me for the role of CFO, and I'm delighted to be with you this morning to share our second quarter results.\nAs Tim mentioned, our business experienced an unusually early and severe start to the storm season, and we continue to feel the pressure of the inflationary conditions that are contributing to higher loss severities. These 2 factors are the primary drivers of the increase in our combined ratio in the Exchange. While we are prioritizing efforts to improve the Exchange's profitability, the Exchange generated substantial growth in the second quarter of 2023. This quarter marks the first time in our history that we've written over $1 billion of direct written premium in a single quarter.\nThis strong production growth drove the increase in the amount of management fee revenue for the indemnity company, which you'll see as we review our second quarter 2023 results. Starting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, direct written premium growth for the second quarter was 16.3%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which climbed almost 32.6% over the prior year. With a combined ratio for the quarter of 118.9%, the Exchange's policyholder surplus decreased to $9.7 billion, down $400 million from December 31.\nThe primary focus of our strategy to address the elevated combined ratio is taking rate increases to more appropriately match the level of losses we're experiencing in the current environment. This has resulted in us taking double-digit rate increases and also evaluating our rating needs more frequently. Of course, we monitor our competitive position and the rate increases we are taking are in line with the industry. We also stay focused on our underwriting and agency management discipline and have identified certain initiatives targeted towards improving profitability. These strategies, along with several others, will allow us to continue driving down our overall combined ratio.\nNow shifting to Indemnity. In the second quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $118 million or $2.25 per diluted share compared to $80 million or $1.53 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2022. For the first half of 2023, net income was $204 million or $3.90 per diluted share, an increase compared to the first half of 2022 net income of $149 million or $2.84 per diluted share. Operating income increased 29% or $30 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022.\nIndemnity also saw an increase in operating income of 29.9% or $56 million for the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $89 million or 16.3% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022. For the first 6 months of 2023, Indemnity saw an increase of $159 million or 15.4% compared to the first half of 2022. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased just over $1 million in the second quarter and $2 million in the first 6 months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.\nTurning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $44 million in the second quarter and $71 million in the first half of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. The increases in agent compensation in both periods were driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation.\nNoncommission expenses increased $16.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $3.7 million, primarily related to the increased production growth. Information technology costs increased by $3.3 million, driven by increased personnel costs and professional fees. Also, administrative and other expenses increased $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven by increases in personnel costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.\nFor the first 6 months of 2023, Indemnity saw an increase in noncommission expenses of $33 million, primarily driven by increases in technology costs of $14.8 million and administrative and other costs of $10.6 million. The increased technology costs were driven by higher professional fees, personnel costs and hardware and software costs. Administrative and other costs increased $10.6 million, primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. Overall, personnel costs were impacted by increased compensation, including higher estimated costs for incentive plan awards, partially offset by lower pension costs compared to 2022.\nInvestment income before taxes totaled $12 million in the second quarter compared to a loss from investments before taxes of $2 million in the same period of 2022. For the first 6 months of 2023, we recorded investment income before taxes of $7 million compared to $1 million in the first 6 months of 2022. While we recognized limited partnership losses in the first 6 months of 2023, these losses were offset by both higher bond net investment income and lower realized and unrealized losses on equity securities, which drove the improvement over the same period of 2022.\nI will remind you that the limited partnership asset class is in runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management and we maintain a strong balance sheet. For the first 6 months of 2023, our financial performance enabled us to pay our shareholders over $110.8 million in dividends. Thank you again for your time today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Julie. Another major topic of discussion recently has been our focus on modernization. As I've mentioned in previous calls, transitioning out of legacy platforms and investing in greater digital capabilities are among our highest priorities in 2023. Recent updates to our claim status platform provide more robust claims information to agents, employees and customers on a more intuitive platform.\nAnd another claims platform, Erie Claim Center was recently migrated to the cloud. This was our largest migration to date with several more planned as part of Erie's overall cloud transformation initiative. We expect these innovative efforts to increase speed and productivity across the enterprise.\nAnother key modernization effort is tied to our upcoming refresh of workers' compensation, which will introduce full policy servicing capabilities on our quote application and service platform, a new billing platform that allows for enhanced pay-as-you-go functionality, and the introduction of online accounts for our commercial customers. We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app and online account platform. Most recently, we introduced self-service functionality for roadside assistance with a mobile app through Agero.\nSeveral other modernization efforts are also underway, all aimed at helping us to increase efficiency, reduce expenses and to better serve our customers and agents. You can expect to hear more updates on this work in future earnings calls.\nYet another challenge almost all industries have been facing recently has been the tight labor market and the war for talent. We are pleased to share that the challenges in attracting and retaining talent we experienced in 2021 and 2022 have leveled out. In our claims division where we experienced some of the biggest talent challenges, all open positions have been filled, and we've developed an advanced staffing capacity tool that enables us to identify and respond to staffing needs in real time.\nIn this tough labor market, workplace accolades are particularly important, so we're excited to have recently earned a Great Place to Work certification from the Great Place to Work Institute. This recognition is based on the results of an engagement survey sent to all Erie employees in June. Four out of 5 Erie employees completed the survey and 86% of those employees said Erie is a great place to work. This compares to just over half or 57% of employees at typical U.S.-based companies and 91% for the benchmark set by Fortune 100's Best Places to Work.\nWe're proud of our long-standing reputation as an employer who places a great deal of importance on our workforce, culture and treats employees like family. This recognition has as a certified Great Place to Work affirms that commitment. We're also proud to have recently earned a global distinction as one of only 4 U.S.-based insurers named to all 3 of Forbes World's Best Insurance Companies list for 2023. Forbes ranked the best insurance companies in 3 areas: homeowners, auto and life insurance. Erie Insurance ranked #5 in the U.S. for auto, #7 in the U.S. for homeowners and #11 in the U.S. for life.\nWith that, I'd like to thank you all again for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

This call was prerecorded, and there will be no question-and-answer session following the recording. Now I'd like to introduce your host of the call today, Vice President, Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Your line is open.\n\nScott W. Beilharz\n\nVP of Capital Management & IR, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our first quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.\nFor information on important factors may cause such differences, please see the safe harbor statements in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC dated April 27, 2023, and in the related press release. This prerecorded call is property of Erie Indemnity Company. It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior risk consent of Erie Indemnity company.\nWith that, we move on to Tim's remarks. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for your interest in Erie's performance for the first quarter of 2023. Last week on April 20, we marked the 98th anniversary of our company's founding. And a few days later, held our annual meeting with shareholders. For the first time in 3 years, we were able to hold this meeting in person, and we did so just a block from our home office, at the historic Owner Theater in downtown Erie, Pennsylvania.\nEarlier this month, we also welcomed the final groups of employees returning to on-site work. This move marked the end of our pandemic-driven working arrangements, with the COVID-19 public health emergency set to expire in just a few weeks. We look forward to moving fully into a new mode of interaction and engagement as we embrace hybrid work as a model for the majority of our workforce.\nPandemic pushed the breaks on many aspects of how we live and work, while at the same time, accelerating the pace of technology and change. Additional challenges like inflation, supply chain issues, and labor shortages emerge from the pandemic and have persisted even as COVID has slowed. Many of these challenges have had a direct impact on the unusually high combined ratio for Erie Insurance Exchange.\nWe're continuing with a slate of intentional steps to reduce our combined ratio through a measured approach to rate increases, adherence to expense management and strict underwriting guidelines and agency profitability reviews. We're also placing a high priority on modernizing our legacy technology platforms and investing in digital capabilities that meet customer needs and expectations. I'll share more about that notable progress that's been made so far this year. But first, let's turn to our first quarter financials.\nLike the rest of the industry, our combined ratio continues to be impacted negatively by the inflationary environment. That was compounded in the first quarter by an increase in the severity of weather events. Cat losses from the 4 weather events experienced in the first quarter added 4 points to the combined ratio and adverse development from [Technical Difficulty], which relate in 2022 and another 4 points to the first quarter combined ratio [Technical Difficulty] 122.7% compared to 104.6% for the first quarter of 2022.\nTomatoes severe wins and flooding have battered Kentucky and Ohio, in particular, during the first few months of 2023. I'd like to extend my gratitude to our catastrophe claims and first less of loss teams as well as at staff working tirelessly to serve our policyholders affected by these unrelenting stores.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Greg to expand on our first quarter results. Greg?\n\nGregory John Gutting\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Earlier, Tim mentioned that we held our 98th Annual Shareholder Meeting earlier this week. As you know, that meeting was my last serving as Chief Financial Officer, given my retirement effective April 30. Over my 37-year career, I have been afforded many wonderful opportunities and I am thankful for all the relationships I have cultivated during my tenure.\nWith our prior 3 shareholder meetings being held virtually, it was wonderful to have everyone attend the live event in person and get a chance to spend time with our long-term shareholders. As I begin the next chapter in my life, Julie Pelkowski will be taking over as your company's newest CFO.\nJulie has had a distinguished career at Erie, first joining our internal audit department in 1998. In 2016, Julie was named Senior Vice President and Controller, and I look forward to seeing all the great success here will have under her leadership.\nNow I'd like to share with you the first quarter results for 2023. Beginning with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Direct written premium growth for the first quarter was 14.6%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which increased 36% over the prior year.\nWith the combined ratio for the quarter of 122.7%, the Exchange's policyholder surplus decreased to $9.9 billion, down $200 million from December 31. Now shifting to Indemnity. In the first quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $86.2 million or $1.65 per diluted share compared to $68.6 million or $1.31 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2022.\nOperating income increased 31.1% or $26.2 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Indemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $70.1 million or 14.4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $900,000 in the first quarter.\nTurning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $27.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The increases in agent compensation were driven by increases in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange, slightly offset by decreased agent compensation awards.\nNoncommission expense increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 2022. Underwriting and policy processing expenses increased $2.7 million primarily due to increased personnel and underwriting report costs. Information technology costs increased by $11.5 million, driven by increased professional fees, hardware and software costs and personnel costs. Also, administrative and other expenses increased $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, driven by the increased personnel costs related to compensation and building occupancy costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.\nInvestment losses before taxes totaled $5 million in the first quarter. The results were primarily driven by equity and losses of limited partnerships of $10.8 million in the first quarter. I will remind you that the limited partnership asset class is in runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future.\nAs always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first 3 months of 2023, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $55 million in dividends.\nThank you again for your time today. And now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, Greg. As I mentioned earlier, modernizing our legacy platforms and investing in greater digital capabilities are among our highest priorities in 2023. We're making some progress in several areas, but perhaps the most visible our recent updates to our claim status platform. A series of Erie redesigns were introduced last year, all influenced by agent feedback, and pros portfolio teams have been working to develop additional updates launched and merged that provide more robust claims information to agents and customers on a more intuitive platform.\nAs 1 of our agents recently said, the updates to claim status are moving the needle towards becoming a true concierge service for customers. These recent enhancements are just the beginning and 1 example of the investments we're making to further improve the experience of customers and agents.\nIn our last call, I mentioned that our online account platform, which acts as a digital self-service tool for customers is now leading on 1 million households. This is an important milestone because the value of this 1 tool delivers. Online account gives customers the self-service features they want and expect and that allows our customer service team and agents to spend less time peeling questions about topics like billing and more time on meaningful and valuable interactions with customers.\nThe growth of online account also creates opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce waste and expenses. Earlier this month, a paperless option for policy documents was introduced. Now in addition to paperless billing, customers can choose to access policies on demand through the platform. With an average policy document of 15 pages and up to 97% of personal lines policies being eligible for paperless, it's easy to see the potential these capabilities have to reduce our expenses and environmental impact.\nAlso at the heart of these enhancements is our commitment to providing the best possible service to our customers. Our goal is to ensure everyone we serve has a positive experience no matter who they are or how they're engaging with us. These efforts continue to be affirmed through industry accolades on the heels of the first place ranking last fall by J.D. Power for independent agent satisfaction among personal line scale. We were proud to be ranked highest in another important J.D. Power study for customer satisfaction in the 2023 U.S. property claims assessment released in February. Erie scored 38 points higher than the industry average and jumped 30 points over 2022.\nThese accolades are not our only gauge of our success, but they do affirm that we're doing the right thing by our customers and agents. What's also notable about this particular recognition is that it comes at a time when our frontline teams are facing significant talent shortages. I'd like to commend our teams in claims, customer care operations and first 1 of loss for their continued commitment to being above all in service.\nWe were also proud to recently be named to the 2023 Best of the Best lists of insurance industry for the Black EOE Journal in Hispanic Network Magazine. And for more than 10 years in a row, Erie was recognized by the American Heart Association, the National Platinum level workforce well-being award for our commitment to employee health and wellness. These 3 recognitions are an affirmation of our continued efforts to be a great place to work for all.\nBefore we close, I'd like to be the CFO, Greg Gutting, all the best in his upcoming retirement after an impressive 37-year career at Erie. He will certainly be missed by the company as Chief Financial Officer, and will personally be missed by many, including myself, as a valued colleague and friend.\nGreg is leaving us, however, in very capable hands. Julie Pelkowski will assume the CFO role on May 1. And and will join me to share Erie's financial results on our second quarter call. Until then, thank you all again for your interest in Erie."

Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for taking time to learn more about Erie's performance in the fourth quarter of 2022 and our year-end results. As you're all aware, we find ourselves at a time of historic economic challenges. Inflation, supply chain issues and labor shortages to name just a few of the challenges have put substantial pressure on our bottom line, which we'll cover in more detail in a few minutes.\nFortunately, our perseverance through 98 years of stability is helping us adapt to and withstand the current financial climate. Our ability to adapt has also helped us transition to new ways of working over the past year. Throughout 2022, we returned employees and welcome new hires to our offices.\nWe also began resuming the in-person gatherings that have either been canceled or shifted to a virtual format for more than 2 years during the height of the pandemic. It's been a learning experience as we've introduced greater flexibility in how and where people collaborate and connect.\nThe majority of Erie employees are now working in a hybrid format, splitting their time between in-office and remote work. Many of our office spaces are now neighborhoods, a mixture of dedicated and flexible workspaces. And meeting rooms have been equipped with new technology that supports the experience of employees participating in both in person and virtually.\nIt's clear that the world of work has changed significantly over the past 3 years, and the competition for talent continues. That's why gathering employee feedback is critical to making sure we're handling these returns the right way. We'll continue to learn and adapt to these new ways of working to ensure Erie remains an employer of choice in today's tight talent market while maintaining the culture, traditions and relationships that are so important to us and distinctive to our service brand.\nBefore I share some additional updates from the past year, let's turn to our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. As I mentioned earlier, we are feeling the impact of the current economic climate, most notably in the combined ratio for Erie Insurance Exchange which was 116.1% for 2022 compared to 103.9% for 2021.\nWhile we saw claims frequency remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, we continue to see higher-than-usual severity. Auto repair costs are up 19.5% through December. The consumer price index was up 6.5% and more extreme weather events like hurricanes and owner storms are creating higher industry property losses.\nLike the rest of the industry, we've responded to these economic challenges through rate increases, which we're doing with a measured approach along with expense management, adhering to our strict underwriting guidelines and agency profitability reviews. In this continued hard market, we know more customers will shop. While customers may be looking for a more attractive price they also demand a superior value proposition.\nThat's something that Erie offers, and we're pleased to see that reflected in our growth numbers. Our top line growth was strong this past year as premium growth climbed an impressive 9.2% and new business premium increased 14.5%. Overall, policies in force are up 3.6% and our retention rate remains strong at over 90% for personal and commercial lines combined. With that, I'll pass it to Greg for a deeper review of the financials. Greg?\n\nGregory John Gutting\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Tim. As Tim alluded to at the beginning of this discussion, the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage, continues to see unprecedented loss costs related to claim severity driven by inflation. Because of this steep rise in claims cost, we have quickly adapted to become more agile, as in a way that still compels us to perform for our policyholders and agents.\nWe have taken a more diligent approach to underwriting, and we've also taken a deeper look into our policy rate structures. All of these efforts are putting us in a position to deliver improved financial results as we are already seeing top line growth.\nThe Exchange direct written premium growth for the fourth quarter was 12.1%, driven by an increase in the average premium per policy and increased policy retention. For the year, the Exchange saw an increase in direct written premiums of 9.2% compared to 2021. The increase was driven by strong new policy growth of 3.7% and an increase in new direct written premium of 14.5%, combined with increased policy retention.\nTurning to the results for indemnity. Net income was over $65 million or $1.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $55 million or $1.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021. We 2022 total year net income was $299 million or $5.71 per diluted share compared to $298 million or $5.69 per diluted share in 2021. Operating income in the fourth quarter increased nearly $20 million or 31.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.\nFrom a total year perspective, Indemnity experienced an increase in operating income of $58 million or 18.3% compared to 2021. Management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased over $53 million or 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and almost $175 million or 9.1% for the total year compared to 2021.\nThe increases in both the fourth quarter and total year were driven by increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange. The total cost of operations from policy issuance and renewal services increased $35 million for the fourth quarter and over $118 million for the total year 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021.\nCommission expenses for the fourth quarter grew $16 million while the total year commission expense increased $71 million. Similar to the management fees, the increase in both the fourth quarter and total year were driven by an increase in the direct and affiliated assumed written premiums.\nTurning to our noncommission expenses. For the fourth quarter, Indemnity saw an increase of over $19 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter increase was driven by increases in underwriting and policy processing costs, information technology costs, sales and advertising costs and administrative and other costs.\nFor the total year 2022, noncommission expense grew by $47 million compared to 2021. Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $6 million, driven by personnel costs as well as underwriting report costs. Information technology costs grew $13 million due to increased hardware and software costs as well as personnel costs.\nSales and advertising costs increased $7 million due to increased advertising and agent-related costs. And finally, administrative and other expenses increased nearly $23 million driven by personnel costs related to compensation and increased professional fees.\nIndemnity's fourth quarter pretax income from investments totaled $300,000. This represents a decrease of roughly $12 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease was driven by losses in limited partnership investments.\nIndemnity's total year pretax income from investments with just over $600,000, a decrease of $67 million compared to 2021. The large decrease is attributable to losses in our limited partnership portfolio of $10 million recorded in 2022 compared to earnings unlimited partnerships of $32 million recorded in 2021.\nIndemnity also incurred $27 million in realized and unrealized losses in 2022 compared to gains of $5 million recorded in 2021. I will remind you that the limited partnership asset classes and runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future.\nFinally, in 2022, we paid our shareholders dividends in the amount of $207 million. Also in December of last year, our Board approved a 7.2% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend for both Class A and Class B shares for 2023. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, Greg. Technology has not only become vital to how our workforce connects, but it's also an integral part of how we do business. This isn't new to us, but the speed and focus of technology has certainly been heightened over the past 3 years.\nErie's strategy in essence is to modernize our business model with greater digital capabilities while continue our investment in one of our most unique assets: our independent agency force. And because of the pace of technology, we're focused on acceleration and agility to get that strategic work done. This means working faster, working smarter and being nimble. It also means setting objectives and tracking key results to ensure we're hitting goals and time lines, engaging the effectiveness and success of our overall strategy.\nNot only will this allow us to modernize legacy platforms and bring new products and services to market more quickly, but shorter run times for major projects and initiatives will also lead to expense reductions. This accelerated agile approach was used to launch a recent pilot for a new online quoting and agent routing program called [cold flow]. This aims to capture more digital prospects through a more streamlined quoting process, combined with personal interaction with an Erie agent.\nIt brings together the technology to meet customers where they are, with the human touch that differentiates Erie from the competition, which is exactly what our strategy is about. Following the pilot, we expect to expand the program to more agencies throughout 2023.\nWe also continue to invest in our new and enhanced ways to serve our existing customers. Our online account platform, which acts as a digital self-service tool for customers is now used by more than 1 million households, and chat services have become a popular feature of the customer experience. More than 22,000 conversations were handled by digital services team last year, an increase of more than 200% over 2021.\nBased on recent survey data, customers rated the tool an average of 4.7 out of 5. 2 new products launched in 2022 are also showing promising early results. The combined Cyber Suite coverage, which protects businesses against cyber attacks, now covers more than 11,000 ErieSecure Business customers; and Extended Water Coverage, which was piloted in 2 states in early 2022 and roll off to 10 states within our footprint in the second half of the year, has been added to nearly 14,000 policies so far, protecting customers against certain types of water damage.\nAs we've always done, we're developing and refining these new products and services alongside our independent agents. The relationship we have with our agency force is unparalleled. We place a high priority on seeking their input, recognizing their successes and making sure they have the very best products, technology and business processes in place.\nThese efforts were recognized recently when Erie was ranked highest among personal lines insurers in the J.D. Power 2022 U.S. Independent Agent Satisfaction Study released in October. This is the second year in a row the independent property casualty insurance agents have rated Erie highest in satisfaction. Our independent agent distribution model has been a key driver of our success for nearly 100 years, and we will continue to build on that creation of trust and collaboration as we move into our second century.\nBefore we close, I do want to acknowledge some changes to our executive team that have been announced since our last call. As we shared publicly in November, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Greg Gutting, will be retiring at the end of April. Greg is a familiar voice on this call, and he's been an extremely valuable member of our executive team, both for the wise financial perspective and expertise he offers and the institutional gained in his nearly 40-year career in Erie. His partnership will be truly missed.\nJulie Pelkowski will succeed Greg to become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on May 1. Julie currently serves as Senior Vice President of our Enterprise Office. Prior to taking on that leadership role last year, Julie served as Senior Vice President and Controller. She began her career in 1991 with Deloitte & Touche and joined Erie in 1998 as an internal auditor before moving into various leadership roles within our finance division. Julie's years of exceptional leadership have positioned us strongly for the future.\nFinally, we welcome to our executive team, Sean Dugan. Sean was promoted to Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Corporate Services on January 1. Since 2020, Sean has led our Human Resources as Senior Vice President. And prior to that, he held the position of Corporate Human Resources Officer. His 30-year Erie career includes leadership roles, corporate training and development, talent acquisition and community outreach. Sean's expertise in both business and support functions and his deep knowledge of the organization is a tremendous asset to our executive team.\nAs always, I'd like to thank our employees and agents for their dedication to our above all and service commitment, our shareholders for their continued support and trust and all of you, for your continued interest in Erie. Thank you all for listening in today.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

This call was prerecorded, and there will be no questions-and-answer session following the recording.\nNow I'd like to introduce your host of the call today, Vice President, Investor Relations, Scott Beilharz. Your line is open.\n\nScott W. Beilharz\n\nVP of Capital Management & IR, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for this recorded discussion about our third quarter results. This recording will include remarks from Tim NeCastro, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Gutting, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and financial supplement were issued yesterday afternoon after the market closed and are available within the Investor Relations section of our website, erieinsurance.com.\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking remarks that reflect the company's current views about future events. These remarks are based on assumptions subject to known and unexpected risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause results to differ materially from those described in these remarks.

It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of the Erie Indemnity Company.\nWith that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to learn more about Erie's performance in the third quarter of 2022.\nAs we move into the last few months of the year, I'm excited to be doing so with more employees working and collaborating in our offices with many of our long-standing in-person events back in place. Nearly 70% of employees in position who've worked on-site before the pandemic have now returned to our offices, and those returns will continue into next year. Like many other companies, we're taking a hybrid approach, balancing the flexibility our employees have come to value over the past couple of years with the needs of our business and relationship-based culture.\nThe past few months also saw the return of many of the celebrations and gatherings that are so important to us at Erie. Events like our annual branch meetings to recognize our independent agents, service anniversary celebrations to honor our long-tenured employees and summer picnics to connect with colleagues were all resumed after more than 2 years of cancellations and shifts to virtual formats. We are also excited to introduce our inaugural Diversity Summit held in September, a week-long event featuring guest speakers, interactive sessions and live panel discussions all designed to further engage employees and agents in our journey to integrate diversity, equity and inclusion into how we operate.\nThe Diversity Summit was a milestone in a year of significant progress, which included naming the company's first Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Lance Hyde brings more than 16 years of experience in diversity and inclusion practices, including supplier diversity and sustainability initiatives. He served as Director of Global Inclusion and Diversity at Koppers in Pittsburgh. Under the leadership of Lance and our Chief Diversity and Community Development Officer, Chris Marsh, we've moved into a phase of action, accountability and deepening of our commitment to making diversity, equity and inclusion operational at Erie.\nNow let's turn to our third quarter financial results. We're with the rest of our industry and many others in facing continued challenges created by the inflationary environment. The combined ratio of 113.1% for the year reflects both high claims severity to declining repair and replacement costs for auto and property claims and an increase in weather-related losses. Weather event-related claims for the end of September were up 42% over last year and contributed 8.2% to the combined ratio.\nOn the positive side, we continue to also see an upward trend in premium, which grew 9.4% for the quarter and is up 8.4% for the year. Overall policies in force are up 3.3% and our retention rate remains strong and over 90% for personal and commercial lines combined. Along with that, our policyholder surplus stands at almost $10.2 billion, allowing us to maintain our steady-as-we-go approach to pricing and profitability.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Greg for a deeper review of our financials. Greg?\n\nGregory John Gutting\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be a part of the Erie Indemnity Company third quarter earnings call.\n2022 has been difficult. Growing inflation, coupled with unfavorable market conditions, has challenged not only our business but the insurance sector as a whole. Erie is not immune to these factors, but our tried and true business model continues to provide successful results as we face these challenges head on.\nI will begin my review with the results for the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Direct written premium growth for the third quarter was 9.4%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which climbed almost 21% over the prior year. With a combined ratio for the quarter of 111.9% and continued market volatility, the Exchange's policyholder surplus decreased to $10.2 billion, down $400 million (inaudible).\nNow shifting to Indemnity. In the third quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $84 million or $1.61 per diluted share compared to $90 million or $1.72 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2021. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, net income was $233 million or $4.46 per diluted share compared to $243 million or $4.64 per diluted share in the same period in 2021.\nOperating income increased 12% or $11 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. Indemnity also saw an increase in operating income of 15% or $39 million for the first 9 months of 2022 compared to the same period last year.\nIndemnity's management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services increased $47 million or 9.3% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. For the first 3 quarters of 2022, Indemnity saw an increase of $121 million or 8.3% compared to the same period in 2021. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services increased $200,000 in the third quarter but decreased $500,000 in the 3 quarters of 2022 compared to the same period last year.\nTurning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $22 million in the third quarter and $56 million in the first 3 quarters of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. The increases in agent compensation in both periods was driven by increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation.\nNoncommission expense increased $14 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. Underwriting and policy processing expense increased $3 million, primarily due to increased postage and underwriting report costs. Information technology costs increased $4 million driven by increased professional fees and hardware and software costs, partially offset by decreased personnel costs. Also, administrative and other expenses increased $6 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, driven by increased personnel costs related to compensation and increased professional fees.\nFor the first 9 months of 2022, Indemnity saw an increase in noncommission expenses of $28 million, driven by increases in underwriting and policy processing costs of $3 million, information technology costs of $8 million, sales and advertising costs of $3 million and administrative and other costs of $15 million compared to the same period in 2021.\nInvestment losses before taxes totaled $1 million in the third quarter, and income from investments before taxes totaled $300,000 year-to-date 2022. The results were primarily driven by equity and losses of limited partnerships of $5 million and $2 million in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022 compared to limited partnership earnings of $12 million in the third quarter and $27 million for the first 9 months of 2021. I will remind you that limited partnership asset class is in runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future.\nInvestment income was also negatively impacted by realized and unrealized losses of $24 million for the first 9 months of 2022 compared to gains of $5 million for the same period last year. As always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management and we maintain a strong balance sheet, and for the first 9 months of 2022, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $155 million in dividends.\nThank you again for your time today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Greg. At Erie, we've always had a strong culture of innovation, one that goes back nearly 100 years. Erie Insurance began from a prospectus written on a 10-cent tablet. And our founders, H.O. Hirt and OG. Crawford, hit the street to raise more than $30,000 over 3 months from 90 different investors. That forward-looking spirit endures. Today, it's represented by a slate of efforts aimed at generating new revenue opportunities in a dynamic marketplace.\nIn recent years, we've invested in promising businesses through both opportunities on funding in Erie Pittsburgh and Baltimore and in early-stage tech companies through our next-level innovation efforts. And in August, we announced the launch of an exciting new investment fund, Erie Strategic Ventures, as our new corporate venture capital investment arm. The focus of the fund will be on businesses tied to the personal and commercial insurance value chain as well as natural adjacencies. This could include companies that are innovating in areas like risk avoidance, claims or digital sales.\nThe goal is to make [investments that] will enhance Erie's existing value proposition, support our independent agents and allow Erie to explore new growth opportunities that complement our business model.\nWe're partnering with Touchdown Ventures, an experienced corporate venture capital firm, to strategize and manage these investments. We're looking forward to building on our innovation efforts with the launch of this venture fund and to do so in a way that aligns with our values and our dedication to service.\nBefore we close, I'd like to make note of a few third-party recognitions. Two of those recognitions came from Forbes. Erie was named to its list of America's Best-in-State Employers for 2022 and America's Best Insurance Companies for 2023. The Best-in-State Employers list is based on recommendations from employees who are asked to rate their willingness to recommend their employers to friends and family. Erie is ranked among the top 25 employers in Pennsylvania on that list. The Best Insurance Companies list recognized Erie as an industry leader in 5 product categories: auto, homeowners, renters, term life and permanent life.\nAnd for the second consecutive year, Erie's Future Focus internship program was named to the Rising Insurance Star Executive list of the insurance industry's 50 best internship programs in 2022. The Future Focus program is one of our largest pipelines for early career talent and growing diversity within our talent pool. Erie hosted more than 100 interns in 2022, the largest class [in the program's] 20-year history. As we continue to face a competitive labor market, programs like this one are critical to our talent strategy to maintain and build a robust and diverse workforce at Erie.\nAs always, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees and agents for their commitment to being above all in service and to our shareholders for their continued support and trust. Thank you all for listening in today and for your interest and investment at Erie.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

It may not be reproduced or rebroadcast by any other party without the prior written consent of the Erie Indemnity Company.\nWith that, we will move on to Tim's remarks. Tim?\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Scott, and thanks to all of you for listening in today.\nIt's hard to believe we're already halfway through 2022. First half of the year was a time of transition and new beginnings. Back in April, we began bringing a small number of employees back to our home office. These employees volunteered to be the first to work on our new Thomas B. Hagen building, and they've been pioneers in helping us shape the employee experience as we move into a new era of work.\nThat new era began in July, as we started bringing 200 more employees back to work on site each week, a process we expect to continue for several more months. As we do this, we're finding a balance between flexibility, productivity and connectedness. Wherever possible, employees are working on hybrid schedule, with some days in the office and others remote. This allows employees to have the face-to-face interactions that are a key part of building strong relationships, while still giving them the flexibility they have come to value from working virtually.\nIt's also the core of our business strategy, combining the human touch with an enhanced digital experience. With that said, we know many employees prefer the convenience of fully remote work. And without a doubt, the pandemic has only heightened the competition for talent and work opportunities.\nSo while hybrid remains our preferred model, we're also taking initial steps to expand remote opportunities in target areas and job families facing challenges in recruiting and retention. We believe this move will ultimately help to alleviate some of our talent challenges, with minimal impact to our relationship-based culture. Talent is just one of the many challenges we and so many other companies are facing.\nThe property and casualty insurance industry has been particularly affected by inflation. According to the Insurance Information Institute, replacement costs associated with homeowners and auto insurance, which are our largest lines, are up more than 10% over last year. We too are experiencing higher vehicle and building repair costs, sometimes exacerbated by longer times for repair. Disruptions in the supply chain for things like vehicle sensors are root cause of this. These inflationary cost increases are leading to higher claim severity than we contemplated in our pricing, driving a higher-than-expected combined ratio, which stands at 113.7 for the first half of 2022.\nAcross the insurance sector, everyone is feeling the pinch. Where Erie differs however is in how we leverage the strength of our financial stability, thanks to our policyholder surplus, which stands at $10.6 billion. The other good news is in the strong premium growth we're seeing, which was 8.6% for the quarter. Overall, policies in force grew by 3.1% and our retention rate is also outstanding at 90.3% for personal and commercial lines combined.\nI'll now turn it over to Greg Gutting for a deeper review of our financials. Greg?\n\nGregory John Gutting\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking time today to be a part of the Erie Indemnity Company second quarter earnings call.\nAs you will see in the results I share with you today and as Tim mentioned earlier, Erie has not been immune to the inflationary conditions of our economy, which have had the most impact on the settling of auto and property claims. The second quarter of 2022 was impacted not only by the stormy weather experienced in June, but also by the increased severity in our auto and property claims.\nWith that, I'd like to jump into our results for the second quarter.\nStarting with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Direct written premium growth for the second quarter was 8.6%, driven by substantial growth in new business premium, which climbed 10.7% over the prior year. The increased loss severity driven by inflation, combined with storm losses, generated a combined ratio for the quarter of 122.4%. This, combined with the down financial markets, resulted in a $900 million decrease in the Exchange's surplus for the quarter. Despite these results, the Exchange recorded surplus of $10.6 million at June 30 and continues to maintain a very strong balance sheet.\nTurning our attention to Indemnity. In the second quarter, Indemnity generated net income of $80 million or $1.53 per diluted share compared to $79 million or $1.51 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. For the first half of 2022, net income was $149 million or $2.84 per diluted share, down slightly from the $153 million or $2.92 per diluted share recorded in the first half of 2021.\nOperating income increased 22.3% or $19 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. Indemnity also saw an increase in operating income of 16.8% or $27 million for the first 6 months of this year compared to the first 6 months of last year.\nIndemnity's management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $42 million or 8.4% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021, while for the first 6 months of 2022, Indemnity saw an increase of $75 million or 7.8% compared to the first half of 2021. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services decreased $200,000 in the second quarter and $700,000 in the first half of 2022 compared to the same periods last year.\nTurning to Indemnity's cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased $14 million in the second quarter and $34 million for the first 6 months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increases in agent compensation in both periods were driven by increases in the direct and assumed written premiums of the Exchange, partially offset by a decrease in agent incentive compensation.\nNon-commission expense increased $9 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. Information technology costs increased by $5 million, driven by increased hardware and software costs as well as increased professional fees. Also, administrative and other expenses increased over $5 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, driven by increased professional fees and increased personnel costs related to compensation.\nFor the first 6 months of 2022, Indemnity saw an increase in non-commission expense of $14 million, driven by increases in technology costs of $4 million and administrative and other costs of $9 million. These increased costs were primarily driven by increases in hardware and software costs as well as professional fees compared to the same period in 2021.\nInvestment losses before taxes totaled $2 million in the second quarter. And income from investments before taxes totaled $1 million in the first 6 months of 2022, down significantly from the same periods in 2021. This was driven by lower limited partnership earnings and realized and unrealized losses recorded in 2022.\nWe recorded limited partnership earnings of $2.5 million in the first 6 months of 2022 compared to earnings of over $15 million in the same period in 2021. I will remind you that limited partnership asset classes and runoff, and we continue to expect more limited and inconsistent earnings from this asset class in the future. Also, with market conditions down substantially in 2022, we incurred realized and unrealized losses of nearly $18 million in the first half of this year compared to gains of almost $4 million in 2021.\nAs always, we take a very measured approach to our capital management, and we maintain a strong balance sheet. And for the first 6 months of 2022, our financial performance has enabled us to pay our shareholders over $103 million in dividends.\nThank you again for your time today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim.\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Greg.\nI mentioned earlier in the call that the core of our strategy combines the human touch with enhanced digital experience. That involves embracing technology in ways that are distinctly Erie by bolstering our unique asset, the relationship with our independent agency force. After more than 2 years of virtual meetings and celebrations, we've been excited to reconnect with our agents in person over the past few months at annual branch meetings held across our footprint and at our combined agent task force meeting, which we hosted recently in our hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. Something we've been discussing with agents is how we can make sure they are well equipped to meet the changing needs and preferences of our customers for new and enhanced products and services.\nThe new extended water product for personal lines is one example of that. This represents Erie's entry into the private flood market, which includes sewer or draining backup coverage plus flood barrels under a single limit. Following a successful pilot in Indiana and Virginia earlier this year, we rolled it out to 2 more states, Tennessee and West Virginia, in June. It's already been added to more than 2,000 policies in those 4 states. We're also able to use data from this pilot to appropriately monitor our risk and roll out the coverage to additional states.\nOn the services side, chat is now available to all users of our online account platform. Our digital services being handled over 15,000 chats through May of 2022, and more than 900,000 households now have an active online account. Capabilities of our mobile app were also recently strengthened by an integration with Safelite, Erie's third-party glass plane vendor. This allows users to be in an auto glass claim, which is a high-frequency claim occurrence directly from the app.\nBefore we close, I'd like to make a note of a few third-party recognitions. J.D. Power ranked Erie first in its 2020 U.S. auto insurance study in 2 regions: Mid-Atlantic and North Central. Ranking is based on customer satisfaction scores in billing, claims, interactions, policy offerings and price.\nIn other recognitions, Forbes listed Erie on its 2022 list of America's Best Employers for Diversity. Out of 500 companies recognized across all industries, Erie was ranked #48 nationally.\nFinally, Erie's First Notice of Loss department was named a top contact center in its size and category across all industries by BenchmarkPortal. In 2021, Erie's FNOL customer satisfaction rates improved nearly 90%, a reach significantly higher than the industry average.\nThis commitment to a high level of service is what has always set Erie apart. We remain steadfast in that commitment, especially in these challenging and changing times. That's made possible by the dedication of our employees and agents. And it's reinforced by the ongoing support and trust of our shareholders.\nI'd like to thank all of you for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

We broadcast the meeting from the new Thomas B. Hagen building, which, as I've mentioned on previous calls, was dedicated last September. This beautiful building has continued to sit mostly empty since that time, as the majority of our employees have continued to work remotely. However, just in the past couple of weeks, that started to change.\nWe celebrated Erie's 97th anniversary on April 20 by welcoming nearly 200 employees back to our home office campus. They joined the essential employees who have been coming into the office to maintain operations since the beginning of the pandemic.\nThis is the beginning of a broader phase-in return to our offices that will be taking place over the next several months. We're returning with greater flexibility than ever before, but we're taking a slow and steady approach to ensure the spirit of the organization and levels of service are upheld, as the pandemic continues its transition to new variants in a world anxious to return to living fully.\nAt Erie, our focus now is less about getting back to what we previously knew and more about exploring what's next. We'll be listening, learning and adapting as we go, and we'll be doing that together with our Erie employees.\nAt the Annual Shareholder's Meeting, I also shared some of the external challenges we're facing. The inflation rate, supply chain issues and labor shortages are being felt across all industries, and they are further echoed in our industry through increased claims cost.\nOur combined ratio for the first quarter, which stands at 104.6%, reflects some of those challenges, but I'm confident in Erie's financial strength, evidenced by $11.5 billion in policyholder surplus and continued growth, which can be seen in the 7% direct written premium increase for the quarter.\nAnd of course, Erie's 97-year track record of stability and success is a testament to the adaptability and resilience through whatever the times may throw our way.\nWith that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg for a deep review of our first quarter financials. Greg?\n\nGregory John Gutting\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call.\nAs Tim mentioned, earlier this week, we held our 97th Annual Shareholder's Meeting where we shared many of our distinguished accomplishments in 2021. We shared how several new products have positively impacted our insurance operations. We shared how changes in the way we interact and communicate with our customers has bolstered our customers' overall experience. And lastly, we shared with our audience how, even in the midst of a more difficult year, the Exchange still added $1 billion to policyholder surplus, further showing that strong financial performance can be achieved even during challenging times.\nNow I would like to share with you the first quarter results for 2022 beginning with the Exchange, the insurance operations we manage. Direct and assumed written premium growth for the first quarter was 7%. This growth for the quarter was driven by a 4% increase in the new policy premiums as well as a 3% increase in total policies in force.\nThe Exchange's combined ratio for the quarter was 104.6%, up significantly from the first quarter of 2021. The increase in the combined ratio can be attributed to the increase in auto claims frequency and severity, driven by higher claim settlement costs and driving activity at near prepandemic levels. Despite the increase in the combined ratio, the Exchange still recorded policyholder surplus of $11.5 billion at March 31, 2022.\nShifting our attention to indemnity, first quarter 2022 net income was $69 million or $1.31 per diluted share compared to $74 million or $1.41 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2021.\nOperating income before taxes increased $8 million or 10.8% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nIndemnity's management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services increased $32 million or 7.1% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nManagement fee revenue allocated to administrative services was $14 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $15 million in the first quarter of last year.\nTurning to indemnity's cost of operations related to policy issuance and renewal services. Commissions increased nearly $20 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. This was the result of the 7% increase in the direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange primarily in lines of business that pay a higher commission rate.\nNoncommission expenses increased $4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nSales and advertising increased nearly $2 million due to agent-related expenses, while administrative and other costs increased $3 million primarily due to an increase in professional fees.\nLastly, income from investments before taxes totaled $3 million for the quarter compared to $18 million during the first quarter of 2021. Included in our investment income was nearly $3 million of income from limited partnerships in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $9 million in limited partnership income in the first quarter of 2021. However, keep in mind that our limited partnership portfolio is still in runoff.\nIndemnity also recorded realized and unrealized losses of over $7 million in the first quarter of 2022, which negatively impacted total investment income.\nThank you again for your time and attention this morning. I look forward to continuing to provide you with financial updates throughout 2022. Now I'll turn the call back over to Tim.\n\nTimothy Gerard NeCastro\n\nPresident & CEO, Erie Indemnity Company\n\nThank you, Greg. We headed into 2022 poised to implement the strategy we've spent over a year developing and refining. That strategy involves embracing technology in ways that are distinctly Erie, by strengthening our most unique asset, the relationship with our independent agency groups.\nIt also aims to strengthen our competitive position by making sure our independent agents are well equipped to meet the changing needs and preferences of our customers. A perfect example of a product that addresses those changing needs is our commercial cyber suite coverage.\nThis provides comprehensive protection against a risk we couldn't imagine a few decades back, cyber attacks to businesses. It's now available to commercial customers through ErieSecure Business and automatically quoted on all new policies. There is a growing market addressing the emerging threats businesses based in this digital age, and we see a lot of potential for this particular product.\nAlso through ErieSecure Business, a new wage and hour option with an employment practices liability covers defense costs for claims where the insured and their employee disagree about time paid. These defense costs can present a real exposure for small business clients, and we're pleased to now offer this optional coverage.\nOn the personal line side, we're addressing a previously unmet need by offering extended water or flood coverage. This coverage, which includes both sewer and drain and flood coverage under a single limit, is now offered in 4 states with plans to roll it out to most of our states by the end of this year.\nAnother way we're meeting both customer agent needs is through the service capabilities we provide. Our online account platform now has more than 900,000 active customers, and live chat capabilities are now available to all customers that use it, giving them the option to have a real-time conversation with an Erie customer care representative online. More than 12,000 chats have been handled since the functionality was introduced.\nWe're also pleased to now offer live interpretation services for our agents through a partnership with the service called LanguageLine Solutions. Agents can have clear professional conversations with any customer or prospect, regardless of the language they speak. Agents simply call a number, choose from the more than 200 languages and connect with a live interpreter at no charge.\nAlong with service to our customers, we're also committed, as always, to service in our communities where we live and work. Erie recently selected 23 educational nonprofits to receive more than $824,000 in funding for 2022 through Pennsylvania's educational improvement tax credit program. Erie has donated nearly $10 million to the program since it was established in 2009.\nI'm also proud to announce 2 recent third-party recognitions. Erie was named Best of the Best by both the Hispanic Network Magazine and by the Black EOE Journal. Both publications promote diversity in all aspects of education, business and employment to ensure equal opportunity, and we're excited to be recognized for our commitment to integrating diversity, equity and inclusion into our principles and practices.\nFinally, I'm very excited to share that after an extensive search, we've appointed a new Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer to replace Bob Ingram, who retired at the end of last year. Partha Srinivasa, who most recently served as Senior Vice President and Chief Data Officer at Verisk Analytics, joined Erie on April 4. Verisk is one of the world's largest data analytics firms, and Partha was responsible for the company's insurance segment, data and technology as well as enterprise-wide data and analytics.\nPrior to Verisk, he held multiple technology leadership roles as a global CIO and CTO at companies including Zurich Financial Services, Tokio Marine, Farmers Insurance and Safe Auto. Partha is a highly respected IT executive, and his experience is a perfect match for where we need to go as an organization and a critical role of technology and data play in getting us there.\nHe's also a positive open person who embraces and embodies Erie's unique values and culture. I'm so pleased to have Partha at the executive table and know he'll do great things here at Erie.\nAs always, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees and agents, their commitment to being above all in service and to our shareholders for their continued support and trust.\nThank you for listening in today and for your continued interest in Erie.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

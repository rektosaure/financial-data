The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter 2025 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Senior Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\nNow if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; transaction-related expenses associated with completed acquisitions; and lastly, financial impact associated with our minority investment in [indiscernible]. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining us, and excited to be with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we plan to cover today. We'll start with our third quarter highlights and financial results. Next, we'll review our segment performance, our AI progress and momentum and our most recent set of bolt-on acquisitions, then I'll get into our guidance details and of course, wrap up with your questions. So with that, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please.\nTurning to Page 5. Let me run through the 4 key takeaways for today's call. First, we had a strong third quarter. Total revenue grew 14%; organic revenue grew 6%; softer bookings grew in the high singles area; and we continue to deliver impressive free cash flow, with free cash flow growing 17%. And of note, free cash flow margins posted at 32% for the TTM period, really impressive financial results.\nSecond, we're super encouraged by the progress and momentum we're seeing across all of our businesses as it relates to our AI enablement and our product stacks and our internal operations, and more on this in a moment. Third, we're announcing today our first share repurchase authorization, $3 billion in total.\nAnd lastly, we continue to execute on our M&A strategy of acquiring faster growth platforms and bolt-on or tuck-in acquisitions at a high fidelity rate. In the quarter, we deployed $1.3 billion, $800 million for Subsplash, which we detailed this time last quarter, and $500 million on a series of tuck-in acquisitions. Also, more on this later, but worth highlighting here, we are very encouraged by this recent capital deployment execution and the future growth potential that's being layered into our enterprise.\nImportantly, we remain very well positioned for the continued execution of our M&A strategy, and continue to have north of $5 billion of capital deployment capacity available over the next 12 months or so.\nAs I turn the call over to Jason, reflecting on the quarter, I'm quite bullish on most of what we're seeing: a very strong 3Q; real demonstrable AI progress, which is a long-term growth driver for us; excellent execution of our higher growth, higher returning capital deployment strategy; and the announcement of our first ever buyback authorization. This all bodes very well for the future. That said, we'd like to see some of our markets start to cooperate a bit better, namely the government contracting and freight markets, and we have some delays in Neptune, much more on this as we walk through today's call.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to Jason to talk through our P&L and our balance sheet.\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to take you through our third quarter results and strong financial position.\nTurning to Page 6. Q3 and TTM results reflect the long-term financial profile of Roper, which is to compound cash flow in the mid-teens area. We'll start with revenue, which was 14% over prior year and surpassed the $2 billion mark. Acquisitions contributed 8% led by the final quarter of Transact before it turns organic, and CentralReach, which we acquired in April of this year. Of note, these businesses are tracking very well against our acquisition expectations.\nWe printed 6% organic growth, both for the consolidated enterprise and across each of our 3 segments. Our Application and Network Software segments were in line with expectations, while TEP was a bit below given near-term timing at Neptune, which Neil will discuss further.\nEBITDA of $810 million was 13% over prior year, with EBITDA margin of 40.2%. Core margins expanded 10 basis points, and segment core [ margins ] expanded 30 basis points, led by our software segments. DEPS of $5.14 was 11% over prior year and $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range, despite absorbing $0.05 of dilution from Q3 acquisitions that were not reflected in previous guidance.\nFree cash flow was outstanding at $842 million, up 17% over prior year, and representing 32% of revenue on a TTM basis. Our software businesses captured strong renewals, and we drove great working capital performance across the board.\nBroadening out a bit. TTM cash flow of over $2.4 billion is a 17% CAGR over a 3-year period. And for those looking at per share metrics, you'll note that our share count has compounded at about 0.5% over that same time period. At Roper, we have been and will continue to be relentlessly focused on cash flow and shareholder value creation.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 and discuss our very strong financial position. Our net debt to EBITDA stands at 3x, which is up only modestly from Q2 at 2.9x despite deploying $1.3 billion towards acquisitions. This places us in a great position with over $5 billion in the next 12-month capacity for capital deployment.\nRegarding M&A, you can see that we've been quite active this year in acquiring high-quality growth businesses and several strategic bolt-ons. This is against the backdrop of a muted PE deal environment. The pipeline of high-quality acquisitions continues to build as access mature in PE portfolios and a return of capital to LPs becomes paramount.\nAdditionally, as Neil mentioned, we're pleased to announce another capital deployment lever that was previously unavailable. Our Board has authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program with an open-ended time period to execute. While M&A will continue to be the majority of our capital deployment allocation, our share repurchase program will allow us to opportunistically complement our M&A program.\nOver the last year or 2, we have talked about the great business building taking place across the Roper portfolio, from strategy, to talent, to execution, all now greatly turbocharged by AI. Our repurchase program reflects both confidence in our strategy and our commitment to delivering long-term shareholder value.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. Turning to Page 8, and before I get into our segment details, we want to discuss why AI is a powerful and durable growth driver for Roper.\nTo start, AI represents a meaningful expansion of our TAM across the portfolio. We can now deliver transformational software solutions that automate labor-intensive work adjacent to our existing platforms. This creates substantial new value streams for our customers and correspondingly facilitates long-term growth for Roper and our businesses.\nImportantly, our businesses are uniquely positioned to win in AI. In fact, having a very high right to win in the AI world. Our software solutions are deeply embedded system of record applications with workflow-oriented domain-specific architectures. The decade of cumulative workflow knowledge built into our platforms combined with the proprietary vertical market data provides the precise context needed to develop agentic AI solutions. Because of this, our businesses have been exceptionally high right to win as we deploy these capabilities across our VMS end markets.\nInternally, we're becoming AI native across all functions to drive productivity gains. We're excited to reinvest these gains to further accelerate our product development and go-to-market initiatives. It's important to note, we've always had more great ideas than resources needed to execute, and AI has the potential to attack this challenge.\nFinally, we have tangible proof points, though it's still early. [indiscernible] has claimed the technology leadership position in Legal Tech, accelerating their bookings growth. CentralReach now has roughly 75% of their bookings attributed to AI-enabled products, which have automated 100 million reimbursement rule evaluations, over 3.5 million learner appointments and over 1 million clinical summaries being generated. Great real-world examples of the power of AI. Deltek has released over 40 AI features into their cloud offerings, driving increased cloud conversion activity. And DAT has industry-leading AI/ML-enabled freight matching capabilities, which I'll detail shortly. These are but a few examples from across the portfolio. Very exciting times for sure.\nWith that, let's now turn to our segment review, starting with Page 10 and our Application Software segment. Revenue for the quarter grew by 18% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. EBITDA margins were 43.4%, and core margins improved 40 basis points in the quarter.\nStarting with Deltek. Deltek delivered solid performance in the quarter, with particularly strong results in their private sector end markets: construction, architecture and engineering remain robust throughout. The GovCon business experienced softness in September as agencies pause activity ahead of the pending government shutdown. This timing is unfortunate. Pipeline activity and commercial momentum has been building nicely, following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill in July, and we are seeing increased engagement across our customer base heading into the new fiscal year. The fundamentals remain strong. The [ OB3 ] authorized significant increases in defense and infrastructure spending that will flow through to our customers once appropriations are finalized. This is simply a timing issue, not a demand issue. Finally, retention levels across the entire Deltek franchise remained very high.\nAderant continues to be incredibly strong and continues to post impressive bookings and recurring revenue growth. The booking strength is broad-based, fueled by their AI-enabled solutions, especially as it relates to AI-enabled compliant time capture and billing, and is a combination of market share gains, cloud migration and SaaS growth.\nVertafore continues once again to be steady and solid for us. We continue to see consistent ARR growth and strong customer retention and strength across our agency, MGA and carrier solutions. This growth is enabled by their strong go-to-market capabilities and their long-term commitment to product strength.\nPowerPlan's performance has been terrific. Their success is a result of several years of business building and the product stack, the go-to-market capabilities, their service delivery really across all functions. In addition, to remind everyone, they serve power generation customers, which are adding capacity as quickly as possible to handle the AI workloads. The setup here should be quite good for a long time.\nAlso in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Orchard, a tuck-in acquisition for our CliniSys business. Orchard brings additional clinical laboratory capability to CliniSys with particular strength in reference, physician offerings and public health labs.\nFinally, the balance of our application software portfolio continues to execute very well. CentralReach was awesome again in the quarter, driving accelerating adoption of their AI tools and capturing [ ABA ] therapy capacity additions.\nProcare made a great installment of progress with new bookings continuing to be strong, posting low double-digit growth in payments with improved gross margins, though still work to do, in particular, with faster implementation time frames and share wallet expansion, but meaningful progress for sure.\nFinally, Strata and Transact were steady and solid in the quarter.\nAs we look to the final quarter of the year, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. This outlook reflects high single-digit growth in our recurring revenue base, offset by declines in nonrecurring revenue, primarily due to anticipated softness in our Deltek business stemming from the ongoing government shutdown. Given the uncertainty surrounding the duration impact of the shutdown, we see potential outcomes across the full range of our MSD outlook, from the lower to the higher end. That said, our businesses in this segment continue to compete and execute exceptionally well. The primary variable remains a higher level of market uncertainty than we typically experience for our Deltek business.\nPlease turn to Page 11. Total revenue in our Network segment grew 13%; and organic revenue, 6% in the quarter. EBITDA margins remained strong at 53.7%, with core margin improving 60 basis points.\nAs we dig into the individual businesses, we'll start with DAT. DAT was solid in the quarter and had strong ARPU improvements. DAT continues to execute exceptionally well on their core strategy of driving enhanced network value for both brokers and carriers. This dual-sided approach positions DAT to better monetize their entire network ecosystem, and more on this when we turn to the next page.\nConstructConnect was solid again for us in the quarter. The growth was fueled by strong customer bookings activity and improved customer net retention. Of note, this business continues to make good progress with our emerging AI-enabled takeoff and estimating solution.\nFoundry is turning the corner on growth, posting continued sequential improvements in ARR, and we expect our Q4 exit ARR to grow year-over-year in the HSD area. Really happy for the team there as they've had to work through some tough market conditions.\nNext, our network health care businesses, MHA, SHP and SoftWriters were very good in the quarter. Of particular note, SoftWriters is executing at an exceptional level, winning a few very large pharmacy customers and making substantial progress on a high-impact AI solution, which is being beta tested in the market currently. Congrats to Scott and his entire team for their success.\nFinally, Subsplash. Our most recent acquisition that closed on July 25 is off to a great start, delivering financial results in line with our deal model expectations. Of note, they saw very good market traction with their AI-driven [ sermon ] content offering, Pulpit AI, as they deepened its integration with their core engagement platform, driving strong product-led growth. Exciting stuff.\nAs we turn to the outlook for the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth at the higher end of the mid-singles area.\nAs we turn to Page 12, we'd like to spend a few minutes describing the strategic evolution of our DAT business and while we're so excited about its future growth prospects. To start, our legacy DAT platform is the largest freight-matching network across the U.S. and Canada. The scale is remarkable. Over 1.2 million loads posted and 15 million rate views every single day. DAT is the clear market leader, delivering tremendous value to both rate brokers and carriers, both of whom pay to participate in this powerful network.\nAs strong as the legacy business is, we're even more bullish about where DAT is headed. To bring this vision to life, DAT is building capabilities across the entire freight automation workflow, from carrier vetting, to broker carrier matching, to AI-driven rate negotiation, load management tracking and finally, payment and settlement. Through deep customer partnering with the brokerage community, DAT is working to fully automate the freight matching process. As this happens, DAT will generate $100 to $200 per load in savings for brokers, while giving carriers greater predictability and faster payments on their invoices.\nWhat sets DAT apart is this end-to-end product capability and its role as a neutral trusted partner, a switcher and light player that equally serves the entire freight brokerage market. This is a truly unique position in the market. This evolution also highlights the Roper DAT partnership at its best. We work closely with the DAT team to craft this strategy, then we execute a focused M&A program to strengthen it through 3 strategic tuck-ins: Trucker Tools, Alco and Convoy. With the deals complete, DAT is now fully focused on delivering against this strategic opportunity. Important to note, Convoy is an unusual transaction for us as it currently is not profitable. We expect the financial returns over the next several years to be extremely attractive.\nThe key to success is scaling efficiently, leveraging DAT's advantaged customer unit economics for both brokers and carriers to drive sustained growth and profitability. We are confident in this strategy, market position and DAT's ability to execute. I know this was a bit of a deep dive, but I wanted to share with you why we're so excited about the growth opportunity that sits in front of DAT through AI-based freight automation.\nNow let's turn to Page 13 and review our TEP segment's quarterly results. Total revenue here grew 7% and organic revenue grew 6%. EBITDA margins came in at 35.2%.\nLet's start with Neptune. As we said before, Neptune continues to execute really well, particularly around its ultrasonic meter strategy, and we're seeing strong traction in its data and software billing solutions. The new copper tariff that took effect on August 1 caused some short-term disruption. Neptune responded by implementing surcharges to offset the tariff impact, which temporarily slowed order timing. These actions reflect the benefit of being part of Roper, doing the right long-term thing for customers and the business even when it creates near-term headwinds.\nVerathon continues to perform well. In particular, during the quarter, Verathon saw continued strength in single-use recurring product lines, both BFlex and GlideScope, which remain key growth drivers.\nNDI also delivered an excellent quarter. As we discussed previously, NDI provides proprietary world-class precision measurement technologies to a range of health care OEMs. These technologies, in turn, enable guidance enabled solutions across multiple clinical markets, including orthopedic surgery, interventional radiology and cardiac completion.\nFinally, we saw strong execution and growth across CIVCO, SMI, Inovonics, IPA and rf IDEAS, rounding out a solid overall performance for this group of companies. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect organic growth in the low single-digit area, given the very difficult prior year comp and the timing we discussed at Neptune.\nNow let's turn to Page 15 and review our Q4 and updated full year 2025 guidance. Starting with the full year outlook, we continue to expect total revenue to remain in the 13% area. Also given the delays at Neptune and the temporary impact of the government shutdown, which is slowing year-end commercial activity at Deltek, we now expect organic revenue to land in the 6% area versus our previous 6% to 7% range.\nRelative to our full year DEPS outlook, we're tightening guidance to the high end of our prior range after adjusting for $0.10 of dilution for the $500 million of tuck-in acquisitions completed during the quarter. Specifically, we now expect adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $19.90 and $19.95. We expect to see our tax rate at the lower end of our 21% to 22% area for the full year. For the fourth quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance between $5.11 and $5.16, which includes $0.05 of dilution for last quarter's tuck-in deals.\nNow please turn with us to Page 16, and we'll open it up to your questions. We'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, we made a very good third quarter with exceptional free cash flow. Second, we're super excited about the pace of AI innovation and the growth potential in front of enterprise. Third, we're announcing a $3 billion authorization for a share repurchase. And finally, we remain super well positioned for further M&A activity. Relative to our financial results, we grew total revenue 14% and organic revenue 6%, grew EBITDA 13% and delivered 17% free cash flow growth in the quarter.\nAI is a significant growth driver for Roper, expanding our TAMs by automating tasks and work across our vertical market offerings. With deep workflow integration, proprietary data and vertical market-specific architectures, our businesses are well positioned to succeed in AI, in fact, have a very high right to win and are already seeing measurable yet early product and commercial results.\nDAT exemplifies this strategy in action, evolving from a traditional freight matching network, to a fully automated freight marketplace powered by AI. Through this transformation, DAT is unlocking significant efficiency and economic value for brokers and carriers alike, positioning itself for improved high-quality growth.\nAs Jason mentioned earlier, we're excited to announce a $3 billion share purchase authorization, which we'll deploy opportunistically, enabling us to take advantage of dislocations in the market. We're super confident with our talent advantage, our strategy and our execution capabilities, and this first ever buyback is evidence of such.\nImportantly, we remain exceptionally well positioned to execute our M&A strategy. We have north of $5 billion of available firepower over the next 12 months and a very active, large and attractive pipeline of opportunities. Importantly, Roper continues to strengthen its position as an acquirer of choice for both target CEOs and their private equity owners. As always, we'll pursue these opportunities whether consistent, unbiased, patient and disciplined approach.\nPrior to turning to your questions, and if you can flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by executing a low-risk strategy and running our dual threat offense. First, we have a proven powerful business model that begins with operating a portfolio of market-leading, application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustainable organic growth rates and underlying business quality.\nSecond, we run a centralized process-driven capital employment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on cultivating, curating and acquiring the next great vertical market-leading business or a tuck-in acquisition to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area, meaning we double our cash flow every 5 years or so.\nSo with that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support, and open the call to your questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations, please.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter 2025 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Senior Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.

You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3.

For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, transaction-related expenses associated with completed acquisitions; and lastly, financial impacts associated with minority investments, including cash taxes paid resulting from the sale of our minority interest in Certinia. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we plan to cover today. We'll start with our second quarter highlights, including reviewing the platform acquisition we announced earlier today, Subsplash. Then we'll go through our segment results and our improved outlook for the full year and then get to your questions. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please.\nAs we turn to Page 5, let me highlight the 4 key takeaways for today's call. First, we posted another solid quarter of financial results. Total revenue grew 13%. Organic revenue grew 7% and Software bookings grew in the high teens area, and we continue to deliver impressive cash flow with free cash flow margins coming in at 31% for the TTM period. Second, we announced earlier today the acquisition of another great vertical market software provider, Subsplash, which I'll get to in a bit. Then given the strong first half performance and the anticipated completion of the sub-plus acquisition, we're raising our full year total revenue guidance and our full year debt outlook. And finally, we continue to be very well positioned for capital deployment and continue to have more than $5 billion of available firepower over the course of the next 12 months.\nPlease turn to Page 6, where we'll discuss Subsplash. Subsplash is a cloud-native and AI-enabled software provider serving faith-based organizations. As a leading provider of digital engagement, church management and integrated giving solutions, their purpose-built platform enables customers to serve congregations while engaging with members more effectively. Subsplash partners with 20,000 faith-based organizations to help them become digitally native by deepening member engagement, reducing manual administrative burden through automation, streamlining content distribution and integrating digital giving solutions, all supporting their customers' core mission.\nSimply put, Subsplash enables these organizations to allocate more time and resources to what matters most. -- ministering to and engaging with their congregation in a digitally native way, whether it be online or on an in-person basis. Importantly, this customer value proposition strengthens further as the company's AI native capabilities are further deployed across their product stack.\nIn terms of investment highlights, the purchase price is $800 million. We expect Subsplash to deliver $115 million of revenue and $36 million of EBITDA for the 12 months ending Q3 of 2026. This business meets all of our long-standing acquisition criteria. Leader in a niche competes on the basis of customer intimacy, has strong gross margins and converts high levels of cash flow. Subsplash reflects the maturing leader acquisition profile of being a higher organic growth business, in this case, in the high teens area and competes in a $2.5 billion U.S. TAM with about half being currently served and potential to meaningfully expand internationally.\nIn addition, Subsplash is well positioned to materially improve their gross and EBITDA margins over the next 3 to 5 years and we expect to deliver this by executing a handful of the available levers. As a result, we expect to see Subsplash's organic revenue growth convert to high 20% EBITDA growth over the next 3 to 5 years. We will finance this transaction with a revolver and report the results in our network software segment. Subsplash represents another powerhouse addition delivering critical solutions to a customer base with deep ongoing needs for these capabilities.\nTo the Subsplash team, we're so excited for you to join Roper -- thank you for all of the super important work you do for your customer community and for trusting Roper to become your permanent partner. So with that, let me turn the call over to Jason to walk through our P&L and balance sheet. Jason?\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. I'll now take you through our Q2 financial highlights on Slide 7. The second quarter was another solid installment in what we believe will be a good year for Roper. Revenue of $1.94 billion was up 13% over prior year and well balanced with 7% organic growth and a 6% increase from acquisitions, with Central reach results contributing since the April 23 close date. Organic growth was strong across the portfolio, demonstrating resilient demand for our mission-critical solutions. Importantly, and as expected, network software year-over-year growth notably improved from Q1, given more normal comps at MHA, increased freight match unit economics and recovery of foundry.\nEBITDA of $775 million was up 12% and generated EBITDA margin of 39.9%. Core enterprise operating margin was flat to the prior year with core segment margin up 40 basis points. This follows a similar pattern to Q1, bringing our year-to-date core segment margin expansion to 70 basis points. For the diluted EPS, we delivered $4.87 versus our guidance range of $4.80 to [indiscernible] on strong revenue growth and excellent core operating leverage.\nFinally, free cash flow of [indiscernible] million was up 10% versus prior year, which drives TTM free cash flow to over $2.3 billion. The recent passage of the big beautiful Bill Act provided a permanent repeal of Section 174 capitalization of R&D expenditures. We are, therefore, reducing our cash tax payments for 2025 by around $150 million to reflect the cumulative reversal of capitalization, of which about $60 million benefited our second quarter. We will also see a benefit of $120 million carry into next year due to deduction limitations in 2025.\nAdjusting out the Section 174 impact, our 3-year TTM free cash flow CAGR would be about 14%. So overall, good news in offsetting some near-term deal dilution and feeling our growth equation. Now let's turn to Slide 8 to discuss our strong financial position. We finished the quarter with a healthy balance sheet and substantial capacity for continued capital deployment. We exited at 2.9x net debt to EBITDA and pro forma for Subsplash, this would be around 3.1x.\nAdditionally, our cash balance was $242 million, and our revolver had $1.4 billion drawn against our $3.5 billion credit facility. So even with Subsplash closing this month, as Neil outlined, this gives us over $5 billion in M&A firepower. This substantial capacity positions us very well to executing on our disciplined capital employment strategy. To that end, while the sponsor-to-sponsor market is still somewhat muted, we are active on a number of both platform and bolt-on transactions that reflect the characteristics of higher growth and increasing long-term value capture with Subsplash being a case in point.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Neil for our segment highlights and the guidance update. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 10, let's review our Application Software segment. Revenue for the quarter grew by 17% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. The EBITDA margins were 42.9%, and core margins improved 70 basis points in the quarter. As returns to the businesses, we'll start with Deltek. Deltek grew in the mid-singles range in the quarter, both recurring and total revenues. As highlighted on the slide, Deltek continues to have strong migration to their cloud offerings, while the business continues to innovate at a rapid pace and has benefited by very strong gross and net retention. .\nAs it relates to the federal government contracting outlook, we believe the big beautiful bill spending priorities and sheer volume will be a catalyst for market growth, which has been tepid for the last 24 months or so. The timing of market reacceleration is still to be determined, but we believe it will occur over the course of the next few quarters. Importantly, during the quarter, Deltek made substantial progress in regard to their AI-based product capability and recently announced their new flagship GovCon product cost point, fully embeds their AI assistant Della help deploy intelligent task-oriented agents to streamline repetitive processes and help users make faster, better informed decisions, exciting stuff here and lots more to come for sure.\n[indiscernible] continues to be incredibly strong and posted their best bookings quarter in the company's history. The booking strength is broad-based, fueled by their AI-enabled solutions and is a combination of market share gains, cloud migration and SaaS growth. Congrats and thanks to Chris and the entire team at Aderant, Keep up the amazing work. Vertafore continues once again to be steady and solid for us. We continue to see consistent ARR growth and strong customer retention here with strength across our agency, MGA and carrier solutions. This growth is enabled by their strong go-to-market capabilities and our long-term commitment to product strength. We look forward to talking about this and their AI-enabled solutions in subsequent calls.\nPowerPlan continues to be outstanding. As we mentioned last quarter, the team has done a great job at making the revenue stream more recurring in nature. In addition, they continue to get amazing feedback with our innovative cloud offerings, which are driving strong SaaS migration activity. As a result, PowerPlan just continues to win in the market. with our new SaaS solution and near 100% gross retention. ProCare and TransAct seaborne continue to perform very well in their respective markets. We also saw very good results from the health care IT portion of this segment, Strata, Data Innovations and CliniSys.\nFinally, CentralReach is awesome in the early days, has exceptional momentum, record expansion activity and a 70% enterprise new client win rate all in the quarter. As it relates to the outlook for the second half of the year, we continue to expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit plus area.\nPlease turn with to Page 11. Total revenue in our Network segment grew 6% and organic revenue 5% in the quarter. EBITDA margins remained strong at 54.6% and core margins improved 20 basis points. As we dig into the individual businesses, we'll start with DAT. DAT was solid in the quarter and had strong ARPU improvements. The market continues to be stable, albeit bouncing along the bottom. Also in the quarter, we integrated Loadlink our Canadian freight match business with DAT. We expect the integration to deliver over time, a more unified and efficiently deployed North American Freight Match network. DAT continues executing exceptionally well on their core strategy of driving enhanced network value for both brokers and carriers. This dual-sided approach positions us to better monetize our entire network ecosystem.\nSupporting this strategy, DAT made significant progress integrating trucker tools, our Q4 bolt-on acquisition and completing the acquisition of Alco an AI-native factoring technology solution. Combined with the DAT Network Foundation, these integrated products and assets now deliver substantially more value to both carriers and brokers. Looking forward, DAT will maintain their aggressive execution of this network value enhancement strategy, positioning the business for continued growth and improved monetization across all.\nConstruction that was solid for us in the quarter. The growth was fueled by strong customer bookings activity and improved customer retention. Of note, this business continues to make good progress with the emerging AI-enabled takeoff and estimating solution. Foundry declined in the quarter as expected, but we continue to see market recovery signs as they grew their sequential ARR for the first time since the actors and writer strikes. Good to see recovery start here.\nAlso in the quarter, Foundry's new product, Nuke Stage, started gaining traction in the market, specifically with a very large studio and several smaller customers. Nuke stage enables the power of postproduction compositing to occur in the production phase of the pipeline and exciting new capability that will help drive cost savings for the industry.\nFinally, our network health care businesses, MHA, SHP and SoftWriters were very good in the quarter. As we turn to the outlook for the second half of the year, we expect to see revenue growth in the mid-single-digit plus range. Now please turn to Page 12, and let's review our TEP segment's quarterly results. Revenue here grew 10% and organic revenue grew 9%. EBITDA margins came in at 36.7%. So we'll start with Neptune, which was, once again, just solid for us. Neptune continues to do a great job with our ultrasonic meter go-to-market execution and continue to see strength in their data and software offerings.\nVerathon continues to execute at a high level as well. In particular, in the quarter, Verathon saw continued strength in their single-use reoccurring solutions, both BFlex and GlideScope. NDI was really good in the quarter. As discussed in prior quarters, NDI delivers proprietary and world-class precision measurement technologies to a wide variety of health care OEMs and which in turn, enables the OEMs to deliver guidance enabled solutions across many health care markets such as orthopedic surgery, interventional radiology and cardiac ablation.\nFinally, there was strong execution, which led to growth across SIFCO, FMI, anionic IPA and RF ideas. Turning to the outlook for this segment. We expect to see high single-digit organic growth for the second half of the year with a stronger third quarter and a more difficult fourth quarter comp. Before turning to our guidance outlook, I'd like to reflect on our AI perspective, its transformational potential for customers and our enterprise and the steps we're taking to build lasting advantage.\nOur strategy is focused and practical, applying AI to address high-impact customer-specific challenges. We're confident that AI-based innovation substantially expands our business's TAMs where we have a high right to win, and will be a core catalyst for our next chapter of growth. The true unlock, the magic, if you will, of AI emerges at the intersection of the specialized mission-critical workflows as our customers rely on daily and our deep vertical market expertise. Our AI initiatives span all our businesses, and we're seeing early traction from compliance solutions to AI-enhanced products to AI assistance and intelligent agents that streamline tasks. We're building solutions that deliver tangible high-value outcomes.\nToday, we have approximately 25 AI-enabled products either in market or in development. Importantly, our AI innovations create a positive halo effect across many of our businesses, driving booking activity for our broader product stacks. This is an exceptionally fun moment to be at the forefront of innovation, redefining and automating workflows across our vertical markets while unlocking new growth and building durable competitive advantages. Exciting stuff for sure.\nSo with that, please turn to Page 14. Let's turn to our Q3 and increased full year 2025 guidance. Given our strong Q2 performance and anticipated closing of the Subsplash acquisition, we're increasing our total revenue growth guide to be in the 13% range. Our organic growth rate of 6% to 7% for the full year remains unchanged. Finally, we're increasing our full year depths outlook to be 1990 to 2005 which includes about [indiscernible] of Subsplash solution. Our guide continues to assume a full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% area.\nFor the third quarter, we expect adjusted debt to be between $5.08 and $5.12, absorbing $0.03 of Subsplash dilution in the quarter. Now please turn over to Page 15, and then we'll open it up for your questions.\nWe'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, our second quarter financial results were quite good. Second, we announced the acquisition of another market-leading vertical market software business Subsplash. Third, given our solid start to the year, we're raising our full year guidance. And finally, we remain well positioned for further capital deployment. Relative to our financial results, we grew total revenue 13% and organic revenue 7% in the quarter and delivered 31% free cash flow margins in the TTM period. We're delighted with our acquisition of South Flash. As discussed, this vertical market leader is mission critical to the delivery of digital engagement, church management and payments to 20,000 faith-based organizations and has several embedded growth drivers that will support high teens revenue growth and expanding margin profile.\nNext, we're raising our full year outlook. And finally, we continue to be very well positioned with more than $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy capital towards leading vertical market software businesses. Our M&A pipeline continues to be very active, and our teams are engaged on several opportunities. As usual, we're excited to pursue these opportunities with our unbiased and disciplined approach.\nPrior to turning to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do with Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by executing a low-risk strategy and running our dual threat offense. First, we have a proven powerful business model that begins with operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses.\nOnce the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustained organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Second, we are on a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on a deliberate and disciplined manner on cultivating, curating and acquiring the next great vertical market leading business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel.\nTaken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area, meaning we double our cash flow every 5 years or so. With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor to your questions."

The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. .\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter 2025 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Senior Vice President of Finance. .\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.\nAnd now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations base. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; transaction-related expenses associated with completed acquisitions and lastly, financial impact associated with our minority investment in Indcor. Reconciliations can found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we plan to cover today. We'll start with our Q1 highlights, which included reviewing our most recent acquisition, Centralreach then we'll go through our segment results and a modestly improved outlook for the year and then get to your questions. Let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, let me highlight the 4 key takeaways for today's call. First, our quarterly financial results were solid with Q1 total revenue growing 12% and organic revenue growing 5% as expected and cash flow growing 12% over the last 12 months.\nSecondly, we successfully completed last week the acquisition of Centralreach, which I'll discuss in a bit. Third, given our solid start to the year and the completion of the Centralreach acquisition, we're raising our full year total revenue guidance and modestly increasing our full year debt outlook.\nAnd finally, we continue to be very well positioned for capital deployment with more than $5 billion of available firepower over the course over the next 12 months. As we turn to Page 6. Allow me to remind everyone about the durability of our business model. As a cash flow compounder, it is critical, our underlying cash flow generation capability of our enterprise is, in fact, durable.\nWhile no business is immune from the current macroeconomic trade and policy environment, we feel our enterprise is far better suited than most to withstand the uncertainty. To this end, over 85% of our revenues are generated in the U.S. and over 85% of our software revenues recur.\nOur enterprise solutions are mission-critical, and this criticality is best demonstrated by our 95% gross retention. More importantly, we have a very efficient business model that long term converts about 30% or a touch better of our revenue to free cash flow. All of this is further enhanced by our capital deployment optionality. So with this reminder, let's now discuss the newest acquisition to our family companies Centralreach.\nAs we turn to Page 7, I'll start with what Sensor does. Centralreach is the market-leading cloud-native software solution that enables applied behavior analysis or ABA therapy providers to deliver care for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. On a daily basis, about 200,000 professionals use Centralreach's platform to perform their daily tasks such as setting up clients, running their practice scheduling care, collecting clinical data and processing reimbursement claims.\nCentralreach offerings enable an overworked population of therapists to deliver more and better care to the autism community. This is all done in a cloud-native modern tech platform that utilizes Gen AI on a robust basis. As it relates to the deal, we paid $1.65 billion, net of a $200 million tax benefit. We expect such REITs to deliver about $175 million of revenue and $75 million of EBITDA for the TTM period ending June 2026.\nFurther, we expect Centralreach revenue and EBITDA to continue to grow in the 20% area or a touch higher once it turns organic for reporting purposes. As you can see, Centralreach meets all of our long-standing acquisition criteria. Leader in etch market, competes on the basis of customer intimacy, has strong gross margins and converts high levels of cash flow.\nIn addition, Centralreach reflects our new maturing leader criteria of being a higher growth business in this case in the 20% area. We financed the acquisition with our revolver and report the results in our Application Software segment. Now turning to Page 8, we'll briefly walk through the long-term drivers of Centralreach growth. As you can see at the top here, Centralreach is the leader in a market with strong sustainable tailwinds.\nFirst, there is a long-term persistent shortage of ABA therapists compared to patient demand. To scale this for you, for the U.S. alone, the current annual demand is approximately 900 million hours, where only about 300 million therapist hours are currently being supplied. We estimate the care gap to exist for the next decade both in the U.S. and throughout the developed world. And finally, Centralreach is winning with the winners, meaning their clients tend to be the industry aggregators so Centralreach reaches customers grow, so does Centralreach. As we talked about on the prior page, Centralreach solutions are mission critical to delivery of care. Their tools help measure outcomes, ensure compliance, and realized reimbursement. Perhaps more so, Centralreach's solutions unlock operational efficiencies, which allow for more care hours to be delivered to a grossly underserved patient population. Finally, Centralreach has multiple levers available to both grow revenue and expand margins. Some of these levers include expanding their product portfolio, cross-selling our new AI-powered solutions continuing to win new logos, opportunistically pursuing adjacent markets such as speech and occupational therapies and bring their solutions to international markets.\nImportantly, while we grow this business, we expect to see continued margin expansion. In short, this is a powerhouse business that is a critical solution to a huge challenge the world is facing. Through the Centralreach team, so excited for you to join Roper, thank you for all you do for the autism community and for trusting Roper to become your permanent partner.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jason to talk through our P&L and our balance sheet. Jason?\n\nJoseph Alfred Ritchie\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nThanks, Neil, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Neil, we had a good start to the year. Revenue of $1.9 billion was up 12% and led by an 8% contribution from acquisitions, mainly via our TRANZACT and ProCare portfolio additions and organic growth of 5%. Coming into 2025, we expected Q1 to be our lowest quarter for organic growth, given some comp challenges in our network segment. And so 5% was in line with that expectation.\nTo click into the monthly cadence throughout the quarter, for software, enterprise bookings were up low single digits in the quarter. This was expected following very strong Q4 performance across the portfolio. Importantly, pipelines remain high given the essential nature of our solutions. Yet we are cautiously optimistic and mindful of the current macro environment heading into Q2.\nFor products, demand improved throughout the quarter, particularly at Neptune and Verathon without any indication of pull-forward activity. EBITDA of $740 million was up over 9% in total and nearly 10% on a segment basis. Reported EBITDA margin of 39.3% was down 90 basis points versus prior year. Core EBITDA margin, which exclude acquisitions, was solid at 4.8%, representing a 50 basis point margin expansion or 53% incrementals. Regarding acquisition margins, Q1 is TransAct's lowest margin quarter as about half of TransAct's EBITDA comes in the third quarter of each year. This is due to a high concentration of term renewals and back-to-school transaction volume.\nWe'll expect margin expansion from Q1 as we progress throughout the year. For diluted EPS, we delivered $4.78, which was above our guidance range of $4.70 to $4.70 led by strong margin performance.\nFinally, on free cash flow, Q1 came in at $507 million, which was down 1% versus prior year. Note that this figure includes a legal settlement of $24 million, which was funded in January, and we discussed in our last earnings call. Though Q1 free cash flow was a bit low. It was not unexpected, given the exceptionally strong Q4 working capital performance that discussed in our last call.\nOverall, free cash flow margins, if you look over the last few years, we've been in the 31% to 32% range. Last quarter, I had mentioned that we issued $2 billion of bonds in Q3 2024, yet the first coupon payments are occurring in February and April of this year. This, along with the legal settlement in Q1 has about a $70 million or 80 bps impact on free cash flow margins this year.\nOperationally, we feel good about working capital conversion and the structural free cash flow margin profile going forward. Now I'll turn to Slide 10 to discuss our strong financial position. We finished the quarter with net debt to EBITDA of 2.4x with a fully undrawn revolver. Last week, we closed on Centralreach and used the revolver to fund the acquisition. This brings our pro forma net leverage to around 3x.\nAs we roll forward our expected cash flow and leverage ratios, we remain in a great position even after funding Centralreach. over $5 billion of capacity to deploy towards high-quality acquisitions. To that end, we continue to work through a very strong pipeline of opportunities today. Given the uncertain macro backdrop, some PE sponsors are understandably taking a breath.\nHowever, as we have discussed, many PE sponsors need to return capital to LPs in the near future. And so the current market dislocation creates a favorable environment for Roper. In summary, our unique and resilient business model creates opportunity during times of uncertainty. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Neil.\nNeil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's review our Application Software segment. Revenue for the quarter grew 19% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. The EBITDA margins were 41.4% and core margins improved 110 basis points in the quarter. This group of companies continues to demonstrate resilience and deliver on our growth expectations. .\nAs we turn to the businesses, we'll start with Deltek. Deltek grew in the mid-singles range in the quarter, both recurring and total revenues. As we highlighted on the slide, Deltek continues to have strong migration to their cloud offerings while the business continues to innovate at a rapid pace and has benefited by very strong gross and net retention. Aderant continues to be very strong with record first quarter bookings and strong cloud migration activity in the quarter. Aderant continues to gain market share and carry its momentum forward.\nPowerPlan also was outstanding in the quarter. Over the last several years, the team has done a great job at making the revenue stream more recurring in nature. In addition, they continue to get an amazing feedback with their cloud offerings, which are driving strong SaaS migration activity. Also during the quarter, we promoted Rafi Shore, Aderant's CEO to succeed Joe Gomes as the next CEO of PowerPlan. Joe Gomes is now leading ProCare for us.\nWe love high-potential leaders be placed in a position to have even higher levels of impact. Turning to Vertafore, which was once again steady and solid for us. We continue to see consistent ARR growth and strong customer retention here. ProCare, our platform acquisition from a year ago has done a nice job competing and winning in the market increasing its market share versus the primary competitor. That said, there's a clear opportunity for the business to reach its full potential, both in terms of operational efficiency and growth. Because of this, we asked Joe Gomes, who has been a CEO within the Roper portfolio for 8 years to lead ProCare going forward. We look forward to Joe replicating his prior Opera leadership success at ProCare.\nFinally, the combination between TransAct and Seaboard is going according to our integration plan and the combined business is performing well in the market. Now turning to the outlook for the balance of the year. We see no change in the trajectory of the outlook and continue to expect to see organic growth in the mid-single plus range. Also, and as we highlighted last quarter, we want to remind you that TransAct's revenue, earnings and margin profile are highest in the third quarter, as Jason mentioned earlier.\nPlease turn to Page 13. Organic revenue in our Network Software segment grew 1% in the quarter, as we expected, given the difficult prior year comp at MHA. EBITDA margins remained strong, 55.3%. As we dig into the individual businesses, we'll start with DAT. DAT grew in the quarter as expected based on increased ARPU driven by carrier and broker price actions, product packaging and continued customer cross-sell activity.\nIn addition, DAT continues to innovate at a rapid pace and did a great job integrating our recent Trucker Tools bolt-on acquisition. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect to see DAT grow based on the price actions rolling into the recurring revenue. From a market point of view, spot market volumes and DAT monetize network participation continue to bounce along the bottom, which is what we expect to occur for the balance of the year.\nBoth MHA and foundry declined in the quarter as expected for MHA due to a prior year typical comp and for foundry due to the 5 elements of the actors and Rider strike hangover. That said, we did some nice green shoot activity at foundry during the quarter and now feel confident that the worst is behind and foundries ARR will, in fact, return to growth this year.\nConstruct Connect was strong for us in the quarter. The growth was fueled by strong customer bookings activity and improved customer retention. In addition, building on what Matt Strata started, our new leader, Bub Brody, who's doing a terrific job leaning into Gen AI and developing very interesting, innovative and potentially groundbreaking products. We look forward to talking more about this in future calls.\nFinally, our alternate site health care businesses, SoftWriters and SHP, continue to grow nicely, winning in the marketplace. As we turn to the outlook, we continue to expect to see revenue growth in the mid-singles range for the balance of the year.\nNow please turn to Page 14, and let's review our segment's full year results. Revenue here grew 6% on a total and organic basis and EBITDA margins came in at 36.2%, solid results. Before we get into the business specifics, the vast majority of our tariff exposure resides within this segment. The good news is that most of our cross-border flows are U.S. MCA compliant, which obviously mitigates most of the tariff impact. Our teams will continue to work this issue and further mitigate as needed. Now none of us are enjoying the continually evolving tariff situation. It is yet another example of the nimble execution capabilities of our organization.\nIn March, with all the tariff noise started kicking up in earnest, our business leaders went to work to countermeasure the risk and start reworking the necessary supply chain activity. Nice job by the teams and keep up the great work. Now turning to Verathon. Verathon continues to be rock solid for us, coming off an incredible 2024 and Q4, they did a nice job growing in Q1. The source of their strengths remain consistent their single-use bronchoscope or Beflex product leadership and their video Larngoscopy or GlideScope market leadership.\nImportantly, Verathon has built a true world-class new product development capability with several new product releases slated for this year. We look forward to talking about these new products as soon as they're launched. Turning to Neptune, which was just solid once again for us. They continue to do a great job with their ultrasonic meter go-to-market execution. Also, and importantly, in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of a cloud-based utility building software solution for Neptune. The Neptune team has long crafted their strategy based on the unique unmet needs of their customers.\nFrom their market research and ongoing discussions with customers, it became abundantly clear that Neptune could solve a persistent industry problem by closing the loop in the meter to cash cycle. This acquisition provides Neptune with the final piece of the strategy. So we look forward to talking about the enhanced customer value by fully connecting the water meter read to data management to billing and collection processes. Special thanks to Don Deemer and the entire Neptune leadership team for completing this incredibly strategic acquisition, exciting stuff. Of note, both Verathon and Neptune order momentum improved as the quarter progressed.\nTurning to our Citco Medical Products business. They unfortunately declined in the quarter based on a very difficult prior year comp. Finally, NDI nailed it in the quarter and we need a drag on this business and the team for a bit. They have proprietary and world-class precision measurement technologies used on health care applications worldwide. Over the past few years, the team has done an amazing job of hyper focusing on their medical markets and their OEM clients. In addition, they have built and are building a world-class go-to-market capability to match their product strength. Based on this, they're winning in important submarkets within health care, namely orthopedic surgery, interventional radiology and cardiac ablation. Great job, Dave and your entire team.\nTurning to the outlook for this segment. We continue to expect to see high single-digit revenue growth for the balance of the year. So with that, please turn to Page 16. Let's turn to our Q2 and increased full year 2025 guidance. Given our solid Q1 start, the closing of our Centralreach acquisition, and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're increasing our total revenue growth outlook from 10% to be in the 12% area.\nOur organic growth rate of 6% to 7% for the full year remains unchanged. Finally, we're increasing our full year debt outlook by $0.01 on the low and the high end to be $0.1980 to $0.2005. Included in this outlook is $0.15 of Centralreach dilution. Our guide continues to assume a full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% area.\nFor the second quarter, we expect adjusted debt to be between $480 million and $484 million and we are absorbing $0.05 of Centralreach dilution in the quarter. Now please turn us to Page 17, and then we'll open it up to your questions.\nWe'll conclude with the same for key takeaways with which we started. First, our first quarter financial results were solid, and our businesses remain very resilient to the current trade and macroeconomic dynamics. Second, we successfully completed the acquisition of Centralreach. Third, given our solid start to the year and the completion of the Centralreach acquisition, we're modestly raising our full year guidance. And finally, we remain well positioned for capital deployment, where we continue to have more than $5 billion of available firepower over the course of the next 12 months.\nDespite the macroeconomic uncertainties in the market, when it comes to acquisitions, Roper remains open for business. As it relates to our compounding model, we grew total revenue 12% and organic revenue 5% in the quarter and free cash flow of 12% over the last 12 months. We're delighted with our acquisition of Centralreach. As discussed, this vertical market leader is mission critical to the delivery of autism care and has several embedded structural growth drivers that will support its 20% revenue and EBITDA growth outlook.\nFinally, we continue to be very well positioned with more than $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy capital towards leading vertical market software businesses. Our M&A pipeline continues to be very active, ,our teams are engaged on several opportunities. It is always difficult to predict timing of deals, but we remain quite bullish on our ability to deploy capital this year. Keep in mind, at least historically, we have found times of uncertainty can be advantageous for deploying capital, think Verathon in the summer of 2020.\nAs usual, we're excited to pursue these opportunities with are unbiased and disciplined approach. Now as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper Simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by executing a low-risk strategy and running a dual threat offense.\nFirst, we have a proven powerful business model that begins with operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented business. Once a company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy.\nWe coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustainable organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Second, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate in this one manner on cultivating, curating and acquiring the next great vertical market leading business to add to a cash flow compounding flywheel.\nTaken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area, meaning we double our cash flow every 5 years or so. With that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor to your questions."

For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, transaction-related expenses associated with completed acquisitions, a charge related to the settlement of the PowerPlan 2020 litigation matter, and lastly, financial impact associated with our minority investments. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 4.\nI'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we'll take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you'll see the topics we plan to cover today. We'll start by highlighting our strong fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial and operating performance. We'll then go through results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our very impressive cash flow growth and performance. Then we'll discuss our segment highlights and introduce our 2025 and Q1 guidance. After closing remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please.\nAs we turn to Page 5, we want to highlight the 3 key takeaways for today's call. First, our cash flow growth was strong, once again demonstrating our consistent and durable compounding capability. Second, we entered 2025 with improving momentum. And third, we now have over $5 billion of acquisition firepower at a time when the M&A markets are becoming increasingly more attractive.\nNow as it relates to our cash flow compounding capability. 2024 was another example of how our model works. We grew revenue 14% in the year, which was nicely balanced between organic and inorganic contributions, and deployed $3.6 billion towards market-leading vertical software businesses headlined by our acquisitions of Procare and Transact Campus. Of note, our 2024 cohort of acquisitions not only meet all our historical criteria but also meets our higher growth and higher return ambitions. As a result, we grew free cash flow 16% for the year, topping $2 billion for the first time in our history, with free cash flow margins of 32%, another great year in our long history of cash flow compounding.\nAs we look to 2025, we're excited to talk through the positive momentum we're experiencing. First, we're seeing accelerating demand for our mission-critical solutions broadly across our businesses. Specifically, throughout 2024, our enterprise bookings accelerated, ending in the high teens growth area in Q4. This bookings momentum, combined with consistently high gross and net retention supports the continued growth and expansion and high singles area for a $4.6 billion base of software recurring and reoccurring revenues. Given this, we're initiating our 2025 total revenue guide to be north of 10% with organic revenue growth in the 6% to 7% range, with adjusted DEPS between $19.75 and $20.\nOn the capital deployment front, our disciplined approach will greatly benefit our company and our shareholders this year. Specifically, we now have over $5 billion of available M&A firepower. This is particularly important, given the backdrop of the current M&A market, one that is poised for high levels of deal activity over the next couple of years and more on this later. Great year, team, and look forward to seeing you at our leadership meeting next week.\nI'd like to ask everyone to turn to Page 6, where we'll discuss our long-term growth algorithm. In March of '23, we concluded our first ever Investor Day with the components of our long-term mid-teens cash flow growth algorithm, as you see here on the left. As you compare our '24 performance on the right-hand side to this, you'll note we're right in line with our strategy, namely posting 14% revenue growth, 41% core margin leverage and adding 800 basis points of growth through our capital deployment capability. This all yields 16% cash flow growth. Importantly, 2023's performance was quite similar with 15% revenue growth, solid operating leverage and consistently good cash flow growth.\nWe execute our algorithm by running a dual threat offense. Namely, first, driving consistent and improving levels of leveraged organic growth. And second, deploying the enterprises capital towards the best ideas that we consistently cultivate and execute upon. Importantly, as we do this, we not only grow, but we improve the underlying quality of our enterprise and our portfolio across several dimensions, including growth, the level of recurring revenue and asset intensity. In short, this is how our model works. 2024 is no exception, a year where our [indiscernible] ratio was quite high, and importantly, we have strong momentum heading into '25.\nSo with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our quarterly and full year results. Jason?\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil. Let's turn to Page 7. We had an excellent finish to 2024, with Q4 being our highest revenue quarter of the year at 16%, bringing us to just under $1.9 billion.\nAcquisitions contributed a solid 9% as a full quarter of Transact is going through, along with sequential gains realized at Procare.\nOrganic revenue grew 7% with our software segments coming in line with expectations, and our TEP segment slightly outperforming as I'll discuss shortly.\nEBITDA of $744 million was 13% over prior year and represented 39.6% of revenue. Core EBITDA margin, which excludes the impact from our 2024 acquisitions, was down 30 basis points compared to prior year. Of note, some of our software businesses, mainly within our AS segment, took $9 million of targeted and opportunistic restructuring actions, which they absorbed in the fourth quarter and which will better position these businesses going forward.\nDEPS of $4.81 was above our guidance range of $4.70 to $4.74 despite the costs associated with the restructuring. So all in, a very good quarter.\nNow I'll flip to Page 8, where I'll briefly cover our Q4 segment performance. Application Software posted 24% revenue growth, with an 18% contribution from acquisitions and 6% from organic growth. Importantly, organic recurring and reoccurring revenue grew 8% in the quarter and the year led by double-digit SaaS growth as customers move from on-premise to the cloud.\nEBITDA margin of 41.5% includes our 2024 acquisitions that come into Roper at lower margin but provide greater opportunity for margin expansion over time.\nCore margin is 30 basis points over prior year on a comparative basis.\nTurning to Network Software. Revenue growth of 3% was in line with expectations and an improvement over the last couple of quarters as our Freight Match business returned to growth. Neil will unpack the dynamics of 2025, but we expect the segment to post mid-single-digit growth in the year with exit velocity above that range.\nEBITDA margin here was spectacular, 57.4% in the quarter.\nTEP finished strong with 12% revenue growth in the quarter. Verathon capped off a terrific year with record revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Also, Neptune had outstanding operational execution across both mechanical and ultrasonic product lines. And EBITDA margin here was 120 basis points over prior year at 34.8%.\nAll right. Now we'll turn to Page 9. We'll look at the full year results. All in all, this was a great year for Roper. We delivered on our long-term growth algorithm with mid-teens revenue and free cash flow growth. This is underpinned by a balanced contribution of acquisition and organic revenue growth, which combined, came in at 14% to print at just over $7 billion of revenue, a new milestone for Roper.\nOur disciplined capital deployment strategy generates consistent and repeatable performance, which has been demonstrated over time and is what our investors can expect going forward. Organic growth is also repeatable and fortified and we're well positioned for further improvement.\nAs Neil mentioned, we ended the year with $4.6 billion of software recurring and reoccurring revenue that we expect to organically grow in the high single-digit range in 2025. Further, it's a good time to remind everyone that over 85% of our revenue is in the U.S. which limits currency and potential tariff risk while capturing domestic opportunities that lie ahead.\nEBITDA of over $2.8 billion was 13% versus prior year with EBITDA core margin consistent with the prior year.\nSo clicking into margins and operating leverage a bit. Core segment operating leverage was strong at 49%, and including corporate G&A, was 41%. We made significant progress in 2024 to build out expanded capital deployment and growth capabilities. So we see that continuing in 2025, but then moderating in 2026 and beyond with a return to leverage on corporate G&A.\nMost importantly, free cash flow was outstanding in 2024, as Neil had mentioned, coming in at nearly $2.3 billion and up 16% or $320 million over prior year with 32% free cash flow margins. We finished the year above expectations, which positions us quite well going into 2025.\nAnd just looking back since 2021, our free cash flow has compounded 14% if adjusted for Section 174 that went into effect in 2022. We are really pleased with the steady and consistent growth in cash flow. And as we move forward, we expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more.\nSo beyond the numbers you see here, we see great things happening within Roper. We have significantly enhanced and expanded our capital deployment team and processes. Additionally, our multiyear focus on talent is really taking shape as we're feeling the best business leaders in our history. And now we're starting to see those leaders hire great leaders. This is resulting in more data-driven strategies and more deeply connected operating plans that give us confidence in long-term acceleration of organic growth. Reflecting on my 18 years with Roper, I can say this is a banner year for both strategic and operating progress.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10 to discuss our balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 free cash flow was better than expected with 15% growth over prior year. Additionally, we exited our minority position in Certinia this quarter. As a reminder, Certinia is a professional services automation software company. We partnered with [indiscernible] Haveli to execute on a successful first chapter of a value creation plan. And in exiting our position, we received $246 million of proceeds, which is a 2x multiple of our invested capital over a 14-month period.\nSo a terrific financial outcome and a great learning opportunity to apply as we look at businesses that have higher growth profiles and profitability improvement potential. Thank you to the team at Haveli for the opportunity to partner and learn.\nAt quarter end, our net leverage was 2.6x. And as of today, we have near full access to our $3.5 billion revolver. So this plus our strong projected cash flow provides us with over $5 billion that we can deploy toward high-quality acquisition opportunities this year. And just to note, 2024 market activity was a little quieter than we originally expected. Despite this, we were able to deploy $3.6 billion for some great vertical market software businesses highlighted by Procare and Transact.\nIn 2025, we believe the [ log jam ] should break free. From our direct conversations with [ PE ] sponsors and from what many are stating publicly, there is a pressing need to provide liquidity to limited partners. Therefore, we anticipate being very busy this year on the deal front.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's review our Application Software segment. Revenue for the year grew by 21% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. EBITDA margins were 43% and core margins improved 40 basis points in the year. We like what we're seeing across the businesses in this segment.\nFrom a market perspective, we exit '24 in a much improved state and entered '25 with momentum, which is highlighted by our second half organic bookings growing solidly in the double-digit area. In addition, the recurring revenue base and retention levels remain quite healthy here.\nAnother thing we like across this segment is the amount of business and talent building that occurred throughout the year. For example, Deltek made meaningful investments in their cloud tech stack, specifically with Gen AI investments and saw meaningful improvement in enterprise bookings during the second half of the year. Importantly, this all occurred during our planned and scheduled CEO succession from Mike Corkery to Bob Hughes.\nSimilarly, Aderant was super good throughout 2024 while furthering their product lead with meaningful Gen AI deployments and cloud migration activity. In 2024, Aderant was our leading net retention business, reflecting their strong market position, innovation capabilities and strong customer intimacy.\nVertafore was superb in delivering their enterprise capabilities to the largest customers in the market while seeing compelling and steady bookings throughout the year, leading to consistently strong ARR growth.\nAs it relates to PowerPlan, Joe and the team there did an excellent job deploying their first cloud native product and migrating several critical industry-leading customers to this product. As a result, PowerPlan's ARR growth was the best in its history as the market continues to respond to PowerPlan's innovation.\nAs discussed at the onset of the call, we successfully deployed $3.6 billion towards vertical market software acquisitions with the largest [ tube ] being Procare and Transact Campus, both rolling up into this segment. Both are off to solid starts, and we look forward to their meaningful contributions to the segment and the enterprise in the many years to come.\nThe remaining businesses in this segment posted solid organic gains. Great job by our leaders and teams of this group throughout '24. We're proud of you and your accomplishments.\nNow turning to the outlook for '25. We expect to see consistent levels of organic growth towards the higher end of the mid-singles range. For the first quarter, we expect margins for this segment to be down year-over-year on a reported basis, similar to Q4 as Transact Campus acquisition revenues come in at a seasonally lower rate. Please turn with us to Page 13.\nOrganic revenue in our Network Software segment grew 3% for 2024. As we've discussed all year, our network growth rate was impacted by the market in our freight matching businesses and the [ riders ] and after strikes related to Foundry. Excluding these businesses, the segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 56.1%.\nSimilar to that of our Application Software segment, we're excited by the progress made across this group of businesses. For example, while DAT navigated difficult freight market conditions, [ Jeff Clemens, ] our new DAT leader, did a tremendous job advancing the tech stack and market position of DAT. Of note, our network has never been more resilient and the threat from fraudulent actors has been meaningfully mitigated.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we completed the DAT bolt-on acquisition, Trucker Tools. Trucker Tools is a perfect complement to DAT's offering, providing real-time visibility to the DAT network participants. As a reminder, DAT's strategy is to capitalize on its market leadership, providing continually increasing value to both sides of the freight network, helping to drive higher retention and enhanced network monetization.\nVery similar story of Foundry. While a difficult financial year due to the market conditions related to the strikes, Foundry continued to innovate at an accelerated pace with particular focus on Gen AI and computational AI-based features. This is one of the significant benefits of the Roper operating model. When one of our businesses hit a market issue, we continue to invest, if not accelerate investment, so we could be the primary market share benefactors when the market recovers, and this was certainly the case with DAT and Foundry in 2024.\nWe like what we saw across the balance of the companies here. By pipeline, aggressively upgraded their talent, better aligned their organizational structure with their customers' needs and had very solid ARR growth in 2024.\nIn ConstructConnect, where we executed another planned succession to Buck Brody as Matt Strazza took the reign at frontline was super in the year. This organization continues to be a learning organization, improving lead generation quality and conversions, which led to solid revenue and ARR growth. Importantly, ConstructConnect is building a set of potentially transformative products, leveraging AI technologies.\nFinally, the alternate site healthcare software businesses were once again solid in the year.\nAs we turn to the outlook, we expect to see revenue growth improve to be in the mid-singles range for the full year, benefited by DAT's network value capture and consistent performance across the remainder of this group. Given improvement throughout the year, we expect our 2025 organic exit run rate to be north of the mid-singles area. Organic revenue growth in the first quarter will be a bit lower than the full year in the low singles range given the Q1 comp created by MHA a year ago.\nPrior to turning to our TEP segment, we'd like to spend a moment talking about the significant strides we made with our Gen AI development and deployment over the last year. As you know, each of our businesses primarily competes on the notion of customer intimacy. This intimacy or super deep knowledge of our customers' businesses, needs and workflows is the unique and competitively differentiated advantage of Roper and our businesses.\nNow that Gen AI/LLMs are improving in fidelity and becoming increasingly more commoditized and cost-effective, we are laser focused on combining our intimacy, deep reservoir of data and these Gen AI technologies to innovate and deliver compelling solutions, and we made meaningful steps in this direction in 2024. To name some, Gen AI product assistance at Deltek and Aderant, the beginning of automated and specific client compliant time series -- time entries at Aderant, real-time fraud detection at DAT, post-production content creation automation at Foundry, automated construction takeoff at ConstructConnect, insurance forms automation at Vertafore, and many more exciting Gen AI technology deployments throughout 2025. The future is exciting in this regard, for sure.\nNow please turn to Page 14, and let's review our TEP segment's full year results. Revenues here grew 9% on a total and organic basis, and EBITDA margins came in at 35.2%, just great results here. We'll start with Verathon, which was simply awesome in '24. Verathon's strength is driven by the team's exceptional level of discipline, discernment and tenacity. Throughout 2024, Verathon just won in the marketplace, becoming the market share leader in the U.S. for single-use bronchoscopes and extending their global market share lead in video laryngoscope. Obviously, we continue to be bullish about Verathon and their future.\nFor the full year, Neptune was very, very good. They continue to see strong ultrasonic static meter demand and increasing adoption of their meter data management software offerings. And from an operational and market momentum view, they're exiting the year stronger than ever. Great job by the Neptune team.\nNDI or Northern Digital returned to growth in Q4 following a very challenging year due to the difficult comparable that resulted from a large customer product launch in 2023. Good things in the future for NDI.\nFinally, CIVCO and IPA ended the year with very good, if not great, financial results. Congrats.\nAs we look to 2025, we expect to see high single-digit revenue growth for this segment.\nSo with that, please turn with us to Page 16. Let's turn to our Q1 and full year 2025 guidance. Based on what we previously discussed in the segment overviews, we're initiating our 2025 financial guidance to grow total revenue north of 10%, which excludes any future capital deployment benefits. Embedded in this guide is organic revenue growth in the 6% to 7% range. Finally, we expect full year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $19.75 and $20. Our guide continues to assume a full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% area.\nFor the first quarter, we expect adjusted DEPS to be between $4.70 and $4.74 as we absorb lower acquired margins in Application Software and a tougher comp in our Network segment.\nNow please turn to Page 17, and then we'll open it up for your questions. We'll conclude with the same 3 key takeaways with which we started. First, our cash flow growth was strong, once again demonstrating our consistent and durable compounding capabilities. Second, we entered 2025 with improving momentum. And third, we now have over $5 billion of acquisition firepower at a time when the M&A markets are becoming increasingly attractive.\nAs it relates to our cash flow compounding model, we grew free cash flow 16% on the back of 14% total revenue and 6% organic revenue growth. Our M&A capability deployed $3.6 billion towards vertical market leaders, which helped drive our compounding flywheel but also improved the quality of our portfolio. Importantly, our fundamentals are strong, and we exit the year with quite positive momentum.\nWe saw a reacceleration of our fourth quarter organic revenue growth to 7%. Also on a full year basis, we grew our enterprise software bookings in the double-digit area, better in the second half, and continue to see high single-digit growth in our $4.6 billion recurring and reoccurring revenue base.\nImportantly, our enterprise continues to get better as we grow. In 2024, we upgraded key leadership talent, a few of which we highlighted earlier. We expanded our capital deployment capabilities and capacity, advance our operating model and made meaningful strides developing and deploying Gen AI-based solutions.\nFinally, we are very well positioned with more than $5 billion of available M&A firepower to deploy capital towards leading vertical market software businesses. The M&A markets are very active and appear to be accelerating pace given the increasing pressure limited partners are placing on their private equity [ GPs ] for liquidity. Our M&A team is very busy cultivating and building a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities. As usual, we're excited to pursue these opportunities with our unbiased and disciplined approach.\nNow as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic compounding flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by executing a low-risk strategy and running our dual threat offense.\nFirst, we have a proven powerful business model that begins with operating a portfolio of market-leading, application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustainable organic growth rates and underlying business quality.\nSecond, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on cultivating, curating and acquiring the next great vertical market-leading businesses to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel.\nTaken together, we compound our cash flow over the long arc of time in the mid-teens area, meaning we double our cash flow every 5 years or so.\nSo with that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support, and open the floor to your questions. Operator, please go ahead."

The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us. We discussed the second quarter 2024 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon Callahan, Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website. Now if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.\nAnd now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and financial impacts associated with minority investments. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning. As we turn to Page 4, you can see the topics we'll cover today. I'll start by highlighting our second quarter performance, Jason will then go through our financial results in greater detail, review our balance sheet, including our M&A capacity and discuss our strong cash flow performance. Then I'll walk through our segment highlights and discuss our guidance for the full year. After our closing remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions. So let's go ahead and get started.\nNext slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, three key takeaways for today's call are: first, we delivered another solid quarter results; second, we're increasing the bottom end of our full year outlook; and third, we continue to be very well positioned relative to executing on our capital deployment strategy. To double-click a bit. We grew total revenue by 12%, organic revenue by 4% and EBITDA by 13% with EBITDA margins expanding by 20 basis points to 40.5%. Importantly, we saw good bookings momentum with organic enterprise software bookings increasing in the high single digits area during the quarter. Finally, we grew free cash flow of 24% in the quarter and 35% on a TTM basis. Also, TTM free cash flow margins came in at 32%.\nWe are also increasing our full year 2024 guidance on the low end and maintaining our outlook for total revenue and organic revenue reflecting our continued confidence in our outlook, notwithstanding some production efficiency challenges at Neptune, which we'll discuss in a bit. And we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that continues to improve and one where we have a large pipeline of highly attractive opportunities. Net-net, we continue to be quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front this year.\nSo with that, let me turn the call over to Jason to walk through our P&L and key balance sheet metrics. Jason?\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil, and good morning to those joining the call. As always, thank you for your interest in Roper. If we look at Slide 6, I will provide an update on Q2, both against prior year and against a longer historical time frame. Revenue was $1.72 billion, which is 12% higher than prior year. Underpinning this was organic growth of 4% and an acquisition contribution of 8%, driven mostly by Procare and Syntellis. Organic recurring software revenue grew 6% and as we cycle through the tougher comps at Freight Match and Foundry, which we've outlined in prior calls. We see signs of stabilization in both the Freight and Media and Entertainment markets, which Neil will discuss further.\nGiven our leadership positions and continued innovation investments at DAT, Loadlink and Foundry, we are confident that these businesses will capture growth upon market recovery. Also of note, organic growth in our tech segment was 5% with some production delays at Neptune. EBITDA was $695 million, which is 13% over prior year and yielded EBITDA margin of 40.5%, representing 20 basis points of expansion. Debt of $4.48 was above our guidance range of $4.42 to $4.46. Free cash flow was quite good at $367 million, up 24% over prior year and bringing year-to-date growth to 19%. Broadly over 3 years, our Q2 revenue has compounded 13% through a combination of organic growth and our consistent repeatable and disciplined M&A process. Q2 EBITDA CAGR over the same period has outpaced revenue at 14%.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow compounded at 10%. Adjusting for cash tax payments related to Section 174, which went into effect in 2022, the normalized CAGR is 12% over this 3-year period. Just looking at our current trailing 12-month performance against the prior TTM period, free cash flow of $2.1 billion grew 35% with free cash flow margins of 32%. We expect this to normalize in the second half and for 2024, we continue to expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. With that, we can turn to Slide 7 to go through our financial position.\nWith our strong Q2 cash flow, we paid down the revolver by $300 million, which brings our drawn balance down to $1.45 billion on a $3.5 billion capacity facility. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now sits at 2.7x, which when coupled with future cash generation provides us with capacity to deploy $4 billion or more towards market-leading BMS businesses. On the capital deployment front, we have been quite busy over the second quarter and expect that to continue into the second half. Now I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk through our segment detail and updated guidance.\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 9, let's review our Application Software segment results. Revenue here grew by 21% in total and organic revenue grew by 5%. EBITDA margins were 43.6%. We experienced strong performance across this portfolio of businesses with organic recurring and reoccurring revenue growing in the high single-digit area. So let's start with Deltek. Our software business serving the government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction contractor markets. Deltek was solid in the quarter. We saw continued momentum across our private sector solutions and improved bookings activity and revenue within their GovCon business.\nImportantly, and as we started to highlight last quarter, Deltek's new GenAI-powered digital assistant Dela is in the process of integrated across Deltek's core suite of software applications. We're keen to see the customer workflow efficiency benefits take route as Dela is deployed throughout the Deltek tech stack, exciting for sure. Turning to Aderant. Our software business focused on the needs of large law firms continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter with continued SaaS momentum and GenAI-focused innovation. The Aderant team is consistently delivering new GenAI-powered capabilities across our platform, enabling meaningful efficiencies in creating significant value for their customers in areas like billing, receivables management and time entry.\nAlso, Vertafore and Frontline performed well in the quarter with strong net dollar retention and bookings growth. Also during the quarter, we completed our periodic strategic reviews with each of these businesses and left the reviews encouraged by the long-term opportunities in front of each. PowerPlan, our financial planning and tax software business serving heavy fixed industries was impressive yet again in the quarter and grew its ARR with strong net dollar retention and adoption of its new SaaS solution. Excited to see the progress the PowerPlan team is making. Our health care IT businesses led by Strata and data innovations were also strong in the quarter.\nAs it relates to Strata, the combination with Syntellis continues to go very well with the vast majority of the cost synergies now in the rearview mirror. Great job by the team implementing this portion of the value creation plan. Since the completion of the transaction with Syntellis, the sales pipeline has continued to fill with substantial growth opportunities with several of these opportunities converting to bookings during the quarter. Further to this end, with the cost synergy faced behind the team, their full attention is now focused on long-term growth-related initiatives about which we are quite bullish and look forward to discussing in the quarters to come.\nAs for data innovations, we saw accelerated growth in the quarter with customer decision-making returning to normal, encouraging for sure. Finally, Procare, the most recent addition to the Roper family companies is off to a strong start. For the second half of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth trending to the upper end of this range for this segment. Please turn is to Page 10. Organic revenue in our Network Software segment grew 2% in the quarter and was impacted by the fact we continue to experience pressure with our Freight Matching businesses and work through the impact on Foundry in the recent actors and rider strikes. Excluding our Freight Matching businesses and Foundry, the segment grew in the mid-singles area, which demonstrates the underlying quality of this group of market-leading businesses.\nEBITDA margins continue to be strong at 54.8%. Let's dig into the details and start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which declined slightly as expected due to the continuing challenging freight market conditions that adversely impact both businesses. That said, the market appears stable, both on the carrier and broker side, bouncing along the bottom, if you will. Notwithstanding this and is typical for Roper, we invest for long-term sustainable and improving levels of organic growth. In DAT's case, we're absolutely doing this, leading the industry with GenAI-enabled fraud detection and prevention tools.\nAlso, and importantly, in the quarter, we welcomed a new DAT CEO [ June ] team, Jeff Clemens. Jeff has a long and successful career in network and software businesses, and we look forward to working with him to deliver the next chapter of DAT's growth. Now let's turn to Foundry, our postproduction media and entertainment software business. Foundry continued to roll out innovative product updates and [ ML ] powered functionality this quarter, enhancing the creative process for high-quality visual effects. Given the continued impact related to the recent industry strikes Foundry declined in the quarter as expected. That said, the current content production pipeline is filling and Foundry's customers are beginning to reramp their capacity, which gives us confidence Foundry return to more normalized growth next year.\nAs mentioned, the balance of this segment grew mid-singles organically in the quarter with solid execution across this portfolio of businesses. By pipeline, our life insurance and annuities network software business has strong renewals, customer expansions and market activity, especially in the annuities market. ConstructConnect continued its solid march of improved financial results and bookings momentum. In addition, ConstructConnect continues to lead the market with their GenAI power and take off and estimating solutions. Great job by Matt, Buck and the entire ConstructConnect team. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses performed well with MHA benefiting from increased operational focus and rigor and improvement in senior care occupancy rates.\nSoftWriters, our LTC pharmacy software business continued their cadence of solid execution, well done. For the second half of the year, we expect the difficult freight market conditions to persist which resulted in our continued low single-digit organic revenue growth outlook for this segment. Now please turn to Page 11, and let's review our TEP segment's results. Revenue here grew 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remain strong at 36.2%. We'll start with Verathon. Verathon had very strong growth across all through its product families and once again executed at an exceptional level in the quarter. The long-term success of Verathon is directly attributable to its leadership team building the business and all the underlying processes to enable sustainable long-term and improved organic growth.\nThis long-term disciplined focus is truly a competitive advantage for Verathon. Neptune continues to be solid and delivered another record quarter financial results. Demand remains strong and consistent with our expectations. Also, the Neptune team did a great job commissioning substantial ultrasonic meter capacity during the first half of this year, both of which are great relative to Neptune's long-term success. However, Neptune struggled in the quarter to achieve the manufacturing efficiency needed to deliver on the mechanical meter demand. We anticipate this to progressively be resolved through the balance of this year.\nNorthern Digital, or NDI, declined as expected in the quarter. As a reminder, NDI is our market-leading precision measurement business. NDI partners with the world's leading medical device manufacturers to deliver innovative health care applications that require super precise navigation such as robotic surgery and cardiac procedures to name a couple. Their long-term historical growth rate has been in the double-digit area. However, NDI is declining this quarter and this year based on customer program timing. Notwithstanding the first half performance, NDI continues to see strong OEM order activity, and we fully expect NDI to return to their normalized organic growth rate next year.\nFinally, IPA Inovonics and rf IDEAS declined against a difficult prior year comp. As a reminder, these businesses started recovering from supply chain challenges this quarter a year ago. For the balance of the year, we expect the TEP segment to grow in the mid-single to high singles range, which is slightly below our prior expectation of high singles growth due to the mechanical meter production efficiency timing at Neptune. We do expect to return to high singles growth in the fourth quarter as Neptune's efficiency improvements take hold. Please turn with us to Page 13. Now let's review our full year 2024 guidance and discuss the third quarter outlook.\nBased on our first half performance, enterprise momentum and our confidence in our outlook, we're maintaining our 12% total revenue growth and 6% organic revenue growth outlook for the full year. In addition, we're raising at the bottom end of our full year guidance of touch to be in the range of $18.10 and $18.25. Our guidance continues to assumes full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted debt to be between $4.50 and $4.54. Now please turn us to Page 14, and then we'll open it up for your questions.\nWe'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. First, we delivered a solid quarter of financial results, Second, we're increasing the low end of our outlook for the full year. And third, we are very well positioned relative to our capital deployment strategy. For the quarter, we delivered 12% total revenue and 4% organic revenue growth while increasing our EBITDA 13%. Importantly, free cash flow was strong, growing 24% in the quarter and 35% on a trailing 12-month basis. Free cash flow margins were 32% on a TTM basis as well.\nNext, we're maintaining our full year outlook for 12% total revenue and 6% organic revenue growth and increasing the bottom end of our full year guidance. We're confident in our outlook given the mission criticality of our solutions, the ongoing expansion of our recurring revenue base and seeing HSD growth in our enterprise software bookings.\nFinally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with over 4 [ billion ] capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets are very active. We have a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach. We remain quite bullish about our ability to execute this partner strategy over the balance of this year and into the future. Now as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper [indiscernible] we compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses.\nOnce a company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their long-term and sustained organic growth rates and underlying business quality. Finally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses in a deliberate and disciplined manner on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area. So with that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor for your questions. Operator, please go ahead."

After our closing remarks, we'll open the floor for your questions.\nSo let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, 3 key takeaways for today's call. First, we delivered another strong quarter results. Second, we're increasing our full year outlook. And third, we continue to be very well positioned relative to capital deployment. So all click a bit. We grew total revenue by 14%, organic revenue by 8% and EBITDA by 16%, with EBITDA margin expanding by 60 basis points to 40.2%.\nWe grew depth by 13% to 441 beating our guidance range. We grew free cash flow 15% year-over-year with free cash flow margins of 31%. We also completed the acquisition of ProCare Solutions, a leading provider of software and integrated payments for the early childhood education market for $1.75 billion. ProCare is a great addition to Roper. We remain very excited about the business and are especially pleased with the initial results and progress we've made during the onboarding process.\nWe're also increasing our full year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and depths reflecting our strong momentum and continued confidence in our outlook. And we continue to be very active in the M&A market an environment that continues to improve and 1 where we have a very large pipeline of high-quality and attractive opportunities.\nNet-net, we're quite bullish about our ability to be active on the M&A front this year. As you can see, we had a great start to 2024, and we're well positioned to deliver yet another strong year of performance and growth. Now let me turn the call over to Jason. Jason?\n\nJeffrey Todd Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nThanks, Neil. Let's dive right in on Slide 6. Q1 was an excellent first installment to 2024. Revenue was 14% over prior year to $1.68 billion. Organic growth of 8% was led by double-digit growth at our tech segment and solid mid-single-digit growth across our application software and network software segments.\nOf note, organic recurring revenue grew 7% and despite known headwinds at our Freight Match and foundry businesses. Acquisitions contributed 6 points of growth led by Syntellis, which is a large bolt-on for our STRATA platform that closed in Q3 of last year, and ProCare, which closed at the end of February.\nRegarding ProCare, integration is going really well, and we're excited to work with Joe and Kinzel and her team to drive continued growth and innovation in the attractive early child education market. EBITDA was $76 million, which was 16% over prior year. EBITDA incremental margin of 44% translated into EBITDA margin of 40.2% and represented 60 basis points of expansion. This was fueled by gross margin expansion of 100 basis points to 70.3%.\nOur market-leading businesses compete on customer intimacy and deliver demonstrable value to their customers which we consistently realize in our high gross margin profile. DEPS of 441 was above our guidance of $4.30 to $4.34. Importantly, free cash flow was strong at $513 million, up 15% over prior year and our trailing 12-month free cash flow surpassed $2 billion for the first time in Roper's history.\nLooking over a 4-year horizon, revenue and EBITDA CAGRs are 13% on a quarterly basis. For free cash flow, we take a broader lens and a review on a trailing 12-month basis, which generated an 11% CAGR over this period. Adjusting for cash tax payments related to Section 174 which went into effect and impacted the period -- the current period's free cash flow by $80 million.\nThe normalized CAGR is 13% over this period. For 2024, we still expect free cash flow margins of 30% or more. With that, we can turn to Slide 7 to talk about our balance sheet. Following our ProCare acquisition, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came in at 2.9x at quarter end. Our revolver, which provides us with $3.5 billion of immediate liquidity was utilized to fund the ProCare acquisition, bringing the drawn balance to $1.75 billion.\nWith strong, consistent cash generation and a well-positioned balance sheet, we have the capacity to deploy $4 billion or more towards high-quality acquisitions. And I'll reiterate our commitment to remain a solid investment-grade issuer as access to investment-grade capital markets is fundamental to our strategy. In terms of what we're seeing in deal markets, our pipeline of acquisition opportunities is growing and quite attractive. As always, we will remain patient and disciplined in allocating capital to opportunities with highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk through our segment detail and updated guidance.\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 9, let's review our Application Software segment results. Revenues here grew by 18% in total and organic revenue grew by 6%. EBITDA margins were 43.3%. We experienced strong performance across this portfolio of businesses.\nWe'll start with Deltek. Our enterprise software business survey the government contracting, architecture, engineering and construction contractor markets. Deltek continued to grow at SaaS solutions, especially within their private sector markets. Importantly, in the quarter, Deltek launched a new Gen AI-powered digital assistant which will be integrated across LTC's core software applications. We also welcome Bob Hughes as the new CEO of Deltek. Bob brings a wealth of software and leadership experience to the role having most recently served as the Chief Customer and Strategy Officer at UG. Bob, we're thrilled to be working with you.\nWe also welcome Mike Corkery into his new role as a full-time group executive within Roper. For those who do not know, Mike was Deltek's CEO for nearly 12 years, more than standing our entire ownership period. Mike, thank you for building a tremendous market-leading company. Not only is Deltek grown multifold during their leadership tenure. The underlying quality has massively improved and the culture has never been better. Thank you for everything you've accomplished and we're very much looking forward to working with you in your new leadership capacity at Roper.\nAderant continues to perform incredibly well in the market and had another great quarter with continued SaaS momentum and Gen AI-focused innovation. Vertafore also performed well with solid growth in their ARR base.\nTurning to PowerPlan. Our financial planning and tax software business serving the heavy fixed asset industries, PowerPlan was impressive in the quarter and grew its ARR with strong customer retention and adoption of its new SaaS solution. Great job here. Our healthcare IT businesses led by Strata and data innovations were also strong in the quarter. We're especially pleased to see the solid go-to-market execution at both businesses.\nFinally, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we completed the acquisition of ProCare Solutions, which is off to a good start and complements this segment with a higher organic growth profile. For the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment.\nPlease turn with us to Page 10. Revenues in our Network Software segment grew 5% in total and 4% on an organic basis despite the fact we continue to experience pressure with our Freight Matching businesses and the impact on foundry related to the recent actor strike and right of strike. EBITDA margins continue to be strong at 55.9% and grew about 10% and year-over-year. As we dig into the details of it, we'll start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink which declined slightly as expected due to the challenging freight market conditions that affected each of these businesses.\nAs is typical for Roper, we invest for long-term sustainable and improving levels of organic growth. In DAT's case, we're leading the industry with Gen AI-enabled fraud detection and prevention tools. As many know, fraud across the transport ecosystem remains a cause of great concern and economic loss.\nTurning to Foundry, which continues to innovate at an impressive clip both in terms of major product enhancements and customer productivity-based AI ML innovations. That said, Foundry declined a bit in the quarter as expected, given the recent industry strikes. Notwithstanding the headwinds of DAT, Loadlink and Foundry we grew 4% organically in this segment based on the strength across the balance of this portfolio.\nSpecifically, Pipeline, our life insurance and annuities network software business had strong renewals, customer expansions and market activity, especially in the annuities market. ConstructConnect continued its solid mark but improved financial results and enhance its network value with Gen AI-powered solutions. And MHA had a strong quarter, benefiting from increased operational focus and rigor revenue timing related to one of MHA's data partnerships and improvement in senior care occupancy rates.\nFor the balance of the year, although we did a touch better than expected in the first quarter, we continue to expect to see low single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment based on the continued difficult freight market conditions and our view that foundries recovery will be extended through this year.\nNow please turn to Page 11, and let's review our test segment's results. Revenues here grew 17% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins remained strong at 34.3%. Neptune continued to see notable customer demand, in particular for their ultrasonic meters and meter data management software. In short, Neptune delivered another quarter of growth. Verathon had very strong growth across all 3 of its product families and executed at an exceptional level in the quarter.\nOf note, Verathon had a record number of large account wins further demonstrating their market momentum. Great job by team Verathon. We also had strong execution and growth led by healthcare end markets from SIFCO, Anibonics, IPA and RFID.\nAs we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, let us remind you that we expected to have a stronger first quarter, which we delivered. That said, for the balance of the year, we expect to see organic revenue for this segment to be in the high single-digits area.\nNow please turn to Page 13. Now let's review our increased full year 2024 guidance and discuss our Q2 outlook. Based on our strong Q1 results, enterprise momentum and our confidence in our outlook, we are raising our guidance for 2024. For the full year, we now expect total revenue to grow in the 12% area, up from our initial guide of 11% to 12%. Organic revenues to grow about 6%, up from 5% to 6% originally and adjusted debt to be in the range of $18.05 and $18.25, up from $17.85 to $18.15 previously.\nOur guidance continues to assume a full year effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. For Q2, we expect adjusted debt to be in the range of $4.42 and $4.46. Now please turn it to Page 14, and we'll open it up for your questions. As per custom, we'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started.\nFirst, we delivered another strong quarter results. Second, we're increasing our outlook for the full year. And third, we are very well positioned relative to capital deployment. For the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, adjusted debt and free cash flow with margin expansion and very strong cash flow conversion. Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of ProCare Solutions, which is a great addition to our enterprise and our application software segment.\nAnd we're increasing our full year 2024 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and depths reflecting our confidence in our outlook and continued momentum. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position with $4 billion plus of capacity for capital deployment. The M&A markets are very active. We have a very robust pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities that we're excited to pursue with our unbiased and disciplined approach.\nWe're quite bullish about our ability to execute this part of our strategy over the course of 2024. Now as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment, so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve the organic growth rates and underlying business quality.\nFinally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow over a long arc of time in the mid-teens area.\nWith that, we'd like to thank you for your continued interest and support and open the floor to your questions."

The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and [indiscernible], Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results.

After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our quite good 2023 4th quarter and full year results with you this morning.\nAs we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. This morning, I'll start by walking through our full year highlights and then we turn to commenting on our most recent acquisition, ProCare Solutions. Jason will then go through our quarterly results, both in aggregate and at the segment level, share our annual results and review our strong balance sheet position. Then I'll pick up and discuss our segment level annual results, our 2024 outlook, wrap up and turn to your questions. So let's go ahead and get started.\nNext slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the 2 key takeaways for today's call are: first, we delivered a very strong 2023. And second, we remain well positioned and are carrying positive momentum into 2024. As we look back on the full year, we're proud of what the organization accomplished. From a financial perspective, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth with free cash flow margins at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth. Jason will cover this in a few minutes, but Q4 was strong as well with 13% total revenue growth and 8% organic revenue growth. Also during the year, we deployed $2.1 billion in the high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. As we all know, last year was a challenged year relative to available acquisition opportunities, given that I'm super proud of our team's ability to grind through the market conditions and successfully convert 2 outstanding value-creation M&A opportunities.\nGiven all this, we entered this year with positive momentum. We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical solutions. As a reminder, each of our businesses is a leader in their respective market and delivers system of record, network critical or vital and/or life-saving technologies. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. Also, as we head into 2024, we have meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, Syntellis, Replicon and ProCare. It is important to highlight these additions to our portfolio of businesses also improved the underlying quality of our enterprise in terms of reoccurring revenue mix and organic growth profile.\nFinally, we continue to be very active in the M&A market, an environment that we expect to be notably improved in 2024 and with a strong balance sheet and a large pipeline of attractive opportunities. So a strong '23 and solid momentum, both organic and inorganic behind us as we enter 2024.\nNow please turn to the next page, Page 6, where we'll discuss our most recent acquisition, ProCare Solutions. Procare Solutions is a fantastic addition to the Roper portfolio. Let's start with the fundamentals. We're paying $1.75 billion, net of $110 million tax benefit for the business. We expect ProCare to contribute about $260 million of revenue and $95 million of EBITDA for the 12 months ended Q1 '25. ProCare will be accretive to our free cash flow in '24 and to our adjusted debt in '25. We'll fund the acquisition with a portion of a $3.5 billion revolver and will report ProCare in our Application Software segment and expected deals to close this quarter. ProCare meets all our long-standing acquisition criteria, leader in a smaller market, delivers mission-critical verticalized software solutions, competes based on customer intimacy, operates an asset-light business model and is led by a skilled, passionate leadership team. What is incrementally different for us is the maturing leader nature of this company. As we outlined during our Investor Day last year, our corporate strategy leans on implementing 2 modest improvements. First, continue to improve our long-term sustainable organic growth rate; and second, capture more value from our capital deployment capacity.\nRelative to additional capital deployment value capture, we are focusing on doing a higher proportion of bolt-on activity as evidenced by last year's capital deployment record and adding higher growth or maturing leader business profiles to our enterprise. Procare is a prototypical maturing leader archetype, meeting all our long-standing criteria that I mentioned above but a structurally faster growth business that possesses the opportunity to improve margins as the top line scales. For ProCare, we expect mid-teens top line growth with improving margins from an already strong position for the years to come. Let's talk about what the company does.\nProCare is the leading provider of mission-critical and purpose-built software to 37,000 owners and operators of early childhood education centers which they use to run their business. The software provides all the needed functionality to run the childcare center, ranging from parent and family engagement, staff and teacher scheduling, classroom management, tuition billing and payment processing. The market itself is quite attractive in the midst of a long-term secular tailwind of young dual-income families seeking higher levels of early child education versus day care.\nIn addition, like most industries, this 1 is undergoing long-term tech enablement. Given these factors, this market is growing annually in the low double-digit area. As mentioned, ProCare is the leading player with a 1.5x role market share advantage in this space given their super compelling value proposition that combines both software and the integrated payments capabilities. Given this, ProCare has very high gross retention and compelling net retention as well.\nFinally, from our extensive due diligence of the business, we're encouraged by the fact that broker has multiple strategic and operating pathways available to deliver mid-teens growth and long-term margin expansion. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for Roper and our shareholders and to Joanne, your leadership team and all the ProCare family, welcome to Roper.\nSo with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our very strong financial position. Jason?\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Neil. I'll walk through the enterprise and segment results for Q4 and enterprise results for the full year, along with a review of our balance sheet. Starting with Q4 on Slide 7. We have an excellent finish to a strong year. Revenue of over $1.6 billion was 13% over prior year, led by 8% organic growth with acquisitions adding 4 points and less than a point of currency benefit. Organic outperformance was led by our TEP segment, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon. Gross margin of 69.7% was down 30 basis points versus prior year, given a higher mix coming from our TEP segment. EBITDA grew 11% to $659 million with EBITDA margin coming in at a solid 40.8%. With the offsetting impact of interest and taxes, this translated into debt's growth of 11% to $4.37, above our guidance range of $4.28 to $4.32, finished strong at $596 million, up 30% over prior year. This was in [indiscernible] with a good renewal season across our software businesses.\nWe turn to Slide 8, I'll briefly click into the segment performance in Q4. Application Software delivered revenue growth of 15% over prior year to $852 million, with organic growth contributing 7 points and the balance coming primarily from our bolt-on acquisitions of Syntellis and Replicon. EBITDA margin of 43.2% in the quarter was below prior year's high watermark of 45.6%, which as we discussed last year was driven by lower incentive-based compensation.\nNetwork software was up free EBITDA up 10% to $208 million. As we have discussed before, our freight matching businesses are navigating a drawdown of carriers following exceptional marketplace growth over 2021 and 2022, which is mixing down the growth rate for the segment. We have aligned the cost base with reduced carrier subscribers to still drive solid EBITDA growth in the quarter.\nOur TEP segment grew by 17% in the quarter to $399 million, with EBITDA up 13% to $134 million. [indiscernible] Technologies and overall favorable market conditions. Also, Verathon continued its remarkable growth with strength in single-use products across laryngoscope and brochoscope. EBITDA margin of 33.6% was down from prior year, given some onetime investments and incentive compensation in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 9, I'll walk through our full year 2023 performance. As Neil mentioned, revenue was just under $6.2 billion, up 15% over prior year, with organic growth of 8% and acquisitions contributing 7 points, mainly in frontline and Syntellis. Looking at a 3-year revenue CAGR on this slide, similar to 2023, it's also at 15%. Further, the organic -- average organic growth rate over this 3-year period has been about 8%. Though as Neil will mention, we benefited from some market conditions over that time period. EBITDA of just over $2.5 billion was up 16% over the prior year, yielding EBITDA margin of 40.6%. Our 3-year EBITDA over this period was also [indiscernible] up remains the same at Roper. We own and continually grow a portfolio of high gross margin businesses, and generally convert EBITDA growth to EBITDA in the 45% range, which allows for ample investment back into the business for future sustainable growth.\nFree cash flow for the year was just shy of $2 billion. which represents a 32% margin and is going Stanley up 32% over 2022. Full year contribution from our frontline acquisition and excellent performance across the enterprise drove this result. Underpinned by strong renewals, favorable DSO and improving inventory turns. Of note, our net working capital as a percent of annualized revenue was negative 19% in Q4, which is a new record for Roper. Importantly, over a 3-year period, we have compounded cash flow at 16%. Our consistent focus on growing cash flow and the strength of our new portfolio following our divestitures demonstrates a solid base from which to continue our long-term growth algorithm. To that end, we expect free cash flow margin to be 30% or more in 2024.\nWith that, we can flip to Slide 10 to discuss our strong financial position. From a liquidity standpoint, we finished the year with $3.14 billion available on our revolver with over $200 million of cash. Regarding leverage, we brought down net debt-to-EBITDA from 2.7x at the beginning of 2023 to a year-end figure of 2.4x despite deploying $2.1 billion towards acquisitions. We expect to close on ProCare later in Q1 and will utilize our revolver to fund the transaction. So this will be our pro forma leverage to about 3x. Our solid balance sheet, coupled with strong cash generation gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more of capital while remaining committed to our solid investment-grade rating.\nSince our October call, deal activity has demonstrably increased with a corresponding lift in asset quality. That said, our market optimism remains balanced by our disciplined process and patient posture.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Neil to talk about our full year segment performance and indications for 2024. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. As we turn to Page 12, let's look back on the year for Application Software segment. Total revenues grew 21% and organic revenues grew 6% to $3.19 billion, while EBITDA margins remained strong at 43.7%. Within the segment, results were consistent with strength at Deltek, Aderant, Vertafore, Strata and Frontline.\nDeltek continued to see strong gains in our SaaS solutions, especially in the private sector markets, as discussed throughout the year, the Deltek market was tempered given all the uncertainty regarding government spending, notwithstanding Deltek delivered mid-single-digit organic growth for the year. In addition, they can continue to innovate and add capabilities during times of uncertainty, which is a hallmark of Roper strategy, highlighted by the bolt-ons of Replicon and [indiscernible]. [indiscernible] a smaller transaction, about $80 million purchase price, that closed late last year and delivers the leading contract pricing solutions and software for government contractors and federal agencies and ideal strategic fit for Deltek's Costpoint product family.\nAderant was just amazing last year. They had record bookings and significant adoption of their anchor SaaS solutions and add-on products. Also, Aderant is 1 of the leaders within Roper, and the legal software market as it relates to productizing generative AI solutions within their product stack. Great job by Chris, Rafi and the entire team at Aderant.\nContinuing on, Vertafore was solid with strong ARR gains throughout the year. Additionally, Vertafore made great strides with our product strategy deployment and the MGA systems bolt-on is trending well ahead of our investment case. Data also was quite good last year, both in terms of organic ARR gains and their acquisition and integration work associated with Syntellis. Finally, frontline executed well, delivering strong retention and cash flow during the year. As I mentioned earlier, we will report ProCare solutions in this segment and expected deal to close this quarter. As it relates to our 2024 outlook for this segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.\nPlease turn with us to Page 13. Full year organic revenue for our Network segment grew 5% to $1.44 billion and margins were strong at 55.2%. We'll start with our freight matching businesses, DAT and Load Link which both grew in the year despite the year-long muted freight market conditions. Similar to that of Deltek, both businesses continue to innovate during the sluggish market with particularly interesting Gen AI innovations at DAT to help combat industry fraud. Pipeline delivered record bookings and had very strong customer retention and expansion activity, leading to strong ARR growth.\nFoundry, our postproduction media and entertainment software business muscle through the year given the riders and actor strikes and made meaningful progress in the transition to a full subscription revenue model. Finally, our alternate site health care businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP, were strong throughout the year as census levels in senior care facilities improved. As it relates to our full year 2024 guide for the segment, we expect to see low single-digit organic revenue growth based on the expectation of continued muted freight market conditions but with continued strong EBITDA margin performance.\nNow please turn to Page 14, and let's review our tests segment's results. Organic revenues for the year grew 15% to $1.55 billion and EBITDA margins remain consistent at 35.3%. As we look back over the year, we entered the year with a high degree of supply chain uncertainty. During the year, the vast majority of these uncertainties were resolved, and our businesses did a tremendous job of capturing the opportunity. As we exit '23 and look to '24, we do not see meaningful supply chain constraints. As usual, we'll start with Neptune, our water meter and technology business. Neptune was just great and continues to see strong demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters and increasing adoption of their meter data management software. We remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete.\nVerathon was awesome as well for the year. Verathon was strong across all 3 of their product families: Ultrasonic, Bladder volume measurement, video-assisted innovation and single-use brochoscope. As a reminder, Verathon's reoccurring single-use offerings now make up about 55% of the business' annual revenue stream. Just an amazing product and business execution journey to both scale and improve the underlying quality of the business. Finally, our RF product businesses, and [ Avonex ] and [ FIDs ], did a terrific job managing through their supply chain challenges and delivered very strong 2023 financial performance.\nLooking to our 2024 guidance for this segment. We expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth for the full year and the expectation that Q1 will grow in the mid-teens area. Now please turn with us to Page 16. This morning, we're establishing our 2024 full year and first quarter guidance. For the full year, which includes the impact of ProCare solutions, we expect to see total revenue growth between 11% and 12%. On an organic basis, we expect to see full year 2024 revenue grow between 5% and 6% and finally, we expect to see full year adjusted debt to be in the range of 1785 and 1815, which includes about $0.10 to $0.15 of depths dilution associated with the ProCare deal. Assumed in this guidance a tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. We want to take a moment to set our guide in context of our long-term strategy and execution model. To remind everyone, historically, we operated a 5% to 6% organic growth portfolio. Our strategy and ambition are to structurally improve organic growth rate to be in the 8% to 9% area.\nOver the last 3 years, we grew 8%, 9% and 8% on an organic basis, though these years were benefited to some extent from certain market conditions. As such, our view is our current course and speed organic growth rate is in the 7% to 7.5% area. We are very pleased with our progress to date and continue to work to achieve organic growth aspirations. As it relates to organic revenue outlook for '24, we entered the year mindful of 2 factors: continued subdued large customer activity in our Application Software segment and our freight matching businesses within our Network segment, being below trend based on our expectations for continued muted freight market conditions. As it relates to the first quarter, we expect to see adjusted debt in the range of $4.30 and $4.34.\nNow please turn with us to Page 17, and then we'll look forward to your questions. As per our custom, we'll conclude with the same key takeaways with which we started. One, we delivered another great year of performance; and two, we have continued positive momentum heading into 2024. Relative to 2023's performance, we delivered 15% revenue growth, 16% EBITDA growth and 32% free cash flow growth with free cash flow margins also at 32%. Our total revenue growth of 15% was underpinned by 8% organic revenue growth. Importantly, free cash flow has grown 16% on a 3-year compounded basis and we delivered our first ever quarter of $1 billion of softer recurring and reoccurring revenues, quite an important milestone for enterprise.\nIn addition, we deployed $2.1 billion towards high-quality vertical software acquisitions, highlighted by our bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon. In a year where deploying capital is structurally challenged and we did so at very compelling values, leading to strong value creation for our shareholders. As we enter 2024, we do so with strong momentum. We continue to see robust demand for our mission-critical solutions and a strong outlook for organic growth. Also, you can count on Roper to improve the underlying business quality as we scale our enterprise. Adding to the momentum for the year are the contributions from our 2023 acquisition cohort and last week's announcement of ProCare solutions.\nFinally, we are well positioned to continue our capital deployment execution. We remain very active in the M&A market, an environment that we expect to be notably improved in 2024. We can do this with a strong balance sheet, a large pipeline of attractive opportunities and unwavering levels of patience and discipline.\nNow as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses compete and win based on customer intimacy. We coach our businesses on how to structurally improve their organic growth rates and underlying business quality.\nFinally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy that focuses on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow compounding flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over the long arc of time.\nSo with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper, and let's open it up to your questions."

The Roper Technologies conference call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the third quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\nNow if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.\nAnd now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the third quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indecore, transaction and restructuring-related expenses associated with our completed acquisitions, and lastly, a gain from the sale of nonoperating assets. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Zack, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our third quarter results with you this morning, which like each of the first 2 quarters this year were quite good. As we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. As usual, we'll start with the most recent quarter's financial highlights, then Jason will discuss our results. After that, we'll turn to our segment specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance.\nLet's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the 4 main takeaways for today's call are: first, we continue to perform at a high level operationally, delivering another quarter of very strong financial results, definitively demonstrating the quality of our portfolio of businesses, our leaders and our governance system; second, we continue to be very active on the M&A front, deploying about $2 billion over last quarter; third, we're increasing our full year guidance; and fourth, we remain very well positioned for further disciplined capital deployment.\nAs it relates to the first takeaway, our continued strong performance. We saw total revenue growth 16% and organic revenue growth of 6%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise but also simultaneously improve as underlying quality and recurring revenue base with organic software recurring revenue growing high single digits in the quarter.\nImportantly, the cash. As we've been highlighting throughout the year, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 19% for the most recent TTM period and 77% in the quarter. Turning to our second main takeaway, the deployment of $2 billion over last quarter was led by our acquisitions of Syntelus and Replicon, both of which are bolt-ons for Strata and Deltec, respectively. These are each strategically interesting bolt-ons and are highly compelling from a value creation perspective as we're able to buy these businesses for about 14x next year's EBITDA. More on these in a bit.\nIn addition, in the quarter, we made a $125 million minority investment in Certinia, a professional services automation software business. We're excited to partner with the belly and General Atlantic Ventures to deploy the value creation thesis associated with this unique opportunity. Third, we're increasing our full year total revenue growth to be 14% plus, increasing our organic revenue growth to be 7% plus, and increasing our full year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.62 to $16.66 or up $0.21 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.36 to $16.50.\nAnd fourth, we continue to be very well positioned for further capital deployment by having over $4 billion of M&A firepower. We remain very active in the market as we evaluate and diligence in many attractive opportunities. So with that, Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through our third quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason?\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil, and good morning to those that have joined our call, and thank you for your interest in Roper. Turning to Slide 6, I'll take you through our third quarter enterprise results in a bit more detail. Revenue of $1.56 billion was 16% over prior year, with 6% organic growth and a 9% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline.\nAs Neil mentioned, organic software recurring revenue growth was in the high single-digit area. This was led by strength in customer expansion and net new logos across our enterprise software businesses. Additionally, our product businesses continued to deliver with 10% organic growth in the quarter, highlighted by Neptune and Verathon.\nRevenue converted nicely through EBITDA, with EBITDA of $652 million or 18% over prior year. Margin expanded in the quarter to 41.7%, with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. This all translated to depths of $4.32 versus our guidance of $4.16 to $4.20. Of note, our recent acquisitions had minimal impact on earnings this quarter. We expect depth accretion from these deals in 2024 as we pay down the revolver and benefit from full synergy realization.\nFree cash flow was very strong in the quarter and came in line with our expectations. We generated $625 million of free cash flow, which is up $272 million over prior year. As a reminder, our Frontline business delivers most of its free cash flow in the third quarter. So that, plus a terrific organic contribution drove the significant growth.\nLooking at cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, as shown on the slide, provides a more relevant comparison. With the frontline renewals tucked into the third quarter, our TTM free cash flow was $1.82 billion, which is up 19% over the prior TTM period. With the expectation for a strong Q4, we're on track to deliver north of 30% free cash flow margins in 2023.\nTaking a broader view, our TTM free cash flow has compounded 16% over a 3-year period, which is in line with EBITDA growth. In summary, our focus on compounding cash flow is evident in our results and will continue to guide us into the future.\nNext slide on Page 7 here. Taking a look at our financial position. We ended the quarter with net debt of $6.6 billion, including about $900 million drawn on our revolver. With trailing EBITDA of over $2.4 billion, this leaves us with net leverage of about 2.7x.\nLooking forward, we have capacity to deploy $4 billion or more over the foreseeable period even after deploying $2 billion in the third quarter. As always, cash flow growth optimization guides our strategic choices. So while our balance sheet may be primed, we will be disciplined and patient when it comes to capital deployment. To that end, private markets are slowly signed with activity picking up over the last quarter. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to go through the segment results and outlook. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. Let's turn to Page 9. And before we walk through our segment details, we'd like to start with an overview of our acquisition of Syntellis and the combination with our Strata business. To remind everyone, Strata has been part of Roper for 8 years as a leader in delivering SaaS-based financial planning, decision support and performance analytics solutions to U.S. hospitals and health systems.\nSyntellis is a leading provider of SaaS-based enterprise performance management and data solutions to hospitals, higher education and financial institutions. As many of you know, U.S.-based hospitals and health systems continue to face intense pressure from macro market trends, challenges resulting from care setting shifts, reimbursement rates, lagging rising costs and labor staffing issues.\nThe combined Strata and Syntellis business will uniquely be able to help health systems address these difficult financial and operational challenges. Together, the enterprise has relationships with about 70% of the country's health systems. Stand-alone, Syntellis meets all our acquisition criteria, a leader in a niche market, delivers mission-critical application-specific solutions, is an HSD organic growth business and operates an extremely asset-light business model.\nTaken together with Strata, it only gets more attractive in terms of the combined customer base, the combined product offering, the combined financial profile and the combined future product development opportunities. For 2024, we expect Syntellis to deliver about $185 million of revenue and about $90 million of EBITDA inclusive of cost synergies.\nOf note, this EBITDA is $5 million higher than at the time of our deal announcement. Considering the $1.25 billion net purchase price, the valuation is about 14x next year's EBITDA and will only improve from there. Operationally, the teams have moved quite expeditiously and are ahead of schedule relative to the near-term value creation plan, having implemented about 85% of the cost synergy opportunities within the first 45 days.\nIn addition, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Finally, the new combined leadership team headed by STRATA's CEO, John Martino, are turning their strategic attention to new combined product development ideas. Net-net, this is a highly compelling value creation opportunity for our customers and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, let's now turn to Page 10 and walk through our Application Software segment. Third quarter revenues for Application Software segment were $803 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins increased to 44.6% in the quarter. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid in the quarter with sustained momentum in their SMB channel and the private sector solutions.\nThey continue to see sluggish activity in their GovCon Enterprise segment given the backdrop of federal government spending uncertainty. Retention rates across the entirety of Deltec remain high. Importantly, over the last couple of months, Deltek released a Gen AI-enabled data collection capability for the Gov IQ business, an LLM based processing features for their VantagePoint product. It's good to see further adoption of Gen AI within the portfolio.\nAlso in the quarter, as we outlined on last quarter's call, Deltek closed the acquisition of RepliCon, albeit about a month later than anticipated. To remind you, replicon is a market-leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and is highly complementary to Deltek's strategy. We continue to expect replicon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year.\nAderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms continues to excel and delivered a very strong quarter. In the quarter, Aderant saw record third quarter bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly, during the quarter, Adreant continue to mature and gain market traction with their Jenner-enabler, Manny. Aderant's most recent JNAi product release enables passive fee earner time entry assistance through Aderant's Eye Time product line. Great to see this rapid product innovation at Aderant.\nVertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies continues to be a great business for us with solid performance across our core P&C business and their recent MGA solutions bolt-on. Strata, independent from the Syntellis acquisition, was strong in the quarter and continued to gain market adoption of their leading decision support and financial planning solutions. Finally, Frontline had strong customer renewal season and delivered significant cash flow, as Jason mentioned, to the enterprise in the quarter.\nLooking to the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit area for the segment. Turning to Page 11. Third quarter revenues for our Network Software segment were $364 million, up 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 56.3%.\nLet's start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT and Load Link, both of which grew in the quarter despite the continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. Over the last quarter or 2, these businesses have done a fantastic job of baselining their cost structures while continuing to invest in new product development.\nThis led to strong segment margins in the quarter. Relative to product development, and as we highlighted a touch last quarter, DAT launched Gen AI-enabled solutions, among other initiatives targeted to combat freight industry fraud, which is a problem that plagues the entire industry. Within the first month of release, DAT has made a significant dent in fraudulent activity and DAT's customers have noticed and recognized this great accomplishment.\nThis is a shiny example of why and how Roper businesses continue to innovate through and across macroeconomic cycles, which enables us to consistently deliver on market and customer opportunities ultimately leading to market share gains.\nTurning to our iPipeline. Our network software business that tech enabled the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities. iPipeline continues to execute at a high level and gain market share. In the quarter, they had very nice ARR gains driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. This growth is directly attributable to iPipeline's strategy that is laser-focused on their core life insurance and annuity customer base.\nWe talked about this concept during our Investor Day earlier in the year. A closely held value of Roper in our businesses is a notion that we compete and win based on customer intimacy. Customer intimacy requires focus and strategic choice. iPipeline over the last 2 to 3 years has excelled at this, the concept of focus on the core and choice, which enables further market share gains. Great job, team.\nFoundry, our media and entertainment postproduction software business continued their business model transition to a subscription model and is ahead of plan in that regard. Though industry demand was temporarily paused given both the Hollywood writers and actor strikes. Notwithstanding, Foundry continues to innovate their product offering and will aggressively compete for customer wallet share in the coming months as the actoR Strike results.\nFinally, our alternate site health care businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP, were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid, and the business has benefited by having improved census and skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels and patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic.\nFor the final quarter of the year, we expect to see low single-digit growth for this segment based on continued challenging freight market conditions and the ACR strike impact on foundry. Now let's turn to Page 12 and walk through our TEP segment. Revenues in the quarter were $396 million, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were strong at 36.5% in the quarter.\nWe'll start with Neptune, our water meter and Technology business. Neptune delivered another fantastic quarter of operational and financial performance. As has been the case for several quarters, Neptune continues to see strong demand and momentum for the residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters and increasing adoption for their meter data management software.\nWe remain bullish about Neptune and the market in which they compete, given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles.\nVerathon was awesome in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products both Bronco scope or Beflex and video innovation or GlideScope as well as bladder scan capital purchases. A group of smaller businesses here, antibotics, IPA and RFIDs were fantastic as they were last quarter. substantially working through a series of nagging supply chain challenges.\nRelative to the final quarter of the year, we expect to see low double-digit organic growth for this segment. Now please turn to Page 14, and let's go through our increased 2023 guidance. Based on our strong third quarter performance, we're raising our full year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and adjusted debts.\nFor 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be 14% plus, an increase from about 13% last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year organic revenue outlook to be in a 7%-plus ZIP code an increase from about 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide for the year. As a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our debt guidance for the year to be in the range of $1.62 and $166 up from our prior guidance of $16.36 to $16.50. Assumed in this guidance is the tax rate trending to the high end of our 21% to 22% range. For the fourth quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $4.28 and $4.32.\nNow please turn over to Page 15, and then we'll look forward to answering your questions. We want to leave you with the same 4 points with which we started. First, we delivered yet another solid quarter. And in the third quarter, revenues increased 16% to $1.56 billion. This growth was underpinned with 6% organic revenue growth and high single-digit organic software recurrent revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were notably strong at 41.7% and and cash flow was outstanding, growing 77% in the quarter and 19% on a TTM basis.\nSecond, we successfully deployed $2 billion of capital in the quarter, led by the bolt-ons of Syntellis and Replicon. These 2 deals will deliver about $115 million of EBITDA next year and are priced about 14x next year's EBITDA, quite compelling. Third, based on the strong quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers were increasing our full year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full year debt outlook to be between 16.62 and 16.66.\nAnd finally, notwithstanding this quarter's $2 billion of deployment, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several quarters, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital, just as we did with the Syntellis and Replicon acquisitions. We firmly believe that patients as is always the case with capital deployment will be rewarded.\nBefore we turn to your questions, I'd like to share an exciting addition to the Roper executive team. During the quarter, Janet Glaser joined our team and is leading our acquisition cultivation and corporate development outreach efforts. Janet will partner with our M&A resources, our corporate leadership team and several of our business units to increase our forward-leaning posture with private equity sponsors and their businesses. Most recently, Janet was a global sector leader and portfolio manager at Fidelity. We're super excited that Janet has joined our leadership team and welcome aboard.\nNow as we turn to your questions, and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel. We'd like to remind everyone that what we do at Roper is simple. We compound cash flow over a long arc of time by operating a portfolio of market-leading application-specific and vertically oriented businesses. Once the company is part of Roper, we operate a decentralized environment so our businesses can compete and win based on customer intimacy, yet we close our businesses on how to structurally improve their growth rates and underlying business quality.\nFinally, we run a centralized process-driven capital deployment strategy to focus on finding the next great business to add to our cash flow flywheel. Taken together, we compound our cash flow in the mid-teens area over a long arc of time. So with that, thank you for your continued interest in Roper and let's open it up to your questions."

The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\nNow if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. And now please turn to Page 3.\nToday, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nAnd thanks to everyone for joining our call. We're looking forward to sharing our second quarter results with you this morning, which like Q1 were quite good.\nAs we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. I'll start with our second quarter enterprise highlights then ask Jason to share our financial results. After that, we'll turn to our segment-specific discussion and wrap up outlining our increased 2023 enterprise guidance. So let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please.\nAs we turn to Page 5, the 4 main takeaways for today's call are first, we continue to perform extremely well and had a very strong second quarter, another demonstration of the quality of our portfolio of businesses.\nSecond, we're increasing our full year guidance, both in terms of total and organic revenue growth and adjusted debt. Third, generative AI. We're very excited by the promise of this technology and outline reasons why today. And fourth, we remain very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment.\nAs it relates to the first takeaway, a strong start to the year and a solid second quarter. We saw total revenue grow 17% and organic revenue grew 9%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise, but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow growing 17% in the quarter.\nOur results this quarter are another proof point that our higher quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose-built to consistently perform at a very high level. Given the strong second quarter, we're increasing our full year total revenue growth to be around 13%, increasing our organic revenue growth to be around 7% and increasing our full year debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 to $16.50 or up $0.23 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.30.\nThird, relative to Gen AI, we feel we're structurally advantaged and excited by this technology as our vertical and application-specific businesses will use our specialized market positions and knowledge to provide context for these enabling technologies, both to create customer value and internal productivity gains, more on this during today's call.\nAnd finally, we continue to be well positioned relevant to capital deployment. We remain active in the market as we evaluate an actively diligence many high-quality opportunities. Jason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our second quarter results and our very strong financial position. Jason?\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil, and I hope everyone is doing well this morning. Turning to Slide 6. The second quarter was another good post in 2023. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, which was up 17% over prior year. Organic growth was 9%, which was led by 8% software recurring revenue growth across the enterprise and outsized growth, 19% in our tech-enabled products segment.\nEBITDA increased 20% to $617 million with EBITDA operating leverage of 46%. Notably, margin expanded across all 3 segments in the quarter. Debts of $4.12 was $0.12 above the high end of our guidance range and 20% above prior year. Debt growth was in line with EBITDA growth given the offsetting impact of a higher tax rate and lower net interest expense.\nMoving to free cash flow. As a reminder, the second quarter is always our lowest conversion quarter in the year as we make 2 federal tax payments. We delivered $295 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was up 17% over prior year. As I've previously mentioned, Frontline's cash flow is seasonally weighted to Q3 and Q4, especially in Q3, and this is in line with our K-12 customers' annual renewals. So we expect a meaningful increase to cash flow in the second half.\nTaking a broader view of cash flow on the slide, recall that we acquired Vertafore in 2020 and had a onetime cash tax benefit of $120 million, of which about $60 million benefited the second quarter of 2021. We, therefore, had very strong multiyear cash flow performance when normalizing for this 2021 tax item. For the year, we are confident that free cash flow will be greater than 30% of revenue.\nTurning to our balance sheet sheet on Slide 7. Our net leverage sits at 2.2x at the end of the quarter with about $6.7 billion of debt and just under $1.5 billion of cash against our TTM EBITDA of $2.35 billion. Also, our $3.5 billion revolver remains fully undrawn.\nTo summarize, we have significant acquisition capacity and remain quite active in many bespoke processes. To that end, in Q3, we expect to close on Repacon, which is a bolt-on acquisition for our Deltek business, with a purchase price of $450 million or about $370 million net of a long-term cash tax benefit. Neil will discuss the details around this exciting addition to the Deltek platform and the segment discussion.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Q2 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $770 million, up 6% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins increased to 43.7% in the quarter.\nIn this segment, we continue to see consistently strong performance across the entire group of companies. We'll start with Deltek. Deltek was once again solid across both our government contracting and private sector businesses. Importantly, Deltek continues to see momentum build with our SaaS offerings and retention rates remain at historically high levels.\nAlso in the quarter, and as Jason mentioned earlier, we announced the acquisition of Replicon for Deltek, Roper's largest bolt-on today. RepliCon is a market-leading timekeeping and workforce management SaaS solution focused on professional services firms and is highly complementary to Deltek's strategy. We expect RepliCon to contribute north of $70 million of revenue and $24 million of EBITDA next year, and we expect the deal to close during the third quarter.\nFinally, as it relates to Deltek, we wanted to brag on them for a moment. During the quarter, the Washington Post awarded Deltek the #4 top workplace in the D.C. Metro area for large companies. As you know, we have a closely held belief that talent and culture can create long-term competitive advantage, and this is certainly the case for Deltek.\nDuring Roper's ownership Deltek, the company has increased its organic growth rate, retention levels, recurring revenue and margin structure, and a big contributor to that success is the structural talent advantage that Deltek continues to build. Congrats to Mike, and congrats to your entire team.\nAderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to be excellent. In the quarter, Aderant sold record bookings and continued success in the adoption and cross-sell of their SaaS solutions. Also and importantly, during the quarter, Aderant launched their generative AI enabler, MADDI. Today, MADDI is enabling 2 solutions outside council guidelines, management and time entry with plans to extend this to AR cash-receipt matching and docketing over the coming months.\nOver time, MADDI will be integrated widely across Aderant's product platforms. Generative AI for the legal space has tremendous potential. One such example in the market today is Onyx. Onyx powered by MADDI solves a massive challenge that all law firms face, namely how to navigate outside counsel guidelines or the biller requirements that clients impose on their law firms.\nIt's fairly common for a large law firm to have to navigate hundreds of thousands of bespoke client billing requirements. Today, Onyx uses generative AI to extract contractual terms and convert them into business tools used in the time entry and billing processes, a true game changer.\nMore broadly across Roper, we're excited about the potential of generative AI and large language models. We believe, given our deeply verticalized and application-specific business model, that our businesses are structurally advantaged given that all AI, computational and generative, need context, specifically data and workflows in which to train or target the technology.\nInternally, we're working closely with our businesses on the productivity and product-enabled opportunities associated with gen AI. Certainly much more to come on this. Now back to the segment performance in Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies.\nVertafore continues to be a great asset for us with solid performance across our core P&C business and the recent MGA solutions bolt-on. Our health care IT businesses also performed very well in the quarter with growth in each of our health care IT franchises, Clinics, Data Innovations and strata. Front line also continues to deliver for us. Frontline's mission is to empower the front line of education.\nAs many of you know, the hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging, and Frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school districts to navigate these challenges. Because of this, Frontline solutions are mission-critical and of high importance to their school district customers. As such, Frontline's net retention is consistently strong.\nLooking to the second half of the year, we expect to see organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit area for the segment. Overall, very strong results and outlook for this segment.\nTurning to Page 10. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $358 million, up 5% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.2%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was solid across the segment.\nRelative to business-specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, both of which grew in the quarter despite continued challenges across the broader freight and logistics markets. I'll remind you that our businesses are critical to the operation and execution of the North American spot freight market.\nIn addition and importantly, the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future great ships. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle, DAT and Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet.\nAs we speak, DAT is launching a generative AI-enabled solution among other initiatives targeted to create industry fraud. This is in addition to their existing set of computational AI and data science-driven solutions like DATIQ, which they deployed at scale over the last 3 or 4 years.\niPipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities, had very nice ARR gains in the quarter, driven by strong retention and customer expansion activity. Foundry continued its string of strong performance and had terrific growth for their flagship product now, which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, Foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Nuke. And in the first half of the year had north of 60% of their Nuke units sold under their new model ahead of their transition plan.\nFinally, our alternate site health care businesses, led by SoftWriters and SHP, were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid, and the business has benefited by an improving census in skilled nursing assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels in patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic.\nTurning to the second half of the year. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on sustained ARR momentum. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in the quarter for our tech-enabled products segment were $403 million, up 19% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were strong at 36.4% for the quarter.\nAcross the segment, business performance and execution was exceptional. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continue to ease. Neptune, our water meter and technology products business continues to be great. In the quarter, they had a record revenue performance. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for the residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We remain bullish about Neptune in the market in which they compete. Given this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles.\nVerathon was awesome in the quarter as well, with double-digit order growth and tremendous operational execution. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products, both bronchoscope or Bflex, and video innovation or GlideScope as well as BladderScan capital purchases.\nNorthern Digital or NDI was also strong in the quarter, setting a record revenue for the business. A group of smaller businesses here, IPA, RFIDs and antibiotics were fantastic in the quarter as they substantially work through a series of nagging supply chain challenges.\nRelative to the second half of the year, we expect to see high single-digit organic revenue growth. Recall, we have a tough Q3 revenue and margin comp to lap from the prior year. Now please turn to Page 13, and let's review our increased 2023 guidance.\nBased on our strong second quarter performance, we're raising our full year 2023 guidance for total revenue, organic revenue and adjusted debts. For 2023, we now expect total revenue growth to be around 13%, an increase from 12% last, last quarter. In addition, we're raising our full year organic revenue outlook to be in the 7% ZIP code, an increase from 6% to 7% last quarter and 5% to 6% in our original guide.\nAs a result of our improved revenue outlook, we're increasing our debt guidance to be in the range of $16.36 and $16.50, up from our prior guidance of $16.10 to $16.30. Assumed in this guidance is a tax rate trending to the high end of our 21% to 22% range.\nSpecific to the third quarter, we're establishing our debt guidance to be in the range of $4.16 and $4.20. Now please turn to Page 14, and then we'll look forward to answering your questions.\nWe want to leave you with the same 4 points with which we started. First, the year started strong and we delivered solid second quarter results. In the quarter, we saw revenues increase 17% to $1.53 billion. This growth was underpinned with 9% organic revenue growth and 8% organic software recurring revenue growth. In addition, EBITDA margins were quite strong at 40.3%.\nSecond, based on the strong second quarter performance, the recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we're increasing our full year total and organic revenue growth outlook and increasing our full year debt outlook to be between $16.36 and $16.50.\nThird, we're excited by the potential of generative AI, both as it relates to internal productivity, and using our application specificity to provide context for new product development ideas. We look forward to sharing progress and updates in coming quarters and years.\nAnd finally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we've been discussing over the past several months, we have a very large pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure the continued optimal deployment of our available capital.\nNow as we turn to your questions. And if you flip to the final slide or strategic flywheel, we want to once again thank those of you who joined us in New York for our first ever Investor Day and for the hundreds who have watched the replay over the past few months. During that long-form overview of Roper, we were excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high-quality nature of our portfolio of businesses, our operating ability to improve our businesses our process-driven capital deployment approach and our compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area. So thank you for your continued interest in Roper.\nAnd with that, let's open it up to your questions."

The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\nNow if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.\nAnd now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the financial impacts associated with our minority investment in Indicor. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Zack, and we hope everyone is doing well this morning. We're looking forward to sharing our Q1 results with you, which were quite good. As we turn to Page 4, let's look at today's agenda. We'll start with our enterprise highlights and financial results, then turn to our segment-specific discussion and wrap up discussing our raised 2023 enterprise guidance.\nSo with that, let's go ahead and get started. Next slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the three main takeaways for today's call are, first, the year is off to a strong operational and financial start as our higher-quality, enhanced portfolio is obviously performing really well; second, we're increasing our full year guidance both in terms of organic revenue growth and adjusted DEPS; and third, we continue to be very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment.\nAs it relates to our first takeaway, a strong start to the year, we saw total revenue grow 15% and organic revenue grow 8%. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we continue to not only scale our enterprise but also simultaneously improve its underlying quality and recurring revenue base. Importantly, we had very strong cash flow performance with free cash flow margins in excess of 30%. Our results this quarter are another proof point that our higher-quality, less cyclical portfolio was purpose-built to consistently perform at a very high level.\nFinally, and also during the quarter, we held our first ever Roper Leadership Summit, where we had our 27 business unit presidents together and shared best practices and learnings across a variety of topics, including strategy development, strategy enablement and team and talent. While honoring our high trust autonomous model, the operating and corporate teams left feeling a true sense of community. It was a terrific week.\nGiven the strong start to the year, we're increasing our full year organic growth outlook 100 basis points from 5% to 6% to 6% to 7% and increasing our full year DEPS guidance to be to be $16.10 to $16.30 or $0.15 at the midpoint. Our previous DEPS guide was $15.90 to $16.20. And finally, we continue to be well positioned relative to capital deployment. We remain quite active in the market as we evaluate an actively diligent many high-quality opportunities.\nJason, I'll turn the call over to you so you can walk through our first quarter results and our strong financial position. Jason?\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Turning to Slide 6. We're very pleased with how Q1 shaped up. Revenue came in at $1.47 billion or 15% over prior year. This was through a combination of strong organic growth of 8% and an 8% contribution from acquisitions, led by Frontline, and this was slightly offset by a 1% FX headwind. Growth was broad-based across the segments and a little better than expected. Broadly speaking, customer demand was favorable in the quarter, and order pipelines remain strong.\nEBITDA was $582 million or 15% of our prior year with margins roughly flat and in line with expectations. DEPS of $3.90 was up 19% over prior year and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range of $3.80 to $3.84. Free cash flow of $445 million was 4% higher than prior year In our Q4 earnings call, we highlighted a $45 million settlement of a patent dispute for certain Verathon sales dating back to 2004. We paid that this quarter, so adjusted for the settlement, free cash would be 33% of revenue and up 14% over prior year.\nWe saw very good cash performance, especially in our software businesses. Our Q1 renewals and related collections came in strong as expected. As I mentioned last quarter, Frontline will collect most of their renewals in the third quarter. So it's a bit of a drag on conversion in the first half. So overall, just a really great start to 2023.\nNow turning to Slide 7, we'll spin through our balance sheet. Coming off solid Q1 cash flow performance, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. Gross debt was around $6.7 billion, and our cash balance has grown to just under $1.2 billion, which yields net debt just shy of $5.5 billion. This puts our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at 2.4, which was down from 2.7 at year-end.\nThis, coupled with our undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion gives us capacity to deploy $4 billion or more in the near term.\nTo that end, we've been quite active in 2023, evaluating a number of platform and bolt-on opportunities. As always, we will remain disciplined and patient in our capital deployment process. With that, I'll turn it back over to Neil, to talk about our segment performance and outlook. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through our Q1 highlights for Application Software segment. Revenues here were $761 million, up 6% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 43.2%. Performance in this segment was strong across the board. To highlight a few of our business' performance, we'll start with Deltek. Deltek was solid. As we mentioned last quarter, Deltek did see some slower customer decision-making, but that was largely rectified this quarter. Deltek had double-digit bookings in the quarter with strength across both enterprise class and SMB-sized customers as well as government contracting and private sector solutions. As usual, both gross and net retention at Deltek remain strong and consistent with recent history.\nAderant, our software business focused on the needs of law firms, continues to compete and win and take share from our competitors. In the quarter, Aderant experienced record bookings and continued success in the adoption of their SaaS solutions. Great job by Chris, Rafi and the entire Aderant team.\nVertafore, our software business at tech-enabled property and casualty insurance agencies, posted another solid quarter and continues to perform quite well for us. Of particular note, Vertafore recent acquisition of MGA Systems, a software solution targeted to manage general agents, or MGAs, is proving to be highly strategic and bookings activity is tracking ahead of plan.\nFrontline continues to perform quite well for us in the first couple of quarters of ownership. Frontline's mission is to empower the front line of education. As many of you know, hiring of teachers and administrative staff is particularly challenging, and Frontline software solutions better equip K-12 school districts to navigate these challenges. Because of this, frontline solutions are mission-critical and of high importance to their school district customers.\nFor the segment, EBITDA margins were down 90 basis points year-over-year, in line with our expectations.\nOur Acute Care software businesses, especially CliniSys, Data Innovations and Strata are ramping up their implementation capacity based on recent bookings momentum. We expect to see similar margins in Q2.\nLooking to the balance of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area for this segment based on our leading market positions and growth in recurring revenue.\nTurning to Page 10. Revenues in the quarter for a Network Software segment were $355 million, up 6% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.1%. As with our Application Software segment, growth and performance was broad-based across this segment. Relative to business-specific comments, we'll start with our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, DAT and Loadlink, which both grew nicely in the quarter. While freight market conditions are softer than this time last year, our businesses in this space are critical to the operation and execution of the spot freight market.\nIn addition and importantly, the spot market is a long-term secular beneficiary in terms of the volume of future freight shipments. Throughout and across the freight and economic cycle, DAT and Loadlink continue to innovate and launch new products and offerings to help drive enhanced customer value and share of wallet. with the current product strategy focused on tech enabling the connectivity between brokers and carriers.\niPipeline, our network software business that tech enables the distribution channel for life insurance and annuities, is coming off a terrific 2022 and continued its high level of execution this quarter with very strong bookings, retention and customer expansions.\nFoundry continued its string of strong performance in the quarter and had terrific seat growth for their flagship product Nuke , which enabled continued double-digit recurring revenue growth. As we mentioned last quarter, Foundry commenced their subscription pricing transition for Nuke and in Q1 had north of 50% of the Nuke seats sold under their new model ahead of their plan.\nFinally, our alternate site health care businesses, MHA, SoftWriters and SHP were strong in the quarter. Execution was solid, and the business has benefited by an improving census in skilled nursing, assisted living facilities and home health reaching the highest occupancy levels and patient volumes since the onset of the pandemic. Turning to the balance of the year. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across this group.\nAs we turn to Page 11. Revenues in the quarter for our Tech-enabled Products segment were $354 million, up 14% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 34.7% in the quarter. Across the segment, business performance and execution was solid. Importantly, the broad-based supply chain issues continue to wane. Though we're not entirely out of the woods, we can now see a path to a more normalized supply chain environment.\nNeptune, our water meter and technology product business, continues to be just great. In the quarter, they had record revenue performance and set records for backlog levels. Importantly, Neptune continues to see increasing demand and momentum for their residential and commercial ultrasonic or static meters. We remain bullish on Neptune and the market in which they compete as this market tends to be quite steady as Neptune's customers' budgets are typically fixed year-to-year and not tied to broader macroeconomic trends or cycles. Great job at Neptune, and congrats.\nVerathon was strong in the quarter as well with double-digit order growth. Specifically, Verathon saw strength across the reoccurring single-use products, both bronchoscope or BFlex and video innovation or GlideScope as well as BladderScan capital purchases. Importantly, Verathon has four product launches scheduled for the next few months which will help continue their market share gains and momentum.\nNorthern Digital NDI was also strong in the quarter and continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI's enabling measurement technology is used by scores and medical product OEMs and solutions such as robotic-assisted surgery and across multiple cardiac-specific modalities. NDI's high level of market focus and operational discipline will enable them to continue to be the market share leader for these measurement technologies long into the future.\nOur outlook for the balance of the year for this segment has improved to be in the low double-digit area and is based on continued strong orders and improving manufacturing productivity at Neptune as well as an improved growth outlook across our medical product businesses.\nNow please turn to Page 13. And let's review our increased 2023 guidance. For 2023, we expect total revenue growth to be north of 12%. In addition, we're updating our organic revenue growth outlook to be in the 6% to 7% range, an increase from our original guidance of 5% to 6%. As a result, we're increasing our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $16.10 and $16.30 up from our prior guidance of $15.90 to $16.20, assuming that this guidance is a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the second quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance is to be in the $3.96 to $4 range.\nNow please turn with us to Page 14, and then Jason and I will look forward to answering your questions. As we turn to Page 14, we want to leave you with the same three points with which we started. First, 2023 is off to a great start. We saw revenues increase 15% to $1.47 billion in the quarter. This growth was underpinned with 8% organic revenue growth and 8% recurring revenue growth. In addition, margins were quite strong.\nThis quarter's financial and operational performance is yet another proof point of our capabilities, and frankly, the expectations of our improved higher-quality portfolio of businesses. Most importantly, our revenue growth translated to impressive cash flow growth with our underlying free cash flow growing 14%. As you know, we view cash flow growth as the best measure of performance.\nSecond, based on the strong start to the year, the higher recurring nature of our revenue stream and the importance of our solutions to our customers, we are increasing our full year organic revenue growth outlook to be between 6% and 7% and increasing our full year DEPS to be between $16.10 an $16.30.\nFinally, we continue to be active with our capital deployment activities as we have north of $4 billion of available M&A firepower. As we discussed during our Investor Day last month, we have a very large universe and pipeline of opportunities, though, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital.\nNow as we turn to your questions and if you could flip to the final slide, our strategic flywheel, we want to thank those of you who joined us in New York or online last month for our first ever Investor Day. During that long-form overview of Roper, we are excited to share with you our long-term strategy, the high-quality nature of our portfolio of businesses, our operating ability to improve our businesses, our process-driven capital deployment approach and our compelling long-term business model that compounds cash flow in the mid-teens area.\nSo thank you for your continued interest in Roper. And with that, let's open it up to your questions."

The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVP of IR, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies.\nJoining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jason Conley, Incoming Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brandon Cross, Incoming Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\nNow if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.\nAnd now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; a legal charge related to the settlement of the Berall v. Verathon patent litigation matter. The case related to the sale of certain Verathon products from 2004 through 2016, there are no future financial obligations for Verathon related to this matter; next, transaction-related expenses for completed acquisitions; and lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our divestiture activity.\nGAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual year-end agenda, highlights for the most recent quarter and full year, followed by color commentary for each of our segments and then the initiation of our 2023 guidance. Let's go and get started. Next slide, please.\nAs we heard on Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are: First, we delivered another great year of strategic, operational and financial progress. To this end, we concluded our multiyear divestiture program, which was centered on improving the quality of remaining portfolio, namely emphasizing less cyclical, more asset-light and higher-growth businesses.\nIn addition, we successfully deployed $4.3 billion towards market-leading and application-specific software businesses. More on this later, but we also continue to have substantial M&A firepower well north of $4 billion. Organically, we grew just shy of 10% for the year while simultaneously improving the underlying quality of the enterprise. During the course of the year, our businesses did a terrific job of innovating and capturing share, which leads us to our second main takeaway for today's call that we're well positioned for another solid year of performance in 2023. Our higher quality, less cyclical and more highly recurring nature of our portfolio will serve us well during 2023.\nNow as I hand the call over to our Incoming CFO, Jason Conley, let me take a moment and thank Rob Crisci for all he's done for Roper and for me. Rob has been a significant contributor to our success and an important member of our executive team with meaningful insights and contributions across a variety of topics, including our most recent portfolio repositioning.\nWe're excited to welcome Jason to his new role. Many of you know, Jason, but those of you who do not, Jason has been with Roper for 16 years. He started in Corporate IR and FP&A, then the operating CFO at MHA our one of our businesses and most recently serving as Roper's Chief Accounting Officer. Since his return to corporate, he has been a member of our capital allocation team and has attended every Board meeting. The team and I are excited to partner with Jason for the next leg of our evolution.\nSo with that, looking forward to the partnership with Jason, and thank you, Rob, for all that you've done to make Roper better than when you joined. Jason, let me turn the call over to you, so you can walk through the fourth quarter and the full year financial summary. Jason?\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil. I am very excited and incredibly grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the team in this new role. And of course, thanks, Rob, for your awesome partnership and mentorship over the years. It's been just a great experience working together.\nSo first, I'd like to introduce Brandon Cross as our new Principal Accounting Officer. Brandon joined Roper about 5 years ago, progressing to our Assistant Controller and more recently, has led and transformed our audit services function. He has significant M&A and integration experience. So this is a natural and well-earned promotion for him. Brandon, I look forward to working together in your new role.\n\nBrandon Cross\n\nThanks, Jason.\n\nJason P. Conley\n\nVP & CAO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nIf you indulge me, I'll rip on Roper for a few seconds. I've been blessed to help guide and execute our evolution from Roper Industries to Roper Technologies, which has been underpinned by our North Star belief that cash is the best measure of performance. And as we enter 2023, our best years are ahead of us. We have a family of market-leading businesses with durable growth drivers and terrific free cash flow margins. Further, the leadership teams and talent processes at our businesses are the best in the company's history.\nAnd finally, we have significant capacity to execute our proven and disciplined M&A strategy that I've been a part of for many years. I anticipate being quite active on the road this year. So for those on the call, I look forward to either meeting you or reconnecting in the coming months.\nAll right. Let's get into the financials. Turning to Slide 6. We'll do a quick review of our Q4 performance. We capped off a solid year of growth with revenue of over $1.4 billion, which was 14% higher over prior year. Organic growth was 7% with strength across the portfolio, which was enhanced by 10% software recurring revenue growth. Acquisitions added 8 points of growth, led by our Frontline business that closed in early October, and currency was a 2-point headwind.\nEBITDA of $592 million, was up 17% over the prior year. We experienced strong operating leverage across the enterprise and improving gross margins in our TEP segment to finish out the year. DEPS came in at $3.92, which was 17% against the prior year and $0.18 above the midpoint of our guidance range.\nNext, we'll look at free cash flow. Free cash flow of $457 million, was down 8% over the prior year. Excluding the Section 174 impact, we were down 3%. And factoring out a $30 million Vertafore tax benefit in 2021 that doesn't repeat, we're up about 3% to 4% in the quarter.\nTaking a broader view, you can see we compounded cash 11% over a 4-year period, despite the Section 174 headwind, and we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding going forward.\nTurning to Slide 7. We'll now do a quick overview of our Q4 segment results, as Neil will unpack more detail on the full year a bit later. We had a nice finish to a great year across the 3 segments. For Application Software, revenue was up 22% to $740 million, with organic growth of 7%. EBITDA margin increased to 45.6% in the quarter. We had strong SaaS bookings growth and overall solid net retention throughout the year, which is just naturally rolling through recurring revenue in the quarter.\nGrowth was broad-based across the segment, aside from some delayed decision-making in the large government contracting space within Deltek. On margin, we had lower incentive-based SG&A and employee medical costs, so some favorability in the quarter. If you look at the full year margin of 44%, that's about where we would expect to be over a longer horizon.\nOur Network Software segment grew nicely in the quarter, with revenue up 9% to $350 million and EBITDA also up 9% to $189 million or 54% of revenue. Growth was led by our freight matching businesses, which continued driving higher ARPU from premium offerings to offset moderating carry activity as we expected.\nTech Enabled products revenue was $340 million and grew 5% organically in the quarter. Demand remained strong, and we had some orders that didn't get delivered toward the end of the quarter, which will benefit Q1. EBITDA grew 7% to $119 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 34.9% or 100 basis points over prior year, with strong operating leverage as the price cost dynamic was neutralized in the quarter.\nTurning to the full year 2022 performance on Slide 8. Revenue was 11% higher than prior year to $5.4 billion, with 9% organic growth. EBITDA was 12% better to nearly $2.2 billion, with EBITDA margin coming in at 40.4%. DEPS of $14.28, was 15% over prior year and reflected strong P&L leverage against the 11% revenue growth. Notably, compared to our 2018 pre-divestiture financial profile, our revenue is about $175 million higher, while EBITDA is nearly $365 million higher.\nSo through a combination of organic growth and capital deployment, we've grown despite divesting about 40% of our 2018 revenue. And most importantly, the composition of our portfolio today positions us for higher and more durable growth going forward.\nFree cash flow came in at about $1.5 billion, so down 7% versus prior year. It's a bit of the same situation as our fourth quarter with both the 2022 headwinds of Section 174 of nearly $100 million and the nonrepeat of the 2021 Vertafore tax benefit of $117 million. If we normalize for those items, free cash flow grew about 8%.\nWe've had a bit of an inventory built within our Tech segment as supply has become more available. This is not a new normal, and we certainly expect that to improve in 2023. If we kind of take this up to a multiyear view, you can see we've compounded cash at 15% over a 4-year period. And as we look forward, the impact from Section 174 will be fairly neutral, and we expect to convert plus or minus 80% of EBITDA to free cash flow. So we're clearly well positioned for double-digit growth.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let's take a look at our financial position. We certainly had a lot going on in Q4. On November 22, we completed the majority sale of our industrial businesses, which are now operating under the name Indicor and received $2.6 billion in upfront proceeds. Also in the quarter, we paid $270 million, representing all taxes due related to the majority sale. So this yielded us net proceeds of over $2.3 billion, a very good outcome here indeed. Related to our stake in Indicor, this is now appearing as an equity investment on our balance sheet. We will be updating the fair value of the equity investment each quarter going forward.\nTo provide a clearer picture of our continuing operations, we will provide a non-GAAP adjustment for this fair value accounting and any tax expense related to this investment.\nSo just looking at our balance sheet, even after our $3.7 billion Frontline acquisition, which was completed in October, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 2.7x. So our solid leverage profile, coupled with strong free cash flow generation and an undrawn revolver of $3.5 billion, gives us $4 billion plus of M&A capacity. Clearly, we are very well positioned for disciplined capital deployment in 2023.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Neil to go through our segment details. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason, and well done. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 2022 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.64 billion, up 7% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Performance across this segment was just solid in 2022. Vertafore, our software business that tech enables property and casualty insurance agencies accelerated their growth, led by continued strength in their Enterprise Class segment. In addition, the 2 Vertafore bolt-on acquisitions are strategically on point, integrated and performing well.\nAs we've been discussing, SaaS migrations have been a key theme for us over the past few years, and 2022 was no different. Both Aderant and Deltek continued their SaaS migration momentum and both grew nicely based on solid customer adds and strong retention. Deltek was particularly strong in their private sector end markets. But as Jason mentioned, Deltek did see some slower decision-making specific to new bookings in the enterprise segment for their GovCon solutions. At our upcoming March 21 Investor Day, you'll get an opportunity to hear directly from the leaders at Vertafore, Deltek and Aderant about how they're competing and consistently winning in the market.\nAs it relates to PowerPlan, we liked what we saw last year. PowerPlan was strong given their refocused and narrowed strategy combined with a highly aligned team. As a result, PowerPlan crossed a meaningful milestone, launching a SaaS solution for their flagship product, Tax Fixed Assets. Congrats to the team for a great 2022 and looking forward to more great things in 2023.\n2022 is a very good year for application, health care, IT businesses as well. Strata's combination with EPSi has just been great. The integration is complete and the number of EPSi, the Strata has conversions and upsell, cross-sell are both meaningfully ahead of our deal expectations.\nCliniSys and Data Innovations continue to win in the marketplace. The internal combination of CliniSys and Sunquest has rejuvenated and energized their high-performance culture, which is enabling the business to more effectively compete and win in the marketplace. Data Innovations continues to gain share and evolve to become the de facto standard as it relates to lab middleware.\nFinally, Frontline, our cornerstone 2022 acquisition is off to a solid start. We look forward to sharing the strategic and financial success of this business in the quarters and years to come. I'd like to reiterate with what we started with. Performance here strategically, operationally and financially was just great in 2022. Very proud of the team and the performance. Congrats and thanks. Looking to the outlook for 2023, we expect to see organic growth in the mid-single-digit area based on our market positions and growth in recurring revenues.\nTurning to Page 12. Revenues in 2022 for our Network Software segment were $1.38 billion, up 13% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 53.3%. As we dig in the business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses were great in 2022. Their exceptional growth is based on many factors, certainly favorable market conditions, but also continued product and network innovations as well as terrific product and package designs that drove increased value for the Network participants.\niPipeline and iTradeNetwork were stellar performers throughout 2022 and benefited from having strong renewal and expansion activity. iPipeline like that of PowerPlan is benefiting from having a narrowed and more focused strategy, namely Tech Enabling, the life insurance, and annuity distribution network.\nMoving to Foundry, which had another great year as part of Roper. Foundry continues to be the market-leading software in postproduction media entertainment. During 2022, Foundry's product innovations were impressive with several new features focused on ML-based automation. Starting in 2023, Foundry's flagship product Nuke will begin its subscription transition, so looking forward for solid progress on that front.\nGrowth in our businesses that focus on alternate site healthcare was led by SHP and SoftWriters and importantly, retention rates across SHP, SoftWriters and MHA remained extremely high. Broadly, the performance across this segment was great. Congrats to the teams for this terrific year of financial performance.\nTurning to the outlook for 2023. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment based on broad and sustained growth across the group and a normalization of market conditions for freight and logistics applications.\nAs we turn to Page 13, revenues in 2022 for our Tech Enabled Products segment were $1.35 billion, up 10% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for this segment were 35.4% for the year. As expected, EBITDA margins expanded in the second half of the year as pricing and supply chain improvements flow through.\nLet's start with Neptune, our water meter and technology product business. This past year was just terrific with very strong growth based on strong margin conditions, strong share gains and strong adoption of their static ultrasonic meter technology. In addition, Neptune launched their cellular connectivity solution and did a fantastic job migrating a large chunk of their customer base to their newest data management solution. Spectacular job Neptune, congrats Don to you and your team.\nNorthern Digital, which is our precision measurement tech company, continued to see terrific demand for their optical and EM solutions. NDI benefits from having a strategy that is laser-focused on healthcare applications and an R&D capability that is unmatched in the industry. NDI's core tech is using countless life-saving procedures on a daily basis across the globe.\nVerathon turned in another solid year performance in 2022 as well. The growth is based on momentum across their video innovation and single-use bronchoscope product lines. As you saw in the press release, we did take the opportunity to clean up a legacy patent dispute. Make no mistake, the innovation capability at Verathon is nothing short of exceptional, and we cannot be more confident about their most recent product launches and the new concepts in the development pipeline. As it relates to the single-use bronc space, we hope to see Verathon capture the #1 market position in North America in 2023.\nOur outlook for the year in this segment is in the high single-digit area and is based on continued strength in backlog at Neptune as well as continued growth across our medical product businesses. Specific to the first quarter, we do have easier comps versus a year ago.\nNow please turn to Page 15, and let's review our 2023 and Q1 guidance. For 2023, we're initiating our DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.90 and $16.20. Underpinning this guidance is expected organic growth of 5% to 6% and a tax rate in the 21% to 22% area. Specific to the first quarter, we're establishing our DEPS guidance to be in the $3.80 to $3.84 range.\nNow please turn with us to our final page, Page 16. As we turn to this page, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, 2022 was a year of great accomplishment for our teams and our enterprise. We grew revenue 11%, 9% on an organic basis. And we did this while continuing to increase the underlying quality of our revenue base. In fact, we delivered double-digit increases in our Software organic recurring revenue during 2022.\nEBITDA grew 12%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points to 40.4%. Also, we successfully concluded our multiyear divestiture program and deployed $4.3 billion against our long-standing capital deployment strategy, headlined by Frontline Education.\nThe second key takeaway is that we're well positioned for double-digit cash flow compounding in 2023 based on our organic revenue growth outlook, contributions from our 2022 acquisition cohort and having well north of $4 billion of M&A capacity. To this end, we continue to be very active in the M&A markets. But as you saw during 2022 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital.\nFinally, and perhaps the most important, the new higher quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about the future of enterprise. As we open up to your questions, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on Tuesday, March 21, in New York. We look forward to seeing many of you there. So with that, let's open it up to your questions."

As we turn to Page 4, we'll walk through our usual agenda, highlights for the most recent quarter, followed by color commentary for each of our segments and ending with our increased outlook for the year. Let's go ahead and get started.\nNext slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are: first, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we're further increasing our outlook for the year. Second, earlier this month, we acquired another leading niche software business, Frontline Education. Third, we continue to have substantial M&A firepower north of $4 billion. And fourth and perhaps the most important, the new, higher-quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we've never been more excited about our future.\nAs it relates to the operating and financial performance in the quarter, we are pleased that revenues grew 10% on an organic basis and the strength was broad-based across our 3 segments and that margin performance improved well.\nConsistent with our commentary during the last several quarters, not only did we grow nicely in the quarter, but the quality of our underlying business also improved as we saw our software recurring revenue base grew 11% on an organic basis. More on Frontline in a moment.\nBased on the strength in Q3 and our expectations for Q4, we're increasing our organic growth outlook to north of 9% for the year, and for those reasons, together with the addition of Frontline, we're increasing our full year DEPS guidance by $0.57 at the midpoint.\nAnd finally, we've been active in the M&A market. Over the last few months, we deployed just over $4 billion, $3.7 billion for Frontline and $300 million for 2 Bolt-ons, one for Deltek and the other for Aderant. To this end, even after our recent $4 billion of capital deployment, we still have a large amount of available M&A firepower, over $4 billion.\nWe continue to be very active in the M&A market. But as you saw in Q3 and as always, we will remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of available capital.\nFinally, we feel great about the improving quality of the portfolio and the associated financial and operating results. All of this is made possible by our incredibly committed and passionate teams and associates. Thank you to everyone.\nTurning to the next page. As previously announced, we're excited to introduce to you another niche application software leader which we've added to the Roper portfolio, Frontline Education. Of note, we closed this transaction on October 4.\nFrontline is a leading provider of SaaS software solutions targeted to the U.S. K-12 education market. Frontline is an exceptional business which, not surprisingly, meets all our acquisition criteria, including being the clear leader that delivers administrative and HCM solutions purpose-built for the K-12 market, having multiple durable growth drivers and a high single-digit organic growth outlook, higher recurring revenue north of 90%, great cash flow characteristics and a passionate high-quality team. While early days, we're delighted to welcome Frontline to the Roper family where we will be their permanent home going forward. This is just another great fit relative to our capital deployment and corporate strategy, not only to increase the scale of our enterprise but the quality as well.\nNext slide, please. As we turn to Page 7, we want to take a moment to highlight the recent transformation of Roper and our higher quality portfolio. To that end, the vast majority of our 27 businesses, save for their smaller size, could be a highly successful, stand-alone, leading vertical software or tech-enabled product company. Each of our 27 businesses are leaders in their respective niche markets. Our businesses serve the mission-critical needs of our customers and have intimate relationships with them. Our market leadership, purpose-built software solutions and customer intimacy are the basis for our long-term, competitive advantage.\nNext is our higher level of organic growth. This is no accident. We have raised the performance expectations for each of our businesses to structurally improve their long-term organic growth capabilities. We're doing this in a balance sheet- and margin-friendly way.\nA large component of the organic growth story is the higher level of recurring revenue within each of our companies, approaching 60% for the enterprise and about 75% for our software businesses. In addition, our businesses are blessed with business models that generate high levels of free cash flow, a result of their operational efficiency, margin levels and customer prepaid orientation of their balance sheets.\nToday, our portfolio is 75% software and 25% medical and water products. We are meaningfully less cyclical today versus 2018 given the markets we serve, health care, legal, education, government contracting, utilities and food, to name some of our larger ones, and our fixed subscription versus volume-based revenue model.\nTo put today's portfolio in perspective, in 2018, roughly 40% of our company was either highly cyclical or project-oriented. Today, these market dynamics essentially no longer exist for us.\nWhen we reflect on this portfolio transition, we've never been more excited for the future of Roper given our increased quality, higher growth and more resilient portfolio companies.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Rob to walk you through our financial summary and our balance sheet position. Rob?\n\nRobert C. Crisci\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 8 and covering our Q3 financial highlights. As a reminder, as Zack said, all financial results are on a continuing operations basis.\nTotal revenue increased 10% to $1.35 billion. The FX headwind was $20 million or 1.6% and was offset by acquisition contributions. Notably, our mix of business has shifted meaningfully toward more domestic revenue post the announced majority sale of our industrial businesses. The U.S. now represents approximately 85% of our revenue, helping to shield our results from the impacts of any currency fluctuations.\nQ3 organic revenue increased 10%, with broad-based strength across each of our 3 reporting segments. Application Software grew 7%. Network software grew 10%. And technology-enabled products grew a robust 15% organically.\nEBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 41.1%, resulting in 12% EBITDA growth.\nAdjusted DEPS was $3.67, well above our guidance range and 18% higher than last year.\nQ3 adjusted free cash flow was $353 million, which was 9% above prior year.\nExcluding the Section 174 tax law change we discussed last quarter, quarterly free cash flow grew 17%.\nIn the quarter, we made $157 million of additional tax payments related to our recent divestitures. Per our normal convention, those payments have been adjusted out of our reported cash flow.\nSo overall, an excellent third quarter, as Neil said, and great momentum heading into Q4.\nNext slide. Turning to Page 9, looking at our strong financial position. We did complete the Frontline acquisition early in the fourth quarter utilizing a combination of our balance sheet cash and a draw on our revolving credit facility. As of today, our drawn revolver balance sits at $2.2 billion. We expect to fully pay down the revolver balance with the proceeds from our industrial sale, which should close late in the fourth quarter.\nSo after taking into account the receipt of those industrial transaction proceeds, we'd expect to end the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio pro forma for our recent acquisitions in the mid-2s.\nOur consistently strong cash generation quickly refreshes our capacity for capital deployment. So looking forward, we remain active on the M&A front, and we have the ability to deploy an additional $4 billion plus of capital now through the end of 2023.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to review our segment performance.\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through our 3Q highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $644 million, up 7% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 43.6%.\nAcross this segment, we saw recurring revenue, which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 8% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models.\nAcross this group of companies, the financial strength was broad and has been quite consistent for several quarters running.\nAs we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Vertafore, who had another great quarter of bookings growth, revenue growth and margin performance. Vertafore continues to see success in their software solutions targeted to the P&C insurance market, with particular strength in the enterprise class market segment.\nAcross both Deltek and Aderant, we continue to see solid new customer adds and nice momentum and migration towards their SaaS solutions. Also in the quarter, we acquired TIP Technologies for Deltek, a leading software provider servicing the GovCon manufacturing and QA market and viGlobal for Aderant, a leading human resources and recruiting software tool for global law firms.\nCBORD, our nutrition and access Management software business, had strength across both education and health care end markets.\nClinisys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. CliniSys continued its market share gains across Europe, and DI continues to demonstrate product market fit by gaining share of wallet across large health care systems.\nStrata continues to be solid for us as evidenced by strong new customer adds, cross-selling and renewal activity.\nFinally, Frontline will be reported in this segment starting in Q4.\nLooking at the outlook for the final quarter of the year, we expect to see organic growth in the 6% to 8% area.\nTurning to Page 12. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $347 million, up 10% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were strong at 54.5%. The 10% organic growth in this segment is underpinned by 16% growth in recurring revenue.\nAs we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continue to be fantastic. The market conditions, while slowing a touch on the carrier side of the network, remain favorable. These businesses saw a nice new customer adds and ARPU increases during the quarter.\nMoving to Foundry, our software business that enables live action film and computer-generated graphics to be combined in a single frame, again demonstrated their financial strength. Net retention was very strong and ARR grew in the strong double digits again.\nFoundry's success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability and favorable long-term market conditions.\nGrowth in our businesses that focus on alternate site healthcare was led by SHP and SoftWriters and, importantly, retention rates across each of these businesses remained extremely high.\nFinally, iTrade, our network through supply chain business, and iPipeline, our life insurance SaaS business that tech enables the quoting and underwriting processes, each had solid customer additions which helped drive strong ARR growth in the quarter.\nTurning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect to see 8% to 10% organic growth for this segment.\nAs we turn to Page 13, revenues in our tech-enabled products segment were $360 million, up 15% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment increased nicely to 37.2% in the quarter. It's very nice to see 15% organic growth in the quarter and easing supply chain challenges. While supply chain challenges remain, we experienced demonstrable easing conditions, especially as it relates to chips and chipsets. We are cautiously optimistic; conditions will continue to improve.\nLet's start with Neptune, which once again set records for orders and quarter-end backlog. For a few quarters running, Neptune has been able to gain market share by successfully maintaining industry-leading product lead times while simultaneously launching new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. To this end, Neptune continues to experience accelerating demand for their static leader solutions.\nVerathon was simply strong. They grew nicely in the quarter driven by momentum across all 3 components of their product portfolio, bladder volume measurement, video intubation and single-use bronchoscopes.\nAs it relates to Northern Digital, they set a new record for quarterly revenues as they experienced continued strong demand for their precision measurement solutions.\nOur outlook for the final quarter of the year is 5% to 7% organic growth for this segment as we have a more difficult comp heading into Q4.\nNow please turn to Page 15, and let's review our updated and increased outlook for the balance of the year.\nAs a reminder, last quarter, we increased our adjusted DEPS outlook to be between $13.46 and $13.62. We are now once again increasing our guidance to be between $14.09 and $14.13, an increase of $0.57 at the midpoint. This increase as guided is driven by our strong third quarter performance and the momentum we carry in Q4, together with the addition of Frontline Education. Embedded in this guidance is full year organic growth of 9% plus, an increase from 8% to 9% organic growth guidance discussed last quarter.\nAs we look to the fourth quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.72 and $3.76.\nNow our concluding comments, and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 16, we want to leave you with the same key points with which we started. First, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we are increasing our outlook for the year. Second, we acquired another leading niche software business, Frontline Education. Third, we continue to have substantial M&A firepower, north of $4 billion. And fourth and perhaps the most important, the new, higher quality portfolio is becoming ever more visible.\nAs it relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically by 10% and EBITDA by 12%. We are lifting our full year organic growth and DEPS guidance based on the factors previously discussed.\nRegarding capital deployment, we have been active. Over the past couple of months, we deployed just over $4 billion. To this end, our prudence and patience are being rewarded through the identification and selection of these high-quality assets.\nWe continue to have a large amount of available M&A capacity north of $4 billion. We continue to be very active in the M&A market. But as you saw in Q3, as always, we remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital.\nFinally and perhaps the most important, the new, higher-quality Roper portfolio is becoming increasingly more evident, and we have never been more excited about the future of our enterprise.\nAs we turn to your questions, let us remind everyone that our strategy is the same. We compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche, market-leading technology businesses. This is what we've done for over 20 years, and we'll continue to do.\nIn addition, our value creation and governance model remains unchanged. We operate a portfolio of market-leading businesses in defensible niches. Each of our businesses has high levels of recurring revenue, strong margin and competes based on customer intimacy, which yields highly resilient organic growth rates.\nWe operate a highly decentralized operating structure that focuses on long-term business building. Our culture sets a very high bar for performance and focuses on continually improving. We are all paid to grow, which reinforces our culture of transparency, nimbleness and humility.\nFinally, we redeploy the vast majority of our capital to acquire the next great business. We do this with centralized corporate resources in a highly disciplined, thoughtful and analytical manner. This strategy unchanged, delivers compounded and superior long-term shareholder value.\nSo thanks for joining us this morning. And with that, let's open up to your questions."

The Roper Technologies conference call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded, (Operator Instructions) And now I'd like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVP of IR, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the second quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\nNow if you please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.\nAnd now please turn to Page 3. Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. During the quarter, Roper announced an agreement to sell a majority stake in our industrial businesses. Results for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, the numbers shown in this presentation are on a continuing operations basis.\nFor the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense; income tax restructuring expense associated with the pending sale of our industrial businesses; and lastly, we have adjusted our cash flow statement to exclude the cash taxes paid related to our 2021 divestitures. GAAP requires these payments to be classified as operating cash flow items even though they are related to the divestitures. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I'll hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning, we'll start by reviewing our second quarter highlights and financial results, then we'll review our segment detail and our increase out for the year, then get to your questions.\nNext slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are: first, we had another great quarter of operational and financial performance, and we're increasing our outlook for the year; second, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to divest the majority stake of our industrial businesses; and third, we have north of $7 billion of available M&A firepower.\nLooking at the second quarter, we continue to be pleased with the quality of execution across our enterprise. This quarter is characterized by having very strong order activity and solid organic growth of 11%. Of particular importance, our growth was quite broad-based across our 3 segments. Consistent with our commentary during the last several quarters, not only did we grow nicely within the quarter, but the quality of the underlying businesses also improved as we saw our software recurring revenue base grow 12% on an organic basis.\nIn addition to our strong software growth, our product businesses performed very well in the quarter, experiencing very high levels of demand and record levels of backlog. Once we complete the divestiture of the majority interest of our industrial businesses, the quality of our portfolio will be significantly improved across several dimensions. First, we will be meaningfully less cyclical, with about 75% of our portfolio being software and the balance being medical and water products. Second, we'll have higher levels of recurring revenue, with 80% of our software revenue being recurring in nature. Also, a large percentage of our product revenue is reoccurring in nature, such as Neptune's replacement demand and our medical product consumables. And third, we'll be even more asset-light given a vastly improved working capital profile, one that generates significant increasing amount of cash as we continue to grow. And finally, with the closing of our industrial divestiture, which we anticipate will occur later this year, we'll have north of $7 billion of M&A capacity.\nWe are very active in the M&A markets, but also remain super patient and highly disciplined to ensure optimal deployment of our available capital. We are confident in our ability to deploy this capital wisely, which in turn will further improve both the quality and scale of our enterprise. We are proud of our operating team for their execution, a very solid quarter. Now let me turn the call to Rob, who will walk through our financial summary. Rob?\n\nRobert C. Crisci\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 6. Here, we want to briefly cover our Q2 performance compared to our guidance, including the industrial businesses now reported as part of discontinued operations due to the pending sale. On that apples-to-apples basis, our Q2 DEPS of $3.95 compares quite favorably to our guidance of $3.80 to $3.84, an $0.11 beat at the high end of our guidance. A very strong quarter.\nNext slide. Turning to Page 7 and covering the Q2 financial highlights. Here, we will review some of the key financial metrics on a continuing operations basis, which is our reporting basis for earnings and guidance moving forward. Total revenue increased 10% to $1.31 billion. Organic revenue increased 11%, with strength across each of our 3 reporting segments. Application Software grew 7% organically as our 2 largest businesses, Deltek and Vertafore, continue to perform very well. Network Software grew 15% led by continued exceptional performance at our freight matching businesses. Finally, our new technology-enabled products segment grew 13% organically, aided by an excellent quarter from Neptune.\nEBITDA margin was 39.3%, resulting in EBITDA increasing 10% to $515 million. DEPS on a continuing ops basis was $3.43, 16% higher than last year. Net working capital is now negative 17% of Q2 annualized revenue as a result of our higher-quality portfolio.\nQ2 adjusted free cash flow was $252 million, which was 19% below prior year, but still represent a 17% 3-year CAGR versus 2019. Notably, like many technology companies, our cash flow was negatively impacted by the Section 174 R&D capitalization change that took effect for 2022. We paid $49 million in Q2 related to Section 174, and we expect to pay an additional $50 million for Section 174 in the second half. Importantly, this tax law change only impacts the timing of when the taxes are due, and not the overall amount of tax owed or our tax rate.\nAdditionally, in the quarter, we made tax payments related to the gains on the 2021 divestitures of TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy. Per our normal convention, those payments have been adjusted out of our cash flow. Finally, we are very pleased to announce the completion of our new 5-year $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. We are grateful for our bank group and their continued support, and I'd personally like to thank Shannon O'Callaghan sitting next to me for the excellent work in leading the process for Roper.\nSo in summary, with a $3 billion cash balance, our new revolver in place and the future proceeds from the closing of our industrial sale later this year, we are very well positioned for meaningful capital deployment. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil.\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. Congrats to you and your team for upsizing and extending our revolver, especially in these market conditions.\nAs we turn to Page 9, we summarize for you our go-forward portfolio of 26 businesses arrayed across 3 segments: Application Software, Network Software and tech-enabled products. In the 8-K issued a few weeks ago, we provided historical annual and quarterly financial disclosures on this segmented basis. Also for the first time, we're breaking down our revenues by type. As you see, 61% of our total revenue and 82% of our software revenues are recurring or reoccurring in nature. 74% of our total revenues are software related.\nFor several quarters, we've communicated how the quality of our revenue stream continues to improve. You can see this point well illustrated here. Our 11% organic growth is underpinned by a 12% growth in our software recurring revenue base. Further, you can see the breadth of the growth, growth in software and products. Our strategy for nearly 2 decades now has been to improve the quality of our enterprise, and this is clearly reflected on this page. We cannot be more excited for our future.\nLet's turn to Page 10 and walk through the 2Q highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $627 million, up 7% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 43.1%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue which is about 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 8% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention and continued migration to our SaaS delivery models. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was quite broad.\nAs we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Deltek. The Deltek team posted another great quarter of strength across all end market serves, with particular strength in their construction contractor end market. In addition, Deltek continues to gain momentum, driving adoption to their cloud-based product offerings.\nVertafore had an excellent quarter, which was highlighted by strong ARR bookings activity and revenue growth. Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of MGA Systems. This tuck-in acquisition enhances Vertafore's ability to compete and win in the managed general agent segment of the property and casualty insurance ecosystem. CliniSys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. CliniSys continued its market share gains in the U.K.; DI continues to demonstrate product market fit by gaining share of wallet across large health systems and the VA.\nStrata continues to be super solid for us. The acquisition of EPSI has been exceedingly strong as Strata has successfully lifted and shifted many EPSI customers to the Strata cloud-based offering. At the same time, Strata continues to improve the legacy EPSI product release and support capability. We remain committed to meeting the EPSI and Strata customers where they are.\nFinally, Aderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, extending their share gains in the large law space. Aderant continues to see an acceleration of SaaS bookings activity, driving substantial increases in the recurring revenue base. Looking to the outlook for the second half of 2022 in this segment. We expect to see mid-single-digit growth for the balance of the year, driven by continued ARR momentum.\nTurning to Page 11. Revenues in the quarter for our Network Software segment were $343 million, up 15% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 52%. The 15% organic growth in this segment is underpinned by 19% growth in recurring revenue.\nAs we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continued to be exceptional. The market conditions while slowing a touch on the carrier side of the network continue to be favorable. During the recent surge in transportation volumes, the market share of the ecosystem represented by the spot market increased as it became easier to transact volumes in the spot market compared to the contracted market. We believe this is a secular trend that DAT will benefit from over a multiyear arc. In addition, DAT continues to do a nice job of increasing revenue per user by both adding features and improving value capture. Finally, over a longer arc planning horizon, our freight matching businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the further digitization of the spot freight market.\nMoving to Foundry. Our software business that enables live-action filming and computer-generated graphics to be combined in a single frame, continued their recent financial strength. Net retention is north of 110% and ARR grew double digits again. Foundry's success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability and favorable long-term market conditions. iTrade, our network food supply chain business and iPipeline, our life insurance SaaS business that tech enables the quoting and underwriting processes, each had solid customer additions, which helped drive strong air of growth in the quarter. Finally, our businesses which focus on alternate site health care, namely skilled nursing, assisted living and home health grew nicely in the quarter despite their customers' growth being constrained by staffing shortages. Proud of the execution here.\nTurning to the outlook for the balance of the year. We expect to see mid-single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by continued recurring revenue momentum and moderating growth for our freight match businesses.\nAs we turn to Page 12, revenues in our tech-enabled products segment were $340 million, up 13% on an organic basis despite the very challenging supply chain environment. EBITDA margins for this segment were 34.9% in the quarter.\nLet's start with Neptune, which had record orders, revenue and quarter ending backlog. For a few quarters running, Neptune has been able to gain market share by being successful in keeping product lead times at industry-leading terms and releasing new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. As a fun fact, Neptune turns 50 later this quarter and next year will mark our 20-year ownership anniversary, a great run so far with an even better forward view. Congrats, Don, to you and your team for building such a great company.\nVerathon, Northern Digital and each of our medical product franchises continue to see very strong ordering activity but were hampered by a variety of supply chain challenges during the quarter. That said, the teams are executing exceptionally well, and we remain confident in our ability to execute through these challenges. Looking over the horizon, each of our medical product businesses are benefactors of secular tailwinds, namely the increased demand for single-use devices and the aging of the population. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain challenges.\nNow please turn to Page 14, and let's review our updated and increased outlook for the balance of the year. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $15.50 and $15.75, which included $2.30 from our industrial businesses. Given our agreement to divest our industrial businesses, we are removing the $2.30 from our guidance model going forward. So on a new continuing ops basis, our previous guidance equates to $13.20 to $13.45.\nBased on our strong Q2 and second half visibility, we're now increasing our continuing ops guidance to be between $13.46 and $13.62. Embedded in this guidance is full year organic growth of 8% to 9%, again, on a continuing ops basis. As we look to the third quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.42 and $3.46.\nNow our concluding comments, and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 15, we want to leave you with the same 3 points with which we started: first, we had a strong quarter of performance, and we're increasing the outlook for the full year; second, we took strategic actions to divest a majority stake in our industrial businesses; and third, we have a tremendous amount of M&A firepower north of $7 billion.\nAs it relates to our strong start, we grew revenues organically 11%; EBITDA, 10%; and DEPS, 16%; and free cash flow has grown 17% on a 3-year compounded basis. We are lifting our full year organic growth in DEPS guidance based on the factors outlined during the call, specifically strong recurring revenue growth and a record demand for our product businesses. Finally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have a highly active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We have north of $7 billion of M&A available firepower.\nAs mentioned at the start of today's call, our high levels of activity are equally matched with our patience and discipline, and we remain confident in our ability to deploy this capital to further improve the quality and scale of our enterprise, just as we've done over the past 2 decades. Finally, kudos to Rob and Shannon and the finance team for increasing the size and term of our $3.5 billion revolver.\nAs we turn to your questions, let us remind everyone that our strategy is the same: we compound cash flow by acquiring and growing niche market-leading technology businesses. This is what we've done for over 20 years and will continue to do so. In addition, our value creation and governance model remains unchanged. We operate a portfolio of market-leading businesses and defensible niches. Each of our businesses has high levels of recurring revenue, strong margins and competes based on customer intimacy, which yields highly resilient organic growth rates.\nWe operate a highly decentralized operational structure that focuses on long-term business building. Our culture sets a very high bar for performance and focuses on continually improving. We are all paid to grow, which reinforces our culture of transparency, nimbleness and humility. Finally, we redeployed the vast majority of our capital to acquire the next great business. We do this with a centralized corporate resource team in a highly disciplined, thoughtful and analytical manner. This strategy, unchanged, delivers compounded and superior long-term shareholder value.\nSo thanks for joining us this morning. And with that, let's open it up to your questions."

Please go ahead.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVP of IR, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the first quarter financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call.

Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the first quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website. And now if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I'm sure many of you have already noticed, we are introducing Roper's new logo on today's call. Our new logo better reflects our transformation journey while paying honor and respect to our legacy. As a fun fact, our legacy logo was first introduced in 1977.\nSo with that, let's turn to Page 4 and review today's agenda. As usual, we start with our quarterly highlights, followed by our segment by segment overview, then go through our increased outlook for guidance expectations and leave plenty of time to address all your questions.\nNext slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways from today's call are: first, we continue to increase the quality, predictability and durability of the underlying business models and revenue streams; second, we continue to deliver strong organic growth and operating results, enabling us to increase our organic growth outlook and DEPS guidance for the year; and third, we have substantial M&A capacity, given our rapid deleveraging and completion of our TransCore divestiture.\nAs it relates to the first quarter, we're delighted to report another strong quarter of execution and positive momentum across the portfolio. Specifically, we grew revenue on an organic basis, 11% in the quarter. This growth was broad-based across each of our 4 segments. Not only did we grow nicely in the quarter, but the quality of the underlying business also improved as we saw double-digit organic increases in our recurring revenue base.\nIn addition to our strong software growth, our product businesses performed quite nicely in the quarter as well, experiencing very high levels of demand and record levels of backlog. Also during the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our project-based TransCore business. As you'll note, we now have $3.2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. When combined with our borrowing capacity, we have over $5 billion of available capital deployment firepower, which when deployed will further help drive cash flow and shareholder value compounding. So with this, definitely a solid start to the year.\nNow let me turn the call to Rob, who will walk through our financial summary. Rob?\n\nRobert C. Crisci\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Page 6 and covering some of the Q1 financial highlights. Total revenue increased 11% to $1.53 billion. As Neil mentioned, organic revenue also increased 11% with broad-based strength across our 4 reporting segments. Application Software grew 9% organically, Network Software grew 16%; our MAS segment grew 7%; and finally, our smallest segment, Process Technologies, was up 18%. EBITDA margin was 37.8% for the quarter, resulting in EBITDA increasing 8% to $577 million.\nNotably, that $577 million of Q1 EBITDA on a continuing operations basis is actually higher than the Q1 EBITDA we reported last April, when we still own and, of course, consolidated TransCore and the other 2 divested businesses. Adjusted DEPS for the quarter was 3.77%, which was well above our guidance range of $363 million to $367 million. Free cash flow was $459 million, with solid EBITDA cash conversion of 80%. That's above the Q1 conversion levels we experienced in 2019 and 2020 but below last year's exceptionally strong Q1 conversion of 96%.\nTo that end, there are 2 discrete cash items that combined to create an $80 million Q1 headwind versus prior year. As discussed on last April's call, last year's Q1 included $40 million of accelerated payments to CliniSys.\nFurthermore, this year's Q1 reflects a $40 million increase in incentive compensation as a result of our strong 2021 performance compared to the pandemic year of 2020. So stepping back, we are, of course, focused on long-term compounding here at Roper. In the 3 blue bars at the bottom of our page, you can see our 3-year compounding from Q1 2019 for revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow was 10%, 13% and 17%, respectively. So in summary, an excellent start to the year.\nNext slide. Turning to Page 7, which is an update on our financial position. Turning to the balance sheet. As Neil mentioned, we have a very large cash balance, which is the result of closing the TransCore divestiture during the quarter and receiving the gross proceeds. We have yet to pay the approximately $650 million of taxes related to the divestitures and which will be paid during the final 3 quarters of 2022. As of March 31, as Neil mentioned, our cash balance stood at $3.2 billion, which brings our net debt down to $4.2 billion or approximately 1.9x our TTM EBITDA from continuing ops.\nSo with our healthy combination of balance sheet cash, continued strong free cash flow generation and our investment-grade leverage capacity, we are very well positioned to deploy $5 billion or more of capital. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Neil to cover our segments in greater detail.\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 9 and walk through the Q1 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $632 million, up 9% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 44.1%. Across this segment, we saw recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment increased 10% in the quarter. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds. Across this group of companies, the financial strength was quite broad. As we highlight a few businesses, we'll start with Vertafore. Vertafore had an excellent quarter, which was highlighted by strong ARR bookings activity and revenue growth. In addition, during the quarter, Vertafore released its new commercial submissions product line. To remind everyone, Vertafore's strategy is to help tech-enabled workflows for their P&C agent customers. This new product is a meaningful step in this direction as it allows agents to quote multiple carriers in a simple automated workflow. Great stuff from the Vertafore team.\nTurning to Deltek. They posted another great quarter with strength across all end markets served. Deltek continues to gain momentum, driving adoption to their cloud-based product offerings. Deltek also continues to be benefited by having favorable secular tailwinds. CliniSys and Data Innovations continue to exhibit strong demand and operational strength. Specifically, CliniSys continued its market share gains in the U.K. As a reminder, CliniSys is one of 4 strategic IT vendors to the National Health Service. DI was awesome in the quarter with continued strength, driven by their direct go-to-market approach and large wins within the VA system.\nAderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, extending their share gains in the large law space. Also in the quarter, licensing activity tied to seed expansions was very strong. They also continue to see a meaningful shift towards our cloud offerings, driving substantial increases to the recurring revenue base. Strata whose cloud-based software helps hospitals plan, budget and manage their operations continues to execute their cross-selling strategy with TTM net retention north of 110%.\nOf note, we are in the midst of an orderly leader transition at Strata, Dan Michelson, who has led Strata for the last 10 years is retiring. As an element of Roper's talent offense, Strata has been developing its next CEO, John Martino, for the past several years. As part of John's development, he started in the CFO function then led commercial and go-to-market functions and then became the company's COO. Strata's future is secure given the successful succession planning. Big thanks to Dan for all your leadership and accomplishments at Strata. John, we are super confident with you at the helm, your new role is well earned. Congrats.\nFinally, PowerPlan posted a strong double-digit growth quarter, driven by recurring revenue adds and higher services utilization. They also have a substantial new product road map slated for this year, which we're looking forward to discussing on subsequent calls.\nLooking to the outlook for 2022 in the segment, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth for the balance of the year, driven by continued strong ARR momentum. With that, let's turn to the next slide.\nTurning to Page 10. As a reminder, the financial performance for this segment as well as the X2, MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. Revenue in the first quarter for our Network segment was $369 million, up 16% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were strong at 51.2%. The 16% organic growth is underpinned by 16% growth in recurring revenue, which is roughly 80% of the segment's revenue base. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses continue to be super strong during the quarter. The market conditions continue to be quite favorable, which led to record levels of network adds again, especially on the carrier side of the network. In addition, DAT continues to do a nice job of increasing revenue per user by both adding features and improving value capture.\nOver the longer arc of time, our freight matching businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the digitization of the spot freight markets.\nMoving to Foundry. Our software business that enables the combination of live action filming and computer-generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, had record bookings, revenue and EBITDA for the first quarter. Net retention is north of 110% and ARR grew double digits. Foundry success is rooted in their fast-paced innovation capability in favorable long-term market conditions. iTrade, our network food supply chain business and iPipeline, our life insurance SaaS business helping to tech enable the quoting and underwriting processes each had strong customer additions, which helped drive strong ARR growth in the quarter.\nFinally, RF IDeas had record orders with growth coming from secure print and identity management applications. Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year. We expect to see high single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds.\nKindly turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 11, revenues in our MAS segment were $392 million, up 7% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 31.5% for the quarter. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. Before getting into business-specific details across this segment, demand continues to be very strong and product backlogs continue to be at record levels. Also, each of these businesses are navigating the current supply chain complexities.\nWhile margins were in line with our expectations, they were negatively impacted versus prior year and are impacted by the availability and pricing of raw material components as well as expediting freight costs. As our businesses increased price actions take hold throughout the year, margins should improve as we get into the second half. As it relates to our business-specific commentary, we'll start with Neptune, which had record orders, revenue and quarter ending backlog.\nNeptune has been able to gain market share by being successful in keeping product lead times at industry-leading terms and releasing new products, both in terms of cellular connectivity and static meter reading technology. Verathon, Northern Digital and each of our medical product franchises remain super solid. Verathon continues to see strong demand and market share gains in their single-use bronchoscope category and NDI sees the same in both our optical and electromechanical measurement capabilities. These businesses are beneficiaries of long-term and favorable market tailwinds. As it relates to our industrial businesses, demand throughout the quarter was quite strong, given the improving end market and capital spending conditions. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. Net-net, we expect a very strong balance of the year for this group -- for the balance of the year for this group.\nNow let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 12, revenue on our Process Tech segment were $134 million in Q1, up 18% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 32.5% in the quarter. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The story here is we continue to see improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and very strong demand. Cornell continues to perform well for us delivering record orders in backlog in the quarter. The strength is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand tick up for their IoT connected pumping solutions and the share gains they are doing as a result of their niche-focused go-to-market teams.\nAlso, our upstream oil and gas businesses saw strength in the quarter. Similar to that, our MAS product businesses, these businesses are also being impacted by supply chain challenges, but continue to navigate well through the issues. As we turn to the outlook for the balance of 2022, we expect high-teens organic growth based on strong levels of backlog and solid market conditions. Now please turn to Page 14, and we'll talk through our 2022 increased guidance outlook.\nBased on a solid start to Q1, strong growth in our software recurring revenue base and record levels of product demand and backlog, we are increasing our full year 2022 DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.50 and $15.75 up from our original guidance of $15.25 and $15.55. Underpinning this DEPS guidance is our increased organic revenue growth expectation of 7% to 9% for the year. We expect a steady tax rate in the 21% to 22% range.\nAs we look to the second quarter, we're establishing DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.80 and $3.84, again, on a continuing ops basis. Now our concluding comments, and we'll get to your questions.\nAs we turn to Page 15 in our closing remarks, we want to leave you with the same 3 points we started with: One, as we grow, we are increasing the quality of the underlying business and business model; two, we had a strong start to the year; and three, we have substantial M&A capacity available to us. As it relates to a strong start, we grew revenues organically 11% and EBITDA 8%. More so, we have grown our cash flow 17% on a 3-year compounded basis. We are lifting our full year organic growth and DEPS guidance based on the factors outlined during this call, specifically strong recurring revenue growth, record demand for our product businesses and generally favorable market conditions.\nFinally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have an active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We have north of $5 billion of available M&A firepower. So as we turn to your questions, we would like to highlight that our inaugural ESG report was published to our website earlier today. This report outlines our commitment to ESG and our sustainability principles. And with that, let's open it to your questions."

The Roper Technologies Conference Call will now begin. Today's call is being recorded, (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Zack Moxcey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nZack Moxcey\n\nVP of IR, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results for Roper Technologies. Joining me on the call this morning are Neil Hunn, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Crisci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jason Conley, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer; and Shannon O'Callaghan, Vice President of Finance.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release announcing our financial results. The press release also includes replay information for today's call. We have prepared slides to accompany today's call, which are available through the webcast and are also available on our website.\nNow if you'll please turn to Page 2. We begin with our safe harbor statement. During the course of today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as described on this page, in our press release and in our SEC filings. You should listen to today's call in the context of that information.\nAnd now please turn to Page 3. Unless otherwise noted, we will discuss our results and guidance on an adjusted non-GAAP and continuing operations basis. For the fourth quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consists of the following items: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense, a Sunquest trade name and technology asset impairment related to the merger with CliniSys. And lastly, income tax restructuring associated with our pending divestiture of TransCore. Reconciliations can be found in our press release and in the appendix of this presentation on our website.\nAnd now if you please turn to Page 4, I will hand the call over to Neil. After our prepared remarks, we will take questions from our telephone participants. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Zack, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Let's turn to Page 4 and review today's agenda. As usual, we'll start with our quarterly and full year highlights. We will then provide details regarding our segment performance, followed by sharing our first quarter and full year 2022 guidance. At the end, we'll leave plenty of time to address all your questions.\nNext slide, please. As we turn to Page 5, the main takeaways for today's call are: first, our strong finish to '21; second, that we are set up very well for a solid 2022 organic performance; and third, we have substantial M&A capacity given our rapid deleveraging last year. As it relates to the fourth quarter and close to 2021, financial performance was excellent with double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow.\nAdditionally, because of our strong cash performance last year, our balance sheet is in a great spot as we exceeded our deleveraging plans for the year. As we look towards our 2022 outlook, we have considerable tailwinds that help set up for a very strong year.\nUnderpinning this outlook is our software recurring revenue growth momentum. Given strong market demand, continued innovation in new products and an increased shift towards our SaaS solutions, we exit 2021 with robust ARR growth that carries momentum into '22. In addition, our product businesses are experiencing strong demand and record levels of backlog, which provide these businesses with an unprecedented level of in-hand orders and revenue visibility heading into the year. Factoring all this together, we expect 6% to 8% organic revenue growth in 2022.\nIn addition to this organic outlook, our balance sheet is well positioned to allow us to be more meaningfully offensive with M&A in 2022. So the table is set for us to have great 2022 and continue our long-term track record of double-digit cash flow compound.\nNow let me turn things over to our CFO, Rob Crisci, to walk through our financial summary. Rob?\n\nRobert C. Crisci\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Neil. Good morning, everyone, and thanks again for joining us. Turning to Page 6, looking at our Q4 income statement performance. As Zack stated earlier, all the financials here are reported on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted.\nBoth organic revenue and total revenue for the quarter increased 13% to a total of $1.51 billion. EBITDA grew 12% to $576 million. EBITDA margin was down 10 basis points versus prior year at 38.1%. That all resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.73, which was above our guidance range.\nFree cash flow grew 4% in the quarter on top of last year's 23% fourth quarter growth. Cash conversion was once again very strong at 35% of revenue and 92% of EBITDA. Q4 was a nice finish to a very strong year and positions us well for a great 2022.\nNext slide. Turning to Page 7, reviewing the Q4 results by segment. Neil will discuss the full year segment performance in more detail a little later, but we wanted to just highlight the Q4 results by segment here.\nAll 4 segments grew double digit organically as our businesses executed very well and continued to win within their niche markets. Application Software segment grew 10% organically with broad-based strength throughout the segment. EBITDA margin increased to 43.8%. For Network Software, excellent 14% organic growth with EBITDA margin increasing to 52.3%.\nFor Measurement & Analytical Solutions, 15% organic growth was broad-based with double-digit growth at Neptune, medical products and our industrial businesses. EBITDA margin was 31.3% as our businesses continue to navigate supply chain challenges. Lastly, for Process Technologies, a nice rebound from last year's decline with 17% organic revenue growth and EBITDA margins of 31.2%.\nNext slide, turning to Page 8, which is a summary of our full year 2021 financial highlights. For full year 2021, organic revenue growth was 9%. We benefited from both our strong organic growth and meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions to achieve 19% total revenue growth.\nEBITDA grew 22% for the year to exceed $2.2 billion. EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points to 38.2%. Full year DEPS increased 23% to $14.18 and which was above the high end of our guidance range. Free cash flow performance was outstanding for the year with 19% growth to $1.8 billion.\nOur free cash flow represented 31% of revenue and 82% of EBITDA. Excellent cash conversion, which is, of course, a key component of Roper's business model and value creation flywheel. We are well positioned to continue our double-digit cash flow compounding moving forward.\nNext slide. Turning to Page 9, which is the latest installment in our successful deleveraging story, including our discontinued operations, total operating cash flow for 2021 exceeded $2 billion. After CapEx and servicing of our dividend, nearly all of our excess free cash flow went to debt reduction.\nIn total, we were able to reduce our net debt by $1.7 billion in 2021, which exceeded the deleveraging outlook we shared with you last January by about $200 million. We ended the year with net debt to EBITDA of 3.1x. Subsequent to year-end, we closed the previously announced $350 million Zetec divestiture, which has further reduced our leverage. The closing of the TransCore divestiture expected for later this quarter will bring in over $2.1 billion of additional after-tax proceeds.\nWe are pleased with our performance here as we once again demonstrated our ability to quickly delever after large acquisitions, reinforcing our commitment to our solid investment-grade ratings. So with that, I will turn it back over to Neil for the remainder of our prepared remarks. Neil?\n\nLaurence Neil Hunn\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Roper Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rob. Let's turn to Page 11 and walk through the 2021 highlights for our Application Software segment. Revenues here were $2.38 billion, up 8% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins were 44.2%. Across this segment, we saw organic recurring revenue which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for this segment increase 8% for the year. This recurring revenue growth is enabled by strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, cross-selling activity and new customer adds.\nAcross this group of companies, the financial strength was broad-based. To highlight a few companies, Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the U.S. federal, contractor, architect, engineering and other services end markets, had another great year.\nDeltek had nice gains in both our government contracting and private sector end markets, gaining share at each and driving considerable SaaS adoption. Deltek continues to benefit by having favorable secular tailwinds.\nTurning to Vertafore, a great year, exceeding the EBITDA expectations that we outlined at the time of the acquisition in 2020. Vertafore had impressive demand from their enterprise customers as they continue to partner with P&C agencies to tech-enable their customer acquisition, quoting and underwriting workflows. Notably, Vertafore had record quarterly bookings in Q4, which only adds to their ARR momentum. Amy, to you and your team, congrats to a phenomenal start as part of the Roper family.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we combined CliniSys and Sunquest to create the largest global lab diagnostics and informatics business. Together, the businesses will begin integrating their go-forward product road maps and innovation efforts and operate under the CliniSys brand. Also of note, both CliniSys and data innovation set records by a wide margin for bookings activity in 2021.\nFinally, as it relates to this group, we recently completed the acquisition of Horizon Lab Systems, which adds public health, water and environmental laboratory cloud-based software to the global CliniSys product portfolio.\nAderant continues to be a solid performer for Roper, taking share in '21 from our primary large law competitor. Also, starting in 2020 and gaining momentum last year, Aderant is seeing a meaningful shift towards our cloud offering, helping drive substantial increases in their recurring revenue stream.\nFinally, we completed a small tuck-in acquisition, American LegalNet, which will extend and enhance Aderant's court docketing software solution.\nFinally, Strata's combination with EPSI has worked out wonderfully well. Today, Strata partners with about half of the U.S. acute care hospitals to help them manage, forecast and plan their operating and capital expenses and continues to extend both market share and product cross-selling.\nLooking to the outlook for 2022 in this segment. We expect mid-single-digit growth that is driven by our ARR or recurring revenue momentum, making for a solid year for this segment.\nAnd with that, let's turn to our next slide. Turning to Page 12, as a reminder, the financial performance for this segment, as well as in X2, MAS and PT are shown on a continuing ops basis. 2021 revenues in our Network segment were $1.34 billion, up 11% on an organic basis and EBITDA margins clocked in at 51.1% for the year.\nThe exceptional organic growth performance in this segment was underpinned by very strong growth in recurring revenue, which is roughly 80% of the segment's revenue. The growth in margin performance in this segment was broad based and well distributed. As we dig into business-specific performance, our U.S. and Canadian freight match businesses were just amazing throughout 2021.\nMarket conditions were very favorable, which led to record levels of network adds, especially on the carrier side. More so, the leadership team at DAT did a terrific job scaling infrastructure to meet the market's demand while maintaining aggressive new product innovation efforts, which led to higher ARPU as well. Over the longer arc of time, our freight match businesses continue to be well positioned to enable the digitization of the spot freight markets.\nAlso, all of our other businesses in this segment saw increasing levels of ARR growth throughout the year, which helped set up for a strong 2022. To highlight a few, Foundry did a terrific job of continuing to extend their product advantage by using AI ML to automate tasks within the media and entertainment post production workflows.\nIn addition, Foundry has benefited by the continued increases in content creation budgets for streaming, animation and theatrical releases. iTrade, our network food supply chain business, rebounded very nicely in 2021 following the 2020 COVID shutdowns. In addition to benefiting by food service reopening, iTrade was able to meaningfully expand their food supply chain network in 2021.\niPipeline continues to benefit from the tech enabling of the life insurance distribution model. And our long-term care GPO, pharmacy software and home health analytics businesses continue to benefit from the post COVID recovery and the longer-term demographic aging of America. Finally, both RFID and Inovonics had good years, improving in the second half, especially within their health care applications.\nTurning to the full year outlook. We expect to see high single-digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds.\nPlease turn to the next slide. As we turn to Page 13, revenues in our MAS segment were $1.56 billion, up 8% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.1% for the year. Again, these results are on a continuing ops basis. Before getting into business-specific details, across this segment, demand continues to be very strong. As previously mentioned, product backlogs ended the year at record levels. Also, each of these businesses are navigating the current supply chain environment.\nStrong demand at Neptune continued throughout the year, picking up in the back half as Neptune's end markets continue to fully reopen. Also, the Neptune team continues to do a great job innovating their core product offering both in terms of the metering and the meter reading technologies. These innovative product advances helped set Neptune up for many great years.\nVerathon was very good last year. Remember, they had a great 2020, which was aided by COVID-related demand, but Verathon's 2021 was meaningfully higher than 2019, roughly 40% larger. Over the last 2 years, this team has innovated like crazy, going from 0 to #2 in the U.S. single-use bronchoscope market, launching several new video or bronchoscope products and developing a new ultrasound core platform. Perhaps more importantly, in 2021, Verathon's largest product offering is now a mission-critical consumable medical product.\nOur other medical product businesses, especially NDI and CIVCO, recovered nicely in 2021 as health care spending started to normalize. These businesses enter 2022 with record levels of order backlog. Demand across our industrial business rebounded with better end market and capital spending conditions but somewhat hampered by supply chain challenges.\nAs it relates to the 2022 guidance, we expect to see high single-digit growth for this segment, underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. Net-net, we expect a very strong year for this group.\nNow let's turn to our final segment, Process Tech. As we turn to Page 14, revenues at our Process Tech segment were $499 million in 2021, up 8% on an organic basis. EBITDA margins were 32.2% for the year. These results are also reported on a continuing ops basis. The story here is we saw improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment and very strong demand in the second half.\nCornell continues to perform well for us. This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they're seeing very nice demand tick up for their IoT connected pumping solutions and the share gains they're enjoying as a result of their niche focused go-to-market teams. Similar to that of our MAS businesses, these businesses are being impacted by supply chain challenges, but continue to navigate well through the issues.\nAcross this group, the business has exited 2021 with record levels of order backlog.\nAs we turn to the outlook for 2022, we expect mid-teens organic growth based on strong levels of backlog and solid market conditions.\nNow please turn to Page 16 as we'll walk through our 2022 guidance. For 2022, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance on a continuing ops basis of $15.25 to $15.55 Underpinning this DEPS guidance is organic revenue growth of 6% to 8% and a tax rate of 21% to 22%. As we said throughout the call, we feel quite bullish about our 2022 based on our 2021 recurring revenue growth and the momentum it carries into this year with strong product demand and the record levels of order backlog.\nAs you look to the first quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be in the range of $3.63 and $3.67, again, on a continuing ops basis.\nNow some concluding comments, and we'll get to your questions. As we turn to Page 17 and our closing remarks, we want to leave you with the same 3 points we started with: we had a strong '21; we are set up very well for a solid 2022 organic performance; and we have substantial M&A capacity heading into the year.\nAs it relates to 2021, our revenues grew 19% to $5.8 billion and 9% on an organic basis. EBITDA grew 22% to $2.2 billion, which was 38.2% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 19% to $1.8 billion, 31% of revenue and 82% of EBITDA. Finally, we exceeded our deleveraging plan by reducing net debt by $1.7 billion and ending the year with 3.1x leverage.\nAs we discussed throughout this call, we are set up to have a very strong 2022. Our 2021 software recurring revenue growth provides significant momentum heading into the year. Additionally, our product businesses had and have broad-based demand and record levels of backlog.\nTaken together and further aided by favorable market tailwinds, we expect to see 6% to 8% organic revenue growth this year. In addition, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have a highly active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. We anticipate having about $5 billion of available M&A firepower over the course of 2022. As a result, we have a high level of conviction that will continue our double-digit cash flow compounding in 2022.\nAnd with that, let's open it up to your questions."

My name is Colby and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Q3 2025 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nI would like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew James Korn\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you, Colby. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to happy to join our third quarter earnings call. Joining me from the CSX leadership team are Steve Angel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, EVP and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, EVP and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the presentation that accompanies this call, which is available on our website, you will find slides with our forward-looking and non-GAAP disclosures. We encourage you to review them. With that, I'm very happy to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Angel.\n\nStephen F. Angel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Linde Plc\n\nThank you Matthew. Hello, everyone. We're happy to have you join our third quarter call today. First, I want to recognize Joe Henricks. He led this company through some difficult times and worked with this leadership team to make some real progress. Now we are all eager to move forward from a solid position.\nMy connection to this industry goes way back. My career started at GE, where I worked directly with locomotives and rail operations, that experience gave me a deep appreciation for railroading that has stayed with me. I spent the last couple of decades leading large industrial companies, specifically industrial gas companies, but the interest in rail never faded. There are some similarities between the industrial gas business and the railroad industry.\nFirst of all, safety. It isn't just a nice thing to do. It is a sacred responsibility. Everyone must come home safe at the end of each and every workday. Industrial gas and railroads are both capital-intensive businesses. Our strategy at Linde was to build network density in targeted geographies. That is how you leverage your infrastructure to generate ever higher returns on capital. That concept applies to the railroad industry as well. I think of pipelines and railway track the same way. own the pipelines provided they were in the right locations, had a strong advantage over their competition. Same for railroad tracks.\nAnother similarity is our vision. At Linde, our vision is to be the best-performing industrial gas company in the world. And we achieved that in some cases, by a large margin over the next best competitor. At CSX, our vision is to be the best-performing railroad in North America. I like that. And when we say best performing, I'm certainly talking about financial performance, operating margins, return on capital, cash flow, but I'm also talking about safety, customer service, employee engagement integrity and ethics. And I don't see any of these as being mutually exclusive. You can be best in class in all these areas and every important aspect of running a great railroad company. How do you do it? It takes a concerted effort. Sounds trite, but you have to make the most important things, the most important things. Focus, execute, grinded details repeat build a strong, stable foundation and get better every day, and build a disciplined, high-performance culture, and you build a talent pipeline that will sustain the culture long after you're gone.\nThat's enough about me. I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael A. Cory\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Canadian National Railway Company\n\nThank you, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. First, I want to recognize the very good work of our teams across the network. Their dedication and their execution have really led us to deliver one of our strongest operational performances in recent years. And we're building on that great service cost momentum from last quarter, and it's really paying off. We're seeing improvements across the board, but it's really exciting to see the railroad become more efficient and even more responsive to our customers' needs, especially given the current market conditions.\nWe can turn to the next slide. As Steve noted, safety is our largest shared responsibility. Our FRA personal injury frequency rate ticked up slightly from last quarter, but the bigger picture is very positive. Through September, we've seen a solid reduction in moderate and severe injuries with fewer cases requiring employees to miss work. This shows our SAFE CSX program is working. Our culture is shifting to be more proactive, data-driven and safety-focused and daily operations. On the train accident front, this quarter was the best since the end of 2023. Human factor accidents are down 16% year-to-date, thanks to targeted efforts, better training and smarter tools that help our people make safer decisions.\nNext slide. Now let's take a look at the operational performance. This was our fastest quarter for training velocity since early 2021. For all time hit at the lowest point since mid-2023 and average daily cars online were the lowest since 2020, that shows how disciplined the team has been in running a balanced, efficient network, even while major construction continued on the Howard Street Tunnel and Blue Ridge Subdivision. Tip Plan Compliance continued to improve. Intermodal TPC rose to 93% from 90% and carload TPC climbed to 83% from 75%. These are strong gains, a result of the fluidity of the network.\nNext slide. I'm proud of how this team has kept momentum on improving asset utilization, with market changes and mix shifts, our ability to be efficient and nimble is extremely important and was evident last quarter. Through disciplined asset and cost management, we reduce train miles and optimized horsepower utilization running efficiently without impacting customers. These improvements show up in our solid fuel productivity and horsepower management. Car month per day also improved, reflecting both faster train velocity and our unwavering focus on our operations.\nLet's go to the next slide. And finally, I want to highlight 2 major wins for us, Howard Street Tunnel and the Blue Ridge Subdivision projects, both were extremely complex efforts and finished slightly ahead of schedule, a tremendous accomplishment, and I want to give a big thank you to everyone on our team who is involved to make that happen. With these projects complete, we now have full network access, positioning us for greater capacity and resiliency as we go forward. In closing, I couldn't be prouder of the team. The momentum this quarter is real, and we're going to keep it going. We're not done improving, innovating or delivering for our customers and shareholders and each other.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Kevin.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Mike. As Mike just mentioned, we are excited that both the Howard Street Tunnel and Blue Ridge projects are complete. As we move forward, customers will see benefits from reduced out-of-route miles that will improve on our best-in-class service levels. Starting in the second quarter of 2026, we begin -- we will begin to capitalize on double-stack clearance through Baltimore that will expand our intermodal service offerings into the Northeast region. Looking across the markets we serve, business conditions are mixed. Customers face uncertainty and headwinds from shifting trade policies, weak gold commodity prices, unsupportive interest rates in a persistently soft trucking market.\nNow let's turn to merchandise revenue on Slide 8. Revenue and volume was down 1%, with RPU flat, as core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge and unfavorable mix. On the positive side, minerals volume and revenue were up 8% and 12%, respectively. The team continues to capitalize on strong demand in aggregates and cement by leveraging our unique footprint into the Southeastern market. Fertilizer volume rebounded due to improved production at a key phosphate producer, which helped drive 7% growth in the quarter. Metals and equipment volume was up 5%, driven by increased wallet share combined with new capacity on our network. Increased automotive production drove 1% higher volume. And moving forward, production levels are expected to remain relatively steady from year-end with minimal anticipated impacts from the aluminum supply challenges. Broader market softness and tariffs continue to impact our forest products and chemical markets, where we have some customers that have rationalized production for both volume -- for both, volume was down 7% compared to the prior year. A positive core pricing has mitigated revenue declines. Ag and food volume was down 7% as the strong Southeastern crop has provided feed buyers a robust local supply. We've also seen increased competitiveness in the ethanol and weakness in certain food and consumer products. In the fourth quarter, we expect a stronger export market and improving domestic grain trends from the Midwest harvest.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 to review the coal business. Coal revenue declined 11% for the quarter on 3% lower total volume. All in coal RPU declined 9% year-over-year. But as shown in the slide, the headwind from export benchmark pricing continues to diminish as we move into the fourth quarter. Export tonnage was down 11%, largely due to reduced production associated with mine fires we noted earlier in the year, but recent trends have been encouraging. Our operational performance has been very strong, and we are pleased with the recent reopening of a key export mine. Domestic coal business continues to see steady trends through the year. Steel and industrial tonnage was down 15% year-over-year due to softer market fundamentals and reduced domestic steel production. On the other hand, utility coal performed well over the quarter with tonnage up 22% year-over-year. Power demand remained supportive, helped by higher natural gas prices.\nTurning to Slide 10. Intermodal performed well despite a soft trucking market and muted pricing Third quarter revenue was up 4% on a 5% increase in volume. Our international inter business benefited from strong growth with key customers. Tariff impacts and general consumer demand remain watch items. Volumes have softened in recent weeks, which looks largely in line with typical seasonality. Domestic volumes grew modestly year-over-year, primarily due to new service offerings. Following a successful bidding season for our IMCs and strong eastbound volumes, we expect continued strength in our domestic business in the near term. As we look ahead to the end of the year and start of 2026, we are excited about the opportunities to leverage the strength of our network performance, win in the marketplace and find ways to create and creatively convert more business to the railroad.\nNow let me turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Third quarter reported operating income was $1.1 billion and earnings per share was $0.37. These figures include $164 million and $0.07 per share from impairment of the remaining goodwill related to quality carriers. I'll now speak to adjusted third quarter income statement, excluding the goodwill impairment charge. Revenue was lower by about $30 million or 1% as 1% volume growth and an increase in other revenue were offset by headwinds from unfavorable mix and coal pricing. Adjusted expenses increased by 3%, and I'll discuss the details on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $19 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell by $46 million on lower pretax earnings and a lower effective rate that was driven by renewable energy and state tax credits. As a result, earnings per share fell by $0.02, reflecting a combined $0.02 of discrete unfavorable impacts, $35 million of restructuring, severance and regulatory advisory expenses and approximately $25 million of network disruption costs related to the recently completed Blue Ridge and Howard Street projects. CSX is well positioned in building momentum. Year-over-year headwinds ease into the fourth quarter and strong operational execution and cost control provide a positive setup for improved results.\nLet's now turn to the next slide for a closer look at expenses. The total expense variance includes the $164 million charge based on impairment testing completed during the quarter. Despite the difficult trucking market, quality carriers has helped drive truck-to-rail conversions, maintained industry-leading share and stable pricing across its end markets. We're working closely with the QC team to aggressively identify additional efficiency opportunities, that will support an improvement in near-term financial results while still positioning quality carriers to fully capture the upside when the trucking market recovers. Expenses, excluding the impairment increased by $71 million or 3%, including approximately $60 million of severance, network disruption and other costs noted on the prior slide. This expense management reflects solid fundamentals and disciplined execution, delivering increased volume with a lower rail headcount and year-over-year efficiency savings across the expense base.\nTurning to the individual expense line items. Labor and fringe was up $9 million year-over-year, including $22 million of management and executive severance. These costs plus the impact of inflation were mostly offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings, reflecting lower rail head count and network-driven improvements in T&E overtime and ancillary costs. Headcount will hold stable to slightly lower sequentially in the fourth quarter, while cost per employee will see a normal seasonal increase as the benefit of lapping restructuring and severance costs will be at least partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. Purchased services and other costs increased $54 million year-over-year. This was driven by cycling a prior year favorable inventory adjustment as well as network disruption costs this year. Trucking casualty and freight damage claims and inflation, plus $13 million of restructuring and advisory costs, slightly offset by higher property gains. Importantly, the team delivered significant PS&O efficiency savings which were broad-based. Continued execution and the easing of network disruption costs will help partially offset the normal sequential increase in PS&O in the fourth quarter despite $5 million to $10 million in regulatory advisory costs. Depreciation was up $8 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was up $5 million, driven by additional consumption due to network reroutes and a slightly higher price per gallon, partly offset by improvement in gallons per gross ton mile. Finally, equipment and rents decreased by $5 million year-over-year with higher costs from inflation and the negative impact of re-routes on car cycle times, offset by savings from improved fluidity and increased income generated from company-owned real estate. We're encouraged by the structural cost improvement the team delivered in the third quarter. These efforts position us well to build upon strong resource utilization, and identify additional efficiency opportunities.\nNow turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 14. Targeted and efficient investment in the safety, reliability and long-term growth of our railroad is our highest priority use of capital. Property additions are higher year-to-date, including $440 million of spending towards the rebuild project on our Blue Ridge Subdivision. In total, spending to rebuild the Blue Ridge is now expected to exceed $500 million before insurance recoveries. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $1.1 billion, which includes over $850 million of cash outflows for Blue Ridge and previously postponed tax payments. Lastly, CSX remains committed to shareholder distributions and has returned over $2 billion year-to-date.\nNow for a review of our guidance. Given solid network momentum, new business wins and expanded service offerings we still expect to deliver volume growth for the full year. Recall that our fourth quarter performance in 2024 [indiscernible] made hurricanes. We expect our fourth quarter results to reflect the strong operating performance and cost efficiencies that we have driven through the year. There's no change to our full year CapEx guidance of $2.5 billion, excluding the Blue Ridge. Finally, we expect to continue our demonstrated long-term track record of powerful cash generation combined with a strong investment grade credit rating that enables value creation through the opportunistic use of share repurchases, while also annually reviewing the dividend with steady increases for over 20 years.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Steve for his closing remarks.\n\nStephen F. Angel\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Linde Plc\n\nWe are encouraged by the progress made this quarter. Our team did a great job at working together and responding effectively to the test faced earlier in the year. The railroad is running well, and we have a strong foundation to drive further improvements. While the underlying economy is mixed, our customer service is strong, and we have excellent relationships with those customers. We are working closely with numerous partners to help accelerate the build-out of industrial capacity on our network. And our commercial team is actively developing new solutions that will help us expand our reach and gain share. We've received quite a few inquiries on strategic opportunities. we will, of course, pursue anything we believe can create compelling value for our shareholders. We are confident in our path forward and energized by our vision to be the best-performing railroad in North America.\nWith that, Matthew, we will open it up for questions.\n\nMatthew James Korn\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. We will now proceed with the question-and-answer session. To ensure that we maximize everyone's opportunity to participate, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Colby, we are ready to begin."

My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2025 CSX Corporation Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Head of Investor Relations and Strategy, Matthew Korn. Mr. Korn, please go ahead.\n\nMatthew James Korn\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tiffany. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to welcome you to our second quarter conference call.\nJoining me from the leadership team are: Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, EVP and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, EVP and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the presentation accompanying this call, which is available on our website, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review.\nWith that, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter call. When we last spoke, we acknowledge the challenges we were facing on our network, and we made a commitment to act decisively to turn it around. What you'll see in the numbers and the momentum behind them is a result of deliberate and effective actions taken to return our network back to the efficient well-run operation need to provide superior service for our customers. This quarter shows what is possible when you pair clean -- clear priorities with decisive action and the results are a testament to the ONE CSX culture we've been instilling across the business.\nNow turning to Slide 1. As we think about what we accomplished in the quarter and what we see out in front of us, 4 things come to mind. First, as I've already highlighted, we are proud of how our network performance has bounced back from the challenges of the first quarter. As Mike will cover later on, our velocity dwell, Tippin compliance and other metrics have steadily trended upward. In some areas, we are approaching or surpassing some of the best levels we've seen in recent history. This recovery reflects the strength of our operations and the team's ability to overcome challenges. We have to keep pushing, but this has been a great result.\nSecond, the entire CSX team's commitment to working efficiently helped us deliver improved cost performance that supported meaningful sequential margin expansion. We will continue this focus throughout the year.\nThird, we are very pleased with the progress being made at our Howard Street Tunnel and Blue Ridge rebuild projects. We expect completion in the fourth quarter, which will remove 2 key constraints from our network. Finishing these 2 projects will open back up 2 of our 4 North Style routes. And as you know, we're excited about removing the last impediment to double-stack intermodal on the 95 corridor.\nFinally, as Kevin will discuss, we know that our customers are facing mixed markets with activity holding strong in certain areas and slowing in others. That said, at CSX, we will continue to drive forward across all of our initiatives, we will not sit back and wait for the markets to turn.\nNow let's turn to Slide 2, where we feature some of the most important results from our second quarter. Total volume was flat compared to last year, and we saw a 4% sequential increase in the quarter driven by merchandise and improvement in total coal shipments. Total revenue was $3.6 billion for the quarter, down 3% from the same period last year, largely due to lower coal and fuel prices. Quarter-over-quarter, total revenue improved 4%, in line with the increase in volume.\nOur reported operating margin, which includes our trucking business, declined by 320 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2024, but increased by 550 basis points sequentially, supported by the solid cost performance that accompanied our operational improvement. Earnings per share decreased by 10% year-over-year, but grew by 29% quarter-over-quarter. Now after a difficult start to the year, I am proud of all that we have accomplished, but we also cannot let our foot off the gas. We are committed to maintaining this momentum. Now that our network has stabilized, we are positioned to pursue more opportunities to grow the business. To do that, who are run safer, faster and more consistently, we will provide attractive, profitable solutions for our customers, even when economic conditions are uncertain.\nAs we move forward, we will make sure that our execution remains effective and efficient. As an example, as part of our normal business review process, we recently reorganized management resources across several areas to improve align with the businesses and accelerate decision-making. These are positive steps towards our goal of sustainable, profitable growth.\nWith that, I'm going to turn the call over to Mike to discuss our operational performance.\n\nMichael A. Cory\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Canadian National Railway Company\n\nThank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for participating today. So after a difficult first quarter, the team has effectively responded to a recovery plan that we presented on our last call. While we still have many opportunities for improvement, I'm really proud of the work the team has accomplished so far and truly appreciate their efforts.\nSo let's go over to the next slide. Throughout challenges of late winter and into the spring, we remain committed to safely running our operations. Leading with our safe CSX values, our focus on eliminating significant injuries has resulted in a reduction of both life-changing injuries and missed work days. Also, improved alignment and engagement and safety leadership is occurring throughout the operations organization.\nOur managers and craft employees are learning how to have meaningful conversations about exposure reduction, leading to a culture that is eager to identify and mitigate hazards before they become exposures. However, improvement in our train accidents have not followed suit. Most of our incidents occur in the slow-speed environment of our yards and result in little damage to infrastructure or equipment. However, they still are disruptive to the operations of our network. We continue to further implement yard inspection drones that will assist in identifying conditions that lead to track-caused derailments in their yards, and we continue to work on improvements to our wayside car health monitoring systems to prevent impact from equipment failures. An important area we have seen great improvement on is our human factor derailments, which continue to decrease.\nOver to the next slide. Train velocity continues to improve while being affected by the rerouting of traffic off our 2 corridors. Our cars online and dwell continue to improve and are back at levels experienced prior to our disruptions. Reducing cars online was a key focus during our recovery period, but we did so in a way to minimize customer supply chain impacts by avoiding the use of disruptive embargoes.\nWe compressed all of this while experiencing weekly volumes in line with our prior years. A recovery is a real true testament to the hard work and dedication of every railroader at CSX. As we move into the third quarter, our efforts are concentrated on operating efficiently across our network.\nOver to the next slide. Our efforts over the last quarter have improved our service measures. But while we're not yet at the TPC performance we strive for, our view is these measures will continue to improve as we improve our dwell and train velocity. With the completion of our network projects, we expect these numbers to improve.\nWith respect to our local service delivery, we continue to work very closely with our customers to make sure our service to them is everything they need for success.\nNow on to the last slide, at this time, both our major projects are tracking on schedule. The Howard Street Tunnel portion of our I-95 project will be done in time for the fourth quarter and the Blue Ridge subdivision used primarily for access to and from the Carolinas will also be ready for the fourth quarter. But these projects unlock -- while these projects unlock significant capacity for the entire network, we're also upgrading our capacity and throughput at our Arden Indianapolis with the extension of the hump pullback. While this project is small in nature relative to the other two, will give us the ability to hunt more cars with less handlings at a very critical yard in our network.\nThe entire team has accomplished much more -- or much over the last 3 months, but we're not done with converting opportunities that we have to make this railroad run better.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Mike. First, I want to thank the entire operations team for their hard work. Our service levels are approaching record levels and our ability to communicate across our teams and react to any disruptions has never been better. Many of the industrial markets we serve continue to face challenges with uncertainty around tariffs, trade, interest rates and the overall direction of the economy. Our focus remains on the customer and driving strategic discussions that deliver value to our customers and new growth opportunities to the CSX network.\nNow let's review our end markets. Turning to Slide 9. Merchandise in the second quarter saw both revenue and volume decline of 2%. RPU was flat as lower fuel surcharge and negative mix were offset by core pricing gains. Our metals market and equipment volume was up 3%, while revenue was down 3%. We captured volume from positive trends in the steel market, while lower equipment and higher scrap volumes did impact RPU. Continued infrastructure demand in the Southeast and strength in new cement production led to 5% revenue growth for the Minerals segment.\nAg and food volume was up 2% compared to last year, as operational execution enabled us to fully capitalize on strong grain demand into the Southeast region of our network. This was partially offset by weaker consumer demand and food products, including alcoholic beverages.\nAutomotive volumes were down 2% for the quarter. Volume gains from a contract win with a new North American auto plant were more than offset by lower overall industry demand, and production challenges at some CSX serve plants.\nForest products has been impacted by challenges in the housing market in an overall sluggish demand environment. We continue to see industry plant consolidation along with several extended plant outages concentrated in the second quarter. Looking at the second half, we anticipate less downtime and expect to continue to drive incremental opportunities through our strategic partnerships with industry leaders.\nCelica volumes decreased due to lower shipments of export plastics impacted by an extended unplanned outage at a customer location, as well as a decline in chlor-alkali shipments. Fertilizer shipments declined 6% as we experienced softer phosphate volumes due to customer production issues, the revenues remained flat due to positive core pricing and mix.\nAs we move into the third quarter, we will continue to monitor the tariff policy and expect to see mixed demand within end markets, including auto and housing, which remain well below long-term demand levels. One area of the business that we continue to see reasons for optimism despite the uncertainty in the economy is our industrial development pipeline. We are still seeing great progress in that area with another 25 projects that went into service in the second quarter, bringing the total for the year to 49. As we look to the back half of the year, we have another 30 that are nearing completion and additional projects on top of that, which may go in service depending on permitting and construction time lines. These facilities consume raw materials or produce finished products for a wide range of markets including natural gypsum, aggregates, rolled aluminum, steel and food and beverage. And with support from recently passed tax legislation, we expect to continue to see more projects added to the roster for years to come.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10 to review the coal business. Coal revenue declined 15% for the quarter on 1% higher volume as we continue to face headwinds from lower global benchmark pricing. All-in coal RPU declined 16% year-over-year and fell 2% sequentially, slightly below previous expectations.\nThe Australian benchmark averaged $184 per tonne in the quarter versus $242 in the same period last year. Our export business was also impacted by production constraints. We knew 2025 would be challenging for this market, but we remain hopeful we will benefit from mine restarts towards the end of the year.\nOur domestic markets were mixed as the utility coal segment was well supported by high burn rates, higher natural gas prices and faster cycle times. At the same time, our steel and industrial markets were impacted by unfavorable source shifts and softer steel market fundamentals. Moving forward, we expect the domestic segment to be supported by growing power demand and the deferral of coal plant closures.\nTurning to Slide 11 to review the intermodal business. Second quarter revenue declined 3% on a 2% increase in volume as lower diesel prices and unfavorable mix dragged on RPU. Our international business performed well with solid year-over-year unit growth supported by increased activity ahead of tariffs, especially early in the quarter. In recent weeks, we've seen a pickup in container arrivals as we expected, with exporters reacting to the change in tariff policy.\nDomestic volumes were effectively flat year-over-year as the ongoing soft trucking market remains a drag and interchain business from West Coast arrivals softened. Looking ahead, we're excited with the momentum we're building and expect to drive several new opportunities, including truck conversions through the new Myrtle wood interchange. Overall, just as Joe described, we're facing mixed markets into the second half of the year but are taking a proactive approach with our CSX specific initiatives. Our service levels are allowing the team to drive positive engagement with our customers as we continue to convert wallet share opportunities. It's important to highlight that our total Net Promoter Score with customers over this last quarter was the highest it's ever been. It is clear that they see that and appreciate our return to industry-leading service and that we accomplished this through teamwork and great communication across the ONE CSX team.\nWe are also excited about the reopening of the Howard Street Tunnel and Blue Ridge subdivision later this year that will improve on the positive service levels customers are experiencing today. We expect to achieve double-stack clearance through the Howard Street Tunnel in the second quarter of 2026, following the completion of bridge clearance work. This will open the CSX network to new markets and drive incremental growth opportunities.\nNow with that, let me turn it over to Sean to discuss financials.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at second quarter results, revenue fell by 3% on flat volume as weaker export coal benchmark pricing, lower fuel recovery and unfavorable mix all contributed to lower yields. Expenses increased by 2%, and I'll discuss the details on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $9 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell by $40 million on lower pretax earnings. As a result, earnings per share fell by $0.05.\nIncluded in these numbers is quality carriers, which, as you know, has a continued margin drag on our results and has been impacted by a challenged trucking market. We are working closely with the team to drive improved results.\nI also want to touch on sequential performance against the first quarter. As Joe mentioned, our railroaders worked tirelessly to help our network recover from an extremely challenging start to the year, and these efforts carried through to our financial performance. Operating income increased $242 million from Q1 and op margins improved by 550 basis points, both well ahead of normal sequential seasonality. This reflects strong momentum, particularly when you consider that April was challenged by flooding across the Midwest, with a gradual recovery in operating performance through the month that resulted in a strong May and June.\nLet's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total second quarter expense increased by 2% or $38 million against the prior year. This variance includes around $10 million per month of network disruption costs, plus the impacts of inflation and higher depreciation, partly offset by savings from lower fuel prices.\nLooking on a sequential basis, our service recovery during the quarter was complemented by improved efficiency as expenses fell 4% or over $90 million from the first quarter despite a 6% increase in gross ton miles. Mike and the team delivered for our customers while also driving improved rolling stock utilization, and operating with a rail head count that was lower versus the first quarter.\nTurning to the individual expense line items. Labor and fringe was up $25 million year-over-year, mostly driven by inflation. An additional increase is attributed to our trucking business, where head count was higher primarily due to the conversion of previously independent affiliates with offsetting savings in the PSMO line.\nRail head count was lower on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Despite a higher workload with fewer employees, monthly overtime expense fell by over 15% in May and June relative to the first 4 months of the year. Also, as a reminder, cost per employee will step higher in Q3 as the majority of our union employees now covered by new labor agreements, received a 4% wage increase effective on July 1. And labor expense will include accrued wage increases for the remaining employees. This will result in roughly a $20 million sequential increase to labor and fringe expense in Q3.\nThird quarter labor infringe will also include a charge of $15 million to $20 million related to the management restructuring Joe mentioned earlier, which will help position our workforce for 2026 and beyond. Annualized expense savings should be approximately $30 million, resulting in minimal net impact this year when you account for the Q3 charge.\nPurchased services and other expense increased $19 million year-over-year, which includes about half the total network disruption costs as well as inflation and volume-related expenses, partly offset by multiple net favorable variances. also saw a significant improvement from the first quarter, benefiting from lower locomotive costs and other items on top of normal seasonal trends. Depreciation was up $17 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $32 million, driven by a lower gallon price, partly offset by additional gallons consumed due to network reroutes.\nFinally, equipment and rents increased by $9 million year-over-year, reflecting costs from seasonally higher volume and other items that were partially offset from the benefit of sequential improvements in payable car cycle times of 5% and 12% in our merchandise and automotive fleets.\nWe're encouraged that both operational improvement from Q1 as well as structural efficiency opportunities are resulting in cost momentum. As we continue to invest in emerging technologies, we expect to deliver further savings that will support strong incremental margins in 2026 and beyond.\nNow turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 15. Investing in the safety, reliability and long-term growth of our railroad continues to be our highest priority use of capital. Year-to-date, property additions are higher, including around $295 million of spending towards the rebuild project on our Blue Ridge subdivision. Excluding Blue Ridge, capital spending is still expected to be roughly flat to the prior year at $2.5 billion.\nFree cash flow is lower year-to-date as a result of the increased total CapEx and a decline in net earnings as well as a smaller impact from the relative size of previously postponed tax payments in each year. As we look forward, second half cash flow will be meaningfully stronger than first half and is partially supported by now permanent bonus depreciation. This should positively impact our cash flow by approximately $250 million in the second half, and we expect continued benefits in future years. After fully funding our capital investments, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders, including close to $1.7 billion year-to-date. This reinforces our ongoing balanced and opportunistic approach to shareholder returns.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Sean. We will conclude our remarks with a review of our guidance, which is effectively unchanged from the previous quarter. And we continue to expect overall volume growth for the full year. As we have discussed, markets are mixed overall with some very stable waters are showing some signs of softening. With our fluidity improved and incremental contributions expected from new projects and new service offerings, we feel very good about our momentum. Consistent with our past statements, there will be a smaller year-over-year impact from lower coal and fuel prices over the second half of the year as export coal benchmarks and diesel moderated over the back half of 2024. Our intense focus on efficiency, including labor productivity will continue through the rest of the year.\nSumming up, we are encouraged by the progress made this quarter. Our team did a great job at working together and responding effectively to the tests we faced earlier in the year. We delivered a strong operational recovery and truly demonstrate the benefits of the One CSX culture that we have been building.\nAnd finally, we know there's been a lot of rumor and speculation about consolidation in the railroad industry in recent weeks. While we cannot comment, we want to be clear that at CSX, we are absolutely focused on delivering shareholder value and are always open to anything that can help us achieve this objective. We have a strong franchise that we believe is the best in the East, and we are making it stronger every day.\nOur customer service is industry leading, and we have exceptionally strong relationships with those customers. We are working closely with numerous partners to help accelerate the build-out of industrial capacity on our network. And our commercial team is actively developing new solutions that will help us expand our reach and gain share. We are driving forward with major network projects that will prove to be valuable investments. Our Howard free tunnel project will allow us to compete in key intermodal markets.\nThe Blue Ridge rebuild will ensure network balance and our operations team continues to unlock ad efficiency yard by yard and region by region.\nWhile we are confident in CSX path forward, we welcome all opportunities that would allow us to deliver value for our shareholders, drive profitable growth and serve our customers better. We actively evaluate these opportunities for their upside potential. This has been and remains the focus of our management and our Board.\nWith that, Matthew, we're ready to take questions.\n\nMatthew James Korn\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe. [indiscernible] Tiffany, why don't we start the process."

My name is Christa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Matthew, you may begin.\n\nMatthew James Korn\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you, Christa. Hello, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to have you join our first quarter conference call.\nJoining me from the leadership team are Joe Hendrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, EVP and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. In a presentation accompanying this call, which is available on our website, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review.\nWith that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter call. Since I came to CSX, we have been clear about our commitment to lead with service consistent, reliable, excellent services is what -- strengthens our relationships with customers, expand our markets and ultimately drives profitable growth. We do not fulfill that commitment this quarter. The start of the year typically brings operational challenges that we manage the network through the worst of winter weather [indiscernible] that these challenges will be more difficult this year because of the constraints associated with our 2 major infrastructure projects, the Howard Street Tunnel and the [ Blue subdivision ] rebuild.\nUnfortunately, our performance fell short of our expectations. As a result, we left good business on the table, which reduced our revenues and our inefficiencies met, we incurred more expense. We take full accountability for our performance this quarter, and we are not standing still. The team is aligned. Our expectations are clear, and we are taking actions to stabilize our operations, improve efficiency and enhance coordination across the entire One CSX team.\nAll that said, I want to reiterate the underlying strengths of our business. This is still the same great network and on CSX team. Our customer relationships are strong, and the fundamentals of our strategy are sound. I want to thank our employees for their resilience and our investors for their continued support as we move forward with urgency and clarity.\nNow let us go over some highlights. Let's start with Slide 1, where we feature some of the key results from our first quarter. Total volume decreased 1% compared to last year, but we did see intermodal volumes increased 2% on the quarter as we saw an uptick in port traffic. Total revenue was $3.4 billion for the quarter, down 7% from the same period last year.\nAs we anticipated, much of this decline was due to the commodity effects of lower benchmark coal prices and reduced fuel surcharge. Earnings per share decreased by 24%, reflecting the effects of our margin from reduced revenues and our challenged network performance. We know that trust is earned through consistency. One quarter doesn't define us. defined us is how we respond, how we learn and how we come back stronger. That is our focus. We are committed to delivering better results and most importantly, to executing in the quarters ahead.\nNow I will turn the call over to Mike to provide details around our operational performance.\n\nMichael A. Cory\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Canadian National Railway Company\n\nThank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to participate today. As Joe highlighted in his opening remarks, this was a difficult quarter for the CSX network and the team. We've talked about how we have 2 major infrastructure rebuilds and progress that are causing us to reorganize and reroute a significant amount of our daily traffic. As a result, we were hit by severe weather and faced other tough railroading challenges has become more complicated for us to recover, and it's just taking us longer to stabilize our operations.\nThese effects are clear in our service metrics as all of you have noticed. Let me say this as firmly as I can, improving the fluidity of the network is essential in order to deliver on our promises to our customers, and we are committed to getting this done. We expect our performance to improve from first quarter even as we manage the ongoing infrastructure projects.\nI'll talk more in a moment about what steps we're taking, but let's first discuss safety results for the quarter. The first quarter saw a third straight sequential decline in our FRA injury rate, which also brought us lower on a year-over-year basis. The continued education and mentorship programs that we've put in place are having a measurable effect helping our employees understand how to reduce their risk exposure every day that they're on the job. I'm pleased that our FRA train accident rate also declined sequentially and improved year-over-year. Our team sees this as an encouraging affirmation that our Safe CSX program is taking hold and driving positive results. We will continue our work to build a safety-focused culture here at CSX always with the goal of everyone returning home safe and sound after every day.\nLet's move to the next slide. At the top of this page, you'll see metrics reflecting our network fluidity. After working through the storms in the second half of 2024, our velocity was affected early in the first quarter of 2025 after closing the Baltimore tunnel and it continued to be challenged as we manage through the after effects of harsh winter weather. [ Dwell ] demonstrated a similar unfavorable trend over the last several weeks as yard congestion persisted, making it difficult for trains to depart on schedule.\nWe're working hard to address the increase in cars online as having excess inventory has slowed the network, with particular flooding on our Southwest and Midwest regions, Nashville and Cincinnati, in particular, we have much to do in this regard. The charts on the bottom show important customer-facing metrics. Our Intermodal business is highly service sensitive. We have to get this right to stay competitive in this market. As this chart shows, our intermodal trip plan compliance rebounded nicely in the first quarter after the hurricane-related disruptions that hit last fall.\nThe team has worked hard to keep our terminals fluid and minimize the amount of time at trade drivers are waiting to drop off or pick up boxes. We're encouraged by this result, but we didn't do nearly as well with Carload TPC, which was negatively impacted from the quarter's fluidity constraints. This is a primary area of attention for the team. We have to deliver here in order to support our current merchandise business and the substantial amount of new business that Kevin and his team won and expect to win going forward.\nFinally, our CSD or first mile, last mile measure shows fairly steady performance, but we know that for our customers, every percentage point represents important freight that they've entrusted to CSX. So we understand where we are, and we are certainly committed to getting back to where we need to be.\nTop to bottom, our team is focused on speeding our operations back up and rebuilding the positive momentum that comes from a fluid balance network. Now we're not going to get back to our true potential until we get these major projects completed, but we are doing the hard work to drive incremental improvement step by step as we go through the year.\nThe first things we're doing is to get the resources in place that will enable us to run a consistent operating plan even with the 2 major closures to work around. We're bringing online a modest number of locomotives to help get the network in balance and reduce train delay. This is scheduled railroading. Trains leave on schedule, everything else is able to fall in place.\nWe're also taking steps to drive our asset utilization. Our field leaders are connecting with our customers to identify and flush cars off our network. This car is accumulated network fluidity declined. So we're working closely with our customers and taking immediate action to get these levels back to where they need to be.\nFinally, we're making sure that everyone in this organization acts according to the priority that we at CSX place in delivering customer service. There's no single measure for the railroad that accounts for everything. But for years, TPC has served us as a very good guide to effective statistics. When we miss, we hold ourselves accountable, find a solution and make it right with our customers.\nWe have a lot of work to do. But remember this, we have the same people in the same assets that we had a year ago. And we take a lot of pride knowing how to apply the core principles of an effective scheduled railroading. On top of that, we're adding improved tools such as the real-time operations portal system that we previewed at our Investor Day. Hundreds of railroaders across the network, use our top every day to strengthen communication and support faster, more effective decision-making. The bottom line is that we're aligned across the team, and we're going to deliver for our customers and our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to you, Kevin.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Mike. Right now, CSX and our customers are navigating elevated levels of macro uncertainty. Clearly, there's an added market volatility and global trade policy is shifting day to day. We are staying close to our customers to understand the changing landscape, partnering to ensure supply chains remain resilient and efficient as well as looking for opportunities to grow together, including investments in U.S. manufacturing. Year-to-date, end market demand has remained relatively stable. While some areas are clearly stronger than others, we have not seen any major negative inflections.\nThat said, we are unsatisfied. The disruptions we faced across the network resulted in missed opportunities in some of our key end markets. As you've heard, our entire team is 100% engaged and we have confidence that we will show improvement as the year progresses. As an example of our commitment, I want to quickly highlight the CSX's TDSI automotive terminal team, sit a record with 4 terminals winning the auto industry's premier awards for origin and destination operations as recognized by the AAR. We are incredibly proud of our TDSI team and how they represent service excellence here at CSX.\nNow let's turn to the slides. Starting with our merchandise business, as shown on Slide 6. In total, for the first quarter, both revenue and volume declined 2%. RPU increased 1% year-over-year as higher core pricing gains offset lower fuel surcharge and the effects of negative mix. Looking across the different end markets, Fertilizer volume was up 2% compared to last year, benefiting from modest improvement in short-haul, Bone Valley shipments. Our revenue was flat as RPU was affected by this mix shift.\nMarket demand was strong for ag and food, but operational challenges limited our ability to meet this demand, reducing our shipments compared to the market opportunity. Minerals volume was lower by 1% as weather impacted aggregate shipments but underlying construction activity remained robust. Cement volume was favorable over the quarter, supported by the ramp-up of new production, which contributed to favorable RPU mix and helped lift revenues by 4% for the quarter.\nChemicals revenue was up 1% against a 1% decline in volume. We saw positive demand in plastics and energy-related areas such as propane and LPGs, but cold weather had an impact on asphalt shipments. Forest products volume declined 4%, reflecting an uncertain building products environment when considering interest rates and changing trading policies. Meals and equipment continued to be sluggish with volume down 7% for the quarter. Automotive production was slow to start the year, and though we saw improvements in March, volume and revenue declined 7% and 8%, respectively.\nAs we look to the second quarter and the rest of the year, we're closely watching the daily changes in trade and tariff policy. As I said before, based on what we observe from our merchandise customers now demand across merchandise is relatively steady. There are even some encouraging recent signs with a good seasonal pickup in aggregates, strong end market demand in some of our ag markets and some early favorable effects from tariffs as steel prices have improved. If markets hold, we see opportunities to capitalize on improved network performance, allowing us to capture and fulfill more of the demand in some of our key markets.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 to go over the coal business. Coal revenue declined 27% on 9% lower volume as the team navigated lower export prices, producer issues and operational challenges in the quarter. All-in coal RPU declined 20% year-over-year and fell 4% sequentially, slightly more than the 3% decline that we anticipated last quarter. We saw year-over-year declines in both our export and domestic businesses. Export tonnage declined by 12%, partially driven by the impacts of 2 significant temporary mine outages. While domestic tonnage was lower by 4%, we did see positive demand trends through the quarter.\nUtility demand has been supported by higher natural gas prices, and we see positive signals from some of our key customers for increased demand into the summer and beyond. Domestic shipments to steel mills were also down year-over-year, reflecting soft conditions in the metals market to start the year. For pricing, the Australian benchmark averaged $185 per ton over the first quarter and currently sits around that level. On a lag basis, this would be a modest headwind to ARPU in the second quarter. although we could see a slight positive yield offset if we're able to increase our deliveries to the southern utility customers.\nTurning to Slide 8 to review the intermodal business. This quarter, revenue was down 3% despite a 2% increase in volume. RPU was lower by 5%, with a 3% impact due to lower fuel surcharge and the remainder largely due to stronger international shipments. The volume growth for the quarter was driven by international activity as we saw positive trends in container import flows sourced from our global partners. While some of this may have been due to a moderate pull forward ahead of anticipated tariffs, we do not see any real step change in the trend line until we approach the end of March.\nDomestic was effectively flat with grain in our rail asset shipments and new initiatives offsetting mixed results among some of our other channel partners. Again, we're encouraged by what we've seen over the quarter, but visibility is low into the rest of the year. The trucking market has not inflected, but does not seem to be past the bottom but does seem to be past the bottom, which is moderately favorable for the Intermodal overall.\nFinal+ ly, let's turn to Slide 9 for an update on industrial development at CSX. It's been very encouraging to see how our overall program has continued to progress. As you've heard us say at recent conferences, inbound calls to our team remain at very high levels, and our total pipeline of projects continues to grow, reaching nearly 600 by quarter end. Even better, 1/4 of these projects are already under contract or nearing the final site selection. Activity within this pipeline continues to move forward. with 24 new facilities going live on our network over the first quarter. These new plants and expansions will ramp up over the next few years, contributing to our positive outlook on growth.\nWe expect to keep this momentum up through the rest of the year with up to 50 additional facilities scheduled to start service over the next 9 months. We remain confident that as the program continues to mature and accelerate we are on track towards realizing the volume growth path we outlined at the November Investor Day. We're being very excited about this unique growth opportunity. and we'll continue our efforts to attract more and more customers who will benefit from growing their business on the CSX network.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Sean.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at first quarter results, revenue fell by 7% or $258 million from a 1% drop in volume as well as lower export coal benchmark prices, lower fuel recovery and declines in other revenue and trucking. Expenses increased by 2%, and I'll discuss the line item details on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $14 million higher compared to the prior year, and we expect this amount to step up slightly following our debt issuance in March.\nIncome tax expense fell by $76 million on lower pretax earnings. As a result, earnings per share decreased by $0.11. Declines in export coal benchmarks and net fuel prices drove a $0.04 headwind to EPS. We expect a similar commodity price headwind in the second quarter, which should ease throughout the back half of the year.\nGoing into the year, we knew that Q1 would represent an earnings trough both on a year-over-year and an absolute basis. Then difficult operating conditions faced during the quarter led us to miss our own expectations for both revenue and expense. Despite new challenges from storms and flooding early in the second quarter, our team of railroaders is working tirelessly to clear congestion and deliver the service product our customers deserve, which will drive revenue and expense benefits moving through the year.\nLet's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expense. Total first quarter expense increased by 2% or $38 million. This includes around $45 million of additional costs related to network disruptions, congestion and severe winter weather. These headwinds plus the impact of inflation were partly offset by savings from lower fuel prices.\nTurning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe was up $16 million primarily due to inflation. Headcount has remained stable over the last year, and we expect it to be about flat through the year. Purchased services and other expense increased by $54 million. About half of this increase was tied to network disruptions and weather with inflation and other items driving the remainder.\nDepreciation was up $15 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel costs decreased $50 million driven by a lower gallon price and savings from efficiency and lower volume. Gallons per GTM has now improved on a year-over-year basis for 5 consecutive quarters, driving over $50 million in cumulative savings over that period. Finally, equipment and rents increased by $3 million.\nNow turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 13. Investing for the safety, reliability and long-term growth of our railroad continues to be our first priority use of capital. Q1 property additions were higher, including $133 million of spending towards the rebuild project on our Blue Ridge subdivision. For the full year, our expectations are unchanged with non-Blue Ridge spending roughly flat to 2024 and the total Blue Ridge rebuild expected to exceed $400 million before insurance recoveries.\nFree cash flow was stable in the first quarter as lower earnings were offset by cycling a previously postponed tax payment in the prior year. Now as a reminder, cash outflows in the second quarter will include a roughly $425 million tax payment that was postponed from 2024 due to hurricane-related tax relief.\nAfter fully funding capital investments, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders, including nearly $1 billion in the first quarter. Our approach will remain balanced and opportunistic, factoring in an attractive current share valuation while closely monitoring shifts in demand for our services and the broader economic climate.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Sean. Now I will conclude our remarks by walking you through our updated guidance for the full year 2025. First, we continue to expect overall volume growth for the full year. As Kevin said, demand remains fairly stable. However, the near-term effects of rapidly changing trade and tariff policies are uncertain. This makes it difficult to project a reasonable range.\nThat said, we remain very well positioned to facilitate and benefit from the continued long-term trend toward expansion of U.S. manufacturing capacity. As we have called out in the past, our revenue will reflect the challenges of lower commodity prices and changes in mix. The year-over-year impact of lower export coal benchmark should be smaller than what we reported in the first quarter.\nAs Sean highlighted, we expect first quarter to be a trough for our [ probability ] for this year as we improve the your network as we continue to drive our greater efficiency and we deliver labor productivity, we should see sequential improvement. Our CapEx forecast is unchanged as you heard from Sean. And as you see in this past quarter, a balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns also remains in place.\nTo conclude, while this core did not meet our expectations, I appreciate the commitment focus and the efforts of our entire One CSX team. That said, we recognize that the effort must translate into better outcomes, and that is where our attention is right now. We are fully committed to running a safer, faster and more reliable railroad. And we know that doing so consistently is the path to delivering the long-term software growth we expect to ourselves.\nThanks to all of your interest in our company. Matthew, we're ready to take questions."

My name is Abby, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin.\n\nMatthew James Korn\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you Abby, Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the presentation accompanying this call, which is available on our website, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review.\nWith that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. As we look back and review 2024, we see that our railroad faced a significant number of challenges during the year, including weaker commodity prices, a bridge collapse and multiple hurricanes. We had another year where U.S. industrial production was effectively flat, reflecting mixed end markets across our customer base. There are also some labor disruptions across North American supply chain, which added economic uncertainty. But it's so impressive that through all of this, our ONE CSX team continued working together to improve our overall business. We have been resilient adapting to changing markets and operating conditions while remaining focused on our commitment to customer service.\nLast year, it was different than we planned, but we are proud of what we achieved and how we achieved it. We are confident because we know that our momentum continues to build, and we are ready for the important year ahead of us in 2025. Now as shown on the first slide, we achieved a lot over 2024. CSX achieved 2% volume growth for the year, outpacing the industrial economy yet again, we accomplished this even with a number of constraints on our coal franchise, including the collapse of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. Our leading merchandise business delivered 3% revenue growth even after absorbing the effects of much lower fuel surcharge, soft metals markets and the hurricane disruptions. We delivered strong, consistent customer service and our customers have responded.\nYou heard this for yourselves at our recent Investor Day, and you can see it in our financial results as we are able to price according to the value we are delivering. Operationally, we worked across our network to reduce waste, unlock capacity and improve responsiveness. We took more steps in building a successful culture that can deliver more sustainable, efficient performance and drive more positive momentum for the business. We also led the rail industry in reaching early agreements with our labor unions on our 5-year contracts, working together to value our employees, avoid the prolonged labor battles of the past and provide certainty for our customers.\nNow we can review some of the results of the fourth quarter. Slide 2 highlights key metrics for our fourth quarter compared to last year, as we expected, our underlying operations performed well, but we did see the impact of substantially lower coal and diesel prices. Hurricane effects also laid on revenues and expenses for the quarter, as we noted in our October call. Total volume grew by 1% versus last year in the quarter. The largest contributor was growth in intermodal volume, which gained 4%. Quarterly revenue declined by 4% and largely due to lower global coal prices and a decline in fuel surcharge.\nEarnings per share declined 7% on an adjusted basis, excluding the effects of the goodwill impairment this quarter. Overall, we executed well through a difficult period. However, we are not satisfied with these results. We have a clear vision of what we want to achieve at CSX, as we shared with you at our recent Investor Day, and we are committed to delivering on that vision for the benefit of our customers, our employees and our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss our operational performance.\n\nMichael A. Cory\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Canadian National Railway Company\n\nThank you, Joe, and I really appreciate you all taking the time today to participate. So first, I want to thank our team for the tremendous efforts through the quarter and the year, and I'm really truly proud of this team from weather to structural challenges like the Blue Ridge or Howard Street Tunnel. They work together to minimize the impact on our customers. And they did all of this while controlling costs and building a safe work environment for our employees and the communities they operate in. Let's go to the first slide.\nThe fourth quarter saw a sequential decline in FRA injuries, which reflects our continuing initiatives around transforming our safety culture. However, the full year rate remained elevated compared to last year. A positive result of our efforts has been a significant reduction in our employees' lost time associated with injuries. We finished 2024 with the lowest total workdays loss in the calendar year in company history. For FRA accidents, we saw a quarterly year-over-year increase but finished largely flat on an annual basis. We strongly believe that our work in the field on hazard identification and exposure control combined with our focus on newly hired and trained employees will continue to reduce significant injuries and accidents. And to improve efficiency in our capital work, we continue to harden our main lines and infrastructure more effectively.\nClearly see how our safe CSX initiative is creating positive fundamental changes in both our safety leadership and the workplace environment our employees are in. Over to the next slide. On this slide, you can see the impact of the strong hurricanes that pass through much of our service areas at the beginning of the quarter and flowed through to our customer service metrics. Much of the impact to our trip plan compliance indirectly from our inability to deliver cars to customers due to the effects of the storm. Our customer switch data shows that we maintain relatively good first and last mile switching considering the challenges. However, it remains our focus for improvement.\nI'm confident that our team will deliver in these metrics as we progress through the year. I'm also very pleased with the progress that we've made in developing our field employees to be more responsive to customer needs. As this development takes hold, we have a much better understanding at the local level on how to manage costs through proper service process. Over to the next slide. As I stated earlier, 2024 brought various weather-related challenges over the last 2 quarters that have affected our overall operating metrics. We entered Q4 still dealing with the residual effects of the previous storm such as the Blue Ridge reroutes. Hurricane Milton, in particular, caused long periods of recovery for the various commodities to move into and out of Florida. This resulted in increased well for our traffic in our largest volume state. It also affected other parts of the network as we were unable to run our regular cadence on some flows throughout the storms up to recovery.\nOn the velocity side, we were able to maintain -- excuse me, we were able to continue increasing our capacity and maintain our speed through very close management of our train starts. This also benefited our locomotive utilization and overall transportation, engineering and mechanical costs. As we worked hard in adverse conditions to maintain our network fluidity, we also drove strong improvements in efficiency. The top right of the slide shows the gains we've made in fuel efficiency, which has resulted in millions of dollars in savings in this last year. The chart on the bottom reflects how we're using less power per tonne of freight moved, another indicator of better operating efficiency. Further, over 2024, our engineering, transportation and network teams work together to improve our work block performance. This resulted in substantial improvements in the amount of rail, ties and [ ballast ] or placed per man hour compared to the previous year. And we're seeing great productivity gains here, but there's still much more improvement that we expect to get going forward.\nFor the Howard Street tunnel, we've commenced rerouting traffic and our start date at February 1 is on target. This project was initially planned to take 3 years to create extensive daily track outages over 1 of our key corridors. We're extremely proud of the team for being able to turn this around from a 3-year project to one that will take 6 to 8 months for the tunnel to be operational. Benefit from this improvement forever and far faster than originally planned. At the Investor Day, I spoke about the opportunities at Cumberland. The team is 90% complete with the sites for configuration and the results have been great. Already, we've doubled the number of cars processed per day, meeting our initial target. And with completion still to come, we are focusing on much more in terms of improvements.\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with our progress on many of the fronts. All our initiatives discussed at the Investor Day are proceeding. And while 2024 had numerous challenges, we made fundamental improvements in many areas that will benefit us over the long run. We've increased transparency in the relationship between cost and service for our operating managers. As a result, our service continues to improve while our costs stay in line with expectations. Our SAFE CSX program is well underway, and the team is defining and implementing key process changes with our operating employees. Bringing benefits to employee retention as well as improving reliability and resiliency across our network. Considering various challenges as it came about last year, I'm very pleased and confident in the operating teams respond and their collective work in both restoration and tackling our initiatives going forward.\nSo looking forward, I believe we're well positioned to deliver our objectives in 2025 and beyond. And we're all looking forward to capitalizing on the opportunities as they present themselves.\nWith that, over to you, Kevin.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Mike. First of all, I do want to thank this entire sales organization for all their hard work throughout 2024. As Joe and Mike have described, we faced numerous challenges across our network this past year, and our team responded with a steady commitment to serving our customers, highlighted by our fourth quarter Voice of the Customer survey. Where we saw the Net Promoter Score reaching an all-time high. We continue to see mixed conditions across the markets we serve. Industrial output remains muted. Interest rates are still high, and the truck cycle has yet to inflect. With that said, we hear optimism from our customers as they consider the potential for support of domestic economic policies, and we continue to see strong activity into 2025 with new project inquiries into our industrial development group.\nOur focus remains to drive outgrowth in the markets we serve, continuing our track record of exceeding industrial production. Let's review merchandise business, as shown on Slide 8. For the fourth quarter, revenue and volume were flat compared to last year. But on a full year basis, revenue was 3% higher, with a 1% increase in volume. Looking across the end markets, chemicals remained strong in the fourth quarter, consistent with the full year performance. with volume increasing 6%. Robust demand for plastics and LPGs has driven much of the growth throughout 2024. Minerals volume was supported by positive demand for cement and aggregates and Forest products volume was up 3% as CSX capitalized on continued demand in paper markets and pulp board. On the other side of the markets, volume for fertilizers business was impacted this quarter at supply chains here in Florida the lingering effects of hurricanes. Performance within metals remain sluggish as it has been all year, largely due to continued soft demand for steel.\nVolume for our automotive business declined 2% for the quarter, higher dealer inventories have [ led ] to lower build rates. Looking ahead to 2025, we're seeing strong demand signals in our ag and fertilizer segments. Along with continued strength in Minerals & Chemicals. Interest rate sensitive markets, including automotive, metals and housing continue to remain challenged. While we anticipate a slower start in the first quarter, we do expect moderate merchandise carload growth for the full year, supported by steady service-driven conversions and new industrial development projects that should accelerate as we exit 2025.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 to review the coal business. Coal revenue declined 20% for the quarter on 7% lower volume, as we've navigated the effects of reduced global benchmark pricing and production issues. All-in coal RPU declined 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, in line with previous guidance. Export volume fell modestly, largely due to lower supply availability of certain coal mines with temporary geological issues, limited production. That said, for all of 2024, export coal volume grew by 9%, even considering the impacts of the Key Bridge and the ship loader outage at Curtis Bay. Exports represented more than half of our coal carloads for the full year, a first for CSX. [ Domestic ] shipments were pressured during the quarter, driven by lower natural gas prices and ample utility stockpiles. More recently, we have seen colder winter weather that has begun to reduce utility stockpiles, providing incremental opportunities as we move into the summer months. As we look into 2025, we anticipate a decline in coal volume with the weakest year-over-year performance in the first quarter.\nThis includes temporary production outages at a couple of its CSX-served mines that will mainly impact the first half of 2025, from year-over-year volume -- from a year-over-year volume perspective. Based on current global benchmark prices, we expect all-in coal RPU to be down roughly 3% sequentially in the first quarter. As we have highlighted previously, we also see a couple of plant closures at domestic utilities that are scheduled for later this year. Despite these challenges, our utility customers are facing accelerating growth in power demand across areas of our service network or data center buildouts are in progress. Lower utilization rates at existing CSX serve utilities does provide opportunities to work with customers to meet increased demand.\nTurning to Slide 10 to review the intermodal business. Fourth quarter revenue declined 5% on a 4% increase in volume. With lower diesel prices year-over-year significantly impacting revenue per unit by 7%. Our domestic intermodal business performed well for the quarter, converting traffic from over the road even in this challenging truck market. We have been -- we have many initiatives underway, including continued growth in our direct business, new volume related to our Myrtle wood interchange, future improvements in double stacking capabilities into the Mid-Atlantic and many other many others that make us optimistic about our growth ahead. Within international, quarterly performance remained robust, allowing us to deliver strong growth for the full year as we gain from alignment with our key customers.\nOverall, we continue to compete in wind intermodal business. Our inland port initiatives remain on track, and we're excited about the prospects of closer alignment with our channel partners. As the political and trade lands shifts, we will remain in close contact with our customers, ensuring that we will be able to adapt to their needs. As we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, there's a lot to be excited about.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Sean.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good afternoon. Reported operating income and earnings per share both fell by 16% in the fourth quarter, impacted by $108 million or $0.04 impairment of goodwill related to quality carriers. I'll now speak to the fourth quarter income statement on an adjusted basis, excluding the goodwill impairment charge. Revenue was lower by about $140 million or 4%. Declines in fuel and export coal benchmark prices as well as business interruption from the hurricanes drove of a combined impact of around $200 million. Despite these challenges, the team delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of 3-plus percent growth in combined merchandise and intermodal revenue, excluding fuel.\nWe remain focused on operating efficiently and delivered an adjusted expense reduction of 2% with more details on the next slide. Interest and other expense was stable compared to the prior year. Adjusted income tax expense decreased $33 million. The effective tax rate of 22% included a $26 million benefit, largely driven by the revaluation of the state deferred tax liability. Our expected tax rate going forward continues to be 24.5%. As a result, adjusted earnings per share fell $0.03, including a $0.06 combined impact from hurricanes net fuel price and lower export coal benchmarks.\nLet's now turn to the next slide for a closer look at expenses. Fourth quarter adjusted expenses decreased $40 million. Turning to the individual line items Labor and fringe was $26 million lower, driven by lower incentive compensation expense and other items, partly offset by inflation. As expected, head count increased slightly from the third quarter attributed to the timing of train and engine employee hiring, aiming to qualify the new employees ahead of the 2025 summer vacation season. We expect to absorb volume growth in 2025 with average head count remaining stable versus current levels, while cost per employee will be higher year-over-year in line with labor inflation.\nPurchased services and other expense increased $43 million. The variance includes approximately $25 million of smaller impairment charges, which were largely offset by a favorable legal settlement. Additional variances were driven by inflation, expenses related to the timing of locomotive modernizations and storm recovery costs. Depreciation was up $17 million on a higher asset base, in line with the rate of quarter-over-quarter increase we expect in 2025. Fuel cost was down $86 million driven by a lower gallon price and a fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year efficiency savings.\nFinally, equipment and other rents increased by $7 million, while property gains were $5 million unfavorable in the quarter. Now turning to the discussion of full year adjusted results on slide 14. Revenue finished 1% lower for the year on 2% volume growth, while adjusted operating income was 3% lower and adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.01. This includes over $400 million of operating income headwinds from the discrete items we have discussed throughout the year. As a result of our increasingly collaborative approach with customers consistent operational execution and cultural improvement lowering to our frontline employees delivering the service product, our customers are rewarding us with steady and profitable volume growth.\nIn fact, volume increased in all 4 quarters for the first time in 10 years, while full year merchandise and internal pricing gains were once again above cost inflation. At the same time, we remain highly focused on controlling costs, eliminating waste and improving efficiency. Mike and the operating team made impressive strides in fuel efficiency during 2024, resulting in approximately $45 million of savings. PS&O costs increased by just $50 million versus 2023, inclusive of headwinds from prior year insurance recoveries as well as storm-related costs in 2024. Core PS&O expense was stable in the face of inflation and 2% higher volume, benefiting from numerous initiatives across operating and G&A functions. PS&O will be pressured in 2025 by the Howard Street Tunnel project as well as ongoing locomotive modernizations and cloud computing expense, but we are committed to unlocking further savings. Our head count stabilized during 2024 with volume gains outpacing employee growth over the second half of the year, and we expect to continue delivering labor productivity gains going forward.\nTurning our attention to 2025. This company is headed in the right direction. We're building a strong culture, serving our customers at high levels, pairing new business wins and industrial development opportunities with ongoing efficiency to deliver strong bottom line performance. and investing for the future. That said, the 3 considerations listed on this slide could drive significant net unfavorable impacts this year. As we enter the year, export coal benchmarks and fuel prices are working against us. And if they remain stable, would result in a combined $300 million impact versus 2024, with nearly half of that in Q1 alone.\nOn the flip side, we expect a roughly $50 million net operating income benefit from cycling unique events, including hurricanes and the key bridge collapse, net of anticipated higher incentive comp in 2025.\nFinally, as we've outlined before, major construction projects on the Howard Street Tunnel and hurricane-impacted Blue Ridge subdivision will drive an incremental $10 million per month net impact into Q4. Q1 operating income will be our trough well below prior year. Results will improve from there, and we expect to return to year-over-year growth in the second half. At our Investor Day in November, we presented a theme of proven model with powerful momentum and profitable growth. Despite the discrete pressures the ONE CSX team remains confident in our long-term guidance.\nLet's now discuss cash flows and distributions on Slide 16. Investing in the safety and reliability of our infrastructure is our highest priority use of cash. Additionally, 2024 capital spending included increased allocations towards rolling stock and other return-generating investments support a pipeline of future growth and efficiency opportunities. The 2024 infrastructure figure also includes around $50 million of initial spend on our Blue rate sub division following the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. We now expect total cost to exceed $400 million before insurance recoveries as we work diligently to reopen this important route that will serve our customers for generations to come.\nStrong cash flow also supported close to $3.2 billion in shareholder returns for the year, including over $2.2 billion in share repurchases and $900 million of dividends. The share repurchase program once again outperformed, with CSX purchasing shares at a 2% discount to the market price in Q4, delivering value to ongoing owners. Economic profit finished lower for the year, largely due to the discrete items mentioned on the prior slide, our goal is to increase economic profit over time, which has been shown to strongly correlate with outsized shareholder returns.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Sean. We will finish up our prepared remarks by discussing our expectations for 2025. As you heard from Kevin, many markets remain uncertain as we look ahead at the full year. Operationally, we are undertaking substantial projects to rebuild the [ Blue Ridge ] subdivision after Hurricane Helene and expand the housing tunnel in Baltimore. That said, the momentum we have both our leading customer service gives us confidence that we can deliver volume growth in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by our merchandise and intermodal business. we expect volumes in the first quarter to show the effects of weather and a slow start for the auto industry and then build over the course of the year.\nGiven the scheduled coal plant closures and a number of mine production issues, we do anticipate coal volumes to be lower year-over-year in 2025. Next, Consistent with our commentary over the last few months, we expect full year revenue to be impacted by lower global benchmark pricing for coal and reduced fuel surcharge, particularly in the first half of 2025. Mix will also be a factor as the Intermodal business has lowest RPU, but is likely show the fastest growth this year. RS to drive efficiency improvements and manage controllable costs will continue. .\nAs Sean discussed, the Blue Ridge rebuild and the Howard Free tunnel project will add expense over the year, but our team is working hard to deliver productivity gains. Even our current outlook, we expect to hold our head count effectively flat for the year. We plan on CapEx being roughly flat year-over-year, excluding spend on the hurricane recovery, which we report out throughout the year.\nAnd finally, our capital allocation [ parties ] remain unchanged. And -- we will continue to invest in the safety and fluidity of our network, execute on high-return growth projects and opportunistically distribute capital to our shareholders. To sum up, I am proud of how the ONE CSX team responded to the challenges that we encountered over 2024. There are great opportunities ahead in 2025 and the longer term. We will execute and deliver on them on behalf of our customers and our shareholders. I have no doubt that CSX will continue to move forward, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.\nWe'll now be happy to answer your questions. Matthew, let's begin the Q&A process.\n\nMatthew James Korn\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joe. We will now proceed to a question-and-answer session. Not to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to take part in the time that we have. We ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Operator, let you start the process?"

You may begin.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Jay. Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean pelkey, Executive Vice and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the presentation accompanying this call, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. Also, please note that our 10-Q has been filed and is available on our website.\nWith that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter call today. Before we start, I want to acknowledge and appreciate all our CSX employees who are out there working throughout the Southeast United States as we deal with the weather effects from Hurricane Debbie.\nWe are prioritizing the safety of our employees and our communities in everything we do. Now this was a strong quarter for CSX. I am pleased that our results reflect the momentum that we are building as a ONE CSX team. And I'm proud to see how teams all across our railroad are working together in better and more effective ways than ever before.\nOperationally, we are developing initiatives to take an excellent scheduled railroading model and make it safer, leaner and more cost effective while providing the consistency and flexibility that our growing customer base demands. And commercially, our sales and marketing organization is creating new, more targeted methods for us to go to market, create partnerships and use our leading value proposition to convert customers on to CSX Rail.\nThere is much we have accomplished so far this year, and we are eager to maintain and build on our momentum over the rest of the year. We keep reminding the entire ONE CSX team. So when we are aligned with each other and work together as ONE team, there is really nothing we cannot achieve. Our employees, our customers and our shareholders are seeing how we are growing the business, controlling costs leading in customer service and leveraging our network capacity in ways we never could before.\nA successful culture we are building at CSX is delivering positive business outcomes. Now we can go over some of the highlights. Let's go to Slide 1. On Slide 1, we show that some of the key results from our second quarter compared to revised results from past periods. Later on this call, Sean will provide more detail on the review of the accounting treatment for engineering scrap and certain engineering support labor as described in our financial report.\nTotal volume grew by 2% with our intermodal franchise, again, leading the unit growth of 5% versus last year. And we are proud to achieve this result even with the constraints at the Port of Baltimore that impacted our coal shipments. Our coal team did an excellent job finding creative ways to respond to the key bridge collapse and deliver for our customers.\nOur operating margin reached 39.1%, which represents a 280 basis point sequential improvement. Revenue of just over $3.7 billion, was flat compared to the second quarter of 2023 and up modestly over last quarter. as strong merchandise pricing and volume growth offset lower coal prices and decline in other revenue. Operating income was 1% lower than last year but up by 8% sequentially as our efficiency efforts helped reduce expense, our earnings per share were flat versus last year and up by 9% sequentially.\nOverall, this was a good quarter that was right in line with our expectations. Have we not faced the incident in Baltimore, our operating income would have been higher year-over-year. Our challenge now is to keep moving forward by focusing on our execution even as markets fluctuate and unexpected events occur as they always do. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Cory to discuss our operational performance.\n\nMichael A. Cory\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Canadian National Railway Company\n\nThank you, Joe. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Here is a rundown of our operating activities in the quarter. But before I do that, I'd just like to extend my sincere thanks to the ONE CSX operations team for their effort and their contribution day in and day out.\nWe all here truly appreciate everyone's teamwork and efforts. So let's go to Slide 3, the first slide on safety. We saw positive trends on train accidents for the quarter and year-over-year. The reduction was driven mainly by fewer mechanical rated derailments and a reduction in human failure accidents, although human failure remains our highest causation factor. On injuries, we saw both an increase in transportation and engineering employee incidents, slips, trips and falls remain the highest related cause for injury.\nThis is an area where increased attention to risk has tremendous potential to reduce personal injury. Much of our focus is on the development of heightened risk awareness for our less-experienced employees who have the highest rate of accident and injury occurrence. .\nBy working with our union colleagues, we are becoming better able to help our employees learn how to identify at-risk situations and hazards. Though, we have a long way to go, through this collaboration, we believe improvements in safety will take place. We've also embarked on an all-inclusive safe operations cultural transformation. This transformation starts with my leadership team and I and will extend throughout to every leader at CSX.\nThis 3-year initiative is the most extensive safety leadership program we've ever embarked will support a culture of risk awareness and care where everyone knows they are valued, appreciated, respected and included. ONC CSX was the first phase of this effort to align the organization to our values and cultural principles. This next initiative will be an extension of ONE CSX. We'll have a strong focus on strengthening our safety leadership skills while building engagement with our employees.\nWe'll be aggressively identifying and eliminating unacceptable risks in our operations, which benefits all our stakeholders. So going over to the next slide. Overall, our fluidity metrics have remained pretty consistent. Our train speed has improved, but we have seen some variability and dwell. Effectively, our dwell metric reflects a combination of our team focusing on keeping costs tightly in line while maintaining the level of service our customers require. And as we've deeply dug into train size and local service, we found some cases where we were spending money to switch a customer when the service is not necessarily required.\nThis was reducing the dwell metric but wasn't positively impacting the customer experience and a wasted precious train and engine resources as well as overall costs. We're eliminating these unproductive handlings even though in some cases, it will result in higher overall dwell. On the flip side, we're spending a considerable amount of time evaluating our network infrastructure to identify opportunities that will increase the efficiency of certain yards and reduce the well going forward.\nThese evaluation exercises start by analyzing the present level of production against demand, ensuring proper standards are in place and that those standards are being met. Then we aim to increase workload and reduce both handlings at other locations and a reduction of route miles when possible. This can entail simple self-funded improvements in the infrastructure at some of our switching yards to eliminate car handlings and route miles.\nEffectively, we're creating more mass where it makes sense, resulting in improved asset speed, service and reliability. As we identify physical improvements to the infrastructure, we work with our supervisors to lead that process. So they understand how to extract the intended value and more. This experience teaches them to continue to strive for both productive work and opportunities for service or growth potential. This initial exercise has been also been supported by a reduction in costs through better utilization of our major engineering gains as well.\nThrough all these exercises, supervisors are the largest area of focus for us as we continue to develop the bench strength on CSX and position them to understand their overall operations better. And we're supporting them through a variety of methods which include increasing visibility of leading indicators, we're teaching them then how to utilize that data to identify areas of improvement and the overall cost of their operations, and they get a lot of daily engagement with the senior leadership team. A greater focus is to ensure they gain a far deeper understanding of the overall operational and customer activities within their charge.\nWe expect to continue improving these metrics as we go forward through the actions of our supervisors, we will always weigh customer need and the cost required to do so. Overall, I'm satisfied we're on the right trajectory. We have opportunities and plans in sight for our network infrastructure and as well our operations leaders ability to improve.\nTurning over to the next slide. We continue to work with Kevin and the sales and marketing team to align our operations with the needs of our customers. Preferred service and cost discipline are always at the forefront. We strive to understand exactly how our customers work and what they need from us. Having this information in the hand of field-level supervisors and stressing connectivity with their customers allows us to provide a very high level of first and last mile service. Our trip plan performance, like the dwell metric reflects the same effect from a continuous focus on cost and customer need. We've identified areas of opportunity to improve but rely on more specific first mile and last mile metrics along with customer feedback and engagement to ensure we are delivering the needed service.\nYou can see in our CSD numbers that our strong customer engagement and the level of service are taking place. In closing, we have much work to do as we always will. With that said, I'm really excited now that our operations leadership team has been together for close to 6 months. I can see the improvement being made to clarify the importance of our tasks and to increase our information visibility. You can also see the deep test for learning from all our supervisors at all levels. And this, to me, is probably the most important factor going forward. This team fully believes our approach to a safe, balanced and efficient customer-focused railroad as many opportunities for improvement ahead, and our plan is to deliver on every one of them.\nWith that, over to you, Kevin.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nThank you, Mike. As Joe referenced, we are really seeing a lot of positive momentum, particularly around sales and marketing, and collaborating with operations. Highlighting these initiatives are the market reviews where our teams come together to discuss and evaluate opportunities to collaborate on operational efficiencies while delivering new solutions to target profitable business.\nDriving network efficiency allows us to deliver a more competitive service product and expand the opportunity for growth. We are continuing to be very aggressive in pushing forward on our truck conversions, new industrial development projects and creative solutions with a growing number of shippers who want to maximize their use of CSX rail. As you've heard from a number of our peers and competitors across the transportation industry over these past weeks, the trucking market remains challenged and industrial markets are mixed as we move into the second half of the year, accumulating effects of interest rates, including a sluggish housing market and fluctuating commodity prices creates headwinds for some of the markets we serve.\nIt's a volatile environment, but we continue to drive initiatives to accelerate modal share and expand CSX's addressable market. Let's turn to Slide 7 and look at our merchandise performance. We had a great result with revenues up 5% on a 1% increase in volume. RPU was higher by 4%, even with fuel surcharge lower year-over-year as we continue to get pricing results that reflect the strong service that the team is delivering. Throughout the second quarter, our Chemicals franchise has performed very well as momentum has persisted in plastics, industrial chemicals, waste and energy markets.\nMinerals revenues also saw positive results driven by industrial development wins and our unique network access into the Southeast markets, including Florida, where we see a multiyear glide path for growth. Our Forest Products business began to accelerate, driven by demand and pull board and recent wins in the Northeast portion of our network.\nWe've been developing some very promising strategic partnerships in this market to take advantage of the capacity that our network has available. which puts us in a good position to gain more truck share as the housing market rebounds. Our automotive business saw a 4% revenue growth, leveraging our strong service product to deliver a competitive win with a key customer. Less favorable this quarter was metals where high inventories and expectations of weaker steel prices weighed on volumes. This is probably the market with the most near-term uncertainty as we watch trends in coil plate and scrap prices for a recovery. Fertilizer volumes continue to be hurt by phosphate production issues here in Florida.\nAs in past quarters, lower volumes of this short haul of mix effect on the total fertilizer RPU. And ag and food remained soft on unfavorable regional crop supply dynamics. So we are very encouraged by the fundamentals into the back half of the year, where we see a weaker southeastern crop leading to incremental opportunities for growth. For the remainder of the year, despite a sluggish economy and persistently weak trucking market, we expect to capitalize on our best-in-class service to deliver growth.\nChemicals should remain strong, supported by business wins, study plastics and healthy waste moves. We also see opportunities in our Forest Products segment, where we see operational focus differentiating us in the market. We're also anticipating a much better second half for our Ag and Food business. with demand supported by larger hog and chicken herds in the Southeast, which will feed -- which will need feed grain supplies from the Midwest. Turning to Slide 8 in the coal business. First, I want to reiterate Joe's comments from the beginning of the call. Our team in Baltimore did a fantastic job of finding creative solutions to move coal after the Key Bridge labs.\nTheir efforts made a huge difference in reducing the negative impact that this incident had on CSX and the customers we serve. As we highlighted at a conference earlier this spring, operations in [indiscernible] were up and running at the end of May, several weeks ahead of our original projections. For the quarter, revenues were down 12%. We estimate that without the key bridge collapse, the year-over-year decline would have been more in the range of 5%.\nVolume was down only 3% and with the decline driven by domestic shipments, largely to utilities. Key here is that our team was able to grow export volume by 8% year-over-year, which is an extraordinary result given the closure of the port of Baltimore. RP was 9% lower year-over-year and 6% lower sequentially, in line with our expectations and driven by export benchmark prices and unfavorable utility mix.\nLooking ahead, the key benchmark for high-quality Australian coal remains above $200 per metric ton. Given the lag in our export coal contracts, we expect a mid- to high single-digit sequential decline for all-in coal RPU in the third quarter. The temporary idling of a recently opened export mine on our network should have little impact on our export volumes as we see strong production offsets at other CSX-served mines.\nJust as we did this last quarter, the team is already finding some creative ways to pivot towards other opportunities in the marketplace where we see strong demand for export capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal. On the domestic side, low natural gas prices continue to impact volumes, but we've seen some good signs from the hot summer with several utilities in our service region, maximizing their coal units in response to very strong demand.\nWe've also seen inventory levels moderate from the highs seen earlier in the year. Finally, turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Revenue increased 3% on 5% volume growth. RPU declined 2% as we felt the effects of lower fuel surcharge revenue and negative mix. Our international business drove our volume growth this quarter. supported by higher East Coast import activity and favorable alignment with our steamship line partners.\nThis has been the trend through the year, and we've been pleased to see customer activity remain solid so far in the third quarter. In contrast, momentum in our domestic intermodal business remains muted as weak trucking conditions persist. The weak trucking market has continued much longer than what was expected coming into the year, but in the meantime, we'll keep pushing hard in a tough environment, leading with our best-in-class service. All in, the collective team has been capitalizing on opportunities throughout the year, working together to win business and gain share for CSX.\nWith mixed conditions across end markets, we've been able to grow total volume by 3% year-to-date while setting ourselves up for more profitable growth over the longer term by demonstrating to our customers that CSX stands apart for our service creativity, efficiency and capacity.\nNow let me turn it over to Sean.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. As Mike and the operations team continue to drive efficiency with strong service, we're challenging ourselves to hold support costs in line and grow revenue through pricing gains and new business wins. As Joe noted, we've built momentum over the last several quarters, and we're looking ahead to strong year-over-year growth in the second half of the year as we finally cycle some of the discrete items that helped our results in prior years. .\nRevenue was flat in the second quarter, while operating income was down 1% when compared to revised prior year results. Merchandise and intermodal revenue ex fuel was up 5%, and was partially offset by about $100 million of unfavorable impacts related to lower export coal benchmark pricing and the Francis Scott Key bridge collapse, declines in other revenue, fuel recovery and trucking drove an additional revenue headwind of nearly $60 million. Expenses were 1% higher, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide.\nInterest and other expense was $11 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell by $8 million. As a result, earnings per share was up 9% sequentially and stable year-over-year at $0.49. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. As noted in the quarterly financial report, a review of the accounting treatment for engineering scrap and certain engineering support labor drove immaterial adjustments to previously reported financial statements. Second quarter 2023 expense was revised up by $16 million.\nAnd going forward, we expect a similar quarterly expense impact split between labor and PS&O. The labor portion will result in lower capital expenditures and the adjustments for engineering scrap and labor did not impact cash flow. Total second quarter expense increased by $20 million. Turning to the individual line items.\nLabor and fringe was up $18 million as costs from increased head count and inflation were partly offset by lower incentive compensation and other items. Headcount declined slightly from the first quarter and is expected to remain relatively stable through the remainder of the year. We expect to deliver labor efficiency gains in the second half while continuing to ensure the training pipeline is stable to offset attrition and support future growth. Also, as a reminder, our union employees are receiving a 4.5% wage increase effective on July 1, and that will be reflected in a higher sequential cost per employee.\nPurchased services and other expense increased $8 million as broad-based efficiency savings and a favorable insurance recovery mostly offset costs from inflation, a write-off of inventory in the quarter and other items. Depreciation was up $6 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $11 million, driven by a lower gallon price and improved efficiency, partly offset by costs related to higher volume. Through a combination of operating initiatives and effectively leveraging fuel-saving technologies, we matched our best quarter of fuel efficiency over the last 3 calendar years. Finally, equipment and rents decreased by $5 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $4 million. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 13. Free cash flow year-to-date is $1.15 billion.\nThis reflects lower net earnings and deferred tax payments made this year, partially offset by the prior year impact of Back wage payouts. As expected, capital expenditures are also higher year-over-year as we continue to prioritize investments for the safety, reliability and long-term growth of our railroad. After fully funding these investments, we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date. And we remain committed to our balanced and opportunistic approach to returning excess cash. A long-term focus on economic profit further aligns our interest with our shareholders. While economic profit is lower year-to-date as we cycle prior year comparisons, the team is strategically focused on growing this measure over time. We expect second half economic profit to be up versus the prior year as profitable growth is paired with disciplined asset utilization and attractive returns on our capital investments. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Sean. Now we will wind up our prepared remarks by reviewing our guidance for the full year 2024. If we look at Slide 16, we expect total volume and total revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range for the second half of the year. Total first half revenue was slightly below our original expectations, largely due to lower fuel prices. The macroeconomic environment does appear a little more uncertain than it did a few months ago.\nThat said, as Kevin described, in merchandise, we see promise across chemicals, [indiscernible] products, ag and food and minerals markets, supported by increasing customer activity the ramp-up of new projects and a growing portfolio of business wins. On the other hand, metals and fertilizers have both lagged and appear likely to remain softer through the end of the year. We expect momentum to gradually build an intermodal, supported by strong port activity and the strength of our service performance, which is facilitating new ways of working together with our channel partners. This is allowing us to drive small but meaningful modal conversions even while the truck market still remains soft. The reopening of the port to Baltimore, returned to full operations at Curtis Bay and consistent domestic demand should lead to a modest pickup in coal shipments in the second half of the year.\nWe continue to price according to our leading service, work better together as a ONE CSX team and push forward on our efficiency initiatives. As a result, we expect to deliver meaningful operating margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in the second half, supported by a very strong incremental margin on our revenues. Our CapEx forecast of approximately $2.5 billion is unchanged, as is our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns. We are encouraged by our accomplishments over the first half of the year. Now we are very focused on executing our plan over the rest of 2024 as we position ourselves for sustained profitable growth over the long term. We have the capacity, the operating model, leadership team and the culture we need to ensure that we are the best run railroad in North America. We look forward to sharing more details about our strategy at our upcoming Investor Day in November. Thanks for your interest in our company. Matthew, we're ready to take questions."

My name is Briana, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Briana. Hello, everyone, and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the presentation accompanying this call, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosure and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matthew. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter call. CSX had a solid start 2024 that was in line with our expectations. I've learned that when it comes to [indiscernible] it never really is an easy quarter, and this year has already brought us a number of challenges. Thankfully, we have a great ONE CSX team of over 23,000 people.\nAnd as you've seen in our weekly volume performance, [indiscernible] has kept moving forward after the early periods of severe weather in January. The latest incident, of course, has been the tragic Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. CSX had a deep historical relationship with Baltimore, and we have important operations there, particularly with our export coal business.\nWe're committed to doing our part to help the city recover, and we are happy to see the progress already being made for reopening the port. Later in the call, Mike Cory and Kevin Boone will tell you more about what we are doing now to mitigate the impact of this event for our customers.\nAll that said, we are very pleased with the momentum that we built over the quarter and are seeing in the business today. We knew we had the opportunity to grow our profitability compared to the fourth quarter, and we did just that. Our goal was to maintain our strong customer service levels, while looking for ways to run the network more efficiently, and we have done so.\nWe have more work to do, and we are confident in our railroad and are excited about the rest of the year. Now let's start with Slide 1, where we highlight some of the key results from our first quarter. Total volume grew by a solid 3% with strong support from our -- our Intermodal business franchise, which grew at 7% compared to last year. Our operating margin reached 36.8%, which represents a 90 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter.\nRevenue of just under $3.7 billion was about 1% lower than a year ago and flat compared to last quarter. Operating income was 8% lower than last year but up 3% sequentially. And while our earnings per share declined by 4% versus last year, EPS grew by 2% compared to the previous quarter.\nNow altogether, this was a good first quarter that reflected our solid progress. The entire ONE CSX team knows that there is much more that we can achieve, given all the opportunities ahead and the great people we have across the entire railroad.\nAnd before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and remember Jim Foote, who passed away earlier this week. Jim was our President and CEO in late December 2017, until I arrived in September 2022. He guided this company through some very challenging and transformative times in our history, including rebuilding the network after the dramatic changes in 2017 and dealing with the COVID pandemic. I have several impactful and insightful conversations with Jim [indiscernible] is being recruited to come to CSX. And I thank Jim for his support with our Board of Directors to bring an outsider in as CEO of CSX. We thank Jim for all his contributions to CSX and the railroad industry overall throughout his 40-plus-year career, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.\nNow let me turn the call over to Mike Cory, who has brought a tremendous amount of new energy and new identity to CSX to discuss our operational performance.\n\nMichael A. Cory\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Canadian National Railway Company\n\nYes. Thank you, Joe, and thanks, everybody, for taking the time to be with us today. Just look at the first slide on safety. While we saw an improvement in the FRA train accident rate year-over-year, my view, our overall performance results in this quarter pale in comparison to what this team is capable and will deliver.\nSo as a team, we've begun to really work collectively to elevate and integrate the beliefs and actions that a strong safety culture requires. We recognize and in order to successfully change our safety performance, we need different and better skills. This includes proactive risk identification for our employees and their supervisors. And we thoroughly investigate every incident to determine the root cause and the necessary follow-ups, [indiscernible] And we pass that information on to our employees through portals to ensure the information is shared, learn from and use in improving everything from training to oversight of all [indiscernible] union and the management provide a key opportunity to build a strong safety culture.\nWe're starting to partner with our union leaders to help us change risk tolerances across our property. And this partnership is starting to provide real benefit towards creating a strong safety culture. This takes time and effort on all sides, but I'm very pleased with our progress so far.\nWe're also listening to our employee suggestions and we're applying to our safety in order to response for our customers needs in a safe and efficient way. Let's look at the next slide. And looking at this slide, you're going to see our standard [ velocity and Gol ] metrics that I'm sure we'll talk about today.\nOur focus this quarter has been on providing strong customer service while controlling costs. And all we've seen a slight decrease in velocity and increase in dwell, our train sizes have grown in line with the increase in volume you've handled for our customers year-over-year. [indiscernible] to remain flat with is up 1.5% or carloads up 3%. cost focus also includes management of the large capital program we have our engineering is currently working on [indiscernible] making sure they have enough time for the work to be done properly.\nAs a result, our crews are accomplishing all of their scheduled work and are also gaining efficiency for both Titan and rails, we've seen reductions in unit costs, good reductions. And we've enforced structure compliance with planned track time for crews, we've seen slight decreases in velocity increases as well. Our intent is to build and execute a more inclusive plan that provides the right work with the [indiscernible] minimizing lots of velocity. And I expect to see improvement as we continue to refine and develop this plan for the rest of this year's cycle and beyond.\nOur focus on cost has also identified some strategic locations that are not as productive as they could be. We see cost-saving opportunities by reconfiguring strategically utilizing these assets into our operating plan. This will reduce cars running out of route in excess handling, and our customers will benefit as we increase speed and open up capacity into the corridors. And that's the most important part even as we make these changes to our operations, there's no change to our goal of servicing the customer the best way we can.\nHaving an efficient network that can consistently perform to our customers' needs will allow us to gain share, convert business from truck and attract new customers to rail. Over to the next slide. On this slide, you're going to see some of our customer service metrics, which still remain strong. Intermodal trip plan compliance remains high, truck driver turn times and arrival to availability, which is a measure of efficiency at the yard but also improved as we collaborate with our customers to improve the experience in our terminals.\nAs an example, our Ferber terminal Southeast of Atlanta is a critical asset for our domestic Intermodal business, but has not performed to our customers' needs as well as our expectations. Intermodal leader put together a team, and we've developed a better process for use of both the footprint and the assets, in turn, creating fluidity that has reduced driver dwell at Farbine by nearly 50% in recent weeks compared to earlier in the year and previous to that.\nThis leads to capacity and more opportunity for conversion from truck. Our carload trip compliance declined slightly but remained over 80% for the quarter and has improved in the first month of Q2. We're very proud of the service that our customers experience with CSX.\nTo show this, we've added another important metric on this slide and as customer switch data, which represents a reliability to be able to deliver on our commitments at the first and last mile of service for our customers and most of our short line partners. As you can see, this remains very high.\nIn closing, we have many opportunities ahead of us. The team is focused on creating a climate of success for all involved, are focused on safety, service and efficiency waiver as we continue to provide the best service product we can for our customers.\nAnd with that, over to you, Kevin.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. The team continues to build momentum with our customers. targeting mobile share conversion and quickly bringing solutions to the market that target profitable growth.\nOur ability to react quickly and provide solutions for our customers was highlighted by our efforts in Baltimore. Where we rapidly stood up an alternative solution to meet the Intermodal needs of the community. Despite a continuing weak truck market, the team has done a great job focusing on developing new opportunities, including truck to rail conversion industrial development, working closer with our rail partners to identify joint opportunities and accelerating strategic discussions that allow our customers to benefit from our best-in-class service.\nCommunication and collaboration between sales and marketing and operations is a key differentiator for CSX. Our recent Voice of the Customer survey results for the first quarter shows the highest service scores since we began the survey, which highlights the positive trajectory that we are on.\nLet's turn to Slide 7 to look at our merchandise performance. Our merchandise revenues were up 1% compared to last year with flat volumes and a 1% increase in RPU. As contract renewals and slightly favorable mix more than offset the effect of lower fuel surcharge.\nAcross the basic lines, automotive accelerated nicely after a slow start at several manufacturing plants. Chemicals, our largest market, continues to gain momentum in plastics, [indiscernible] and GLs. Mortgage product volumes were flat overall, but saw encouraging sides in pulpboard and building products as the construction season appears to be off to a stronger start.\nWe told you that Minerals faced a tough comparison for aggregates, which were unseasonably strong in the first quarter of 2023. The total demand is very strong against a healthy backlog of large construction projects with infrastructure spending expected to accelerate.\nMetals volumes were a bit weaker year-over-year with the weather affecting flows in certain scrap markets. Finnish deal has also been a bit sluggish, but we see opportunity for sequential improvement in the back half of the year.\nFertilizer volumes continue to be impacted by phosphate production issues here in Florida, but an early application season in certain markets supported demand for longer haul haul, higher yield shipments of potash and other fertilizers, which lifted our RPU.\nFinally, our ag and food business remains relatively soft, constrained by a strong global soybean supplies, which limit demand for U.S. exports and still high availability of local crops in many of our customer regions. Underlying demand across grains, speed and food products is solid, were optimistic challenging conditions will normalize into the back half of the year.\nTurning to Slide 8. For the first quarter, coal revenue was flat year-over-year as 2% volume growth was offset by a 2% decline in all-in RPU, largely due to fuel surcharge. Our benchmark-based export yields were slightly lower compared to last year, but we also got some benefit from favorable mix on the domestic side.\nAs expected, shipments reflected the strength in export markets with export tonnage up 25% year-over-year. It really is a testament to the great work by the team, including the credible work by operations to meet the increased demand. We also anticipated that the domestic market would be challenged by low natural gas prices and lapping last year's restocking demand.\nDomestic shipments for the quarter were down 17% against a very tough person in the first quarter of 2023. With Baltimore and the effects of the collapse of the Key Bridge, I'm going to stress how important our partnership is with the city. As Joe noted before, we have a long history with Baltimore, going back to the very beginning of our railroad, and the ONE CSX team is working hard to find alternative solutions to help the community and our customers.\nIn terms of the revenue impact to CSX, export coal will see a near-term headwind with both our Curtis Bay facility and the dual-served console marine terminal that are unable to load vessels. Two days following the incident, Joe and I joined senior leadership from CSX, to those key alternative export facilities.\nWe have already begun to divert a portion of our Baltimore volumes to other outlets. Currently, we estimate that the net revenue impact to CSX from the port closures $25 million and $30 million per month, including the benefit of diverting some of these tons. It's still very early in the remediation process of the [indiscernible] engineers as projected by the full channel depth which we need for coal vessels to be reopened by the end of May.\nIt's also likely that you see a good amount of congestion immediately after reopening, but there's potential for it to take a few weeks to ramp back up to full run rate. In the meantime, time, we are studying in communication with our customers, business partners, state, local and federal authorities. We are working closely with Mike and his team to make sure we are optimizing all available resources to serve our customers as successfully as possible.\nTurning to Intermodal on Slide 9. Revenue increased 1% on 7% volume growth, lower fuel surcharge and negative mix, put our RPU lower by 5%. Growth was very strong for our International business. as healthy consumer demand and more normalized inventories have supported higher endpoint or levels. We saw volumes increase year-over-year with many of our shipping partners, as we gain from new contracts, new lanes and a comparison with last year's weak market conditions.\nWe are very encouraged by the recovery we are seeing and continued positive demand signals as we look over the rest of the year. Our domestic Intermodal business also grew over the quarter at a more moderate pace than what we've seen over the last couple of quarters.\nWhat's been constant is our service performance, which continues to help us win new business and drive truck conversion, even as a weak truck market conditions persist. We're optimistic that truck capacity will normalize in time, and benefit the intermodal market.\nMore importantly, we are confident that we will be prepared when the demand rebounds. Finally, let's turn to Slide 10, where we have an update on our industrial development program. Our project pipeline remains strong, with hundreds of companies eager to partner with us to find attractive ways to expand our production capacity on rail served sites, something that's often overlooked is how diverse these development projects really are.\nThe chart on the left shows the market split based on potential carload volume for the approximately 100 facilities that have come online over the last 12 months, these new sites and expenses represent $4.2 billion in total capital investment and have added new capacity in many of our key markets, such as chemicals, minerals in force products.\nBut this is only scratching the surface. The chart on the right shows the market split for the full development pipeline, ranging from projects that we anticipate starting up later this year to project proposals that will be constructed several years from now. There are 2 key takeaways from this forward-looking view, as the total estimated potential carload opportunity measured by expected capacity implies a meaningful acceleration in activity as we look forward.\nScopes can change and time lines can shift, but the setup is very encouraging for meaningful growth into contribution over multiple years. Segmenting the long-term pipeline is also diverse. We are excited about the multiple electric vehicle manufacturing facilities that are scheduled to come online over the next several years. And combined together with the related raw material or battery facilities they represent approximately 12% of the total long-term volume potential.\nMinerals, metals, chemicals and other projects represent a larger contributors. This is a big opportunity for CSX and our industrial development team has been working nonstop to build the partnerships that make all of this possible. We're excited to tell you that there's much more to come.\nWith that, let me turn it off -- let me hand it over to Sean. Thank you.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. First quarter revenue fell by 1%, while operating income was down 8% or $110 million. These results include a number of discrete items versus the prior year, with approximately $140 million of impacts from last year's insurance recovery, changes in net fuel as well as declines in other revenue and export coal pricing. .\nAcross merchandise coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel recovery, increased 4% in the quarter, benefiting from 3% volume growth and strong pricing across the Merchandise portfolio. Expenses were 4% higher, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide.\nUnderlying results reflect continued momentum generated by the One CSX team, in our service-driven top line performance and broad-based cost control and efficiency initiatives. Q1 was our second consecutive quarter of sequential operating income growth despite a $30 million net fuel headwind relative to Q4.\nIn addition, sequential operating margins grew nearly 100 basis points, demonstrating this team's focus on growth and efficient service performance. This momentum positions us well to deliver year-over-year gains in the back half of 2024. Interest and other expense was $9 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell $25 million on lower pretax earnings, net of a slightly higher effective rate.\nAs a result, earnings per share decreased $0.02, including $0.05 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total first quarter expense increased by $85 million.\nTurning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe increased $75 million, mostly impacted by inflation, higher headcount, costs from union employee sick pay and higher incentive compensation. Even so, cost per employee was down versus the fourth quarter, and we expect cost per employee to again be favorable sequentially in Q2. Total head count should remain statable despite higher seasonal volumes.\nPurchased services and other expense increased $23 million, which includes a $46 million impact from a prior year insurance recovery. Efficiency gains evident on this line represent significant cross-functional collaboration to drive sustainable cost improvements across both operating and overhead budgets. We expect this momentum to continue going forward.\nDepreciation was up $17 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $39 million, mostly driven by a lower [indiscernible] price. Progress continued in fuel efficiency, which improved year-over-year and saw smaller than normal seasonal degradation from Q4. And despite severe winter weather early in the full quarter.\nFinally, equipment and rents increased by $2 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $7 million. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 14. And Free cash flow of $560 million is lower year-to-date, driven by a decrease in net earnings, increased investment in the business and deferred tax payments, partially offset by prior year back wage payouts.\nCSX exits Q1 with a healthy balance sheet and an A-rated credit profile. Our first priority remains investing capital towards safety, reliability and long-term growth. CSX also distributed nearly $500 million to shareholders, split between share repurchases and dividends, demonstrating our balanced but opportunistic approach to returning excess cash. We also believe a long-term focus on economic profit aligns our interest with that of our shareholders.\nWhile first quarter economic profit declined due to previously mentioned discrete headwinds, we expect it to increase over time as we efficiently convert freight off the highway, while maintaining strong asset utilization and attractive returns on our capital spending.\nNow with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Sean. Now we will conclude our remarks by walking through our guidance for the full year 2024, which has not changed.\nLed by our customer service, we continue to expect total volume and total revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We expect our merchandise business to give momentum through the year as effects from new business wins, truck conversions and the ramp-up of industrial development projects build on favorable trends in many of our end markets.\nWe look for steady growth in Intermodal, supported by stable consumer demand and more normalized retail inventories, which are driving improved port activity. We continue to work closely with our channel partners, finding creative solutions to gain share even as the truck market remains soft.\nGlobal benchmark coal prices have fluctuated but remained high compared to history. And though the situation of the Port of Baltimore limit some of the export volume in the near term, we are taking actions to effectively mitigate as much of the impact as we can. [indiscernible] team at Curtis Bay and across the rest of the coal franchise be ready to ramp back up as quickly as possible once the channel returns to full operation.\nOn profitability, we made good progress this quarter and grew our operations -- operating margin sequentially. And as you saw in our results and heard from the team on this call, we benefited from volume growth, solid pricing gains and focused efforts to improve efficiency and productivity. Our goal is to consistently grow our margins over time. And while Baltimore and global coal prices are near-term challenges, we feel very good about our ability to deliver strong incremental performance in the second half of this year.\nThere is no change to our CapEx forecast of $2.5 billion. As you heard from Sean, our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns remains in place. To conclude, during the quarter, where there were many potential distractions, I am very proud of how the ONE CSX team stuck to our plan, focused on execution, prioritize our customers and achieved good results. There is much more to come as we make every effort to run safer, faster and more reliably for our customers, so we can deliver profitable growth over the long term.\nThanks to all of you for your interest the company and [indiscernible], we're ready to take questions.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Briana, we're ready to start the process."

My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Matt Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Matt, you may begin.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Krista. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkeyl, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Now in the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosures on Slide 3. And with that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. As you will hear from our leadership team today, we are very happy with the momentum we carried into the start of the new year. Of course, mother nature gave us a few challenges over the last couple of weeks, but we are proud of the work our ONE CSX team has done to set us up for success this year. Our railroad is performing well, and Mike Cory and the operations team are already bringing new ideas that are helping us run even better, safer and more efficiently.\nOur customers are happy with the consistent service that our dedicated employees are delivering, and Kevin Boone will discuss how this is translating into profitable business opportunities. Sean Pelkeyl will go over our financial position, which remains very strong as we continue to deliver healthy volumes, favorable pricing strong operating margins and high levels of free cash flow. Before we talk about the details of the past quarter and our expectations for 2024, it's important to take a step back to appreciate all that our ONE CSX team accomplished in 2023.\nEveryone on this call knows has been a very active period for our entire industry. Recall that it was just over a year ago that Congress took action to prevent a major rail strike. Soon afterwards, highly visible events last winter led to important public debates about railroad safety. And through the year, Class 1 railroads have completed major mergers and made significant leadership changes. Meanwhile, our customers have had to manage through higher interest rates and inflation on the one hand and wars and supply chain disruptions on the other. Through all of this, the aim of our ONE CSX team has been to keep moving forward on our key goal of delivering sustainable, profitable growth that benefits all our key stakeholders.\nOur customers, our employees, our shareholders and the communities we live in and serve. For example, CSX was the first Class 1 railroad to reach paid sick leave agreements with our union partners, and we were the first railroad to significantly change our attendance policies based on employee feedback. We were also the first U.S. Class 1 railroad to be released from the additional service metric reporting by the STB back in May, based on our improvements in service to our customers. Now here on Slide 5, we have lifted several key achievements from this past year that helped us take important steps forward.\nFirst and foremost, our focus on safety has driven strong results over the year, especially in the fourth quarter, enabling us to report much improved accident and injury rates compared to 2022. Our service metrics that have consistently led the industry, and today, CSX remains ahead of our peers. Importantly, this is improving our customers' experience, which puts us in a great position to gain their trust and gain share. You've heard me reiterate this all year long. Our team delivered positive volume growth in merchandise that beat U.S. industrial production. Improved efficiency helped us grow coal volumes and our intermodal business gained traction led by our service and market initiatives. Our commercial and operating teams are more closely aligned than ever. Our customers know that when we offer them a solution, we have the commitment and the expertise to deliver it.\nFinally, we have seen our efforts to renew the culture here at the railroad start to really take shape. Through our site visits, family days and our regular surveys in town halls, we see the increased pride and energy that our employees are feeling through ONE CSX. And this is great progress, and we are proud of what we've accomplished this past year. None of these efforts are done or complete as this is a journey. There is so much more that we can accomplish as we work together as ONE CSX team. On Slide 6, we highlight some of the key results from our fourth quarter.\nTotal volume grew by 1%, reaching 1.56 million units in the quarter. Much of this growth was driven by our strong merchandise franchise, which gained [ 3% ] year-over-year. Our total revenue decreased by roughly 1% to $3.68 billion as the effects of higher volumes and favorable pricing were offset by a decrease in other revenue and lower fuel surcharge due to lower diesel prices as compared to last year. We earned $0.45 per share compared to $0.49 per share a year ago. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike Cory to go over the details of our operations.\n\nMichael A. Cory\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Canadian National Railway Company\n\nYes. Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to Slide 8, and let's just go to the Q4 recap. As I've said many times before, safety is foundational to every success we have. We saw a reduction in engineering and mechanical-related accidents and a reduction in transportation injuries during the quarter. And I really want to thank every CSX employee for their continued efforts on creating a safe working environment for themselves and each other. And that is extremely important. But we know we still have work to do.\nWhile the full year numbers showed overall improvement, we were flat on transportation-related accidents and saw an increase in engineering-related accidents. These are all areas of opportunities we aim to improve in 2024 and beyond. Safety at its core isn't solely about incidents. It's about how employees feel working within the organization. When we have an environment where employees feel included, respected, valued and listened to, we can continue to identify areas of improvement as a team and change them. In 2023, we listened to our employees, and we made positive changes to the work environment in response, converting these conversations in sound successful practices. Our results are beginning to demonstrate that this is already making a difference, but we have a ways to go.\nWe'll continue to keep this dialogue open and learn from each other. When done right, the entire ONE CSX team will meet its great potential when it comes to operating safely and efficiently and service to our customers. Moving over to the next slide. And on this slide is pre-self-explanatory. To me, it shows we've stabilized our network and we performed pretty well over the quarter. But one of our key focus areas is on maintaining and bettering our customer-facing metrics. Our fluidity has started to allow us to look deeper at our operating plan, again to better align the hard assets needed to move the volume. The team has been focused on maximizing car connections and maximizing the train load, while at the same time reducing locomotive dwell and active horsepower on the trains.\nAs a result, we've seen both the reduction in active locomotive use and daily train starts. Titan connection standards in our yards are starting to drive changes to our operating plan to result in quicker connections, driving a strong focus on using our locomotive technology to reduce fuel usage on line of road has contributed to a savings in overall fuel cost. Altogether, we're finding tangible opportunities to open up more capacity on this network. We expect these metrics to continue to improve as we go forward. Going over to Slide 10.\nI really believe we've made good headway in Q4 and especially over 2023, our key metrics continue to improve and our network is fluid. Our head count is at the point that we are now able to manage through efficiency and attrition. We're paying close attention to resource requirements for any new business coming online when needed. Our focus on car connections and train tonnage closely matched the horsepower along with network fluidity allowed us to reduce 2.5% of our daily starts in the quarter and start to store active locomotives. Among other things, this coming quarter, we'll be performing full territory reviews with our team that will further improve our customer service and continue to identify opportunities to better align asset use.\nAnd of course, we'll be working right along with Kevin and his sales and marketing team to deliver this great service and grow with our customers. In closing, during my 4 months on the property, I continue to learn more about this network and especially the women and men that make up this tremendous ONE CSX team. I'm extremely excited about our potential to deliver our customers better service with greater safety, efficiency and teamwork. And I'm excited to do this together as one group of great railroaders. So thanks for the time, and over to you, Kevin.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nThank you, Mike. It really has been great to see how well our teams have been working together and the positive momentum we are building with our customers as they recognize CSX's focus on service. This teamwork is allowing us to build on new opportunities and drive attractive and profitable growth across all of our end markets. Business conditions in 2023 were challenging for many of our customers with several of our key markets experiencing volatility driven by a number of factors, including inventory destocking.\nOn the positive side, we saw many of these markets show improvement in the fourth quarter, which, combined with our industry-leading service provides optimism that the team can deliver strong revenue growth. Turning to Slide 12, we look at our merchandise performance. As you can see, our revenues were up 5% on both the quarterly and annual basis. Even with the effects of reduced fuel surcharge, volume increased by a solid 3% for the quarter and 2% for the full year, outpacing domestic industrial production that's been effectively flat. And we've delivered pricing results that reflect the higher inflationary backdrop that we have all experienced.\nLooking at the details of the quarter, automotive performed well even with the temporary disruption caused by the UAW strike as total volumes held up and we continue to see leverage and we continue to leverage service to gain new business. Chemicals was challenged over most of the year, but delivered positive growth in the fourth quarter, driven by shipments in plastics, sand and waste. For fertilizers, strong domestic demand and higher CSX shipments of potash exports supported volumes. Short-haul phosphate shipments remained constrained by supply issues, which weighs on volumes but provides a tailwind for yields. Metals has continued to be an area where our service provides growth opportunities, and in Minerals, infrastructure-related demand continued to be very healthy over the quarter with new cement production supporting volumes.\nFor [ Forest ] Products, volume was modestly lower year-over-year but increased sequentially as pulpboard demand has started to show signs of recovery. While the ramp-up in [indiscernible] and food over the fourth quarter was challenged, with Southeastern feed buyers remaining well supplied from local crops, combined with slower ramp-up in exports. As we head into 2024, we are encouraged with the momentum we've built across the business, and we see many opportunities across the end markets we serve. Our service continues to differentiate CSX in the marketplace, and we are excited about the opportunities this offers us to work with customers to collectively grow our businesses together.\nTurning to Slide 13. Coal revenue decreased 1% for the fourth quarter as we lapped very strong export pricing from a year ago. Volumes remained positive, growing by 3% for the quarter and 8% for the year. Our coal business continues to be strong with service levels accelerating in the fourth quarter and global export prices supporting U.S. production. At the end of the last quarter, we indicated that export demand remains strong, that lower natural gas prices and reduced restocking demand would likely weigh on domestic shipments, and that's exactly what happened in the fourth quarter, with export tonnage up a full 27% and while domestic tonnage declined by 13%.\nCoal RPU of just over [ 3,200 ] per ton was up 5% sequentially, in line with our expectations. For the new year, we are optimistic supported by continued strength in export demand as global benchmarks for both met and thermal currently remain at healthy levels. We also see incremental production growth on our network in West Virginia which will primarily be focused on the export market. Domestic demand in 2023 was supported by months of aggressive restocking at utilities and a very hot summer. With stockpiles at more normal levels demand upside will largely be dependent on weather conditions in 2024. That said, total electricity demand growth remains substantial, especially in the Southeast, driven by new industrial capacity to data centers, achieving EV charging stations. Turning to Slide 14.\nFourth quarter intermodal revenue decreased 4% on flat volumes. For the full year, revenue decreased 11% on volumes that were down 7%. Lower fuel surcharge drove the largest impact to yields. Our domestic intermodal business continued to perform well, with volume increasing sequentially and growing in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We saw growth with our key partners that continue to experience industry-leading service performance, which was recently highlighted in JOCs customer satisfaction results. Our ability to deliver domestic growth was an extraordinary team effort, especially given the significant challenges facing the trucking market. In International, volumes were lower compared to last year, but we were encouraged to see improvement each month with December actually showing modest year-over-year growth as the positive effects of more normalized retailer inventories gain traction.\nOur team has continued to work hard to maximize our opportunities, which showed up in the growth as we work to build new partnerships, create new service offerings and leverage higher activity at the inland ports that we serve. Positive market trends are taking shape as we head into 2024, and we expect the combination of a more supportive market, new conversion opportunities and service offerings to drive year-over-year growth in both the domestic and the international business. We continue to monitor the evolving situations at both the Panama Canal and the Red Sea. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any changes in our customer behavior but we stand at the ready with the capacity and capabilities to adapt as needed.\nFinally, as we turn the page to 2024, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. The team is accelerating our efforts in many areas of our business to work hand-in-hand with our customers to identify areas for growth. From industrial development to identifying market-specific operating metrics that enhance the customer experience, [indiscernible] been working closely with our rail partners to unlock growth. These are just a few of the focus areas for the team. Now I'll hand it over to Sean to review the financial review.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good afternoon. Fourth quarter revenue fell by 1%, while operating income was down 10% or $139 million. Now these results include $180 million of discrete year-over-year impacts from declines in Other revenue, real estate gains and export coal benchmark prices. However, the underlying results also reflect the benefit of our sustained service levels throughout 2023 and growing momentum in the business.\nAcross merchandise, coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel increased by 5%, benefiting from strong core pricing across the merchandise portfolio and 3% volume growth in both merchandise and coal. Counter to normal seasonal trends, the team delivered sequential volume gains, helping operating income increase by $25 million relative to the third quarter. Interest and other expense was $16 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $23 million, the effective tax rate of 22.9% included $19 million of favorable adjustments primarily for state tax matters relative to $33 million of favorable adjustments in the prior year. Our expected tax rate going forward remains 24.5%.\nEarnings per share fell by $0.04, including $0.07 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. For the full year, operating income fell by 8% or $462 million, while earnings per share was 5% lower. These results were impacted by the prior year Virginia real estate transaction declining intermodal storage revenue and lower export coal benchmarks totaling nearly $700 million on a combined basis. The hard work of our ONE CSX team provided our customers reliable and consistent service throughout 2023, and laid a strong foundation for long-term profitable growth. With profitable growth in mind, we will also be making a change in how we report results going forward.\nStarting in the first quarter of 2024 and we will transition to a more conventional approach of reporting operating margins rather than operating ratio. Our goal is to target margin improvement, aligning the business around a balanced approach that includes profitable volume gains and pricing to the value of our service, all while controlling costs and optimizing asset utilization. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expenses. Total fourth quarter expense increased by $89 million as the impacts of lower real estate gains, inflation, increased depreciation and higher head count were partly offset by lower fuel prices and efficiency savings in PS&O and rents. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and Fringe was up $82 million, impacted by inflation and additional headcount. The quarter also included costs that related to the timing of union employee vacation and sick benefits.\nWe expect this to adjust down resulting in a lower sequential cost per employee in the first quarter. Purchased services and other expense increased $4 million versus last year, as inflation was mostly offset by savings from our intermodal and engineering teams. We expect a modest sequential increase in the first quarter, similar to what we have seen in recent years. As a reminder, we'll cycle a prior year insurance recovery of nearly $50 million in the first quarter. And while we expect increased technology carry costs and a need for more locomotive overhauls to impact expense in 2024, we are actively implementing cost savings and efficiency initiatives that will help offset these headwinds. Depreciation was up $24 million, including an $11 million adjustment related to prior periods. We are projecting roughly $40 million to $50 million higher full year depreciation expense in 2024.\nFuel cost was down $59 million driven by a lower gallon price. While fuel efficiency was stable year-over-year, we saw strong sequential improvement. These results are especially encouraging as we typically face seasonal efficiency headwinds in the fourth quarter. Mike and the team expect to continue the momentum in this critical measure into 2024 and drive meaningful year-over-year savings. Equipment and rents was $9 million favorable, driven by faster car cycle times across all markets. Finally, property gains were $47 million unfavorable in the quarter. At this time, we do not expect any individually significant transactions during 2024. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 18.\nFull year free cash flow remains strong at $3.3 billion. Our first priority use of cash remains investing for the safety, reliability and growth of our business. As such, this figure includes $2.3 billion of capital spend across a wide range of projects to ensure the integrity of our network infrastructure as well as the high return strategic investment opportunities. Looking to 2024, note that free cash flow will be impacted by about $380 million of Federal Cash Tax Payments that were deferred from 2023. Cash flow generation also supported close to $4.4 billion in shareholder returns for the year, including $3.5 billion in share repurchases and nearly $900 million of dividends. While economic profit finished lower for the year, largely due to lower intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing, our goal is to increase economic profit over time which has been shown to strongly correlate with outsized shareholder returns. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Sean. Now we will conclude with our initial thoughts on our expectations for the full year 2024. As of today, and based on our visibility with our customers and our expectations for the CSX specific initiatives that we are putting in place, we anticipate growth in total volume and total revenue in the low to mid-single-digit range. We see encouraging momentum across our merchandise business, but we are benefiting from service-led gains in market share and wallet share and new industrial development activity.\nWe expect growth in our intermodal business as a prolonged destocking cycle finally winds down and our strategic initiatives continue to drive volume, and Export coal demand continues to be very strong with CSX gaining from the ramp-up of a new mine on our network. By growing volumes and utilizing our existing capacity, we expect our profitability to benefit from a favorable combination of solid pricing better operational efficiency and a moderate easing in cost inflation. Kevin's team continues to do a great job making sure that we are getting paid for the service we provide. And as Mike discussed, we see all kinds of new opportunities run this network better, safer, faster and more efficiently. We expect an increase in our capital spending to approximately $2.5 billion this year as we invest in safety infrastructure, locomotive rebuilds, upgrades to our portion of the New Alabama Interchange with CBKC and other specific high-return investments, including technology investments.\nFinally, as before, there is no change to our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns, using our excess cash to fund share repurchases and dividends to benefit our shareholders. In closing, I am very proud of what our entire team accomplished this past year. To our ONE CSX team, I want to thank all of you across all of our facilities in every state and province that we're operating in, through your hard work and for demonstrating that our ONE CSX culture can be something real and impactful. We're in a great position we had in 2024 and with your help, we can make it even better year than the strong one we just had. For everyone on this call, thank you for all your interest in and support of CSX. Matthew, we're now ready to take questions.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Krista, we're ready to start the process."

My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2023 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nMr. Matt Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Krista. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2 followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call today. Over this last year, CSX mission and message have remained clear and consistent. We have seen great progress with our One CSX initiatives, which are helping to build a focused, collaborative culture that enables all of our employees to feel engaged, energized and focused on working better together. At the same time, our service levels continue to lead the industry. These successes go hand in hand and as our customers see that CSX is truly dedicated to providing consistent, reliable service over the long term, they are responding positively.\nAs we look forward to all the opportunities ahead, we are confident that these efforts we are making will drive clear, sustainable, profitable growth. And we took another step forward on this path this quarter, thanks to the hard work put in by our One CSX team, our railroad is running well. Our merchandise business remained steady, and our coal shipments were very strong. Our domestic intermodal volumes are growing well compared to last year, our international intermodal business though down year-over-year as stabilized.\nOverall, our network continues to perform, and I am pleased with how the team has succeeded in managing the things that we can control. I continue to be very excited about all the potential ahead for CSX.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5 to review the highlights for the third quarter. First, we moved over 1.5 million coal load this quarter, which was down just slightly from a year ago with flat year-over-year performance in merchandise and 9% growth in coal. Our operating ratio ticked up in the low 60s and as we face challenges that we have been talking about all year, with lower fuel recovery, reduced intermodal storage revenue, lower export coal prices and higher cost of inflation, most notably with our labor contract. As in previous quarters, our margin does include the impact of the quality carriers trucking business.\nSecond, we generated $3.6 billion in revenue, which was 8% lower than the previous year. Last year, we benefited from high diesel prices and record export coal benchmarks that were both much lower this quarter.\nThird, even with the year-over-year changes we face -- changes we faced, operating income still came in at $1.3 billion for the quarter compared to a little under $1.6 billion last year and our earnings per share were $0.42, and down from $0.52.\nWhile I'm proud of what we accomplished this quarter given all the challenges, none of us here are satisfied with these results. We're not sitting back and simply waiting for markets to turn. We are looking throughout the entire network to see where we can operate more efficiently. We continue to work closely with our customers to build our business pipeline and drive more volume onto the railroad and we are emphasizing the importance of cost discipline to every team in every 1 of our locations.\nOne of the reasons I'm so confident about what is ahead for CSX is a great leadership team that we have in place. As you all saw last month, we were very pleased to announce that Mike Cory has joined our railroad as Chief Operating Officer. Mike brings great experience and a thorough understanding of scale reality and he also shares our deep dedication and appreciation for customer service and the employees who provide that service day in and day out. Mike arrived in Jacksonville a few weeks ago and is now here joining us on this call.\nAnd so I will now turn it over to Mike to say a few words and cover our operational performance over the quarter.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nWell, thank you very much, Joe. And I truly appreciate the words, and I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity to work with such a committed team of people with so much potential to lead this industry with great customer service. safety, service, efficiency and along with engagement with each other, our customers and stakeholders is how we're going to leverage this great franchise to be best-in-class. And I've been here short time, pretty much less than a month, but I've been really busy. I visited major yards, coal export facilities and I've spent time in headquarters meeting with an array of people from different functions of the railroad.\nIn person, I've listened to, and I've spoken with employees from all across the company. For people on the ground executing the plan from people developing the plan, to sales and marketing, finance, the other network ops, IT facilities and the list goes on. But what really resonates with me is their collective desire to be the best they can be for our One CSX team and our customers. We've got great talent in all our functions and our job is to connect the talent and maximize the value of their efforts.\nWe're doing this in order for our team to be the best at providing what our customers need in the safest and most efficient way. We're doing this because decision-making, acting on what they see and know, must be quick and done as close to where the opportunity is taking place. That said, I see opportunities, 1 of which and to me, the most important at this stage is to create and share a robust and visible flow of information that will drive improvement through the continuation of the lean principles to define scheduled railroad. We all need to see the effects of our collective decisions as fast as possible to be more nimble and responsive to our customers' needs. As well, collectively, we'll learn and share best practices throughout the organization from this and other available data as it gives us a platform to learn as it happens.\nThis will create the speed and the trust that we need to move together as 1 team. So let's go over to the slides and we'll start looking at our safety metrics. Our third quarter injury and accident rates increased as we saw a track caused and human factory incidents trend upward. And these aren't acceptable outcomes for us. And we're taking action to continuously improve the environment our employees operate in as well as the overall safety culture. Human factor incidents especially with newly hired employees within 1 of the trends this year that have driven the increase.\nIn Q3, the team added additional time for initial training for our new conductors at our ready center in Atlanta. We also looked at the length of training when new hires graduate from Atlanta and report back to their home terminals and we increased the length of that training as well. Increased training gives us more time to develop skills with our new hires, but we also determined we needed to place resources to spend that time with them. So we train unionized mentors and now we have them across the property with the new hires. These mentors are available to teach and answer questions, reinforcing the One CSX culture by being part of developing and coaching their newly hired peers.\nLastly, on safety, we're not taking our focus off life-changing events. We've partnered with [ Delta ], specialty risk management group to roll out training to help employees self-identify risk in an ever-changing environment. Now traditionally, railroads train on operating rules. But we can't write a rule for everything or test our way to a positive safety culture. Both identification of risk and eliminating that risk when possible is 1 of our major goals moving into Q4 and beyond.\nSo let's go over to the next slide on our operating highlights. Our end-to-end train velocity averaged 17.6 miles an hour in the third quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but still up substantially from the same period in 2022. Well averaged 9.6 hours, an improvement of nearly 20% compared to the same period last year.\nIntermodal trip plan performance was 94% and increased by 4 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance was 82% and improved by 25 percentage points. Our service performance remains fluid. And though we did see a slight seasonal dip during the middle of the quarter during peak vacation and holiday season, our metrics are rebounding into the fourth quarter. We all know and we will -- we all know we will, and we're all working together to improve these results.\nOur ability to leverage this great franchise by connecting the people and the vast talent they bring will allow us to improve all key aspects of our business with a strong focus on those lean management principles that drive reliable, consistent service. I'm really confident that connecting all of these dots together is going to result in a strong team now and more importantly, bench strength for the future. This is really our 1 CSX goal.\nAnd so with that, over to you, Kevin.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nThank you. Mike and I have been spending a lot of time together, and it's really great to have you on the team. To start, I'm pleased to say that our improving service levels are a key differentiator in the marketplace. And I can't thank the entire team enough for all of the hard work. These improvements are being recognized by our customers and are leading to new initiatives and discussions around how CSX can partner with our customers for growth.\nOur ability to grow profitably requires us to be proactive, quickly adapt to changing markets and think differently. I'm proud of how well we have been able to coordinate with operations to drive both growth and efficiencies. With Mike in his role, we have only seen these efforts accelerate. It's no surprise that overall economic conditions remain uncertain, but it has been encouraging to see gradually improving sequential trends across several of our end markets over this past quarter.\nWe see many, many reasons to be optimistic as we continue to build our business pipeline with an eye toward 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 10 to look at our merchandise performance for the quarter. Our revenues were down modestly compared to last year on flat volumes as solid core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge and negative mix effects in certain markets. Our automotive business continued to show strength with higher production and business wins, driving a 19% increase in volume year-over-year. Minerals continues to perform very well, sustained by infrastructure activity, that is supporting new cement facilities and healthy demand for aggregates. Metals' performance has also benefited from our service levels, leading to competitive wins and solid demand.\nOur chemical franchise, while challenged has begun to stabilize and even showed some promising improvement in domestic plastics over the quarter. Fertilizer revenue growth was strong in the quarter despite volumes that were impacted by weaker short-haul movements with production challenges in Florida. As we expected, the strong Southeastern corn crop and less rail volume for grain and Forest products remains 1 of the most challenged areas with many mills still taking meaningful downtime.\nAs we start the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the early October volume trends with most markets showing sequential momentum. We anticipate a strong rebound for agg and food as a strong Midwest harvest kicks in. And across other markets, we expect our service improvements to drive opportunities to win in the marketplace as we focus on modal conversion.\nTurning to Slide 11. Third quarter coal revenue declined 5%, even though volumes were very strong, growing 9% compared to last year. export demand continued to be a major volume driver growing 26% with the hot summer also supporting solid domestic demand. Strong coal volumes minimized the effects of lower international benchmark prices, which were setting all-time records this time last year. The key difference was met coal pricing where global benchmarks were much lower than in the same period last year. Sequentially, our coal RPU declined 11% compared to our guidance of mid-teens decline with stronger-than-expected shipments to longer length of haul southern utility customers driving the moderate outperformance.\nLooking ahead to the last quarter of the year, we expect export markets to remain strong and are pleased with the increases in international benchmarks that we've seen over the last several weeks. On the domestic side, we have seen stockpiles normalize and demand into 2024 will be driven by winter weather and related demand needs. The increase in global benchmark prices should benefit our cold yields next quarter. So I would remind you that we have a diverse portfolio of met customers, and we have seen U.S.-based met coal benchmarks and those in other regions lag spot prices in Australia.\nTurning to intermodal on Slide 12. As a whole, the business remained challenged with revenue declining by 14% and total volume decreasing by 7% and Overall, RPU declined by 8% year-over-year, with the impact of lower fuel surcharge accounting for the decline, partially offset by positive price, that said, we are seeing encouraging trends from our domestic business, where volume turned positive on a year-over-year basis early in the summer and has continued to improve since then.\nWe offer a diverse mix of transportation solutions within domestic intermodal, and we've seen great results from our strong channel partnerships and our direct relationships with major retailers. Our team has been successful in converting traffic off the highway in a market facing plentiful truck capacity, which is a testament to the team and the market-leading service product. Meanwhile, International intermodal activity has stabilized, but remains weak. We haven't seen any clear signs of a positive inflection yet. Retailers remain concerned about the health of the consumer and though destocking may have slowed, we haven't seen this turn into sustained increases in order rates or imports.\nFor the rest of the year, we expect trends to largely continue as they were over the third quarter with domestic gradually strengthening supported by our team's strong sales efforts. While we prepare for the turning point for international, Recall that we saw a meaningful drop-off in our intermodal volume in the back half of the fourth quarter in 2022 as markets slowed substantially, which will benefit our reported growth rate for the current quarter.\nSlide 13 provides a clear illustration of the encouraging signs we're seeing within our intermodal business. On a year-over-year basis, Domestic Intermodal has shown a favorable trend since the beginning of 2023, turning positive around midyear and steadily improving since, while international volumes remained lower compared to 2022, we've seen stability in the past few months. Altogether, across all of our businesses, our team continues to push forward across multiple initiatives aimed at winning wallet share converting truck traffic and bringing new customers to the railroad.\nWe remain confident that our leading service performance will continue to provide opportunities to win business. And we know that we have the resources and capacity in place to deliver growth when the market environment inflects. I'm proud of what the collective CSX team has accomplished this quarter and I'm excited about all the potential ahead.\nNow I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss financials.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Third quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was lower by 18% or $284 million. These results include nearly $350 million of year-over-year impacts from lower intermodal storage revenue, export coal benchmark prices and fuel recovery, partly offset by $42 million of favorability related to last year's labor agreement adjustment. Suffice it to say, this quarter should represent the peak year-over-year impact from these discrete items.\nRevenue fell by 8% or $323 million, despite strong pricing across many -- the merchandise portfolio along with positive volume trends across many merchandise markets as well as domestic intermodal. The operating team also worked tirelessly to meet customer needs and deliver a 9% increase in coal volume. Across merchandise, Coal and Intermodal, revenue excluding fuel recovery increased 2% in the quarter and was up mid-single digits, excluding the impacts of coal RPU headwinds.\nExpenses were lower by 2%, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $13 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $32 million as the impact of lower pretax earnings more than offset a prior year favorable state tax item. And this quarter's effective tax rate came in at 24.9%. As a result, earnings per share fell by $0.10, including nearly $0.12 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items.\nLet's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total third quarter expense decreased by $39 million. Lower fuel prices and cycling the prior year labor true-up were mostly offset by the impacts of inflation and higher depreciation. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense decreased $7 million as the prior year union labor adjustment was largely offset by inflation and increased headcount. Heightened attention to overtime benefited cost per employee particularly in our mechanical workforce where overtime ratios are now running at multiyear lows. [indiscernible] services and other expense increased $25 million versus last year, including $16 million associated with higher casualty expense.\nTurning to sequential performance versus Q2 on the right-hand side of the page, network performance and numerous cost control initiatives in the quarter drove a nearly $20 million reduction in PS&O across our operating departments. We expect these savings to remain in the fourth quarter aside from normal seasonality. Depreciation was up $21 million as a result of last year's equipment study as well as a larger asset base.\nFuel cost was down $89 million, mostly driven by a lower gallon price. This was partially offset by higher consumption, including approximately 2.5 million gallons recognized from prior periods. Adjusting for this fuel efficiency was still unfavorable versus the prior year, and Mike has brought an increased focus on this critical measure. While seasonality will impact fuel efficiency in Q4, we fully expect to get back on trend.\nEquipment and rents was $10 million favorable, driven by faster freight car cycle times across all markets. These benefits were partly offset by costs related to higher automotive volumes. Finally, property gains were $21 million unfavorable in the quarter. As a reminder, we are cycling over $50 million of prior year gains in Q4 and expect sales this year to be minimal.\nNow turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 17. Reflecting the discrete factors I discussed earlier, free cash flow is down from the prior year, but remains strong, supporting investments in the safety and reliability of our network as well as an increased level of high-return strategic investments. Robust cash flow has also supported over $3.5 billion in shareholder returns so far this year, including $2.9 billion in share repurchases and over $650 million of dividends.\nEconomic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings is about $160 million lower year-to-date, impacted again by intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing. Nevertheless, the focus on economic profit is helping to incent a pipeline of high-return initiatives that will deliver growth and ongoing efficiency gains.\nNow with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Sean. Now as shown on Slide 19, we will finish with some updated comments on our outlook as we approach the final quarter of 2023. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in revenue ton miles for the full year, supported by our consistent performance in merchandise and export coal. Automotive and minerals remain important growth areas. So obviously, we're watching developments with the Toy 3 automakers in EW very closely.\nAs Kevin mentioned, we also look for a substantial rebound in our agg and food business over the fourth quarter. Export coal volumes remained strong as global demand stays high for U.S. met and thermal coal. For domestic coal, we anticipate some slowdown from the third quarter, which benefited from hot summer weather. Though so far this quarter, we continue to be pleased with our shipment levels.\nFor Intermodal, as we mentioned, we expect domestic activity to keep gaining modest momentum in the fourth quarter. While for now, our international business looks largely stable. Overall, our volume growth rate in intermodal will reflect favorable year-over-year comparisons. As we've said all year, the pricing environment remains supportive, and we have been encouraged by the agreements we've already reached for 2024. Note that with the slowdown in intermodal storage revenue that we have seen over the course of this year, we are now expecting supplemental revenue, excluding trucking to decline by $325 million for the full year.\nOur commitment to efficiency and cost control remains in place as we keep our eye on service performance, not just in the near term, but also as we look ahead to improve market conditions and greater demand for rail capacity. Finally, our estimate of $2.3 billion in capital expenditures remains unchanged along with our strong focus on innovation and growth.\nI will close by saying that I'm very proud of what we've accomplished as One CSX team as I finished my first year with CSX. When I spoke to all of you last fall, we talked about our belief that CSX could accomplish great things and create so much value by working better together as 1 team to serve our customers. We have made very good progress. And all of us know that there remains so much more we can do. I'm even more enthusiastic about our opportunities than it was last year. We all appreciate your support in our company and we keep -- as we keep moving forward. All right. Thank you.\nAnd Matthew, we're now ready for questions.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. Make the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity. We ask you to please limit yourselves to 1 question. Krista lets start the process."

I will now turn the call over to today's speaker, Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nA presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you, Matthew, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call. Our performance over the second quarter met our expectations, led by the strong results of our merchandise business. As we had indicated at year-end and again last quarter, we knew that we would have to manage through lower intermodal storage revenue and normalizing export coal prices. We expect intermodal volumes to be soft as imports slowed and destocking activity continued.\nThat said, we also knew that we were gaining momentum with our customers, led by our improved service performance and in our own workplace as our One CSX efforts took hold. Our network continues to run well and our company's initiatives, combined with our employees' hard work and commitment of making a big difference in helping to set our railroad apart. There is much more to do but our results this quarter show signs of the progress we are making as we lay the groundwork for long-term growth and value creation.\nTurning to Slide 5. Let's review the highlights for the second quarter. We moved over 1.5 million carloads in the second quarter, led by a 3% volume growth in merchandise and 4% growth in coal, and our margins remained strong with an operating ratio below 60%, including the impact of the Carload carriers trucking business. We generated $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 3% lower than the previous year and flat from the first quarter.\nOperating income decreased 13% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, and our earnings per share decreased by 9% to $0.49. When making comparisons to last year, it's important to remember that our second quarter 2022 results included $122 million gain, representing $0.04 per share of EPS related to the Commonwealth of Virginia property sale. All in, this was a solid performance highlighted by great results in our core business. The fact that our team was able to drive 3% merchandise volume growth in such an uncertain macroeconomic market is a testament to what we are able to do when we work together.\nNow moving on to Slide 6. Earlier this month, CSX released its new 2022 ESG report, which highlights the tremendous progress that our team has made in moving our company forward. And soon as I started here last fall, you've heard me talk about One CSX, about building a supportive and positive culture and about the need to consider all of our stakeholders when measuring our success as a company.\nMany of you have asked me what this really means in practice? What does the railroad look like, where people feel valued and included? For its customers feel appreciated and where the communities in which it operates are respected. I think the pictures and highlights that you see here offer a small view into how we're making this happen here at CSX.\nTo us, incorporating environmental, social and governance considerations into the priorities of our company goes hand-in-hand with our One CSX focus, adding to the greater sense of purpose that we all share. These are real authentic actions that we are taking today. We talk often about our environmental leadership and our clear advantage here over trucks as a core part of our value proposition to our customers and our shareholders. By expanding our user technology, conducting practical testing of alternative fuels and offering support and encouragement to our suppliers, we continue to make progress.\nAs we reported in our press release last week, we are testing biodiesel blends in locomotives in revenue service. Last month, you heard that we were in talk with [ CPKC ] to form a joint venture from the development of hydrogen-powered locomotives, which offer encouraging promise into low emissions fuel solution. What we probably do not talk enough about are all the incredible efforts made by our railroaders to build up the places in which we live and work. It has been a priority of ours to increase our company's positive cultural impact, and I'm proud of how quickly the people of CSX have responded.\nAs you see here, our volunteer hours are up substantially. Our CSX-sponsored community events have multiplied and the number of people who we have been able to help and support has been incredible. I look forward to much more to come. There's one last item I'd like to mention.\nAs CSX, safety is our top priority, and that's why we focus so much on our reported injury and accident rates. Our fundamental goal is to make sure that every one of our employees gets home safely every day. When that does not happen, and we lose one of our colleagues as we lost [indiscernible] last month, it affects us deeply. As a reminder, why we make so much effort on safety and how much more work we need to do.\nNow let me turn it over to the team.\n\nJamie J. Boychuk\n\nEVP of Operations, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joe just said, we continue to make every effort to enhance our company's safety performance. As Slide 8 shows, we made good progress this quarter with both our FRA injury frequency and FRA train accident rate improved sequentially. Our injury rate also improved year-over-year and was the lowest rate for a second quarter that we've seen since 2015. Our focus is to ensure that every employee, including new hires who are less familiar, understands and appreciates their part to reinforce our safety-focused culture.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our operating performance held up well over the second quarter and continues to lead the industry. Thanks to the hard work of our railroaders who execute the operating plan every day.\nI've seen firsthand a positive response to the efforts being made by our employees to strengthen our culture. Our men and women in the field are valued, included, respected, appreciated and listen to, which helps them feel even more pride in the service they're delivering to our customers. Because of them, we're able to show how well our scheduled railroading model works, and I'm excited as there are more opportunities ahead.\nVelocity averaged 17.7 miles per hour in the second quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.3 hours, an improvement of over 20% compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip Plan performance of 96%, increased by 6 percentage points year-over-year, while Carload Trip Plan Performance of 84% improved by 25 percentage points. I'm pleased with the compliments and support we have received from our customers, regulators and shareholders on our service improvements. Our goal is to keep improving our service, ensure that we can continue to sustain this over time so we can drive long-term growth for CSX.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss our sales and marketing performance.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nThank you, Jamie. As Joe noted, despite headwinds across many of our markets, the team was able to capitalize on strong year-over-year improvement in service. Importantly, as service has improved, is opening up opportunities to discuss new business with our customers, where we are seeing our year-to-date pipeline up 30%. I'm proud of the team and progress we have made. It means a lot of work ahead of us as we focus on building our pipeline of growth opportunities.\nInitiatives, including white-boarding sessions with customers, increasing direct engagement with small and medium-sized shippers bringing new technology tools to better serve our customers; and finally, expanding our reach by leveraging our transfer network in collaborating with both with our short line and Class I partners are just a few of the focus areas for the team as we move into the back half of the year.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our strong merchandise performance continued into the second quarter. With revenue increasing 5%, even as our fuel surcharge declined substantially on lower diesel prices. This growth was driven by 3% higher volume compared to last year and a 1% all-in increase in revenue per unit. As we saw in the first quarter, our customers are seeing improved service levels, which is opening opportunities and encouraging them to bring more of their business to our network.\nFor the quarter, we saw many of the market trends continue from the start of the year. In automotive, we are seeing more consistent production, and we've seen our improved service to new opportunities and business wins. Minerals benefited from strong construction demand for aggregates and our improving cycle times, and our Metals and Equipment business continues to be a bright spot with volumes up across steel, scrap and equipment. We've been successful in expanding our commercial relationships by translating our service product and to convert new business wins.\nI'm also pleased that our fertilizer business delivered higher volumes year-over-year, supported by strong domestic shipments of potash and nitrogen. On the other side, chemicals continues to be soft, as demand remains challenged across our broad book of business. [indiscernible] products faces headwinds in paper and pulp board, we've also seen some slowdown in export grains for ag and food. For the second half of the year, we expect to build on the successes we have had to win more wallet share of our existing customers while continuing our efforts to attract new customers away from truck.\nWe expect auto, minerals and metals markets to remain supportive and will be important contributors to volume growth over the remainder of 2023. We look for destocking activity to wind down in many of the markets we serve, including chemicals, though timing there remains uncertain. What's most important is that our team is not sitting back and waiting for markets to turn, we are pushing forward with our own initiatives. Our business development group has been making great progress with our Select site program and expanding our pipeline of partner projects, and we're strategically investing in developing new locations providing additional transloading capabilities and investing in railcars to drive more business to CSX.\nTurning to Slide 12. Second quarter coal revenue decreased 2%, as a 4% volume gain was more than offset by a 6% decline in revenue per unit driven by lower export coal benchmarks. We saw continued growth in export volumes due to beneficial cycle times, good performance at our Curtis Bay terminal and a push among our coal customers to move more tonnage into the overseas markets.\nDomestic utility shipments declined as we expected, as low natural gas prices weighed on coal [indiscernible], though demand in Southern utilities remained favorable. We expect momentum in export markets to continue over the second half of the year, with CSX volumes supported by new mine capacity and coal producers making opportunistic shipments into the international markets. On the domestic side, we see tougher comparisons versus a strong second half last year. But the hot summers providing a helpful tailwind early in this quarter. And just recently, we are seeing a few customers looking for additional sets. Of course, as international pricing benchmarks have eased from last year's record highs we will see an impact on our revenue per unit into the third quarter.\nMost of our exports are met coal with a benchmark around $225 per metric ton. We anticipate our third quarter all-in coal [indiscernible] will sequentially decline by a mid-teens percentage. Current international benchmark prices remained very healthy in supportive of strong production into the back half of the year.\nNow turning to Slide 13. Second quarter revenue decreased by 18% due to a 10% decline in volume and a 9% reduction in revenue per unit, reflecting the effect of lower fuel surcharge. As in the first quarter, International Intermodal drove most of the volume decrease with the business seeing headwinds from declining imports and inventory destocking. Volumes in the domestic business showed a much more modest decline helped by the good progress we continue to make with rail conversions and the team's efforts to identify new markets and lanes. Our best-in-class Eastern service product continues to position us for truck conversion in the quarters and years ahead.\nLooking forward, while we and our customers are still looking for a rebound in the international business, pressing ahead with our own initiatives, we brought on a new shipper late in the quarter that recognize the value of our strong service product and we're seeing other opportunities in new lanes and growing activity at inland ports. Domestically, we're encouraged by many opportunities to work more closely with all of our Class I partners to target truck conversion. Just one example of this is the agreement we reached with [ CPKC], it's a few weeks ago to create a new interchange in Alabama that will link our customers across the Southeast with key markets in Texas and Mexico. We think there's much more opportunity for new creative partnerships that can help bring even more business to all the railroads. And we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead of us.\nNow I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the second quarter results. Revenue was lower by 3% or $116 million. Declines in fuel recovery, other revenue and benchmark-based export coal pricing work its benefits from strong merchandise pricing as well as volume growth across merchandise and export coal. Operating income was down 13% to $1.5 billion, reflecting a $122 million headwind from cycling a gain on the Virginia property transaction. I'll discuss the expense line items in more detail on the next slide.\nInterest and other expense was $25 million higher compared to the prior year, and income tax expense decreased by $64 million on lower pre-tax earnings. As a result, EPS fell by $0.05, reflecting a $0.04 impact of lower property gains. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses.\nTotal second quarter expense increased $105 million. Lower fuel price was largely offset by the prior year Virginia gain. While network efficiency improvements resulted in over $20 million of cost savings, across labor, PS&O and rents, it was not enough to overcome more than $100 million of headwinds from inflation and higher depreciation.\nTurning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $57 million, impacted by inflation and increased headcount. Importantly, service improvements are helping us get more employees home sooner with overtime ratios down nearly 10% and a significant reduction in the number of employees stuck away from home over 24 hours. As a reminder, midyear union wage rates stepped up by 4% on July 1 and will be reflected in our second half cost per employee.\nPS&O expense increased $37 million with inflation and higher repair and maintenance expense partly offset by savings in intermodal operations and cycling of costs related to the Pan Am acquisition. While we are overhauling and rebuilding more engines than last year, locomotive efficiency was 4% improved in the quarter. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study as well as a larger asset base.\nFuel cost was down $134 million, driven by a lower gallon price. Equipment and rents was $5 million favorable, reflecting strong improvement in car cycle times with merchandise cycles 13% better than last year. These efficiency gains more than offset costs from inflation and higher volumes, particularly in the automotive market. Finally, as discussed, property gains were $117 million unfavorable in the quarter.\nNow turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 17. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX has generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. This has supported $2.4 billion in shareholder returns, including over $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $450 million of dividends. We were encouraged to receive recent news of a credit ratings upgrade. This move reflects the strong core cash-generating power of CSX through economic cycles, which supports our ongoing commitment to investing in the business, and our balanced opportunistic approach to capital return.\nEconomic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings is up over $80 million year-to-date. While intermodal story revenue declines and export coal headwinds will have a more significant year-over-year impact in the second half. We remain committed to cultivating and investing in return-seeking projects that see the pipeline of mid- and long-term growth and efficiency gains.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Sean. Now let us conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023, as shown on Slide 19. First, we reiterate our expectations that revenue ton-miles will grow in the low-single-digits for the full year. We remain very happy with the performance of our merchandise business through the first half of the year and we look for volumes to be supported by continued strength in automotive, minerals and metals and the successes we have had in the marketplace.\nWe expect full year coal volumes to be higher driven by strong demand for export coal. As we noted last quarter, domestic coal shipments will likely soften as demand is impacted by low natural gas prices. For Intermodal, as Kevin said earlier, we have seen modest signs of improvement for domestic intermodal activity starting late in the second quarter, but there are no signs yet of a near-term recovery for the international business. We are still benefiting from a favorable pricing environment though our expectation for a $300 million decline in supplemental revenue is unchanged, with most of that year-over-year reduction occurring in the second half of the year.\nLower international net coal benchmark prices will also impact our coal revenue per unit over the remainder of the year. As before, we are making our best efforts to drive efficiency and control costs to offset real inflationary pressures and we are committed to staying focused on improving service to our customers. And finally, we still estimate capital expenditures of $2.3 billion with a strong focus on innovation and growth.\nTo sum up, I am proud of the progress of the One CSX team continues to make. There is no doubt that we face some mixed economic conditions in the near term. However, there are so many opportunities opening up for us to win share, expand our markets and achieve profitable growth if we remain focused on safety, service, execution and working together. I am very excited about what is ahead for CSX. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Joe. [Operator Instructions]. Emma, we're ready to start the process."

Today's call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2 followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.\nAnd with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nAll right. Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you all for joining our conference call. Working together, the ONE CSX team delivered a strong first quarter, driven by solid pricing as well as volume growth in our merchandise and coal businesses. With sufficient resources in place, we are able to use the benefits of our scaled railroad model to deliver improvement in our customer service performance that are driving real tangible financial results. Our network is running well, and we intend to do even better and show that CSX can sustain reliable service over time, which is essential for us to profitably grow our railroad. 2023 has already proven to be a very active year. One of our top priorities after the national union agreements were finalized last December was to address the matter of Paid sick leave for our union employees. I am very pleased that CSX demonstrated important leadership here. Starting in February, we were the first U.S. class\n[Audio Gap]\nMore details about the specific proactive steps we have been taking to make CSX safer. I have also been actively involved in discussions with our leaders in Washington and the across states our network about some of the legislation that has recently been proposed. They know that it's better for our economy, our environment and our communities for railroads to move a greater share of the nation's freight.\nThey also know that CSX is eager to be part of solutions that are effective, data-driven and will make our whole industry safer. We do not want safety performance to be a competitive advantage for CSX, but wanting to be something our entire industry is proud of. We have been encouraged by our conversations with senior policy leaders and we'll continue to engage with them in the months ahead, sharing best practices and building on our common ground.\nWe are confident that the industry will emerge in this period stronger, more aligned and better at sharing safety best practices. Now let's turn to our presentation to review the highlights of the first quarter. We moved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generate over $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 9% higher than the previous year. Operating income increased 14% year-over-year to $1.46 billion, and our operating ratio was 60.5%, which includes the OR impact of the quality carrier destruction business, as we've discussed in the past.\nFinally, earnings per share increased 23% to $0.48. When I came to CSX last fall, we were very clear with our intention to build on this company's excellent operating model by strengthening our relationships with our employees and serving our customers better. It is still early but you will hear clear examples of how we are starting to achieve this as Kevin, Jamie and Sean talk about the details, what was a very strong quarter.\nNow let me turn it over to our team.\n\nJamie J. Boychuk\n\nEVP of Operations, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Every quarter, you hear us emphasize the importance of safety on our network. This is a fundamental part of our culture and defines how we execute our operating plan. We didn't take shortcuts, we don't compromise, and we teach this mindset to every 1 of our new hires and continually reemphasize it to all of our employees.\nIn this slide, you will see some of the real proactive steps that we are taking to keep our network running safely. In 2023, we are installing 53 additional hot box detectors across our network. These added detectors will reduce the average spacing from 16.2 miles to 14.9 miles. At CSX, these detectors identify high-bearing temperatures, but also transmit real-time data for trend analysis. So we can not only tell when a bearing is hot and a train needs to stop, but we can also use the data to predict bearings and issues before they reach critical temperatures. We're also continuing to integrate newly hired employees into our safety culture, which begins on day 1. Newly hired employees attend extensive training at our railroad Education and Development Institute in Atlanta.\nThe robust classroom, combined with field-based training gives these new employees the tools they need to operate safely in their new roles. Autonomous track assessment cars, commonly called ATACs, are also used as part of our proactive safety plan. These look and run like regular box cars that are loaded with advanced technology. These cars operate on our regular trains and gather critical inspection data that allow us to closely monitor track conditions. Lastly, we are committed to being supportive partners in the communities in which we live and operate.\nThat is why we dedicate so much effort to developing relationships with first responders in those communities and teaching them how to properly respond to incidents, especially those with hazmat materials. We have a dedicated fleet of railcars, including 4 tank cars that are specifically designed and used to offer multi-day training sessions. This is a program we have run for many years. And in 2022, we trained nearly 4,000 first responders. Turning to the next slide. The FRA personal injury rate ticked down sequentially, while the FRA train accident rate increased slightly. However, both measures are up year-over-year.\nIt's important to consider that because of the success of our recent hiring efforts, we have a higher percentage of newer employees -- as they gain experience and learn from federal railroaders, we are confident that the frequency of these incidents will decline. Now turning to Slide 9. Operating performance has improved significantly. With the appropriate resources in place, we are doing what we do best, effectively executing our operating plan. The team's ability to deliver these operating results is a true testament to the tough and hard work that we are doing as an operating team and a plan that shows no other than what we can do here at CSX.\nMost importantly, the dedication that's given by all of our railroaders. I cannot thank our operating employees enough for overcoming the resource challenges and delivering such solid performance for our customers. Carload trip performance of 86% reached an all-time record level this quarter. while intermodal trip plan performance of 96% matched a record high, while the team is pleased with these results, we'll keep improving. In fact, both measures have continued to improve sequentially into the second quarter. I'm happy with the compliments and support we have received from customers regulators and shareholders on our service improvement, but we are not done yet. As Joe said, our goal is to keep improving our service and show that we can sustain this over time so that we can drive long-term growth for CSX. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss the top line results.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, CSX Corp.\n\nThank you, Jamie. We are very pleased with our merchandise performance this quarter. Revenue increased 13%, benefiting from an 8% increase in revenue per unit and a 4% increase in volume. We are seeing some encouraging signs as customers start to respond to our improved service and reduced cycle times. The team is focused on combining best-in-class service with creative solutions to identify new growth opportunities and gain wallet share with existing customers. While we did see positive growth in automotive, customer production issues impacted volumes in the quarter.\nOn the positive side, we see production issues moderating and expect a strong outlook for automotive volumes through the remainder of the year. Minerals and Metals both outperformed, driven largely by very strong aggregates in steel demand. Pricing was up year-over-year as we benefited from favorable contract repricing and higher fuel surcharge. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to see benefits from a supportive pricing environment and improved rail service. While the economic outlook remains uncertain, we continue to see positive momentum in many of our merchandise segments as the team focuses on the growth drivers that we can control.\nIt's still early but we are encouraged by our ability to convert improved service into new business wins in segments such as auto, minerals and food products. There remains a significant opportunity to win share from truck across our merchandise portfolio. Turning to Slide 12. First quarter coal revenue increased 19% on 19% higher volume and flat revenue per unit. Export volumes were strong as we leverage improved cycle times and improved production and performance at the origin mines. We also benefited as we lap the effects of reduced capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal.\nOur domestic shipments also improved on utility restocking demand and improved rail capacity. International met coal benchmarks remained strong over the quarter and now sits just below $300 per metric ton, which continues to support strong production levels. Looking ahead, the international coal market continues to be supported by healthy commodity prices that should drive positive year-over-year volume growth through the remainder of the year. While the domestic market could face a more challenging backdrop should natural gas prices remain low.\nTurning to intermodal on Slide 13. First quarter revenue decreased by 5% as a 9% decrease in volume more than offset a 5% increase in revenue per unit. Most of this volume decline was due to weakness in international intermodal markets, which, as we expected, have been heavily affected by slowing import activity as demand softened and retail inventories remained elevated. Looking forward, while the intermodal market currently remains challenged, we do expect second half year-over-year headwinds to moderate. The team has a number of initiatives underway to continue to drive truck conversion by introducing new lanes of service where there is market demand.\nNow finally, turning to Slide 14. Many of you are aware of the major market shift developing over the last few years as more companies look to diversify their supply chain and bring capacity closer to their key end markets. We have been encouraged by the acceleration in activity with manufacturers of all times, announcing plans and committing capital to build capacity in the Eastern U.S.\nFor CSX, this represents a great opportunity. Our network connects the major population centers of the Northeast with the fast-growing areas of the Southeast that are highly attractive for companies looking to expand. The mission of our industrial development team is to partner with these companies and provide them with a rail serve location where they can leverage the benefits of the CSX network and industry-leading service. We continue to invest in our select site program that has expanded to include a wider range of rail serve site opportunities.\nCombined with new technology enhancements, this will allow us to capture industrial projects of all sizes by offering shovel-ready development sites with access to CSX network. As you can see on the slide, we are excited about the success we are seeing. In 2022 alone, our customer partners brought nearly 90 new facilities online, representing $8.2 billion of total investment across our network and on our short line partners. The map shows how broadly these in-service projects stretch across our service area. Our pipeline remains robust with over 500 projects in process across our entire industrial development pipeline, and we're adding to this total each month.\nOver time, we expect the new business that these projects represent to be a key driver to our growth algorithm as we help our partners bring in an increasing number of expansion projects onto our network, driving volumes and revenue higher. I would like to thank the entire team for all of their efforts across our growth initiatives. We're very excited about the momentum we are building and the engagement as we partner with our customers to grow together. Now I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the first quarter results, revenue increased 9% or $300 million on merchandise and coal volume growth, strong pricing and higher fuel recovery. Operating income was up 14% to $1.5 billion as top line growth outpaced several expense headwinds, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slide. Interest and other expense was $7 million higher compared to the prior year and income tax expense increased by $47 million on higher pretax earnings. Net earnings increased 15% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 23%. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses.\nTotal first quarter expense increased $111 million compared to the prior year. This includes about $65 million of inflation headwinds as well as an $85 million impact from higher fuel and depreciation combined with lower real estate gains. Now turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $31 million as the impacts of additional head count and inflation were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. PS&O expense increased $13 million primarily due to inflation, the inclusion of Pan Am operations and scheduled locomotive overhauls.\nThese impacts were partially offset by a $46 million benefit due to an insurance recovery arising from a customer facility outage several years ago as well as lower intermodal costs as congestion eases. There were also several smaller line item impacts within PS&O that were greater than expected this quarter and should improve sequentially. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study as well as a larger asset base. And fuel expense also increased by $33 million due to a higher gallon price and a 3% increase in gross ton miles.\nEquipment and rents improved by $18 million, benefiting from increased fluidity and faster car higher days per load across all markets. Property gains were $19 million unfavorable in the quarter due primarily to lapping prior year gains from the Virginia real estate transaction. Network and congestion related savings were evident within rents and across intermodal terminal expenses this quarter, and we expect sustained network performance to drive further efficiency savings through the year.\nNow turning to cash flow on Slide 18. CSX generated over $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter. reflecting the impact of cash payments for retroactive wages and bonuses paid to union employees. Adding back these payments, free cash flow would have been up slightly versus last year despite higher investments in the business. You'll also recall that CSX has introduced a measure of economic profit called CSX Cash earnings, or CCE, within our long-term incentive compensation. It benefits both our shareholders and the general public when we grow profitably by encouraging the conversion of freight off the highway.\nAnd CCE is aligned with this shared interest by encouraging disciplined high-return capital investments. The calculation can be seen in the appendix. And through Q1, CCE is up $165 million versus the prior year. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter, including close to $1.1 billion of share repurchases and over $200 million in dividends. Looking forward, we will remain balanced and opportunistic in our approach to returning excess cash to our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Operations, Ford Motor Co.\n\nThank you. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023, as shown on Slide 20. First, as you heard Kevin describe, we are very pleased with the performance we have seen year-to-date from our merchandise business. Strong demand for grains, metals, Minerals and Automotive, combined with significant new customer wins give us increasing confidence that we will be able to deliver solid volume growth for the year in merchandise. We're also off to a strong start to the year for coal, and we expect continued benefit from healthy export demand, both thermal and met. Our merchandise and coal have met or exceeded our expectations. Intermodal volumes have been below what we anticipated.\nWe knew the intermodal -- sorry, we knew the international intermodal activity will be down substantially over the first half of the year. And though parts of our domestic business are doing very well, has not been enough to offset the effect of lower imports and elevated inventory.\nAltogether, Intermodal contributes less than 1/3 of our revenues, but it does contribute roughly half of our volume and was a drag on our total volume over the quarter. The softer intermodal performance will make it difficult for our total CSX volume to meet our previous guidance and grow faster than GDP, especially as consensus GDP estimates for 2023 have moved up and are currently at 1.1%. That said, the effect on our business mix is favorable. Revenue ton miles grew by a solid 4% in the first quarter, driven by the strength in merchandise and export coal and we expect revenue ton miles to grow solidly in the low single digits for the full year. The rest of our outlook is consistent with what we told you at the beginning of the year.\nWe continue to benefit from the favorable pricing environment with customer negotiations supported by our transparency on costs and our improved service products. We still expect supplemental revenues to decline by roughly $300 million compared to last year, with much of that decline in run rate already in [indiscernible] in the first quarter. International met coal benchmarks remained very strong over the quarter and spot prices are just below $300 per tonne today, but year-over-year comparisons will get tougher from here. We will continue our efforts to drive higher efficiency and reduce excess costs to counter the inflationary effects in our labor and other operating costs as best we can. So -- the best way for us to support our margin performance will be to drive more merchandise volume and benefit from the powerful operating leverage potential of our network.\nLastly, we still estimate cash flow expenditures at $2.3 billion. In closing, I am very encouraged by what we accomplished in this quarter. I'm energized to see the ONE CSX culture start to take shape across this company. Every industry has challenges, but ours are addressable and solvable, and I am confident that they are far outweighed by the opportunities that we have ahead. As I said before, all of us here at every location across our network share a common goal of providing the safe, reliable service to our customers that drives profitable growth, and we are taking meaningful steps towards that goal. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Joe. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions."

My name is Lisa, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Before beginning, the company would like to remind you that the forward-looking disclosures have been provided on Slide 2, and non-GAAP disclosures are on Slide 3.\nI would now like to turn the call over to CSX President and CEO, Joe Hinrichs. You may begin your call.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call. I'm here with Kevin Boone, Jamie Boychuk and Sean Pelkey, and we are excited to update you on our quarter results and share our initial views on the upcoming year.\nI first want to thank all our CSX employees for dedication as they work diligently on behalf of our customers through all the challenges and uncertainties that we faced in 2022. Because of their efforts, our network has continued to run safely and our financial performance has been very strong. We have accomplished a lot over the last 4 months since I joined the company. This inventory (inaudible) railroads out in the field, visit to our customers, our investors and our many partners in the government, we finalized agreements with our labor unions. We reached a positive solution for the Gulf Coast with our colleagues at Amtrak. And we started to make updates to the nuts and bolts policies on attendance and make a big difference for our employees' quality of life.\nI am particularly proud to report that our service metrics continue to show real improvement into the fourth quarter after starting a clear upward trend in the early fall. And we are very pleased this progress has continued throughout this month. As we anticipated, our hiring successes have allowed us to deliver better customer service that will allow us to capture more business with more volume over time.\nLooking forward, we are focused on building on our momentum, leveraging our industry-leading operating model and growing this railroad. As we go through the details and answer your questions, I believe that you will get a great sense of the energy and optimism that we all share across the organization of the opportunities ahead for CSX.\nNow let's turn to our presentation to review the highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year. CSX generated over $3.7 billion in revenue, up 9% from the previous year on 1.5 million carloads in the quarter. Revenues benefited from higher fuel surcharges, strong core pricing and higher storage and other revenue. Operating income increased 7% year-over-year to $1.46 billion and our operating ratio was 60.9%.\nAs we've reminded you before, our quality carriers trucking business adds roughly 250 basis points to our OR. Earnings per share increased 17% to $0.49. Quickly looking at the full year 2022, our revenues of nearly $15 billion were up almost 20% compared to 2021. Our full year operating income of $6 billion increased 8%. Excluding the gains from the 2021 real estate transaction with the Commonwealth of Virginia, our operating income grew in line with our guidance for double-digit growth. Operating ratio was 59.5% for 2022. Finally, earnings per share increased 16% in 2022 to $1.95. Now let me turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe. Turning to Slide 7. Merchandise revenue increased 7% in the quarter, as a 9% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 2% decline in volume. For the full year, merchandise revenue increased 9% on 1% lower volume. 2022 merchandise growth was driven by higher fuel surcharge combined with an increasing pricing environment as inflation accelerated through the year.\nLooking forward to 2023, we have significant network momentum as we began the year, and we expect to leverage industry-leading service into growth opportunities with our customers. This is reflected in our recent customer surveys where we have seen a significant improvement in overall customer satisfaction scores. We see opportunity for solid volume growth in merchandise for the year, led by continued strength in automotive, our growing export plastics business and share gains as customers respond to our improving service. This growth is likely to be partially offset by weaker housing-related and domestic chemical shipments as we start the year.\nOn Slide 8, you can see fourth quarter coal revenue increase 20% on 9% higher volume and a 9% increase in revenue per unit. Full year revenue increased 36% on 1% lower volume and a 38% increase in revenue per unit. In 2023, we expect export coal volumes to grow in both met and the thermal markets. So we do expect benchmark indexes to decline from the elevated averages of 2022. We're optimistic about the potential positive demand impact of China's reopening. While on the supply side, we have a new 4 million ton met coal mine coming online this year. We also anticipate volume opportunity as we lap 2022 issues, including reduced production at some CSX-served mines and capacity limitations at the Curtis Bay and Mobile export terminals. We expect domestic volumes to be low -- be driven by low thermal stockpiles that remain below historical averages.\nHealthy inventory levels will allow utilities to better respond to natural gas volatility and more readily dispatch capacity to reduce stress on the U.S. power grid. U.S. steel production, which drives domestic coal consumption to benefit from a recovery in the automotive industry as well as higher infrastructure demand.\nNow turning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter intermodal revenue increased 4% as a 9% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 5% decline in volumes. For the full year, revenue increased 13% on flat volumes due to a 14% increase in revenue per unit. International intermodal markets continue to be negatively impacted by slowing activity, which looks likely to continue into the first half of 2023. Imports have declined and warehouses have seen elevated inventory levels.\nTo help counter this, we are pursuing several initiatives to bring new solutions to our customers to help them reach new and existing markets. With our domestic intermodal business, we see opportunities even as the trucking market has softened. The team is focused on accelerating truck-to-rail conversions and now with equipment constraints largely behind us, the team has more opportunity to pursue these initiatives. We are seeing existing customers and those that are new to intermodal adopt strategies to drive more of their transportation spend to rail. The team is doing a great job of identifying these opportunities and building the relationships to drive this growth.\nFinally, moving to Slide 10. Let's discuss CSX's role in reducing our customers' emissions. As we pursue truck-to-rail conversions across the markets we serve, we are actively promoting rail's environmental advantages to our customers. We are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their own emissions. These are board level initiatives for our customers and the opportunity to choose rail over trucks provides real, measurable savings across the entire supply chain.\nIn 2022, CSX customers avoided emitting 10 million tons of carbon dioxide by choosing to ship with CSX versus truck. We continue providing an emissions advantages for our customers, we need to keep innovating. We are not only piloting new technologies that should provide fuel savings like 0 to 0, but we are exploring emerging technologies that can be implemented in the future and keep CSX at the forefront of delivering best-in-class efficiencies.\nProviding visibility to our customers is also a priority. I'm excited about the additional insights we will provide to customers to help them identify and convert incremental freight to by utilizing our updated carbon calculator platform that will launch in the first quarter.\nLastly, we are proud of the recognition CSX has received for our sustainability efforts, with several of our awards listed on this slide. It is a priority for us to remain an industry leader in environmental stewardship, and we look forward to sharing more details on the several projects we have underway throughout the year.\nNow let me turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations.\n\nJamie J. Boychuk\n\nEVP of Operations, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Safety remains our top priority at CSX and has been the foundation for our service restoration. As shown on this slide, a personal injury frequency index was flat from the third quarter and unchanged for the full year. FRA train accident rate increased from the third quarter but improved versus the prior year. Most importantly, for the second year in a row, we ended the year without a life-changing event. These results were delivered with onboarding over 2,000 new conductors during the year and underscores the safety culture that runs deep within our One CSX workforce.\nNow hires learned the importance of operating safely in the classroom, but the most impactful lessons occurred day in and day out on locomotives and in terminals working with more experienced employees. These daily interactions are reflected in our recent safety performance and emphasize the commitment to our operating safely at CSX. I would like to recognize the over 6,200 employees within CSX's engineering department, which set a record for the lowest number of train accidents in the department history. This is a true accomplishment, given the nature of their ballast-level work. In the year ahead, we will continue to instill the safety culture within our new hires, maintain that culture in our experienced employees and focus on the training and discipline we need to reduce human factor incidents.\nMoving to the next slide. You can see the success that our entire team has had in driving meaningful service improvement with a clear trend emerging around the middle of the third quarter as staffing levels at many of our locations reached a key thresholds. Even with the temporary hit from the weather towards the end of the year, average velocity was up 11% sequentially in the fourth quarter -- was down 13%, and triplane compliance improved by several percentage points for both intermodal and carload.\nThis progress has not stopped as we crossed into 2023 with our service metrics continuing to trend towards pre-pandemic high water levels of late 2019 and early 2020. Our team is focused on improving network fluidity and delivering a consistent, reliable service that will encourage our customers to shift business onto our network and the data shows that we are well on our way.\nNow turning to hiring. A robust training pipeline in over 350 conductor promotions over the fourth quarter allow the team to achieve our long-stated goal of 7,000 active T&E employees. Getting our resources to this level has driven the service momentum Joe discussed a few minutes ago, we will continue to support improved service into 2023. Going forward, we expect to stabilize active T&E headcount with targeted hiring continuing for key locations and to offset attrition. I will turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Looking at fourth quarter financial results, revenue increased 9% and operating income increased 7% to $1.5 billion as top line gain outpaced several expense headwinds and that I will discuss in more detail on the next slide.\nInterest and other expense was $6 million favorable compared to the prior year and income tax expense increased by $15 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9% as a result of favorable adjustments to deferred state taxes. Our expected tax rate going forward continues to be 24.5%. Fourth quarter net earnings increased 9% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 17%. Full year 2022 results were highlighted by top line growth of 19%. Operating income was up 8%, which includes a 4-point impact from the Virginia real estate transaction, resulting in 12% growth when adjusting for these gains.\nLet's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expense. Total fourth quarter expense increased $210 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher fuel costs and inflation. Fuel expense was the most significant driver of $129 million due to higher prices. Labor and fringe expense increased $23 million as the impacts of additional headcount and wage inflation were partially offset by lower incentive compensation. PS&O increased $54 million, primarily due to higher operating support and terminal costs, which will remain somewhat elevated near term as operations continue to improve.\nPS&O inflation is also running around 5% and the quarter included about $10 million of expense from obsolete inventory and technology write-offs. Depreciation increased by $33 million in the quarter, which includes an ongoing quarterly impact of about $20 million related to the completion of a periodic equipment study. As a result of this study and a higher net asset base, full year depreciation expense will be up approximately $100 million in 2023. Equipment and rents was relatively flat versus the prior year and gains on property dispositions increased $31 million.\nWhile we are always looking for opportunities to leverage excess real estate, we'll likely have a few small gains. We aren't expecting any significant sales activity in 2023 at this point. Overall, congestion-related expenses were slightly above $30 million in the fourth quarter, and part of that cost was incurred during winter storms at the end of the period. Despite elevated inflation and increased headcount, we expect to deliver strong cost efficiency throughout 2023, as better fluidity reduces terminal costs, overtime pay and other expenses.\nNow turning to cash flow on Slide 18. Full year free cash flow of $3.7 billion decreased $100 million but was approximately $100 million above prior year results adjusting for the Virginia transaction. Operating cash flow increased over $500 million on higher earnings, more than offsetting approximately $350 million of additional capital spend from our continued focus on both investing for the long-term reliability of our network, as well as identifying and executing high-return strategic projects. After fully funding capital needs, we returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders in 2022, including over $4.7 billion of share repurchases and $850 million in dividends.\nWe exited the year with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, including $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments. Looking forward, we remain committed to a balanced and opportunistic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Sean. Before we discuss our outlook, I want to briefly touch on a couple of key ideas that we think about the ONE CSX concept and how it fits together with the fundamentals of scale railroading at the core of this company. This past year has seen a lot of commentary from many different parties about what scale railroading is and how it's supposed to work. For us, it really is quite simple operating philosophy based on the 5 principles that you see across the top of Slide 20.\nThe key, just as it is with the railroad network, is to keep everything in balance, optimize your assets and ensure you show respect for your employees; be disciplined in cost control; and maintain your client to good service. If you can't service your customers well and reliably, all the cost control in the world won't deliver a healthy growing business.\nCSX has been tremendously successful over the last several years as the company has undergone its transformation. In my view, we've done particularly well across the first 3 of these scale railroading principles. The opportunity for us now is to focus on getting to even better balance with those last 2. We will redouble our efforts in serving our customers and ensuring that our employees, the people who are delivering that service to our customers, feel valued, appreciated and included. To address this and bring out the best of this operating model can deliver, we are building a One CSX culture that prioritizes our relationships and leverages our common goals.\nWhether you are an employee, a customer or a shareholder, you want a strong and thriving CSX. A healthy culture leverages that alignment to do better together. Under each heading, you will see a couple of the ways we have brought these principles to life over the last year. At the bottom, we give examples of what we aim to do. As an example, for customer service, we have added the T&E resources we have needed to increase capacity, and we have built resilient momentum as our service measures have improved.\nNow looking forward, it is critical that we ensure that our service metrics reflect our customer experience and that we are measuring and evaluating ourselves in the right way. We also know that we have to improve the way that we interface with our customers and make it easier to do business with us if we are going to win market share from trucks. Every week, we get together as a leadership team. We are challenging ourselves to find new ways to address these issues and take advantage of the great energy that we are creating here at CSX.\nWe have tremendous talent here. And with these principles at our road map, we have a clear, collective goal. Now let's conclude with a review of our outlook for '23 as shown on Slide 21. First, as our service levels keep improving, we expect to achieve overall volume growth for the year, which will outpace real GDP growth, driven largely by strong contributions from merchandise and coal, as Kevin discussed. That said, we do believe that international intermodal volume is likely to be soft, particularly over the first half of the year, as imports have slowed and retailer inventory levels have recovered.\nNext, the pricing environment remains favorable for us. Our customers have experienced substantial inflation and understand that we face our own cost pressures, including the effects of the recent labor agreements. This transparency has helped us as we renew our pricing agreements, which will support our top line performance. That said, there are a couple of important things to note for 2023: first, we do expect revenues from intermodal storage to decline through the year as supply chain conditions improved. We currently believe it is reasonable to expect we will see a reduction of approximately $300 million in intermodal storage revenue compared to last year, which would imply a quarterly average close to levels seen in early 2021. Second, international met coal benchmarks have recovered from their lows of last fall, but remained volatile. High quality Australia met coal averaged roughly $355 in 2022 and sits at $315 today. It is likely at the average this year will be lower year-over-year, which will impact our coal RPU and our total revenue. Now regarding profitability, we will face cost better in 2023, but we know that we can get better operationally. Where it is possible and where it makes sense, we will make every effort to realize efficiency gains and reduce some of the extra costs that we have been carrying demand through the congestion and resource constraints of that post pandemic period.\nIn the end, our margin performance will largely depend on our success in driving more volume through our network and realizing potential operating leverage. Finally, we estimate that our capital expenditures will increase to approximately $2.3 billion, driven by a full year of spending for PNM, additional equipment for quality carriers structure real conversion opportunities, investing in strategic high-return growth projects and the effects of inflation.\nNow before we close, I want to emphasize what an exciting time it is for all of us to be a part of the ONE CSX team. We have a common goal to properly grow this railroad and you are seeing the real progress that we are making towards that goal as we put people and resources into place. I am personally very optimistic about the opportunities ahead, and I look forward to updating you on the achievements throughout the year.\nThank you. And with that, we will now take your questions."

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter call.\nJoining me on today's call are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Foote, our outgoing President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn our earnings presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.\nAnd with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joe Hinrichs.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call.\nI'm excited to be here with you today on my first earnings call as President and CEO of CSX. The entire CSX leadership team is here with me this afternoon, and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss our strong third quarter results with you.\nOur whole team is very motivated to build on our current momentum, strengthen our key relationships, provide better service to our customers and deliver profitable growth for years to come. We will achieve this through our ONE CSX culture, which at its core means one team working together to serve all our key stakeholders.\nAs Matthew mentioned, also joining us on tonight's call is Jim Foote, who as you all know, led this company through its remarkable -- remarkably successful transformation over these last 5 years. Jim cares deeply about this railroad and its employees, and he has already been a great resource during my first several weeks in this role. I'll be happy to have his invaluable advice in the months ahead, and I want to thank him for all the help you have given me personally as I get the privilege to follow him.\nJim, on behalf of everyone here at CSX, thank you.\n\nJames M. Foote\n\nAdvisor, CSX Corporation\n\nThanks, Joe.\nAs I have said on every earnings call since I took over as CEO 5 years ago, I am incredibly proud of every CSX employee who has been by my side as we transformed this organization into the best railroad in North America. A company that's safer, more efficient, more profitable and far more successful than when we started. I have the utmost confidence that Joe and this team will take this organization to even higher levels of success.\nThis transition process has been underway for a long time. It was critically important that the Board and I ensure that a succession plan was in place when the right time came. Having seen CSX through the initial phases of our transformation, pass some unusual, to say the least, challenges, and now with our operating performance starting to get back to normal, it's the right time for me to step away.\nJoe is a great guy. He is very talented, and he brings a tremendous amount of operations experience in running a large, complicated industrial company. His years working with a diverse unionized workforce will clearly serve him very well.\nIt's truly been an honor to serve as President and CEO of CSX, and I wish all of you and everyone connected to this railroad the best.\nAnd now back to Joe.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nThanks, Jim. I promise you this team won't let you down.\nI am honored to be here on behalf of the entire CSX team. I've spent the last month traveling all across the network, visiting our facilities and meeting with our customers, our employees, union leaders, regulatory partners and government officials. At this point, I can tell you 2 things for certain.\nFirst, this is a fantastic railroad. Our people and our infrastructure are second to none. And the principles of scheduled railroading that drive our successful, resilient operating model are deeply embedded throughout the company. I knew that CSX was a very impressive place when I started, did not appreciate how impressive it really is until I saw for myself how this team of skilled, dedicated men and women work together to move thousands of box cars and containers for our customers each and every day.\nSecond, for as much as this company has achieved over its transformation during the last several years, there is still so much more that CSX can do. Rail is a low-cost freight solution. Rail is a freight solution with low emissions. Manufacturing investment in the United States is accelerating. We have great advantages in this market, and our customers should have every reason to ship more by CSX rail, but we have to focus our efforts to make this happen. We have to make it easier for our customers to use our service. We have to provide better service to our customers. We have to engage with all of our employees, especially those out in the field serving our customers every day to ensure that we deliver the reliability that we promise. And we have to challenge ourselves to nurture the kind of culture that fosters a nimble, creative and market-leading company while staying true to the operational discipline that makes this all possible.\nThe concept of ONE CSX as one team working together to accomplish great things can be very powerful. We have to bring ONE CSX to life. We'll talk more about that in a few minutes. But now let's turn to our presentation to review the financial highlights for the third quarter of 2022.\nCSX moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the third quarter and generated approximately $3.9 billion in revenue. Operating income increased 10% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, which includes the effect of additional labor and fringe expense related to the tentative agreements reached with our unions last month. Results this quarter also reflected lower real estate gains compared to last year. Earnings per share increased 21% to $0.52 a share. Our operating ratio for the quarter was 59.5%.\nNow let me turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for the details.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Joe.\nTurning to Slide 5. Third quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year, with revenue growth across all markets. Overall volumes were up 2% as modest volume growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offset a minor decline in coal.\nMerchandise revenue increased 14% on 1% higher volumes, driven by pricing that reflects rising cost inflation and higher fuel surcharge revenue.\nWe saw strength in the automotive market, where revenues rose 31% on 13% higher volume. Semiconductor challenges continue to ease and we see significant finished vehicle inventory that needs to move. Ag and food was also a bright spot as improving cycle times as well as stronger demand for grain, wheat and ethanol resulted in revenue growth of 25% on 10% higher volume in the quarter.\nFertilizers and metals and equipment both saw modest revenue growth despite volume declines in the quarter. Fertilizer shipments continue to be impacted by reduced phosphate shipments and production facility turnarounds. Lower metals and equipment shipments reflect volatile commodity pricing and mill maintenance outages.\nIntermodal revenue increased 19% on 2% higher volume, as yields remained strong and supported by high fuel prices. International shipments were partially offset by lower domestic volumes, which reflected tight equipment availability and softer truck market. Intermodal demand remained strong in the quarter, with the team continuing to collaborate with customers and identify new opportunities including a new international service line that contributed to growth. Customers continue to recognize our industry-leading service products in a challenging market as they seek lower cost and lower emission alternatives to truck.\nCoal revenue increased 36% on 2% lower volume as pricing continues to benefit from strong export benchmarks. Volumes remain limited in the quarter due to production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the export terminals and general manpower shortages, though our crew availability did show improvement into the end of the quarter.\nWe were also able to reopen portions of our Curtis Bay terminal in September, which provides additional volume opportunities as operations normalize. Demand remains strong and we see opportunities to move more volume as some of these constraints ease.\nTrucking revenue increased 26%, mainly due to strong core pricing and higher fuel recovery. Other revenue increased largely due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage fees. The strong sequential increase was driven by continued limited warehouse capacity at customer sites.\nLooking forward, there is obvious macroeconomic uncertainty as the Fed remains committed to raising rates and addressing high inflation. Given this backdrop, the team is highly focused on its efforts to drive strategic growth opportunities that target truck and expand CSX's addressable market.\nAs you've seen, our select site program continues to facilitate new customer partnerships. Last month, a key emerging domestic lithium supplier for the EV and battery markets announced the construction of a $600 million refining and manufacturing facility on a CSX serve site in Tennessee. We also have several other potential projects in various stages of development. We continue to see customers investing in new projects across our network.\nWe're also moving forward with efforts to facilitate ESG solutions for our customers. Before year-end, we will be releasing an updated version of our carbon calculator that is integrated within our ShipCSX interface. This new calculator will enable customers to drive into much deeper detail and understand in real time the environmental benefits that CSX rail can provide.\nFinally, we are also encouraged that service performance is on an upward trend, and we expect to turn this positive momentum into additional opportunities with customers.\nI will now turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations.\n\nJamie J. Boychuk\n\nEVP of Operations, CSX Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin.\nSafety remains our top priority at CSX and operating safely is the foundation to our service restoration efforts. In the third quarter, our personal injury rate and train accident rate decreased sequentially. Though we are not satisfied with our performance, I'm encouraged by our success, especially given the number of new employees across the network.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, it is critically important to instill a culture of safety in our new T&E employees from day 1. That emphasis on safety does not end when new employees graduate from training. It requires continuous attention throughout every railroader's career. To reinforce this, we are actively engaging with new hires and all of our employees in the field to discuss recent injuries and accidents to ensure that we take each opportunity to learn from each other.\nIn the fourth quarter, our efforts will continue to focus on making sure our employees are protected from incidents that commonly occur as weather changes. Increased education and awareness of seasonal safety risks will help our team become safer.\nTurning to Slide 7. We are encouraged by the recent improvement in our operational performance. These strong results are a testament to the ONE CSX team and their unrelenting devotion to serving our customers. If we only look at the third quarter averages, train velocity, dwell and carload trip plan performance all showed a deterioration versus the prior year, though intermodal trip plan compliance continued to improve 240 basis points. However, the right side of each chart of this slide shows the substantial improvements we have made throughout the quarter and continue into recent weeks.\nAs shown here, in the most recent full week performance, all of these 4 key operational measures are above the averages for the third quarter 2022. But they're also ahead of third quarter 2021 performance. We are confident that these metrics show that our efforts to hire, train and retain new employees are starting to take hold and make a difference for our customers.\nThough we are encouraged by the operational momentum, we will not let up. We will continue to push forward and take actions necessary until service is fully restored to a level that our customers expect. We are promoting new conductors, allocating the appropriate number of assets and improving the overall reliability and operational resilience of our network.\nTurning to Slide 8. In the third quarter, active T&E headcount reached the highest level since March 2020. Though the quarterly average shows a sequential increase of less than 100 employees, we exited the quarter with over 6,800 total. The hiring pipeline remains robust, and we averaged over 500 trainees again in the third quarter. We are determined to keep the pipeline full, allowing us to continue filling classes as we work towards our goal of 7,000 active T&E employees by year-end.\nCurrently, we have over 700 employees in training and have additionally started locomotive engineer training. The number of conductors that finished training and marched up was down slightly in the third quarter as we cycled lower class sizes from earlier in the year. We anticipate this number to increase in the fourth quarter as the class sizes have remained elevated through the late spring and summer months.\nConductor promotions will continue to increase the active T&E headcount. Our efforts to minimize attrition that we highlighted in the last quarter are bearing fruit. New hire attrition in the preceding months have trended lower, and we believe our hiring initiatives and recent pay agreements for new conductors are a contributing factor.\nI will now hand it over to Sean to review the financial results.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good afternoon.\nThe favorable operating momentum Jamie discussed was accompanied by strong revenue growth of 18% or $600 million, including gains across all markets. Operating income was up 10% to $1.6 billion as topline gains outpaced expense headwinds from higher fuel costs, inflation, and tentative union agreement impacts that I will discuss in more detail on the next slide.\nThe operating ratio was 59.5%, which, as a reminder, includes roughly a 250 basis point ongoing impact from quality carriers. Interest and other expense was roughly flat as was income tax expense. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9%, lower than our statutory rate as a result of a favorable state legislative change. As such, net earnings of $1.1 billion was up 15%, with EPS up 21%.\nNow let's take a closer look at expense on the next slide. Total third quarter expense increased $460 million versus the prior year. Fuel was up nearly $200 million, primarily due to higher prices. Inflation remains above historical levels with $82 million of inflation across labor, PS and owing rents. Labor inflation alone was around $50 million, which reflects the proposed wage rate increase from the tentative union agreements.\nIn addition, we recorded $42 million of out-of-period expenses related to adjusting union labor accruals for the tentative agreements. The most significant piece of this is the impact of the proposed union bonuses. When you think about labor expense going forward, the $42 million is a net catch-up and will not recur. The base labor per employee, excluding this impact is expected to be the new run rate for Q4 and into the first half of next year. Of course, comp per employee will also be impacted by seasonality mix and other factors, but the full impact of the tentative union agreement is now in our base labor costs.\nNext, Quality and Pan Am combined for $46 million of higher expense with the increase split about evenly between the two. Quality expenses correlate with higher revenues, while Pan Am reflects the first full quarter of CSX ownership. The Pan Am integration process is well underway, and we continue to receive positive customer indications around strong growth opportunities as we invest to increase the speed and reliability of the former Pan Am network.\nReal estate gains were $33 million less than prior year, with volume and all other expenses increasing $66 million. While operating fluidity improved through the quarter, our hiring focus remains, and we incurred approximately $40 million of incremental costs related to T&E training, higher locomotive count, additional intermodal terminal activity and other congestion-related items.\nVolume-related costs and higher depreciation represented the balance of the expense increase. We do expect some of the congestion related expenses to continue into the fourth quarter but view these costs as the first efficiency opportunities to be realized as we achieved sustained improvements in network performance.\nNow turning to cash flow on Slide 11. Year-to-date, free cash flow before dividends is down nearly $30 million but up approximately $120 million when adjusting for after-tax cash proceeds from the Virginia transaction. This is despite close to $225 million of additional capital spend as we continue investing for the health of our network to support the Quality and Pan Am acquisitions and position for future growth.\nAfter funding all the capital needs of the business, shareholder distributions have exceeded $4.3 billion this year, including over $3.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $650 million of dividends. Additionally, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. Looking forward, we expect to maintain our balanced opportunistic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\n\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, Sean.\nNow let's conclude with a review of our outlook as shown on Slide 12. There is no change to our expectation for double-digit revenue and operating growth for the full year, excluding the effects of the Virginia real estate transaction. While there is uncertainty in the global economy, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on this guidance as we look over the remainder of this year.\nAs we mentioned in our earlier remarks, we are pleased with the positive momentum in our service metrics, and we continue our hiring and training efforts to ensure that we have the resources needed to build on these trends and drive improved network fluidity.\nWe remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders, as you saw over this past quarter. And finally, we reiterate our priority to building a unified cohesive culture of ONE CSX that will strengthen the relationships we have with our employees, customers and all other stakeholders. This is a great company. And working together, there is so much more that we can accomplish. And that's why I'm so excited to be here.\nThank you all. I'll now turn it back to Matthew for Q&A."

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2022 CSX Corporation Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, our Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosures.\nAnd with that, it will be my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\n\nJames M. Foote\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Matthew, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.\nI'll start by expressing my thanks to all of CSX's employees for their hard work during another quarter of tough operating conditions. And I am very pleased to welcome everyone from Pan Am who joined the CSX team in June. We look forward to working together to build new single-line service across our combined network.\nOur second quarter results were solid as we continue to benefit from strong customer demand and firm pricing, but our ability to hire and retain new workers, which is vital to improving our service and growing the business, remains challenged. We are not alone in facing this problem. The labor market is tight, prospective recruits have many job options, and the pandemic has had a profound effect on employees' work and lifestyle preferences.\nOur hiring process has been steady but slow. We will not let up in our efforts to grow our engineer and conductor headcount and improve network fluidity to pre-pandemic levels.\nSince the time of our last earnings call, our uncertainty and volatility have clearly increased in the financial markets and in parts of the economy. Inflationary pressures have moved higher and interest rates have risen. We're staying diligent by keeping in close touch with our customers, monitoring our order rates and constantly updating our forecasts.\nBut what remains constant is that right now, as we have seen this entire year, there is more demand for rail service than what we are able to satisfy. The efforts we are making now to grow our workforce and add capacity to our network are not just a status by current demand. We are investing because we see plentiful long-term opportunities for rail, driven by customer demand for more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly transportation options and growth in domestic manufacturing.\nWe're excited about our potential, but to realize it, we must focus on near-term execution. Our entire team is aligned in our goals, and I look forward to keeping you updated in our progress in the quarters ahead.\nTurning to our presentation, let's start with Slide 4, which highlights our second quarter key financial results. We moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the quarter and generated over $3.8 billion in revenue. Operating income was $1.7 billion, which includes a $122 million gain from our Virginia real estates sale. Recall that in the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a much larger $349 million gain from this transaction. Earnings per share increased 4% to $0.54 a share, which also includes a smaller contribution from the Virginia sale compared to a year ago. And our operating ratio was 55.4%, which includes a 320 basis point tailwind from the Virginia real estate gain, but also includes combined headwinds of roughly 450 basis points from the impact of quality carriers, higher fuel prices and Pan Am acquisition costs.\nI'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5.\nSecond quarter revenue increased 28% year-over-year with revenue growth across merchandise, coal and intermodal. Overall volumes were flat, where we saw strong demand across many of our markets, limited by resource constraints across the supply chain. Merchandise revenue increased 10% on flat volume, driven by price and higher fuel surcharge revenue.\nLooking at some of the highlights. We are encouraged by strength in automotive market, where revenues rose 24% on a 10% increase in volume. There are clear signs from auto manufacturers that semiconductor challenges are easing. Our minerals business benefited from improved shipments of aggregates in salt. Our ag and food segment saw growth from ethanol and export grains. Less favorable was our fertilizer business, where volumes and revenues declined year-over-year on reduced phosphate shipments. Volatile fertilizer prices, combined with some production issues, impacted volumes in the quarter. Forest products, along with metals and equipment, saw positive revenue growth, offset by modest declines in volumes, mainly driven by resource constraints.\nIntermodal revenue increased 18% on 1% higher volume as growth in the international business was partially offset by lower domestic shipments, driven by continued equipment challenges through the quarter. Intermodal demand remains strong, and customers continue to recognize our industry-leading service product in a challenged market.\nCoal revenue increased 54% on 3% lower volume. As we have discussed, coal demand remains strong across our domestic and international markets. Volumes have been constrained by production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the port, including Curtis Bay, and general manpower shortages, including crews. We still expect volumes to improve through the year as some of these constraints moderate.\nOther revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage. Although macro uncertainty is clearly elevated as we enter into the second half, we still see positive drivers favoring rail, including environmental benefits as customers prioritize ESG, lack of truck capacity with driver shortages, onshoring of industrial production and inflation that will all benefit our growth opportunities.\nCurrently, we are still seeing demand in many markets limited by the global shortage of labor. We believe this will continue to benefit rail's value proposition and the opportunity to increase mobile share over time. Going forward, we remain committed to making the investments needed to serve our customers and helping them grow their business.\nLet me now turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations.\n\nJamie J. Boychuk\n\nEVP of Operations, CSX Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin.\nSafety remains our top priority at CSX, and operating safely is a critical foundation to achieving any of our operating goals. We work hard to instill a culture of safety across our railroad, and this begins with the moment that our employees enter our training facility. We focus not only on teaching employees the right way to work, but creating an environment that facilitates ongoing coaching and education around our safety protocols.\nThis is particularly important for the almost 700 new T&E employees that have completed training year-to-date. The coaching does not end with the training program. We have created new programs to significantly increase touch points with managers to ensure new employees are protecting both themselves and their fellow railroads. These efforts have helped drive another strong quarter of safety results.\nIn the second quarter, injury rate increased modestly from the near record levels in the first quarter, but remained flat year-over-year. Train accidents ticked up slightly in the prior quarter, but continued their positive trend as we focused on minimizing human factor accidents through proactive employee communications.\nTurning to Slide 7. We remain committed to delivering strong service and we are taking action to improve network performance. We are seeing signs of this improved performance in our local service measures. This is our second consecutive quarter of improved results and our best since exiting the pandemic downturn in 2020. We continue to actively coordinate with customers to further improve these metrics and are encouraged that we are seeing some of the largest improvement in some of the areas that were most challenged entering the year.\nOur intermodal trip plan performance remains strong and crossed back above the 90% threshold this quarter. Looking forward, we continue to focus on keeping terminals open and fluid during the ongoing supply chain constraints.\nWe expect merchandise performance to improve throughout the second half of the year as network fluidity increases. To offset the impact of crew shortages, we have added additional assets to the network to better meet our customer commitments. As employees mark up, we will be able to refine the network plan to reduce congestion, shorten transit times and improve reliability.\nNow turning to Slide 8 and our ongoing hiring initiatives. We continue to have a strong hiring pipeline that averaged over 500 trainees in the second quarter. This pipeline will allow us to continue filling classes as we work towards our headcount targets. For the second consecutive quarter, over 300 conductors qualified and total active T&E increased to nearly 6,700 employees. We expect this number to increase sequentially throughout the second half as our newly qualified more than offset attrition.\nIn addition to focusing on hiring, we are also working to minimize attrition. These initiatives will help us with our new hires throughout the early years of their career, including a recent agreement that will lift the pay for newly qualified conductors. As I said last quarter, this will all take time, but we know that to deliver on service, we must have the right level of resources, and that starts with our people.\nI'll now hand over to Sean to review our financial results.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good afternoon.\nIn the face of these challenging labor market conditions as well as ongoing supply chain issues, CSX delivered over $800 million in revenue growth with gains across all major markets. Expenses were also up over $800 million, and as a result, reported operating income increased 1%. However, as I will explain in more detail on the next slide, costs were heavily impacted by lower real estate gains, the addition of Quality Carriers, and transaction costs and higher fuel. Interest expense was $10 million favorable to the prior year, while other income improved $6 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4%.\nTurning to the next slide. Total costs increased $813 million. Nearly $500 million of the higher expense was due to the inclusion of Quality Carriers, lower gains on property dispositions and Pan Am acquisition costs. Real estate gains were driven by the Virginia transaction, with a $122 million impact this quarter versus $349 million in the prior year. This represents our last significant gain from Virginia, and we expect to receive the remaining $125 million of cash proceeds in the fourth quarter.\nHigher fuel prices were also a significant factor with fuel expense up over $200 million, excluding the Quality impact. Not surprisingly, inflation is running above historical levels. And the $56 million on this slide represents inflation across labor, purchased services and rents. All other expenses increased by $50 million, with approximately $20 million higher depreciation, about $10 million lower incentive compensation expense and nearly $40 million of higher operating costs.\nThis $40 million reflects increased hiring and retention, the impact of a larger active locomotive fleet, intermodal terminal costs from supply chain disruptions, and slower car cycle times. As service levels normalize in the coming quarters, we would expect the opportunity set on the expense side to come first from these operating categories.\nNow turning to cash flow on Slide 11. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow before dividends is down by approximately $125 million, but up about $75 million when adjusting for proceeds from the Virginia transaction in the prior year. Capital spending is up nearly $60 million. And for the full year, we still expect to invest approximately $2 billion in our network. This ensures safety and reliability with roughly 80% of these investments going to the core infrastructure and a growing amount being allocated to strategic and return-based projects.\nAfter fully funding capital demands, year-to-date shareholder returns have exceeded $2.9 billion, including over $2.5 billion in buybacks and over $400 million in dividends. This brings our cash and short-term investment balance down to a more normalized $800 million. And as we go forward, we will remain both balanced and opportunistic in our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\n\nJames M. Foote\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Sean.\nLet's conclude on Slide 12 with our outlook for the year. Having benefited from high export coal prices over the first half of the year and with fuel prices still elevated, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth for the full year. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our customer demand for rail freight remains greater than what we're currently able to supply.\nExport coal benchmarks have moderated over the last couple of months, but our guidance had already anticipated a correction over the second half of the year. Consistent with our commentary all year, we believe that increasing our train and engine employee headcount is the key factor necessary for improved service and network performance, and our hiring efforts will continue. Our aim is still to reach an active transportation headcount of 7,000 as soon as possible.\nAs Sean said, full year capital expenditures are planned at approximately $2 billion, which is also unchanged, as is our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs we stressed last quarter, we are moving forward, but real progress takes time and is often challenging and gradual. There is plenty left to do, but the whole CSX family is committed to delivering on our goals, supporting our customers and growing this company.\nThank you, and I'll turn it back to Matthew.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nThank you, Jim. (Operator Instructions) And with that, operator, we will now take questions."

My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2022 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nMatthew Korn, CSX Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nThank you, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nNow in our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\n\nJames M. Foote\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for again joining us on our call today. I'll begin by expressing my thanks to all of CSX employees, who continue to put in tremendous efforts to serve our customers effectively and above all safely. .\nI'd also like to welcome today Steve Fortune, who's with us in the room here today in Jacksonville. Steve serves in a newly created role of Executive Vice President and Chief Digital and Technology Officer and will focus on harnessing transformative technologies to further growth and enable continued efficiency across the business. His experience leading technology organizations at a global industrial company will be very helpful as we continue to transform CSX.\nNow moving to the quarter. We are pleased with our results this quarter though we're not yet satisfied with our service performance. The effects of COVID and severe weather across much of our network clearly led to a tough start to the year. But as we moved into March, operating conditions began to gradually improve, and we do see indications that this momentum is continuing.\nFor over a year, we have communicated to you that the key to rebuilding our service to pre-pandemic levels is to hire more train and engine service employees. I am pleased to say that our efforts there are progressing well, and our active T&E count has moved steadily higher this year. The people and resources that we are putting in place today will allow us to provide reliable, efficient service to an expanding number of customers.\nThe business environment remains very favorable for CSX despite new uncertainties across global supply chains. We are dedicated to do our part to help our customers here in North America meet increasing demand as business and consumers around the world look for reliable sources of the products that we transport.\nMeanwhile, domestic activity remains robust and our business development and marketing groups are working hard to convert new opportunities. And as higher energy prices and increasing scrutiny on greenhouse gas emissions highlight rail efficiency advantages over trucks, we're in a great position. If we all do our jobs, hold to our principles and deliver the service levels that we know we can achieve, this company has great potential for many years ahead.\nLastly, I'd like to note that we are pleased that the Surface Transportation Board approved our acquisition of Pan Am Railways, which clears the way for the transaction to close this June. All of us are excited about the opportunities that will come as we design new service solutions for shippers and receivers in New England.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4. Turning to the presentation, which highlights our key financial results. We moved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generated over $3.4 billion in revenue. Operating income increased by 16% to $1.28 billion. The operating ratio increased by 150 basis points to 62.4%. But remember, this range includes approximately 250 basis points of impact from Quality Carriers and the impact of higher fuel prices. And earnings per share increased 26% to $0.39 a share.\nI'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 21% year-over-year, with growth across all major lines of business. Merchandise revenue increased 6% on 2% lower volume as strong pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the volume decline.\nCurrent demand remains strong across most merchandise markets, with shippers prioritizing environmental benefits of rail and pursuing lower cost options to offset inflation. The ongoing semiconductor shortage impacted automotive volumes through the quarter. However, we did see sequential improvement as consumer demand remains strong with dealer inventory levels low.\nOur core chemicals franchise saw strong demand that more than offset continued challenges and energy-related chemical markets. As we continue to add resources across network, we expect to capture additional opportunities.\nIntermodal revenue increased 13% on 1% lower volumes as truck conversions drove domestic growth, offsetting declines in the international market that continues to be impacted by supply side constraints. Intermodal demand remains strong, but continues to be challenged by takeaway capacity and equipment shortages, including chassis.\nCoal revenue increased 39% on 10% lower volume. Export coal's revenue increase was driven by higher benchmark prices, partially offset by lower domestic and international thermal coal shipments. First quarter coal volumes were impacted by several factors, including disruptions and an outage at our Curtis Bay export facility. Demand across all of our coal markets remain strong, and we expect volumes to improve in the second quarter as some of these headwinds subside and additional network capacity is added.\nOther revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage but was partially offset by lower payments from customers that did not meet volume commitments. As we exit the quarter, concerns around the Omicron variant have been replaced by broader global supply chain uncertainty in the wake of the crisis in Ukraine. As Jim mentioned, we are committed to helping our customers.\nIn North America, meet the increasing demand for their products from consumers around the world. We are working closely with our customers to understand the potential shifts in the global supply chain. And while it is early, we see opportunities that could benefit our network and the ports we serve. As we look across many of our markets, demand continues to outstrip supply. We expect this to improve as resources are added across the supply chain.\nNow turning to Slide 6, I would like to provide more detail on CSX's business development capabilities, which I briefly discussed last quarter. CSX has an experienced team of business development professionals to help existing and prospective customers identify, design and build facilities across the network. This team works closely with state and locally economic developers to maximize investment incentives that will encourage more business to locate on CSX and our short line partners.\nThese efforts continue to pay off. In 2021, over 90 new facilities and expansion projects were placed into service across our network, which represents over $3 billion of customer investment. Additionally, there are over 500 projects currently in an industrial pipeline. We are excited to work with these customers and provide them with efficient and reliable rail service that will enable them to grow the business for years while creating significant long-term value for CSX shareholders.\nMost recently, VinFast, the electric vehicle subsidiary of the large Asian Conglomerate Ben Group, announced that they will build a $4 billion electric vehicle assembly plant and battery manufacturing facility served exclusively by CSX. The team is proud to be part of North Carolina's first car plant and the largest economic development announcement in the state's history. This announcement is an excellent example of the customer solutions that the team can deliver as sales and marketing works closely with operators.\nThe team is working diligently to direct even more customers to CSX through our Select Site program. CSX select sites feature nearly 10,000 acres, a premium certified rail-served sites to full-scale industrial development and expansion. We are working to add even more sites to this program in 2022.\nI will now pass it over to Jamie to discuss our operations.\n\nJamie J. Boychuk\n\nEVP of Operations, CSX Corporation\n\nThanks, Kevin. The safety of our operations will always be our first priority. Our concern for all of our employees, customers and the communities in which we live and operate drives us to make sure that we maintain the demanding standards of our safety-focused culture. The results that you see on Slide 7 show this clearly. .\nOver the first quarter, we saw sequential and year-over-year improvements in the number of injuries and train accidents, which brought their frequency rates to a near record low levels for the first quarter. We're happy to see this improvement. We continue to push forward with the initiatives that we described to you last quarter, actively coaching safety awareness among our employees, encouraging best practice sharing across teams and expanding our application of technology. And we put a very strong emphasis on our efforts with our new hires to ensure that they respect and demonstrate the principles that make CSX an industry safety leader.\nMoving on to Slide 8. For the last several quarters, you've heard us discuss the efforts we're making to address our staffing levels. This is a critical point because our networks capacity and fluidity will improve when we have enough train conductors and engineers. And we have these resources, it lifts our service performance in the near term, while also ensuring that we're ready to meet the substantial demand growth we anticipate in the years ahead.\nThis slide also shows several important positive train and engine employee trends that reflect the hard work done by our recruiting and training teams. We have made great progress here. And importantly, we're set up to build on the momentum we've created.\nFirst, you can see the strong ramp-up in the number of T&E employees we have in our training program. We averaged over 500 daily employees in training over the first quarter, which is over 5x where we were a year ago. We expect to keep our training classes full to make sure that our pipeline remains healthy.\nSecond, we've successfully increased our run rate of conductors who are completing their training and marking up into the active T&E population. We now have roughly 100 employees marking up each month who are ready to haul freight, generate revenue, and we expect this pace to continue.\nIn the last chart, you can see the payoff. We return in the corner, and we're now adding to our active T&E count month-over-month. We've said it again and again. Our aim is to grow this railroad. To that, we need to bring good people in, train them the right way and deliver on service. It takes time, but this is exactly what we're doing.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7, which gives us a picture on where our operations stand today. This quarter started off with several key challenges. The Omicron wave was hitting our employees. We had the incident at our Curtis Bay facility and the East Coast suffered under severe weather in early February. So for the full quarter, our key metrics of TripLink compliance, terminal Cardwell and velocity were generally flat to slightly worse on a sequential basis.\nThat said, as Jim highlighted in his remarks, early into the second quarter, we're seeing encouraging signs that these metrics are starting to move in the right direction. It's clearly too quick to call the bottom with certainty. But with the success of our hiring initiatives and a continued drive for discipline and consistency in the field, we see reasons to be optimistic.\nConsistent with the last quarter, we have made the tactical decision to keep additional locomotives active in the near term to help with network balance while we remain short of employees in certain regions. As we successfully promote our new conductors, we will be focused on improving our asset utilization and driving efficiency as the additional crew resources facilitate higher volumes and improved service and reliability.\nAs always, the key will be strong execution, and I'm excited at the level of higher engagement and enthusiasm that our operating team is bringing to this challenge. I'm looking forward to showing what we can do over this next quarter, the rest of the year and the years to come.\nI will now hand it over to Sean to review the financial results.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Our focus is on profitable growth. And despite the challenges we faced in the quarter, we delivered $600 million of revenue gains with operating income up 16%. Interest expense and other income were a combined $11 million favorable and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9%. Earnings per share of $0.39 reflects growth in core earnings as well as the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.\nTurning to the next slide. Total costs increased $419 million or 24% in the quarter, but were in line with our expectations outside of the spike in fuel price. The acquisition of Quality Carriers represented approximately $215 million of expense. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor, up about $110 million versus last year. All other expenses increased approximately $95 million, driven by inflation as well as ongoing costs related to supply chain congestion and network fluidity.\nTurning to specific line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $72 million or 12% in the quarter. We invested $10 million more to onboard new train and engine employees, and we expect similar training costs next quarter as we continue to convert our strong new hire pipeline. Quality Carriers drove about $35 million in additional labor expense. Incentive compensation increased $6 million while inflation and other impacts drove just over $20 million of higher costs.\nPurchase services and other expense increased $203 million or 43% in the quarter. Quality Carriers represented approximately $140 million of PS&O expense. Costs incurred to maintain terminal and network fluidity added roughly $45 million of expense in the quarter, similar to last quarter's impact. These costs are likely to persist into the second quarter, and we expect to see improvement in the back half of the year, corresponding to labor and supply chain normalization.\nAdditionally, a legacy environmental reserve adjustment drove $17 million of higher expense in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization was up $15 million or 4% on a higher asset base that also includes the quality impact. Finally, fuel expense increased $141 million or 74%, reflecting a steep increase in highway diesel fuel prices as well as the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. The rapid rise in fuel prices created approximately $45 million of fuel lag in the quarter.\nAnd lastly, the company recognized $27 million of real estate gains in the quarter, including $20 million related to the Virginia transaction. As a reminder, we expect to recognize a $120 million Virginia gain in the second quarter and received the final $125 million cash payment in the fourth quarter.\nNow turning to cash flow on Slide 12. Free cash flow before dividends increased on higher earnings to $976 million. Our highest priority use of cash is investing for the long-term reliability and growth of our railroad. After fully funding these capital projects, first quarter shareholder returns exceeded $1.2 billion, including approximately $1 billion in buybacks and over $200 million in dividends. Looking forward, we will remain balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach as we continue to return excess cash to our shareholders.\nFinally, we are excited to close the Pan Am deal on June 1. Pan Am will contribute about 1 point of annualized revenue, primarily within merchandise. Due to transaction and integration costs, Pan Am will have a negligible impact on earnings this year and the capital we expect to invest to upgrade the Pan Am network is already contemplated in our guidance. We look forward to working with Pan Am and its customers to drive continued growth through our integrated rail network.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\n\nJames M. Foote\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nOkay. So let's conclude with our outlook for the year, as shown on Slide 13. We continue to from strong markets and ample customer demand, and we are adding the employees needs that our network can capture more of the business opportunities that are right in front of us. At the same time, we are, of course, keeping a close eye on inflation, interest rates and the Fed.\nWith support from higher coal prices and a supportive market environment, we feel comfortable projecting double-digit growth for both revenue and operating income for the full year. In the near term, we expect to continue to benefit from elevated export coal prices and higher fuel surcharge revenues.\nFull year CapEx is planned at approximately $2 billion, which is also unchanged. We have made progress since the beginning of the year, and we still have a lot of work to do. But we are committed to supporting our customers by providing them with reliable, efficient, cost-effective rail solutions for their changing transportation needs. By adding the necessary resources and lifting our service levels, we will be well positioned for years of profitable growth.\nThanks, and I'll turn it back to Matthew.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nThank you, Jim. Now in the interest of time, I'd ask that everyone please limit yourselves to just 1 question.\nAnd with that, Emma, we will now be happy to take questions."

My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2021 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Matthew Korn, you may begin your conference.\n\nMatthew Korn\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Acting Chief Financial Officer. In our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2 and followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim?\n\nJames M. Foote\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us for today's call. First, I'm pleased to welcome Matthew to CSX and believe his investment research background, including coverage of many of our customers will make them a great contributor to our team. And I wish Bill success in his new role as Head of Finance and Treasury. As we exit 2021, every CSX employee deserves recognition for their dedication to our customers in what has been another unbelievable year operating through the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. As these challenges continue into the start of the new year, we continue to take the necessary steps to move more freight for our customers. We are putting the resources in place to deliver a high-quality service product and are working hard every day to make rail a more meaningful part of our customers' transportation solutions.\nThroughout this period, we have remained true to our core principles, operate safely, reliably and efficiently and are committed to providing customers with additional capacity to help overcome the current challenges. These actions, combined with expected easing of supply chain disruptions position CSX for growth.\nTurning to our presentation. Let's start with Slide 4, which highlights our key financial results. We moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the fourth quarter and generated over $3.4 billion in revenue. Operating income increased by 12% to $1.37 billion. The operating ratio increased 310 basis points to 60.1%, which includes approximately 250 basis points from the impact from Quality Carriers and 50 basis points from higher fuel prices. And earnings per share increased 27% to $0.42 a share.\nI'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details.\n\nKevin S. Boone\n\nEVP of Sales & Marketing, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue increased 21% year-over-year with growth across all major lines of business. Merchandise revenue increased 4% on 3% lower volume as the impact of ongoing automotive semiconductor shortages was more than offset by revenue growth across all other merchandise markets. Industrial and construction-related end markets continue to demonstrate the strongest growth. Even though declines in energy-related markets remain a headwind for our Chemical business, it's important to highlight that our core chemical, plastics and waste markets continue to show solid year-over-year growth.\nIntermodal revenue increased 16% on flat volumes as international growth driven by strong underlying demand and continued growth in rail volumes from East Coast ports was offset by domestic declines due to ongoing driver and equipment shortages.\nCoal revenue increased 39% on 2% lower volume. Increases in export coal shipments driven by the impact of rising benchmark prices was partially offset by the effect of declines in domestic volumes, largely related to producer outages. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage driven by supply chain disruptions resulting from truck driver shortages, chassis availability and the lack of warehouse capacity.\nAs we exited the fourth quarter, we clearly saw the effects of Omicron with December volumes impacted by labor and supply chain disruptions. These challenges have continued into the new year, but we are seeing customers face labor shortages in their operations. As we look across merchandise, intermodal and coal markets, demand signals remain strong as supply chain challenges normalize, we would expect volumes to align more with demand. Finally, I would like to highlight the positive results we have achieved by working with customers on new business development projects.\nOver the last few months, we have seen 3 significant announcements of new production and facilities to be located on the CSX railroad, including 2 electric vehicle plants and a new steel mill. These projects are a team effort and show the ability of sales and marketing team and partnership with operations, to creatively come up with solutions that meet the requirements of our customers. Importantly, these projects represent significant long-term value to CSX.\nNow let's discuss the progress CSX is making when it comes to our commitment to sustainability as summarized on Slide 6. Rail is the most efficient form of land-based transportation, and CSX is the most fuel-efficient Class 1 railroad, U.S. Class 1 railroad. By using CSX Rail in 2021, our customers avoided 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to taking 2.3 million passenger vehicles off the road, an amount greater than all the hybrid and electric vehicles operating in the U.S. today. We are proud of the recognition we have received for these efforts to date.\nBy organizations such as CDP, Dow Jones and Forbes, but we are certainly not done. CSX continues to invest in existing technologies to drive further improvement, and we continue to evaluate emerging technologies so we are prepared to realize those benefits when available. We are excited to see our customers increase focus on improving their carbon footprint. Customer engagement on ESG has accelerated and we have seen them double their usage of CSX provided tools that help them calculate emission savings from switching to rail. You'll also see later this quarter, we will be recognizing customers for their efforts in prioritizing carbon emission savings by converting traditional truck volume to rail.\nI will now pass it over to Jamie to discuss our operations.\n\nJamie J. Boychuk\n\nEVP of Operations, CSX Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. As Jim referenced, we are working very hard to provide customers the capacity to help overcome the persistent supply chain challenges. One of the areas we have discussed in our ongoing T&E hiring initiative. This effort is beginning to pay dividends as more employees finish training and begin moving freight. We are also encouraged to see ongoing hiring momentum to start the year as we continue to consistently fill weekly training classes while maintaining a strong pipeline of candidates. In total, we roughly doubled the average number of active trainees in the quarter. Also, the number of employees qualifying and moving to active status increased almost 50% sequentially in the fourth quarter to approximately 150. And we expect this number to double to over 300 employees in the first quarter.\nRecently, the benefit of these additional employees have been offset by the rapid rise in COVID cases across the network. Average daily cases have increased by several hundred employees since early November and are approaching prior peak levels. That said, there is no doubt that the hiring actions taken to date have allowed us to better manage the current situation. We have also supplemented this hiring by bringing additional assets online to help offset network imbalance caused by pockets of concentrated case counts. We will maintain asset utilization and drive increased operating efficiency as employees return to work and our ongoing hire initiatives provide the necessary resources to move incremental volumes and deliver the expected high-quality service to our customers.\nAdditionally, until Holloway capacity improves at intermodal terminals, we will continue making the necessary investments to keep terminals fluid by providing the overflow space and supplemental labor required to move long dwelling boxes out of our terminals.\nWe're also continuing to take a long-term approach to network and infrastructure planning and have identified several strategic siding extension opportunities that will provide additional long-term capacity by helping to alleviate congestion while also supporting growth for years to come.\nAs always, we will pursue these initiatives while maintaining a balanced train plan and a continued focus on strong execution to maximize both reliability and service for our customers. I want to thank the entire operating team for the hard work and long hours they put in to keep freight moving for our customers. Despite the incremental headwinds this quarter, service metrics remained consistent with the prior quarter, and we are taking the necessary steps to drive these metrics back towards pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 8. Safety remains fundamental to everything we do at CSX, and we hold ourselves to the highest standard for our employees, customers and the communities in which we work and operate. Our hard work to instill a culture of safety at CSX continues to drive positive results. As shown by the reduction in our train accident headcount this train accident rate this year.\nHeading into 2022, we continue to target further reductions in human factor incidents through a combination of increased awareness, best-practice sharing, collaboration across regions and expanding our successful drone program. We are also engaging with our new hires to instill our principles of safe operations and emphasize our commitment to make CSX the safest running railroad.\nI will now hand it to Sean to review our financial results.\n\nSean R. Pelkey\n\nVP & Acting CFO, CSX Corporation\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. As you've heard, operating income grew double digits up $151 million with revenue up 21% on gains across all major markets. Below the line, interest and other expense was $60 million favorable, reflecting the prior year debt repurchase expense. Income taxes were up on higher pretax income, though we recognized $25 million in benefits this quarter, primarily related to state tax adjustments. As a result, EPS of $0.42 was up 27% versus the prior year.\nNow I'd like to take a minute to walk through operating expense in more detail on the next slide. Total costs increased $451 million or 28% in the quarter. The addition of quality carriers drove approximately $200 million of the increase. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor, driving costs up about $115 million versus last year. Nonlocomotive fuel inflation remained consistent with prior quarters, just above 3%. So as we turn the page to 2022, we expect a number around 4%.\nDrilling into a few specific line items, labor and fringe increased $115 million or 20% in the quarter. Quality was about $30 million. Incentive compensation was a nearly $40 million headwind in the quarter, largely due to higher expected payouts versus last year and the impact of accelerated expense for certain employees. As Jamie discussed, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining train and engine employees. We invested over $20 million in new programs targeting our T&E workforce. In line with these efforts, average headcount increased by 230 or 1% sequentially.\nLabor inflation remained in line with prior quarters, though is expected to be slightly higher in 2022. Purchase services and other expense increased $198 million or 44% in the quarter. As a reminder, this is where most of the quality expense shows up, approximately $130 million. Also, you may recall that we expected investments in supply chain fluidity to result in higher costs on this line. And we saw about $45 million of increased expense as we worked tirelessly to drive network and terminal fluidity in light of unprecedented challenges. We expect these costs will persist until we see a normalization of labor in the broader supply chain. The remaining increase reflected both the impact of inflation as well as a number of smaller items. Depreciation was up 4% on a higher asset base. Fuel costs were up on higher price and trucking fuel. Rents were up slightly and we had about $20 million of higher real estate gains. Going forward, you can expect a modest level of base real estate gains, similar to the $35 million we recognized in 2020 as we shift our focus towards leveraging the real estate portfolio to support growth initiatives.\nHowever, the Virginia transaction will continue to impact results in 2022, with a $20 million gain in Q1 and a $120 million gain expected in Q2. We anticipate receiving the final $125 million of cash in Q4.\nNow turning to cash flow on Slide 11. On a full year basis, free cash flow before dividends increased 45% to $3.8 billion. As a reminder, this includes $400 million from Virginia and over $500 million of total proceeds from property dispositions. Cash and short-term investments finished the year at $2.3 billion. While this remains elevated, we nevertheless expect to continue to work the balance down this year, the levels more in line with our historical liquidity needs. After fully funding capital investments, shareholder returns exceeded $3.7 billion. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\n\nJames M. Foote\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CSX Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Sean. Let's conclude with our outlook for the year on Slide 13. We remain optimistic about the opportunity to grow this year, driven by a combination of strong underlying economic momentum and supply chain recovery. Based on these expected tailwinds, we are targeting GDP plus volume growth for the year. Volume should build sequentially throughout the year as supply chain bottlenecks ease. As a result, growth in the second half of the year is expected to be greater than in the first half. This growth will be supported by the initiatives Jamie reviewed to appropriately resource our network for the current demand environment and to ensure we can provide customers with a consistently strong service product. We also expect -- we also expect pricing to benefit from a combination of market forces including very strong demand for transportation services. Full year capital expenditures are planned at approximately $2 billion.\nOur top capital priority is and always has been maintaining and improving the safety and reliability of our network. In 2022, we will replace in excess of 500 miles of rail as we continue to focus on the core infrastructure. The cost of this capital work has been offset by significant improvements in the efficiency of our engineering programs. While we expect to drive further efficiencies in 2022, our plan reflects the impact of increased inflation, any number of discrete strategic investment opportunities. We will continually evaluate future strategic opportunities as they come along, but still have ample capacity across our network to absorb future volume growth. And finally, after investing in the railroad and high-return growth projects, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We are entering the year with strong demand across the economy, but shippers are facing ongoing challenges from the lack of capacity in labor, materials and transportation.\nOur focus remains supporting our customers by providing effective rail solutions to overcome these persistent bottles. As I said earlier, we are encouraged by the progress we are making, and we expect our actions combined with an improving global supply chain will provide a year of steadily improving growth.\nThank you, and I'll turn it back to Matthew for questions.\n\nWalter Noel Spracklin\n\nMD & Analyst, RBC Capital Markets, Research Division\n\nThanks, Jim. Now in the interest of time, I'd ask if everyone please limit yourselves to one question.\nAnd with that, operator, we will now take questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker, Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on today's earnings conference call are CEO, Tom Bell; and CFO, Chris Cage. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you can find the earnings press release and the presentation slides for today's call. As shown on Slide 2, and our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and thus includes risks and uncertainties. Our press release contains more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.\nTurning to Slide 3. We'll also discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, and today's press release and presentation slides contain a reconciliation between the 2. And now let me turn the call over to Tom, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and welcome, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to report another excellent quarter of performance for Leidos, including top line growth of 7%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.8% and operating cash flow of $711 million. So far in 2025, we've grown revenue 5%, grown EBITDA 13% and grown EPS 18%. These strong results enable us to raise guidance for 2025, marking our second guidance raise of the year. And we've been able to deliver these results despite the headwinds of [indiscernible] earlier in the year, and the current government shutdown. Even through the dynamic market environment of 2025, we've been able to achieve improving strong performance.\nRegarding the current government shutdown, most of our programs have not been impacted. I see 3 primary reasons for this fact. Our programs are considered mission essential by our customer. They are funded or they are beyond the scope of discretionary budgets. This, in turn, reflects our business' ongoing alignment to true enduring customer needs, current administration priorities and our ability to thrive in a business environment that rewards outcome-based contracting. Our portfolio matches the moment with solutions that speak directly to many top priorities: Golden Dome, air traffic control modernization, border security, service to veterans, maritime, autonomy, et cetera. We have the products and services that match our nation's ongoing needs.\nAnd we are accelerating our business pace today, responding to our customers' desire to work with firms that invest in innovation, can deliver real outcomes quickly, have a proven track record of lowering costs and know how to deliver on time and on cost. Our improved financial performance over the past 2 years has enabled us to turbocharge our investments in our Leidos Golden Domes. We're accelerating our focus on creating new solutions to vexing problems in areas ranging from air travel to rural health. Our customers' missions have always been our central focus. The founding motivation for Leidos over a decade ago was to shed advisory work to focus on real mission performance. And with Leidos' expanded position in defense tech, we're focused on getting innovative solutions into the hands of war fighters in areas like counter UAS, low-cost cruise missiles, hypersonics and autonomous maritime vessels.\nLeidos' core business model is to make our customers' outcomes smarter and more efficient. We're always working in every program to deploy technology to drive down costs for our customers. For example, this quarter, we rewon a $0.5 billion counterterrorism contract, a contract that had never been reawarded to an incumbent in large part because of our introduction of automation and AI to deliver smarter customer outcomes. And we continue to demonstrate to our customers our ability to perform for them on outcome-based contracts. An example about this -- about which we are very proud is our having delivered on time and under budget the very complex electronic health record system for the Department of Ore. This performance is a direct reflection of our commitment to a promises made, promises kept culture in action.\nOur NorthStar 2030 strategy is now firmly in place in guiding all our actions. With growth pillars that tightly align to our customers' priorities we are building momentum to drive accelerated growth through 2026 and into the future. As you will recall, our 5 NorthStar 2030 strategy growth pillars are: Space and maritime, energy infrastructure, digital modernization and cyber, mission software and managed health services. On our past 2 quarterly earnings calls, I've highlighted elements of 2 of these pillars, cyber in Q1, and maritime in Q2. Today, I'd like to highlight our energy infrastructure growth pillar.\nFor more than 2 decades, Leidos has provided world-class engineering services for commercial electric utilities. The services we provide typically involve the design and placement of high-power transmission lines, electric substations and/or electric distribution infrastructure. And over the past 7 years, this business has grown by double-digit CAGRs while also delivering double-digit margins. It now represents more than $600 million worth of Leidos' annual revenues.\nAs you will no doubt know, the United States is amid a sustained robust investment posture in its energy infrastructure. Electric utilities are aggressively expanding the grid to meet growing demand from electrification, reindustrialization and data center growth. At the same time, they are also investing to improve the grid's reliability and resilience against extreme weather events. Following a record investment level in 2024, U.S. utilities plan to invest well over $1 trillion in this area over the next decade, and we are prepared to help.\nLeidos proprietary engineering and design tools arm our power engineers with the latest data and tools. This ensures they are always the most efficient and effective engineers in the market. One such tool our engineers use is our proprietary software product, Skywire, powered by Leidos Trusted Mission AI that makes every step of the design process smarter, more efficient and more effective for our customers. Simply put, Leidos' Skywire is an AI platform that revolutionizes the efficiency of distribution system engineering. Over the past 12 months, Skywire has been used to optimize some 18,000 projects for 25 major utilities. And we're now extending the use of this AI technology across the entire value chain from distribution to transmission to create a smarter, safer and more secure grid.\nReduction of project costs enabled by Skywire of 30% is routine. And as we expand the use of these solutions across all of our programs, we're seeing powerful lift in our commercial success. We've increased revenue on more than half of our top accounts by some 50%.\nIn addition to Leidos' AI Golden Bolt deployment in this market, we're also deploying other all of Leidos capabilities to the energy market. We're currently proving out the use of advanced analytics in drone fleets to provide real-time grid damage intelligence. Utilities spend billions annually on this need. And through our products and tools, we see opportunity to radically accelerate storm recovery for millions of Americans.\nWe've helped the key customer in the energy sector successfully migrate their mission-critical software applications to the cloud, a long-standing core Leidos competency. And we're investing in deploying AI-assisted defensive cyber solutions to protect our customers' grids from cyber attacks.\nIn addition, we're also on the cutting edge of helping our nation expand our power generation means. We're collaborating with small modular and microreactor OEMs to prototype nuclear reactors for a secure military-grade sources of energy as our team leans into this exciting model for energy resilience in America.\nSo the energy infrastructure pillar of NorthStar 2030 represents a focused robust area of growth for Leidos, our innovative technology offerings differentiate us in a rapidly growing market, and we see multiple channels by which we can grow this line of business for Leidos.\nNow turning to other aspects of the business. On Golden Dome, the Department of War is finalizing that program's reference architecture and is evaluating proposals for the $150 billion Shield IDIQ procurement. We're very much in the mix here, and we expect vigorous government reengagement on this subject later this month. In the meantime, we're having healthy customer conversations about unique Leidos capabilities that could have a critical role in Golden Dome such as interceptor modernization and advanced radar surveillance systems.\nOn air traffic control modernization, the FAA is currently evaluating bids for the prime integrator role, which we [ no bid ] due to conflict of interest stipulations contained in that solicitation. Our focus remains where we see our greatest value add, perpetuation of our position in the development of key systems and technologies that are central to delivering our next-generation air traffic control system. And at the same time, we continue to move out with the FAA to enhance the current system in ways that are aligned to their future blueprint.\nOn airport security modernization, we, along with our TSA customer, are executing a pilot program at the Houston and Sacramento airports to demonstrate the viability and scalability for smarter, safer and more efficient checkpoint operations. Our demonstrated approach includes digitized checkpoints, remote baggage screening and cybersecurity [indiscernible]. And on border security, customer -- Customs and Border Protection is moving out quickly to bolster non-intrusive inspection at the border as provided for in the reconciliation law. We've received an order for 24 of our mobile VACIS systems that will deliver very quickly over the coming months.\nThis progress and pace is reflected in our current bookings tempo. We had a 27% sequential increase in funded backlog, 1 of the largest in our history, which tells me that our customers are moving out to accomplish missions with pace.\nAlso, as part of our 1.3x book-to-bill ratio this quarter, we were awarded an extension to 1 of our core franchise programs to enhance and sustain the MHS Genesis Electronic Health Record for the Department of Ore. We are expanding our contribution under an asset contract to support the ARTEMIS program and loyal duration space exploration. And we received a large award to modernize Kazakhstan's air traffic control system using our Skyline X comprehensive air traffic management system.\nWe are optimistic about our near-term growth prospects given our $69 billion pipeline of near-term opportunities, which includes $24 billion of bids awaiting adjudication.\nRegarding capital deployment, this quarter, we repurchased another $100 million worth of shares on the open market, and we accelerated payoff of $450 million on our term loan. We have also increased our quarterly dividend. This marks our third dividend increase in 3 years. Shareholders of record on December 15 will receive a dividend of $0.43 per share, a 7.5% increase over our past dividend. This speaks to our ongoing conviction regarding the earnings and cash generation potential of our business.\nIn addition, given our sharpened strategic focus through our NorthStar 2030 strategy, I'm pleased that we recently completed the divestiture of [indiscernible], a noncore legacy energy asset, Acquired in 2006, the disposition of this asset will allow both Leidos and Varick to advance their respective missions and best maximize long-term value.\nOur strong balance sheet position and powerful free cash flow gives us multiple pathways to continue to grow shareholder value. Consistent with our NorthStar 2030 strategy, we will continue to accelerate investments in our growth pillars while we also opportunistically return capital to shareholders.\nI'm very pleased that our ongoing 2025 strong performance allows us to, again, improve guidance, reaffirming our guidance on revenue and cash while increasing our guidance on EBITDA and EPS.\nNow before I pass the call over to Chris, I wanted to take a moment to give a special shout out to our 47,000-plus [ Leidoceians ] that in a year of profound challenges have shown incredible resilience and focus. Their brilliance has been essential to our success. And the momentum we are building through this, our strategic pivot year, is a testament to their commitment to our customers and their missions. I am truly excited about what lies ahead for this team. So with that, over to you, Chris.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. With another quarter of strong financial performance on the books, Leidos is demonstrating its ability to navigate complex market dynamics while delivering mission success for our customers, growth opportunities for our employees and financial rewards for our shareholders. Though we take pride as a team in what we've accomplished, we remain focused on finishing out 2025 strong and setting a path for a successful 2026.\nAs Tom indicated, the shutdown impact so far has been modest, and we remain confident in our ability to thrive in the missions we serve despite any near-term uncertainty.\nWith that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter results, starting with the income statement on Slide 5.\nRevenues were $4.47 billion, up 7% in total and 6% organically year-over-year. Our positive momentum enabled us to overcome the moderate headwinds from ongoing government efficiency reviews to post sequential growth of 5%, our best sequential third quarter since coming out of the pandemic in 2020. Each segment improved sequentially with especially robust growth in National Security and Digital and Defense Systems. Bottom line performance remains strong through consistent program execution, AI-driven cost efficiencies and overall prudent cost management. Even as we stepped up growth investments as discussed on the Q2 call, and increased legal reserves by $24 million, we still generated $616 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.8%.\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS grew 4% to $3.05 as a lower share count more than offset slightly higher interest expense and tax rate.\nDigging a little deeper, let's now turn to the segment drivers on Slide 6. National Security and Digital revenues increased 8% year-over-year, with 7% coming organically. Record revenue growth was driven by recent contract awards and increased volumes for defense IT and mission support for intelligence customers. The multibillion-dollar classified award this quarter is ramping on plan and will provide healthy growth for several quarters. We also generated $26 million in revenues at attractive margins from the acquisition of Kudu Dynamics. This marks the first full quarter of contribution from Kudu, and we're focused on integrating quickly and unlocking new growth vectors.\nNon-GAAP operating income margin decreased modestly from 10.5% in the prior year quarter to 10%. Margins in the low to mid 10s is the right near-term ZIP code for National Security and Digital business. Health & Civil revenues increased 6% year-over-year with an uptick on our large infrastructure operations programs as well as continued high volumes within the managed health services business. Medical disability exam volumes helped drive record non-GAAP operating income margin of 25.7%, along with some nonrecurring items across the portfolio, including a prior period incentive award pickup and equitable cost adjustment and an EAC pickup tied to successful deployment of a key fixed price program.\nCommercial & International revenues were essentially flat and non-GAAP operating margin of 8.1% was down 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The Security Products business moderately pressured both revenue and fee as product deliveries shifted into Q4, and we increased investments to accelerate our AI deployment. The energy infrastructure business that Tom highlighted once again led the sector in growth and profitability.\nLastly, in Defense Systems, again, is 1 of our strongest performing segments, growing 11% year-over-year, its seventh consecutive period of high single to low double-digit growth. Growth was paced by increased volumes in Integrated Air Defense, including the indirect fires protection capability Increment 2 system and multiple radar surveillance systems as well as the small glide munitions and hypersonic missile programs. Bottom line performance was consistent with our expectations, with non-GAAP operating margins of 8.9%. This level of profitability is the result of a higher mix of materials in the initial phases of production on multiple programs as well as increased investments to pursue large opportunities like Golden Dome and maritime autonomy. We're still progressing towards sustainable double-digit profitability in Defense Systems.\nTurning to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. In the quarter, we generated $711 million of cash flows from operating activities and $680 million of free cash flow for a free cash flow conversion ratio of 171%. Q3 was a phenomenal collections quarter as the government prioritized disbursements at the end of their fiscal year, and we aggressively manage working capital, improved DSO by 2 days and began to deduct some previously capitalized R&D costs.\nAfter the $450 million debt paydown and $100 million share repurchase, we ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of debt for a gross leverage ratio of 2x, and $974 million in cash and cash equivalents. Importantly, we'll now have no debt principal payments due until 2028. And even with the increased dividend, our capital commitment is not changing materially given aggressive share repurchases over the past 2 years.\nOur strong balance sheet stands as a key tool to unlock shareholder value through capital investments to drive growth, strategic M&A to accelerate our growth pillars in opportunistic share repurchases.\nFinally, on to the forward outlook on Slide 8. Based on our robust performance year-to-date and confidence in our positioning, we're enhancing our 2025 outlook. Consistent with Tom's remarks, we're reaffirming our revenue guidance of $17 billion to $17.25 billion, raising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance from mid-13s to high 13s, raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance by $0.30 at the midpoint for a new range of $11.45 to $11.75, and we're reaffirming our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.65 billion.\nLet me provide a little perspective on the guidance. First, with the quarter to go, we left wider ranges around revenue and EPS than usual, a proactive hedge against a less predictable government environment. Second, our team and our diverse portfolio are proving to be exceedingly agile. We've been able to absorb top line hits that could approach 3%, and split nearly equally across government efficiency imperatives and the potential for up to a 3-month shutdown and still slightly improved revenue guidance over the year. Third, we are full steam ahead on funding key investments in the fourth quarter, deepening our conviction in a mission-driven, technology-enabled and inherently profitable future. And fourth, cash flow is a metric that is most impacted by the current environment. We expect all of the additional earnings from the raised guidance to convert to free cash flow, but the timing is uncertain in this environment.\nWith that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Welcome to Leidos Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may now begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on today's earnings conference call our CEO, Tom Bell; and CFO, Chris Cage. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you can find the earnings press release and the presentation slides for today's call.\nAs shown on Slide 2, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and thus includes risks and uncertainties. Our press release contains more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.\nTurning to Slide 3. We'll also discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. In today's press release and presentation slides contain a reconciliation between the 2.\nAnd now let me turn the call over to Tom, who'll begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to speak to you all against the backdrop of our truly differentiated Q2 results. We've recorded robust revenue growth, 4.8% year-to-date, record profitability, 15.2% EBITDA margin this quarter and robust operating cash flow, up 28% this quarter. These results are especially gratifying, given the dynamic market environment through which we are navigating.\nBehind this performance is our proactive enactment of intelligent austerity measures, a team that is leaning into our unparalleled customer understanding and engaging customers as their partner to create smarter and more efficient outcomes. Our wrapping technology, AI and all our golden bolts, even more aggressively around all our products and services to enhance our customers' effectiveness and completely aligning all of Leidos around our NorthStar 2030 Strategy. It is because of this, that I'm also pleased to be able to raise our full year guidance for 2025.\nAs you will recall, our NorthStar 2030 Strategy is comprised of 5 growth pillars: space and maritime, energy infrastructure, digital modernization and cyber, mission software and managed health services. Our determined ongoing engagement with customers continues to validate these NorthStar 2030 growth pillars. In fact, the significant multiyear funds provided by the One Big Beautiful bill speak directly to our NorthStar 2030 growth pillars and our core Leidos capabilities. With the One Big Beautiful bill now law and the administration's priority is now clear, our customers are moving out to execute programs for essential missions right in our wheelhouse. These include our space and maritime growth pillar, supporting a wide range of needs in the Golden Dome initiative.\nOur mission software growth pillar, along with our global air traffic control experience being tightly aligned to the FAA's ambition for a brand-new air traffic control system. The TSA embarking on an ambitious airport screening modernization effort, which is tightly aligned to our capabilities in our airport security business. The Department of Homeland Security receiving significant additional funding validating our ongoing investments in our ports and border security business as well as our cutting-edge counter drone capabilities and the drive for improved health outcomes and better service to our nation's veterans, speaking directly to our managed health services growth pillars.\nAll in all, it's indeed a very exciting time for all of Leidos.\nNow I'd like to take a few minutes on this call to highlight the maritime component of our space and maritime growth pillar. Over the coming years, the U.S. Navy plans to rapidly deploy a larger integrated fleet of manned and unmanned vehicles, a direction that closely aligns with our strengths in maritime autonomy. This enhanced battle force will not only prepare the U.S. for future challenges, but also revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base. Leidos' full life cycle maritime capabilities are unmatched to meet this need. Leidos is the only company that possesses world-renowned naval architecture capabilities, proven experience fielding successful autonomous maritime vessels, demonstrated capabilities in state-of-the-art maritime autonomy AI and experience in designing and integrating packaged mission payloads. So Leidos is in a pole position to support the expansion of the U.S. Navy with an autonomous maritime fleet.\nThe fiscal 2025 reconciliation bill allocated robust funding for autonomous vessels along with related autonomy and battle management software. Let me highlight a few examples of the role Leidos is already playing in this area. First, the U.S. Navy has contracted Leidos to survey commercial ships for future potential conversion to high-performance mission-ready, autonomous, medium unmanned surface vessels. Second, the U.S. Marines have a desire to scale up production of Leidos' low profile, small unmanned surface vessel, [ Cspector ], to support expeditionary warfare particularly in the Indo-Pacific. U.S. Marines currently have 3 [indiscernible] in operation and have praised its low-profile approach and capacity for missions in contested environments.\nAnd third, a classified customer has contracted with Leidos to procure one dozen [indiscernible], our low-cost attritable unmanned underwater vessel to augment their arsenals. The customer has expressed an intent to acquire an additional 70 [indiscernible] next year with additional units to follow. This opportunity further positions Leidos as a leader within the subsea warfare domain critical to our nation's defense strategy.\nWe have invested in maritime autonomy for decades. And as a result, our Leidos Autonomous Vessel Architecture or LAVA, is the most trusted and reliable maritime autonomy on the market. LAVA has demonstrated its endurance, long-range capacity and precision while sailing more than 120,000 nautical miles. This includes our fleet of Leidos built MUSPs that transited the Pacific from San Diego to Australia and back last year. This journey marked a huge advancement in maritime autonomy and reinforced our leadership in this crucial domain.\nWe are continuing to invest in technology to improve the performance and interoperability of our nation's maritime capabilities. Our team is adding our proven battle management software, Alpha Mosaic software originally developed to optimize battlefield and aerospace strategies to our maritime command to control capabilities.\nSimultaneously, our NATO allies are increasingly acknowledging their escalating maritime threats and therefore, the imperative to modernize and prepare their maritime forces. This collective global focus presents a nearly $4 billion pipeline for Leidos over the coming years.\nAcross all these opportunities, the new administration's playbook is clear. Leveraging technology and AI to disrupt old models, drive out costs and deliver more efficient solutions. We share that passion and are thrilled to have a receptive customer eager for technology adoption. For some time, Leidos has been deploying trusted mission AI to our own business to lead our own positive disruption. We've been putting AI to work for us for years. And the results are extremely encouraging. Our AI work is on track to save more than 0.5 million labor hours by the end of this fiscal year, and we're just getting started.\nLet me give you a few examples of this work in action. In our growth office, we're using generative AI to help write better proposals faster. In this regard, we've already achieved some 20% greater efficiency on tasks common to every large proposal. In finance, we're using advanced automation to expedite our cash flow process and, as a result, have decreased invoice build and delivery time for select customers by almost 40%, while driving down error rates. And we've enabled over 1,000 software developers with AI-powered coating tools. For these coders, we've seen over a 30% reduction in the time it takes for them to deliver ready to test code. And using these same Leidos AI tools deployed at the FAA, we've seen a 60% increase in development productivity.\nThis brings me to my final point today. The government is now transitioning from policy to productivity. This administration came in with a clear objective to drive efficiencies and attack the status quo. And as discussed on our last call, that's fertile ground for Leidos and core to our business model. Now I am pleased to report that we continue to have success positioning Leidos as part of the solution, not the problem, as this administration moves quickly to make government outcomes smarter and more efficient. And it's apparent to me through the myriad of cabinet level engagements I've had to date that this administration is seeking to work with agile, forward-leading solution providers like Leidos.\nOur customer decision environment is also improving. Our 0.9 book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter was a strong snapback from Q1. And more than half of these awards were for new and takeaway business. Late in the second quarter, we were notified that we were also awarded another multibillion dollar takeaway within the intelligence community. But as happens, that contract wasn't definitized for several weeks. Had the contract been finalized in June instead of July, our Q2 book-to-bill ratio would have been 1.3 and our backlog would have increased 4%. Looking ahead, our pipeline of opportunities remains robust, and we expect much greater awards pace in the back half of this year.\nIt also bears mentioning today that I am encouraged by the first fruits of our Kudu acquisition. As a result of fast integration of Kudu into our business, we've already added $400 million in pipeline opportunities that neither company was pursuing separately. And we are convinced that with the combined Leidos Kudu capabilities, we've now driven up probability of winning on another $2 billion of near-term submits.\nGiven our improving market backdrop, we are confident in our ability to deploy capital to activate our strategy and benefit our shareholders. As we execute our NorthStar 2030 Strategy, we will continue to be on the lookout for constructive acquisitions that support our growth pillars and offer a compelling return on capital. And at the same time, our confidence in future cash flows enables us to remain multifaceted in our capital deployment philosophy. So consistent with earlier indications, we will undertake additional share repurchases and debt paydown during the back half of this year.\nSo in summary, we are fully executing our NorthStar 2030 Strategy. We're seen as part of the solution in the drive for smarter and more efficient government outcomes. And our customers have the funding and the conviction to move forward boldly in areas that speak to Leidos core capabilities.\nWith that, before we take your questions, I'll turn the call over to Chris to run through our financial details of the quarter, and our improved 2025 outlook. Chris?\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom, and welcome to everyone joining the call this morning. With the first half of 2025 in the books, we've shown what our differentiated and diversified portfolio can achieve. Over that period, each segment expanded margins and delivered mid- to high single-digit growth. And we think the best is still yet to come for Leidos. From the 30,000-foot view, the second quarter looks like Leidos just being Leidos, another quarter of beating expectations to deliver top-tier earnings and cash flow growth. But this quarter was anything, but business as usual.\nOn the May call, we estimated the 2025 revenue impact from administration efficiency actions to be about 1%. That remains true today, and that impact is spread roughly evenly across the second, third and fourth quarters. Complicating our growth story, the procurement process was severely constrained in the first several months of the new administration. We've been able to overcome those obstacles by obsessively delivering on the administration's innovation and efficiency agenda.\nFor example, many customers are looking to drive down IT costs as part of their efficiency imperative. After initially focusing on canceling contracts and reducing scope, we've now seen a pivot to consolidating contracts to increase accountability and lower the all-in cost of the government. We've offset a large part of our DOGE headwinds by using our scale, breadth of capabilities and unmatched contract portfolio to aid our customers in developing new requirements onto our existing contracts where we have expansive scope and ceiling.\nWith that as a backdrop, let's take a closer look at this quarter's performance, starting with the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the second quarter were $4.25 billion, up 3% year-over-year and up sequentially despite the headwinds from award delays and ongoing contract reviews. Profitability was where the urgency and discipline of the team shown brightest. Adjusted EBITDA was $647 million for the quarter, up 16% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 170 basis points to 15.2%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 22% to $3.21, well surpassing last quarter's record high of $2.97. Our EBITDA margin in the quarter was our best ever by 100 basis points.\nLet me unpack that a little to give you some more insight into how we accomplish that level of profitability and what is likely to be sustainable going forward. The core drivers were our contract portfolio, solid execution and efficient operations, which we should maintain for the foreseeable future. The second quarter included an $8 million benefit from EAC adjustments, which is actually $3 million to $4 million less than our average quarterly performance.\nAnd as Tom described, we're heavily focused on leveraging the power of AI and automation to drive down indirect expenses to improve profitability and competitiveness. However, we did have some favorable onetime items that lifted earnings in the quarter. Most notably, we received a $25 million insurance reimbursement for legal costs and an $8 million tax refund from prior year state tax filings. Equally important, for the first 2 quarters of 2025, we proactively metered spending throughout the company, which was appropriate for these unprecedented times. Given the uncertainty surrounding the new administration in a host of new EOs, we maintain tight controls on our indirect expenses.\nAs the customer environment is beginning to settle and the pace of procurement is now picking up, we expect to return to a more normal level of spending and also aggressively invest to capture market share.\nTurning to the segment drivers on Slide 6. It is clear that each of our segments contributed to our impressive results. National security and digital revenues increased 3% year-over-year. Several contract awards from the second half of 2024 are now ramping, and we're seeing additional tasking on large franchise programs like this. Building upon the award momentum, this segment was the primary bookings driver in the quarter. So we look for growth to sustain despite some continued dose headwinds for select digital modernization programs. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 10.4% was unchanged from the prior year quarter.\nWith the late May close, the top and bottom line contribution from Kudu was minimal as expected. The team has done a great job with the integration so far, and we're very excited about the opportunities this acquisition is unlocking. Health and Civil revenues increased 1% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating income margin was 24.9%. Sustaining the high levels of performance was enabled by the continued high throughput of medical disability exams and our team maintaining its laser focus on delivering excellence and innovation.\nIn Commercial Internationals, revenue increased 1% year-over-year from continued demand in SES steady performance in our commercial energy business and improved execution on contract growth within our U.K. business. Top line growth was tempered by last year's hardware refresh in our Australian IT line of business. Non-GAAP operating income margins were 8.5%, up 780 basis points year-over-year, stemming from the anniversary of the write-downs on U.K. programs in the prior year quarter, and a more favorable product mix within SES.\nLast, but certainly not least, Defense Systems revenue saw the highest growth, increasing 10% year-over-year from increased volumes on FDA wide field of tranche 2 and integrated air defense programs like IPIC Increment 2, and the electronic warfare mission support program called out in the earnings press release. Non-GAAP operating margins of 9.8% were down from Q2 of 2024, but up sequentially. We continue to track towards sustainable double-digit margins in our Defense Systems business.\nAs we look ahead, we are confident in our differentiated capabilities to support key priorities like Golden Dome and Maritime.\nMoving on to the cash flow -- to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We -- in the quarter, we generated $486 million of cash flows from operating activities and $457 million of free cash flow for a free cash flow conversion of 110%. During the quarter, we completed 2 major capital deployment activities. First, we closed the Kudu Dynamics acquisition for preliminary purchase consideration of $291 million, net of $29 million of cash acquired. And second, we finalized the $500 million accelerated share repurchase on May 20, retiring over 3.6 million shares at an average price of $138.44. These actions are perfect examples of what we're looking for as we use our balance sheet to grow shareholder value. Opportunistically putting about half of our operating cash flow for the year to work to turbocharge our access to a fast-growing market and to take down shares at very attractive prices, sets us up well going forward.\nWe ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of debt for a gross leverage ratio of 2.2x and $930 million in cash and cash equivalents. The strength of our balance sheet offers ample capacity for additional capital deployment, aligned with the strategic priorities that Tom laid out. We will continue to monitor the market and appropriately balanced debt paydown, capability-focused M&A and additional share repurchases.\nFinally, on to the forward outlook on Slide 8. As you all are aware, the customer environment during the first half of the year has been somewhat unsettled. While some disruption may continue, as Tom outlined, awards are picking up and the administration is clearly moving forward. We now have greater clarity and conviction about the near and long-term future for Leidos. As a result, we're very pleased to raise and narrow our guidance for the year across all metrics.\nOn revenue, we're raising the low end of our range by $100 million and the midpoint by $25 million for a new range of $17 billion to $17.25 billion. So Tom and I are confident in the trajectory of funding and ongoing contract reviews, we have experienced some revenue reductions, and we believe it's prudent to account for some potential customer delays and other unknowns. Our performance today gives us high confidence in our ability to deliver on margins and earnings. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance from mid- to high 12s range to mid-13s. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS between $11.15 and $11.45. So we are narrowing the range by $0.10 and increasing the midpoint by $0.75.\nThese ranges reflect a return to more normal indirect spending and an uptick in investments we plan to make for the rest of the year to drive future growth and capitalize on the administration's priorities that are highlighted in and funded by the One Big Beautiful bill.\nLastly, we are raising our operating cash flow guidance by $200 million from $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion. The increase reflects about $50 million from better EBITDA performance and $150 million from the tax changes in the One Big Beautiful bill that allow us to immediately deduct some previously capitalized R&D costs.\nAll in all, the team has again showcased its drive and agility through dynamically evolving high tempo times. We remain confident in our outlook for 2025 and beyond as we execute our NorthStar 2030 Strategy. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Welcome to Leidos First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFinally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I am pleased to report a strong Q1 for Leidos, once again delivering above plan revenue, EBITDA and EPS. In this excellent quarter for Leidos, our organic revenue increased 7% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margins improved again to 14.2%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share rose 30%. This strong start to 2025 builds on the significant momentum we built for our business during 2024. And we continue to push forward with optimism in our outlook. We are uniquely positioned in this environment to solve our customers' most vexing challenges by continuing to leverage our investments in and the application of cutting-edge technology.\nAt the same time, as discussed on previous calls, 2025 was always envisioned to be a pivot year for us as we lock in the gains from our hugely successful 2024, invest in further new business momentum based on our new NorthStar 2030 strategy and actively get after the priorities of our nation's new administration. Given all this, I'm pleased to also announce on this call that we are reaffirming our full year 2025 guidance at this time.\nSince undertaking our year of deep strategic thinking last year, evidence is everywhere that the future we predicted is racing toward us at pace. It manifests itself in the geopolitics we see around us and the challenges our customers are expressing to us and in the administration's rapid actions. So we're excited to be playing offense in 2025 now in full implementation mode on our NorthStar 2030 strategy and leaning into the robust opportunities this environment is presenting.\nSo let me share with you at a high level our NorthStar 2030 strategy, its growth pillars and their alignment to the new administration's priorities. Last year, we introduced the Leidos brand promise, making smart smarter. That brand promise summarizes in three short words the fact that everything we do, the core of our business model is making customer outcomes smarter and more efficient. That's why we exist. And that's why we can confidently assert that Leidos is the digital mission and solutions leader, serving customers with smarter, more efficient innovations.\nUnder that entablature, our NorthStar 2030 strategy is supported by 5 growth pillars, as shown on Slide 5. First, space and maritime, where we will be building off the franchises we have today and further program development to provide commercially-based, rapidly integrated, disruptive hardware products in these two select critical domains to the U.S. military. Second, energy infrastructure. In this growth pillar, we will continue to scale our electrical utility business within Leidos, serving commercial customers nationwide, making our nation's electrical grid more resilient and more secure. And we do this through our core design, engineering, IT and cyber capabilities, further enabled by cutting-edge Leidos AI tools.\nThird, digital modernization and cyber. Here, we will continue to leverage proprietary innovative technologies to build repeatable offerings at scale to make our customers' IT infrastructures more efficient, effective and secure. Fourth, highly customized critical-mission software. Here, we turn our deep understanding of our customers' mission to translate vast amounts of customer data into actionable information. And we do this through best-in-class AI deployment, integration, commercial development and productionized software offerings.\nAnd fifth, managed health services. In this growth pillar, we will use our successful medical examination expertise, our existing infrastructure and our robust provider network to expand our health business to serve new populations and offer additional related services. These growth pillars have been carefully chosen as our analysis shows clearly that they are areas where customer needs and spending will continue to grow robustly, Leidos has a proven ability to perform cutting-edge profitable work and Leidos has clear differentiated technical capabilities that can be actively advanced.\nOur growth pillars are also squarely aligned with the priorities of our new administration, and we are sure they will remain national priorities well into the future. Our confidence is evidenced by recent executive orders and announcements, like the EOs on the electrical grid and maritime dominance as well as orders calling for the modernization of federal technology and software, the President and the VA Secretary having been very vocal in advocating for faster, more comprehensive health care services for veterans, this administration's clear preference to work with firms that solve problems and get things done, not consultants that study problems and publish reports, this administration strive to make the federal outcome smarter and more efficient through technology and this administration's desire for commercial terms focused on outcomes.\nIn short, our administration is driving towards federal outcomes that are better, faster, cheaper, right in Leidos' wheelhouse and synonymous with our core business model of making customer outcomes smarter and more efficient.\nSo we are now actively advancing our NorthStar 2030 strategy, the right strategy at the right time. We are confident that our business, our strategic investments and our go-to-market engine are all aligned with the needs and pace of our customers. You can see our conviction in how we've allocated capital so far in 2025. We've taken advantage of the current market conditions to significantly speed up our planned 2025 share buyback program by executing a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement right out of the gate. This accomplishes the majority of our 2025 share buyback plans.\nAnd I'm very pleased to have signed a definitive agreement to acquire a leader in full-spectrum cyber, our first acquisition in 2.5 years, to accelerate one of our aforementioned NorthStar 2030 strategic growth pillars. Cyber has long been a core competency for Leidos. With the largest cyber operation across the federal government, we see firsthand every day the complex destructive and coersive actions from nation-state threats our customers defeat with our help. So with the cyber threat growing, customers needs becoming more complex, proven Leidos success in the cyber market and our tangible ability to double down on technical differentiation, full-spectrum cyber is a key piece of our 5 North Star 2030 growth pillars.\nWe've also foreseen the cyber risk from AI adoption that creates even more vulnerabilities and attack surfaces for bad actors. Over the past 5 years, we've invested more than $75 million of our own R&D to develop patented technologies that change the cyber paradigm. Our pending acquisition brings additional exquisite cyber capabilities to strengthen our cyber growth pillar. Their expertise in vulnerability research, reverse engineering, exploit development and the converging cyber electronic warfare markets are squarely in line with our cyber strategy.\nOur acquisition is focused on the DoD and the intelligence communities with deep roots in DARPA as well. This delivers to us a unique, additional, active, value-added role in the cutting-edge future of cybersecurity technologies for national security. Leidos will leverage this acquisition both directly for our customers and in support of enhanced, informed and resilient defensive solutions across our own corporation. The acquisition will add to our deep pool of cyber talent and strengthen our competitive position in the $15 billion worth of pure cyber opportunities in our pipeline and even more across the related network and cloud pursuits.\nAs this is the first acquisition under my watch, I want to make it clear that when I do deploy capital inorganically, this is precisely the kind of move you can expect us to make, focused, technology-rich companies in the wheelhouse of 1 of our 5 growth pillars, poised for rapid integration into Leidos with a strong value unlock formula.\nAnother very positive sign for our new NorthStar strategy is the administration's willingness to collaborate with industry to drive better performance across government. I've sought out and secured more meetings with cabinet members and key administration executives in the last month than I was able to secure during the whole of the last administration. And we're seeing significant receptivity in those meetings to big ideas we are bringing forward. One of these big ideas is also one of the administration's highest priorities: establishing our nation's next-generation air traffic control system.\nAir traffic management in the U.S. is highly fragmented with multiple outdated systems and technologies with an overreliance on human intuition and intervention. We are deeply aligned with the FAA's mission. For years, we have invested millions of dollars to develop and deploy both in the United States and overseas essential capabilities for achieving optimal cost-effective air traffic control outcomes. These investments are fueled by our comprehensive understanding of the complex environment, mission-critical requirements and innovation needs, putting us in a great position to help transform the performance and safety of the U.S. air travel for decades to come.\nAdditionally, our Defense Systems team is moving out quickly on one of the Pentagon's top priorities: building a next-generation multilayer mission defense shield, or Golden Dome. From the moment that executive order was signed, we have been actively collaborating with key Golden Dome customers and stakeholders. With the administration's attention on the significance of the space domain for Golden Dome, Leidos stands very well positioned to contribute meaningfully to this mission. Our space-based sensing and tracking capabilities are deployed and in production for low earth orbit missions across all tranches of the FDA's tracking layer. At the same time, we are working to expand our role within the broader proliferated warfighter space architecture.\nGolden Dome also requires an underlayer to defend against land and surface launch threats, such as cruise missiles and swarming drones, which can originate from virtually anywhere and strike with limited response time. Notably, we already lead the rapid production and deployment of the Army's latest air and missile defense capability, which plays a vital role in the defense of Guam, a strategic stronghold essential for deterring threats in the Pacific. And we are already getting interest in potential deployments to defend the continental United States and key infrastructure and installations within the U.S.\nWhile we expect greater specificity regarding the Golden Dome opportunity to be outlined in the President's 2026 budget request, early funding signals in both the space and underlayer domain are very encouraging, and again, supportive of our growth pillar.\nSo in summary, I'm thrilled to be out of the blocks with a strong set of Q1 results. We're confirming our 2025 guidance. I'm excited to be in execution mode on 2030 strategy. We're very well positioned as this administration drives its agenda of making government outcomes smarter and more efficient. I hope you all can feel the productive sense of urgency with which we're approaching this exciting next chapter in our history. Today, more than ever, our mission is compelling, our strategy is clear and our opportunities are growing.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Chris to walk through our results for the first quarter and our outlook for fiscal year 2025. Chris?\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Our impressive start to the year is the result of the resiliency and tenacity of our entire team. In the first quarter, we maintained the exceptional level of performance delivered in 2024 while navigating an intensified macro environment. We worked proactively with customers to bring forward innovative ideas and never took our eyes off execution.\nI think that it's clear that the diversity of our portfolio relative to peers benefits us now more than ever, creating fruitful inroads to support a wide range of enduring missions and at the same time, providing insulation from meaningful industry shifts. Execution was strong across the entire portfolio. Three of our segments delivered solid mid- to high single-digit growth and Commercial & International posted double-digit growth for the second straight quarter. This broad-based performance enabled another quarter of exceptional earnings, well above initial expectations.\nWith that, let's dive into the details, starting with the income statement on Slide 7. Revenues for the first quarter were $4.25 billion, up 7% organically year-over-year. Bottom line performance continues to be a key focus, and it shows. Adjusted EBITDA was $601 million for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 190 basis points to 14.2%. Non-GAAP net income was $391 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.97, up 25% and 30%, respectively.\nTurning to the segment drivers on Slide 8. National security and digital revenues increased 5% year-over-year. We're seeing traction on the new contract awards from the second half of 2024 as well as additional tasking on some of our franchise programs. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 10.1% was in line with the prior year quarter. Health & Civil revenues increased 8% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating income margin was 23.6%. Continued strong demand in our managed health business, 1 of the 5 growth pillars in our NorthStar 2030 strategy, drove the bulk of the revenue and income growth, though the entire portfolio performed ahead of plan.\nCommercial & International revenues increased 12% year-over-year from robust deliveries in SES, continued strong performance in commercial energy and increased volumes within the U.K. business, including reaching a critical milestone on 1 of the challenged programs from last year. Non-GAAP operating margins were 8.5%, up 20 basis points year-over-year.\nFinally, Defense Systems revenues increased 7% over the prior year quarter, driven by increased activity in our space sensing and hypersonic programs. Non-GAAP operating margins of 9.1% expanded by 110 basis points year-over-year from excellent program execution. This portfolio is buzzing with opportunity from a rapidly maturing portfolio of innovative solutions. And in keeping with that outlook, Defense Systems delivered its third straight quarter with a book-to-bill above 1.\nNow on to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 9. In the quarter, we generated $58 million of cash flows from operating activities and $36 million of free cash flow. DSO for the quarter was 62 days, unchanged from a year ago despite modest customer delays from the administration transition.\nLet me provide a little context around cash performance. The first quarter of 2025 included an extra week of payroll, which hasn't happened since 2019. Also, we made a minor change in our cash accounting treatment effective this quarter. We now exclude outstanding payments from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and statement of cash flows. This presentation is more aligned to industry practice and will enhance the predictability of our cash flow with no change to DSO or the income statement. The new policy had an immaterial impact to cash flow for the quarter, and today's press release has recast 2024 financials for this change.\nTo start this year, we made a series of three coordinated moves to solidify our balance sheet and allocate capital aggressively with conviction in our strategy. First, we issued $500 million of 7-year notes and $500 million of 10-year notes with fixed rates of 5.4% and 5.5%, respectively, using the proceeds to repay the $500 million bond due in May. Second, we took advantage of the persistent market dislocation and executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. And third, we targeted and signed a definitive agreement to acquire a fantastic company to strengthen our cyber golden boats and our digital modernization and cyber growth pillar.\nWhile the additional debt and higher interest rates add about $30 million of interest expense this year, the share repurchase and pending accretive acquisition more than offset the earnings impact and significantly enhance our financial and strategic position for the future.\nWe ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of debt for a gross leverage ratio of 2.3x. We also had $842 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter end. Though we still have ample capacity for additional capital deployment, given the current environment, we feel comfortable holding cash in the short term. As we get more clarity through the coming quarters, we expect to further allocate capital, potentially paying down some of our term loans, repurchasing additional shares or completing additional accretive bolt-on acquisitions to generate long-term shareholder value.\nMoving to the forward outlook on Slide 10. Tom and I are confident in the enduring missions we serve for our customers. Most of what we do is essential to the customers, their constituencies and the nation. No legislator wants to see the sensitive systems vulnerable to hackers or veterans unable to receive their benefits. For example, our exceptional Q1 performance derisks the potential unknowns in this volatile environment. So we are reaffirming our initial guidance of revenue between $16.9 billion to $17.3 billion adjusted EBITDA guidance in the mid- to high 12% range, non-GAAP diluted EPS between $10.35 and $10.75 and operating cash flow of approximately $1.45 billion for the year. This guidance does not include the pending cyber acquisition, although we expect the partial year revenue and EPS contribution to be relatively immaterial to 2025 financials.\nConsistent with our promises made, promises kept ethos, we take our guidance very seriously. This quarter, we took a clean sheet view of the risks and opportunities in our plan. We believe that our ranges accurately reflect the current realities and contain the foreseeable outcomes.\nRelating to the top line, what we have seen so far has confirmed our belief that the year would begin with relatively soft bookings, as is typical with any change in administration. In the first quarter, we generated $2.1 billion of net bookings to end with a total backlog of $46.3 billion. Our strong finish to 2024 sustains a solid 1.3 book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis.\nYou'll note that our backlog is up about $3 billion from what we reported last quarter. At the beginning of the year, we adjusted our backlog policy to include the expected value of single-award IDIQs. We believe this approach provides enhanced visibility for investors and more accurately captures the health of the business. Absent the change, this quarter's bookings would have increased slightly. You can find the recast quarterly bookings and backlog for 2024 in our press release.\nWith a robust opportunity pipeline of $226 billion, including $25 billion proposals submitted and awaiting adjudication, we remain confident in our awards prospects for the back half of the year. But history suggests those wins will be more impactful to 2026 revenue than 2025. The midpoint of our revenue guidance implies $120 million of growth above our Q1 run rate, which is prudent based on current conditions. And as we look beyond this exciting pivot year for Leidos, we're confident in our NorthStar 2030 path ahead.\nWith that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

Welcome to Leidos Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I will turn the conference over to Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call.\nJoining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO; and Chris Cage, our CFO. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we're using today.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation.

Finally, as shown on Slide 3, will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy you could join us to discuss another outstanding quarter for Leidos, capping off a very strong year, delivering 2024 results above the high end of our prior guidance.\nLeidos' excellent recent performance also allowed us to reach and exceed the 3-year performance targets we set out at our Investor Day in 2021. I'm very pleased we were able to over deliver on those cumulative commitments. Against the target set then, we delivered an organic revenue growth CAGR of 6.6% and well above our goal. We delivered adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024 of 12.9%, 240 basis points above our goal. And we drove free cash flow conversion of 100% exactly on our commitment. This delivered cumulative operating cash flow to our target of $3.5 billion.\nOur excellent multiyear performance enabled us to take our gross debt leverage ratio down from 3.4x to 2.2x today. And now our strong balance sheet and core financial engine give us the financial flexibility to deploy capital to support tangible growth initiatives and drive brilliant shareholder value.\nAll on this call will be aware that since 12 November, our stock has traded down about 25%. As a result, we repurchased an additional $400 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter. That brought our open market repurchases for 2024 to $850 million, significantly exceeding our initial commitment.\nAs always, I want to thank each of our 48,000 Leidosians who bring our bold vision for Leidos to life every day. Their passion for our customers' mission, their fortitude, resilience and ingenuity enable us to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders even in the most dynamic of environments.\nTurning to Slide 5. In addition to delivering exceptional performance last year, 2024 was a year of deep strategic thinking. We're calling our new growth strategy, North Star 2030. North Star 2030 keys on a specific group of growth pillars, where we know customer needs are growing, market profitability is robust and Leidos differentiation is evident and accelerating. We'll fully unpack our North Star 2030 strategy for you at our upcoming Investors Day. But undertaking this strategy effort last year is proving to have been timed perfectly. I mentioned all this now because a natural question today might be, how does North Star 2030 hold up to the priorities of this new administration? And the answer is incredibly well.\nYou'll recall that our strategy process last year was grounded in a 10-year future-backed Leidos proprietary hypothesis of the future. That work detailed macro domestic and geopolitical mega trends that we predicted would occur over the next decade. Now we see those mega trends coming through at pace. And therefore, we are even more confident our growth pillars position us for success today and in the future because they are all grounded in one unifying theme.\nLeidos exists to make our customers' outcomes smarter and more efficient. Everything we do for every one of our customers is linked to that statement. We were created to leverage innovation for our customers to meet the immense and enduring national security challenges faced by America and its allies, from protecting the Homeland to deterring and winning battles abroad, and driving government efficiency is fundamental to everything we do. And of course, that's what's needed to expand America's economic strength.\nAll that is what we are all about. And that's exactly what our new administration is all about, too. Therefore, we view the new administration's priorities as an opportunity for Leidos. Over the past months, the administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have begun to unveil an agenda to transform government operations and ensure taxpayer dollars are invested more wisely. This has given us increased confidence in our strategy.\nThe new administration has signaled a focus on eliminating regulations, streamlining procurement and moving to more outcome-based contracting, all of which are exactly in line with the mission and work of Leidos to make government smarter and more efficient.\n3 current focus areas are right in our wheelhouse: IT modernization, transformational war fighting capability and increased privatization. First, the new administration has said that IT modernization is low-hanging fruit for government efficiency. We totally agree. The federal government's ability to reduce costs, bridge outdated [ and desperate ] data silos and facilitate the adoption of enabling technologies like trusted mission hinges on having modern, adaptable IT systems. As the leading provider of IT software solutions for the federal government, we have a proven track record of modernizing and simplifying our customers' complex IT environments, while integrated trust [ and mission ] AI and robust cybersecurity. This allows agencies to achieve their mission objectives smarter, faster and cheaper.\nFor example, the disability case processing system we built for the Social Security Administration has improved processing time of disability claims by over 90%, reducing backlog by over 50% and increasing the accuracy of benefit calculations by 20%. Leidos is delivering significant cost savings to the SSA through these customer efficiency enhancements and proven anti-fraud tools. In addition, just last year, we also transformed the SSA's National 1-800 number. In just 48 days, we reduced wait times by almost 75% for over 80 million callers each year.\nThe administration's focus on IT modernization also affords us a great refreshed opportunity to accelerate adoption of our existing Defense Enclave Services program. To date, we've successfully transitioned only 3 defense agency and field activities, or [ DAFAS ], and their 32,000 users, each on time and on budget. As a result, those DoD offices now enjoy better user experiences and better service delivery. But even more importantly, they are now operating seamlessly within a single robust fiber secure, efficient integrated DoD IT system. But there are 11 [ DAFAS ] and nearly 330,000 additional users originally envisioned to be served by this program that are yet to be migrated.\nWe look forward to helping our new Secretary of Defense greatly enhance user efficiency, hardened IT assets and reduce costs by completing the remaining migrations to DISA's standardized, unified and secured IT network. In turn, this will enable DoD reinvestment of real savings into critical war-fighting capabilities.\nSo speaking of critical war-fighting capabilities; secondly, administration leadership has indicated that the Pentagon's top line budget should focus on the right kind of programs with increased investments in cost-effective and high-performance systems. In anticipation of these demands, we have positioned ourselves as a positive disruptor, rapidly transforming invative ideas into market-ready solutions essential for next-generation war-fighting capabilities.\nFor example, we lead the way in maritime autonomy. We recently developed an unmanned undersea multi-mission vessel in less than 18 months. With a price that is, to the best of our knowledge, significantly lower than all comparable offerings. This success has enabled the Navy to expand our program size and scope, allowing us to enhance underwater ISR capabilities and develop multisensor UUVs and other unmanned platforms.\nWe also designed and deployed a small unmanned surface vehicle called Archer. Archer is equipped with a modular mission bay designed for anything, contested logistics, ISR or weaponry. And we did all that in less than 9 months. Archer provides the U.S. and our allies with immediate access to flexible, advanced maritime designs with proven long endurance robust autonomous capabilities.\nAdditionally, we're developing a new class of small cruise missiles, advancing from concept to successful demonstration flights in under 2 years. And we're achieving dramatic cost savings for this critical capability through a modular design, featuring open architecture that incorporates the best most affordable subsystems and technologies using digital twin philosophies and AI optimization.\nThese groundbreaking developments highlight our defense system team's focus on delivering affordable mass war-fighting capabilities with unmatched speed efficiency and efficacy, which the DoD needs today to prevail across the increasingly complex and contested domains.\nThird, leaders are calling for expanded public-private partnerships for essential citizen services to create more efficient and effective outcomes. We have deep expertise and success here, too. For instance, for decades, we've partnered with the Veterans Administration to transform the delivery of health care to our nation's deserving veterans.\nWith our proprietary capabilities to anticipate demand and our ability to innovate at scale, we have established the largest, most flexible network of first-class medical and mobile clinics. This has allowed us to increase veteran throughput by more than 300% and have the average exam time line. And we've delivered all this efficiency while consistently exceeding VA targets for both timeliness and critically quality of care. As part of this, we're very proud to deliver excellent care coordination for homebound veterans and those in remote locations, bringing first-class care to where the veteran is across all 50 states.\nThese capabilities magnify Leidos' differentiation and recognition as a top managed health services provider for our federal customers. But our VA work is just one of many examples of successful privatization.\nAnother case study of our success in public-private partnerships is the future flight services program for the FAA. Through this program, we provide critical services to general aviation pilots. By providing this service, we've saved the Federal Aviation Administration more than $2 billion. by significantly modernizing underlying technology, all while maintaining at or above 99.9% system availability.\n2025 will be an exciting year as we implement our new North Star 2030 strategy, and we're already seeing great traction in our robust growth ambitions. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we had net bookings of $7.6 billion, delivering a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7, our highest ever for a December quarter. And 2024 overall was our best growth year since 2020, with an overall book ratio of 1.4 and a year-over-year backlog growth of 18%.\nI'm very proud of the quality of our backlog achieved through many significant wins, all aligned to durable markets and critical customer missions, which in turn, enjoy bipartisan political support.\nLet me walk through a few key awards in the quarter. First, the VA has awarded us a 2-year multibillion-dollar award for medical disability examinations. This award underscores our ongoing ability to deliver excellence for the VA and our nation's veterans. And it aligns with the financial expectations we outlined to you on our last earnings call.\nSecond, we won a $2.6 billion follow-on for our integrated logistics software work for the Transportation Security Administration. This 8-year award comes with significant increases to our contract size and scope and continues to position us very well with the new administration's determined focus on homeland security.\nThird, we received a $4.1 billion sole-source IDIQ for our IFPC Enduring Shield Air Defense System. So far, we've only booked on task order under this IDIQ to provide systems for the defense of Guam. But this IDIQ provides us and our customer all the top line room they need to ramp up production of this critical capability for years to come.\nAnd fourth, we secured a $670 million task order to advance our nation's long-range hypersonic weapon, specifically, our development and production of the common hypersonic glide body and its thermal protection system.\nSo in summary, 2024 was a great year for Leidos. But all that success is just prologue for our exciting future. Enabling disruptive progress is core to our work of making all our customers' outcomes smarter and more efficient. Pure American entrepreneurial spirit was forged at our founding and is alive and growing here today at Leidos. Our passion is to look at problems differently and seek innovative solutions and outstanding customer results. And this drive and culture serve us incredibly well in today's environment.\nOur new administration is moving quickly with its efficiency agenda, and Leidos is positioned to be a major contributor to the success of that agenda. Building on the bold vision of our North Star 2030 strategy and in light of the new administration's priorities and the core competencies I've outlined, we've developed a set of fast-paced initiatives in the spirit of those to make our customers' outcomes smarter and more efficient. And over the next 90 days, we will continue executing a purposeful campaign we've already begun to work with our customers, administration officials and elected representatives on these initiatives for a smarter, more efficient U.S. government now.\nNow is the time for us to act with pace in this new landscape. We are exceptionally well placed to be a critical part of the solution. And so seizing this opportunity remains our top corporate priority. As a result, we look forward to holding our Investor Day this summer. I'm super excited about our proven track record of performance in dynamic environments. Our strong foundation for executing a successful 2025 and beyond, our bold vision for Leidos and our North Star 2030 strategy and our outstanding outlook.\nWith that, I'm going to pass the call over to Chris to walk through our 2024 results and give you our enhanced financial outlook for 2025. Chris?\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Tom's remarks on the remarkable journey we've been on. This team has rallied to over deliver at every turn this quarter, this year and over the past 3 years. These accomplishments are rooted in a meaningful cultural transformation in how we manage and operate our business, which enabled us to deliver outstanding results while building a path to a better future. We delivered industry-leading margins, and we invested to strengthen internal functions, enhanced technical capabilities, doubled down on business development and reward our employees.\nNow let me walk you through our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year. Please turn to Slide 6. Revenue for the quarter was nearly $4.37 billion, for a robust organic growth rate of 9.7%. Although the quarter did include an extra week as part of the normal periodic true-up of our 4-4-5 financial calendar. For the year, total revenue grew 7.9% to $16.66 billion or $212 million above the high end of our prior guidance range.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $508 million for the fourth quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6% was up 20 basis points year-over-year. The fourth quarter margin includes the cost of enhancing some of our employee benefits in light of our strong performance, which rippled through the segment margins as well. On a full year basis, adjusted EBITDA was $2.15 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 210 basis points to 12.9%, putting us right at the upper end of the high 12% guide from last call.\nOur margins have benefited from a fundamental shift in our portfolio. Currently, 43% of our portfolio is fixed price, up from 39% in 2023. As Tom touched on, we view the move to more outcome-based procurement as a continued area of opportunity for Leidos.\nNon-GAAP net income was $316 million for the quarter and $1.4 billion for the year, which generated non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.37 and $10.21, respectively. For the year, non-GAAP diluted EPS was up an impressive 40%, almost $3 above 2023 and $0.21 above the high end of our prior guidance range. The primary driver of the robust EPS growth in 2024, the best in our history, was consistently strong EBITDA generation. Growth was propelled further by our capital deployment as lower share count and interest expense more than offset a slightly higher tax rate.\nTurning now to an overview of our segment results and key drivers. In the interest of time, I'll focus on the quarterly figures on Slide 7. The full year comparisons are shown on Slide 8. National Security and digital revenue growth accelerated to 5.5%, and spurred by strong business development results in the last 2 quarters. Segment operating income margin slipped a bit to 9.7%, with normal variations in profitability across multiple fixed price programs. Still, margin of 10.2% for the year was above initial expectations, and we look for profitability to continue to increase through repeatable offerings and higher-margin growth pillars.\nHealth and Civil revenues and profitability remained strong. Revenues were up 16.4% from the prior year quarter, and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.6%. These results were driven by high demand in our managed health services as well as excellent program execution across the portfolio. With the VBA MD recompete in hand, we remain confident in our ability to win our fair share by continuing to bring innovative solutions to the VA to more efficiently serve our veterans.\nCommercial and international revenues increased [ 12.3% ] year-over-year with growth across all business areas. Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.9%, down 80 basis points from the prior year quarter due to a product mix within SES and increased investments in growth. Building off this strong top line finish and sunsetting the challenges faced this year in the U.K., we fully expect margins to improve and stabilize going forward.\nLastly, Defense Systems revenues increased 6.7%, spurred by this year's wins like [ Tiago and Whitefield ] Tranche 2 as well as additional production on our IFPC Enduring Shield program. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 3.5%, which included a $21 million write-off associated with an airborne surveillance asset and investments in our proliferated low-earth orbit space architecture. So a short-term pause on the margin momentum built in the second and third quarters, we believe this provides a cleaner and more focused foundation as we enter 2025.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $299 million. DSO for the quarter was 59 days, in line with the third quarter of 2024. For the year, operating cash flow was $1.39 billion, $42 million above our prior guidance. Netting out capital expenditures, free cash flow was $213 million in the quarter and $1.24 billion for the year, which was up 30% compared to 2023.\nIn the fourth quarter, we repurchased $406 million worth of shares and paid $53 million in dividends. As Tom mentioned, we significantly exceeded our $500 million annual share repurchase commitment, keeping our promise to deploy capital in a shareholder-friendly manner. As of quarter end, we had $943 million in cash and cash equivalents, $4.7 billion in debt and a leverage ratio of 2.2x gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA.\nOur healthy balance sheet and financial performance led S&P to enhance our investment-grade rating to BBB flat and Moody's to change their outlook to positive with the potential to upgrade to Baa1 within the next 12 months. These moves strengthen our position as we prepare for the maturation of a $500 million bond this May. We are still weighing our options but given our below target leverage, our current intention is to refinance this debt.\nNow on to the forward outlook on Slide 10. Coming off a record breaking 2024, we're even more confident in our market positioning and pathways for profitable growth. Recent wins create a strong growth footing, and our pipeline is robust. We submitted $8.3 billion of proposals in the quarter and have $25.6 billion of bids awaiting adjudication. With broad-based momentum building, we are confident in our ability to navigate any macro uncertainties from a position of strength.\nGetting to the specifics. For 2025, we expect revenues between $16.9 million and $17.3 billion, reflecting growth of up to 4% over fiscal year 2024, consistent with our prior messaging of low single-digit growth, but off of a much higher 2024 baseline. Our guidance accounts for the ongoing continuing resolution and a continued pivot away from low-margin work. We anticipate fairly balanced revenue growth across the segments.\nWe're guiding 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid- to high 12% range, stronger than our prior expectations. We remain committed to margin expansion over the long term and see potential for higher profitability in all of our segments over time. We're guiding non-GAAP diluted EPS between $10.35 and $10.75, which assumes an effective tax rate of 23.5% to 24%. And share repurchase activity, roughly consistent with last year.\nIn terms of cash, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.45 billion, from a free cash flow perspective, we're targeting capital expenditures of approximately $230 million or about 1.3% of revenues. This generation provides plenty of capital to allocate while also funding growth investments.\nWith that, operator, we're ready for questions."

Welcome to Leidos Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. .\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFinally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you all again today to report a record quarter for Leidos. In this quarter, organic growth remained strong, achieving a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.5%. Year-to-date, we've delivered industry-leading profitable growth with adjusted diluted EPS 50% higher than last year. The team is doing an excellent job converting our earnings into cash. In turn, this has allowed us to continue to deploy capital to grow shareholder value per our plan. We're now halfway through our commitment to repurchase $500 million worth of shares this year. I'm also proud of the fact that this robust first half of 2024 allows us to once again raise guidance for the full year. Chris will give you a complete update on our financials, and our guidance later in the call.\nOne year ago, on my first call with you all, I laid out 4 focus areas to begin Leidos' journey to best-in-class performance. Instilling in Leidos, a promises made, promises kept culture, sharpening our strategy, improving the performance of previous acquisitions, and enhancing our ability to win new business. I'd like to take this opportunity to update you on the meaningful progress we're making in these areas. I see this progress as foundational to putting ourselves in a great position to execute our forthcoming Leidos North Star strategy.\nFirst, our team has fully embraced a promises made, promises kept philosophy. As part of this, we've made a firm commitment to each other to drive operational improvement, profitable growth and robust cash conversion. The evidence of this culture taking hold is clearly visible in the 12-month trend of our results and our second quarter results summarized earlier that are simply our best yet.\nOur currently strong and strengthening balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to continue to allocate capital prudently over time to grow shareholder value. Further share repurchases this year are possible. But at the same time, I must say that our new North Star strategy work is beginning to bring into focus exciting and compelling growth opportunities potentially worthy of investment. This brings me to that second focus area creating our new North Star strategy. While we continue to deliver robust in-year program execution, we are also aggressively prosecuting our year of deep strategic thinking and the energy and insights that are beginning to come into focus because of our purposeful strategy process are very intriguing.\nWe've now completed work on the Leidos proprietary hypothesis of the future. Our own exclusive prediction of the challenges our customers will face, the solutions those challenges will require and the technologies we must create and harness to best differentiate our solutions for our customers. Informed by our hypothesis of the future, we're now halfway through crafting a new business strategy for Leidos. This strategy will both leverage and enhance our current core businesses and uniquely position us for outstanding success in the future we foresee.\nOne clear component of our strategy will remain our focus on technical differentiators, our golden bolts. Technological innovation is and will remain a cornerstone of Leidos. And our enterprise-wide technology investments are now more than 1% of total revenue and growing. At our recent Investor Technology Day, we went in depth on 1 of those golden bolts, trusted mission AI. Those of you who were able to join us witnessed firsthand, our brilliant team in action demonstrating how we use trusted mission AI to drive productive disruption across our customers' missions.\nWe believe that when it comes to AI, the mission is the market. So everything we do as the #1 provider of IT to the federal government and the #8 U.S. defense contractor is an opportunity to exploit and deploy trusted mission AI for our customers' mission benefit. Another area of proactive investment for us remains cybersecurity. For instance, we've been investing in Zero Trust for years before there was a requirement for it to be adopted by federal agencies. As a result, over the last 3 years, we've received more than $5 billion of awards that cite our Zero Trust methodology as a differentiated strength.\nWe're currently pioneering the application of Quantum Technologies to enable highly secured networks. We're executing contract R&D for DARPA in this area and investing in post-quantum encryption technologies and solutions. These will ensure our customers can rapidly respond to future developments in quantum computing. These examples give you some understanding of our forward-looking approach to the market and our track record of investing ahead of demand.\nThird, we're on track to unlock the strategic value from the large acquisitions we made in 2020 and 2021, specifically Dynetics and security, detection and automation. On Dynetics, we have doubled down on 3 specific areas. Each of these now on a robust positive trajectory. In satellite payloads, we're a key supplier to the Space Development Agency's wide field of view sensor program within its proliferated war fighting space architecture. We have delivered all our payloads for tranche Zero and those payloads were the first ones in low earth orbit, providing FDA actual on-orbit imagery.\nIn addition, we remain on track to deliver our Tranche 1 payloads in early 2025. And we are teamed with Sierra Space to be their payload provider on their tranche 2 birds. The Space Development Agency has recently issued their RFI for tranche 3. So in sum, we believe our current comprehensive role on all 3 existing tranches and our current actual emission performance in space position us well to continue to deliver for this critical and expanding mission. On force protection, we've delivered 14 if pick and during Shield prototypes, which are successfully working their way through government testing.\nThe Army recognizes this system's unrivaled air defense capability, and we expect to receive awards soon to begin low rate production in 2025 and full rate production in 2026. And in hypersonics, the United States continues to progress in developing and fielding hypersonic weapons. Leidos is supporting this progress by developing -- delivering technology advances through our common hypersonic glide body and MOCTV programs. These programs play a critical role in accelerating the pace and scale at which we can produce, test, assess, advance and field our nation's hypersonics capabilities. We remain on track for our common hypersonic glide body and thermal protection systems delivery.\nAnd all in all, we feel quite positive about this robust pipeline of opportunities in hypersonics. So 2024 maintains its promise to be a good year for the maturation of these programs. And we're also seeing our focus here translate into better financial performance. Our Defense Systems profitability was double digits in the quarter, our first time at that level of performance from as far back as we recast financials in the new organizational structure. Turning to security products. The SD&A acquisition is now fully integrated into our SES business area. Though challenges remain, SES is on sound footing because of the swift actions of our new management team and that they took last year.\nWe have focused our efforts and investments in product lines and geographies that make the most sense for Leidos and therefore, our shareholders. Our new Charleston manufacturing facility is up and operational and we're performing better against our service level agreements with our customers. We've had solid bookings this year and more consistent deliveries of large border solutions. As a result, SES is ahead of plan for revenue and earnings for the quarter and the year. SES revenues are up 11% year-to-date, and we've achieved almost 90% of last year's non-GAAP profit in the first 2 quarters of 2024 alone.\nA common theme of this improved acquisition performance is the new organizational structure, which brings better alignment of sector resources and new leadership with an increased emphasis on execution and promises made, promises kept. Fourth, we continue to make significant progress to enhance our business capture performance and backlog quality. We've achieved net bookings of $4 billion this quarter with a heavy emphasis on cyber and Digimo awards with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0. We also have nearly $3 billion of awards currently under protest. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $36.5 billion, including $8 billion of funded backlog.\nWhile this quarter's performance adequately supports our 2024 growth commitments, we are not at all satisfied. And our growth teams have been working diligently to reignite our winning ways here at Leidos and do much better on top line growth soon. An element of this is strengthening our customer-centric framework of account management. Over the past 6 months, we've hired dozens of key account managers and frontline growth leaders each with deep mission and customer expertise in areas of strategic importance.\nEach of our account managers have a front-line obsession and seamlessly integrate across both our P&Ls and our office of technology to ensure we couple best-in-class teams with best-in-class technical solutions. Two examples which illustrate this point are our recent hires for IndoPaycom and Aukus. Because of their respective hard work in very short order, we've won strategic awards to support military exercises that are fundamental to the U.S. Pacific deterrent strategy. Maritime Autonomy and underseas sensors work in Australia and hypersonics work in the U.K. that fit within Aukus Pillar 2.\nAnd U.S. Navy submarine trainer development efforts that fit within Aukus Pillar 1. We've taken the further step of dedicating some 100 of our top engineers and solution architects to our frontline growth efforts. Operating in full partnership with our account managers and capture teams, they are positioned to bring the best of the best of Leidos to our customer needs. With the improvements we're making in the growth value stream, we are getting set up for a much better business capture performance in the future. At quarter's end, we had $26 billion worth of bids awaiting adjudication. And more importantly, quality is improving dramatically. Our pursuits are more aligned with our strategic direction, our proposals demonstrate greater customer understanding, and we are doing better at pulling through enterprise-wide technical expertise into each customer solution.\nSo in summary, I'm very pleased with our financial results this quarter and the momentum that we're carrying into the back of the year. We're making great progress on our current 4 focus areas. This puts us in an excellent position to execute our emerging Leidos North Star strategy. I'm very proud of the 48,000 Leidos teammates who collectively every day and sure Leidos is making smart smarter for the benefit of our customers. And I'm honored that every day more and more of the best of the best, we could smart people in the nation, join Leidos to break limits. I'll now turn the call over to Chris to walk you through our financial results in detail. He'll also provide insight into our upgraded outlook for the year, and then we'll be pleased to take your questions. Chris?\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our second quarter results demonstrate yet again the power of our focus on profitable growth and cash generation. With clear intent, our team is driving current financial performance while also building for a more prosperous future. Turning to the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the second quarter were $4.13 billion, up 7.7% year-over-year. .\nRobust revenue growth reflects the benefits of both the strong demand environment and historically low levels of attrition. The highlight for the quarter was margin performance. Adjusted EBITDA was $559 million for the quarter, up 33% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 260 basis points to 13.5%. We achieved this record margin through business mix and intra cost management. Program level execution was generally very strong, but EAC adjustments were a net $12 million headwind -- non-GAAP net income was $360 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.63, up 43% and 46%, respectively.\nBelow the line items had no material impact on net income or EPS. Turning to the segment view on Slide 6. National security and digital revenues increased 1% year-over-year. We saw volume growth on our Sentinel and DES programs as well as several contracted research and development efforts. You may also recall that last year, we had spikes in some of our large digital modernization programs notably NGEN and Aegis, which created a tough year-over-year comparison. National Security and Digital is also the segment most impacted by protest.\nStill, accelerating growth in national security and digital is a major focus of the ongoing strategy discussion. National Security and Digital non-GAAP operating income margin increased 20 basis points from the prior year quarter to 10.4%, with some milestone achievements, strong cost control and excellent program execution. For the first half of the year, national security and digital has been solidly ahead of plan on profitability. Health and Civil revenues increased 22% over the prior year quarter, and non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 24.9%, up from 14% a year ago.\nThe primary driver of revenue growth and increased profitability was higher volumes across our managed health services portfolio and an extra quarter of catch-up on incentive fee awards on our DBA disability exam contracts. Commercial and international revenues increased 3%, paced by an uptick in deliveries on security products, higher volumes in our commercial energy business and a hardware refresh in our Australian IT business. These drivers offset $39 million of write-downs in our U.K. business, primarily on 2 fixed-price mission software development programs caused by changing requirements and scheduled slippages.\nThe U.K. write-down suppressed non-GAAP operating income margin to 0.7% in the quarter. Absent these write-downs, commercial international would have posted 9.7% year-over-year revenue growth and non-GAAP operating income margins of 8%. Although these write-downs are disappointing, they underscore the rationale for the new organizational structure. The C&I team is bringing greater focus on programmatic execution within the international portfolio, and they quickly took action to ensure the long-term success of our U.K. operations.\nWe're confident that we'll get back on track towards our financial and operational objectives within the U.K. And on balance, we remain encouraged by the strong performance and demand signals across our Commercial and International segment. Finally, in Defense Systems, revenues increased 6% over the prior year quarter on a total basis and 7% organically. And non-GAAP operating income margins increased 170 basis points year-over-year to 10.3%. Tom touched on the improvements the segments making on program execution and it is good to see the kind of financial performance that we expected from this portfolio.\nAs we transition from development to production on some key programs, we see Defense Systems as a growth and margin driver for Leidos. We're making great strides towards unlocking the full potential of this business and are optimistic that 2024 marks a significant turning point towards a brighter future.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We generated $374 million of cash flows from operating activities and $351 million of free cash flow. We had our highest collection week ever, which led to the exceptional Q2 performance. Overall, we're seeing a strong focus on cash throughout the organization. DSOs for the quarter was 58 days, an improvement of 1 day from a year ago and 4 days sequentially. In Q2, we repurchased a total of $114 million in shares, including $100 million on the open market and paid $51 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $823 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.7 billion of debt. Our gross leverage ratio now sits at 2.4x, which gives us plenty of financial flexibility.\nNext, I'll go through our enhanced outlook for 2024 on Slide 8. We're raising the lower end of our revenue guidance by $100 million, which gives a new range of $16.1 billion to $16.4 billion. We're increasing adjusted EBITDA guidance to approximately 12% and we're raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.20 to a new range of $8.60 to $9. Our guidance for operating cash flow remains at approximately $1.3 billion for the year. This enhanced outlook reflects our strong first half performance as well as broad-based momentum across the entire portfolio.\nBut let me walk you through some of the drivers of the second half performance for we're modeling. Clearly, we're seeing strong momentum in our managed health services business. Last call, we signaled some potential second half revenue and margin headwind in our VBA disability exam business based on an upcoming recompete, which remains ahead of us. In addition, the unprecedented caseload of disability claims spurred by the PACT Act is straining the VA's budget resources.\nEarlier this month, the VA urged Congress to approve $15 billion to fund budget gaps in government fiscal year '24 and 2025, or risk cuts to veterans benefits and care. The VVA customer has implemented several measures to proactively manage through these budget challenges, including dialing back its internal staffing, which suppresses industry case volume. We're already seeing the impact of this change with reductions in our near-term case backlog. Given that veterans benefits work is funded through mandatory, not discretionary budgets, and caring for veterans as broad bipartisan support, we expect underlying case load to rebound in our fourth quarter.\nNotwithstanding this temporary funding issue, we stand ready to continue to deliver exceptional service to the nation's service members as a trusted mission partner to the VA. We expect commercial and international margins to snap back in the second half and for national security and digital margins to moderate somewhat consistent with our commentary on the last 2 calls. And lastly, in the back half of the year, we've stood up a robust innovation fund focused on growth. Our bottom line performance puts us in a favorable position to accelerate investments across the business as seed corn for our emerging strategy to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth.\nWith that, operator, we're ready to take some questions."

A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. It's very good to be with you again today. And I'm thrilled to report a very robust start for Leidos in 2024, a substantial raise to our full year guidance and some additional detail around the purposeful steps we're taking to position Leidos for an awesome future.\nThe Leidos team got out of the starting blocks impressively this year, addressing our customers' most vexing challenges with passion and pace. And as a result, delivering an excellent quarter of top and bottom line results.\nFirst quarter revenue grew 7.5% year-over-year, all organically. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.3%, a record for Leidos. And year-over-year non-GAAP EPS grew 56%. These results demonstrate that our new capability-based organization is unlocking significant value across the company. With good cash generation, as promised, we began our 2024 stock buyback program by repurchasing $150 million worth of shares on the open market during the quarter.\nYou'll remember that during our last earnings call, I framed our initial 2024 guidance against the backdrop of a very good year for Leidos in 2023 and a very uncertain 2024 customer budget environment. Happily, since then, the House and Senate have passed appropriations for all the federal government. And now with funding in place, our customers have the resources and direction they need to confidently execute their missions.\nWith that certainty in our customers' budget, the quick success of our organizational realignment and our team's strong start to the year, we have increased confidence in our near-term growth prospects. As such, we are significantly increasing our 2024 guidance and now expect to far exceed our previous multi-year financial commitments. Chris will detail our new 2024 guidance later in the call.\nAs I round out my first year at the helm of Leidos, I remain impressed with the capability of our people to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Over the last 4 quarters, revenue has grown 8% and non-GAAP EPS has grown 25%. We've delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.5% and free cash flow conversion of 109%. And we've maintained rigorous investments in IRAD and business development.\nI'm very pleased that we've been able to refine the conversation about what's possible here at Leidos, especially around profitability. Leidos is indeed a healthy business. So for the remainder of my prepared remarks, I'd like to share some additional details about the purposeful steps we are taking to position Leidos for an awesome future.\nWe are achieving and propelling superior profitable growth by focusing on 3 key elements: first, continuing to unlock full value and flawless execution in our new capabilities focused organization. second, increasing investment in distinct organic disruptive technologies; and third, developing a robust value-creating merit-based Leidos profit and growth strategy.\nLet me walk through each of these elements with you. First, we're very happy with the quick wins we're achieving from our capability-based organizational realignment. And we're anticipating that this move will continue to unlock significant value going forward. For example, by consolidating our commercial and international business into a single segment for the first time, we're now better able to truly serve our global customers.\nIn February, I had the opportunity to attend the Munich Security Conference. It was a sobering affair, which made abundantly clear that pervasive global threats are, in fact, growing and our collective efforts to help our allies and partners are becoming even more crucial.\nTo give you an idea of where and how the new Leidos can help, global battlefields of the future demand ever more custom interoperability and leading-edge technical solutions. As we collaborate with our customers and allies around the world, we gain valuable insights into their interconnected issues across borders.\nOur realignment which integrates all our international customer touch points into one organization enables us to better correlate and quickly respond with a whole of Leidos solution to their critical emerging needs. Also, globally, the AUKUS trilateral security partnership represents a unique opportunity for Leidos as Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. seek to work even more closely together.\nThe focus of AUKUS Pillar 2 is seamless information sharing, AI and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonics, and electronic warfare. This list reads like a catalog of Leidos strength. We believe Leidos through our new Commercial International segment is uniquely positioned to serve these ambitions like no other. Second, we will continue to accelerate investment in distinct organic disrupt technologies.\nOn my first earnings call, I highlighted technology innovation as a core of Leidos. Nearly a year into this role, I can confidently reaffirm that the technology prowess at Leidos is impressive, broad and deep.\nContinually sharpening our portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, what I call golden bolts to lead turn the market or remain foundational to our North Star. At Leidos, innovation is everywhere, but we have a particular passion and focus on remaining best-in-class in technologies, trusted mission AI, full-spectrum cyber, and secure rapid software.\nIn each, we maintain a robust IRAD pipeline in what we call accelerators, staffed with incredibly smart people who work across the entire customer solution set. And we combine the resulting immense organic technical prowess with a best-in-class commercial partnership program to truly bring making smarter to life.\nLet's talk about one of these accelerators. Trusted mission AI spans the breadth of our portfolio and is integral in practically all our customer solutions. Our trusted mission AI solutions work as a partner to humans, transforming the way we deliver high-quality, rapid and secure outcomes for our customers' most complex missions.\nFor example, across the intelligence community, we have several large classified contracts where we're leveraging trusted mission AI to exploit vast amounts of data to address ever-changing national security challenges.\nIn the cyber realm, our team of experts has spent the last 3 years developing the next generation of defensive cyber tools. These tools use AI to automate the discovery of new vulnerabilities and the development of novel defenses. This unique solution allows us to proactively deploy defenses before attacks occur. Crucial in foreseeing, averting and defeating cyber risks.\nIn Defense Systems, trusted mission AI is the enabling technology that anchors all our autonomy work. We've built the first generation of autonomous vessels for the U.S. Navy, several of which recently transited the Pacific twice as part of a manned, unmanned task force, and we're now applying this proven trusted mission AI technology to the next generation of unmanned surface vessels.\nIn software and IT, we're leveraging our exclusive relationships with key emerging technology providers to bring the best of the latest generation of generative AI to our customers. This enables us to uniquely position our customers to operate more efficiently, delivering real quantifiable impact.\nLet me share a couple of examples here. Our partnership with [ Source Graft ] leverages their commercial cutting-edge, Gen AI coding assistant to transform the way we develop software in just a few months, by combining our unparalleled government customer knowledge with their tools power, we've proven productivity increases in software development of one third. And we know these solutions are deployable even into the most secure customer environments.\nOur exclusive partnership with [ Moveworks ] gives us a differentiated ability to bring our customers the best in Gen AI-based IT service desk solutions. We've already deployed their technology within the Leidos IT environment and have completely automated processing of thousands service requests.\nOur focus on integrating trusted mission AI into our customer solutions rather than just selling AI labor positions us uniquely to meet the growing demand for AI solutions across our customers. I trust these examples begin to give you a sense of our leadership position in all our golden bolts, but especially trusted mission AI. But if you'd like to see more of our solutions in action and meet some of our wicked smart people, I invite you to an investor's event, we will be hosting here at our global headquarters in [ Reston ], on 12 June.\nFinally, I'd like to give you an update on the development of our strategy for Leidos' second decade of growth. As I mentioned during our last call, this is a year of deep formally structured strategic conversations across the whole of the business. And while this effort will not be complete until early next year, I did want to share with you now some high-level principles that are guiding our work.\nPrinciples of our upcoming strategy will be doubling down on our core strengths, seeking to exploit the power of repeatable business models, making speed a conscious competitive discriminator, differentially investing in the areas of greatest potential, building trusted mission AI into everything we do, and uncovering unique opportunities to expand Leidos into logical, closely adjacent growth markets.\nThese guiding principles will enable us to stay true to what we do best. While being quick to respond to the opportunities that are emerging at pace in our market. Also of note, importantly, as we think about our strategy, we will continue to view our balance sheet and cash generation capacity as key strategic assets. I remain committed to a disciplined capital management and deployment policy continuing a focus on shareholder returns in the near term.\nIn closing, we're off to a great start this fiscal year. We are committed to building on our successes and deliver smarter outcomes for our customers, shareholders and each other. As we continue to push the boundaries and challenge ourselves to think bigger, I am confident that 2024 will be Leidos' best year so far. We'll see tremendous achievements and a crystallizing compelling growth strategy.\nWith that, I'll pass the call to Chris to discuss our financial results for the first quarter and our financial promises to you for the full year.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. The first quarter operating in our new organization was a great one, far surpassing our initial expectations. While Health and Civil was a standout, each segment's relentless focus on innovation and operational efficiency led to above-plan performance in revenue, profit and cash in every reporting segment. Putting these results into the context of the full year, we are well on track to deliver an exceptional year of top and bottom line performance.\nTurning to the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the first quarter were 3.98 billion, up 7.5% year-over-year. With appropriations in place, our teams are working with their customers to execute on vital missions. Strong top line growth in the first quarter enabled us to achieve record profitability.\nAdjusted EBITDA was 490 million for the quarter, up 42% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 290 basis points to 12.3%. Non-GAAP net income was 313 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.29, up 53% and 56%, respectively. This explosive earnings growth was the result of core operating performance. The net impact of a slightly lower net interest expense and share count was wholly offset by a slightly higher tax rate compared to the prior year period.\nThis bottom line performance not only boosted our cash flows, but have put us in a favorable position to continue reinvesting across the business to support the execution of our longer-term strategic objectives.\nTurning to the segment drivers on Slide 6. National security and digital revenues increased 2% year-over-year. The largest growth catalysts were increased volumes on the Sentinel and DES programs, which more than offset the focused box loss early in 2023.\nNational security and digital non-GAAP operating income margin increased 120 basis points from the prior year quarter to 10.1%, and with some milestone achievements, strong cost control and excellent execution. Health and Civil revenues increased 19% over the prior year quarter and non-GAAP operating income margin also came in at 19%, up from 12.2% a year ago.\nThe primary driver of revenue growth and increased profitability was higher volumes across our managed health services portfolio. We entered the year with tempered expectations around medical exam volumes but we're seeing increased complexity on [ PACTA ] cases. And although we're investing heavily to drive throughput, the team did an amazing job at improving efficiency, optimizing resources and delivering exceptional service to the nation's active duty members, reservice and veterans.\nCommercial and international revenues increased 4%, and non-GAAP operating income margin was 8.3% and up 360 basis points compared to the prior year. We had increased deliveries of security products, and we're seeing the impact of the changes we made in the SCS business including a leaner cost structure, improved supply chain and rationalize product and geographic portfolio. Though our work is not done in fully optimizing the security [indiscernible] business I'm proud of the team for their performance and recovery since this time last year.\nFinally, Defense Systems revenue increased 7% year-over-year with increased volumes in our airborne ISR and hypersonics businesses. Defense Systems non-GAAP operating margin [indiscernible] declined 170 basis points over the prior year quarter but were up 30 basis points sequentially and we remain committed to margin improvement for this segment for the full year.\nTurning now to a the cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We generated $63 million of cash flow from operating activities and $46 million of free cash flow. DSO for the quarter was 62 days, unchanged from a year ago. In Q1, we repurchased a net of $170 million worth of shares including $150 million on the open market and paid $53 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $633 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.7 billion of debt. Our gross leverage ratio now goes at 2.6x, comfortably below our 3x target.\nOn to the forward outlook on Slide 8. As we look ahead to the rest of the fiscal year 2024, we are poised to capitalize on the momentum we've been building. Based on our strong Q1 and improved outlook, we are raising our 2024 guidance for all metrics. We now expect revenue between $16 million and $16.4 billion, an increase of $300 million to the range.\nOur new adjusted EBITDA margin range is mid- to high 11%, which would be record profitability for a full fiscal year. With an improving revenue and margin outlook, we're raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS by [ $0.09 ] to a new range of $8.40 to $8.80. And finally, we're raising our operating cash flow target by $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion for the year.\nUnderpinning this updated guidance is a positive outlook on business development. In the first quarter, we booked a net of $3.7 billion, which translated to a book-to-bill of 0.9x for the quarter, and 1.1x for a trailing 12 months. The quarterly bookings total excludes a multibillion-dollar classified award that is currently under protest, and a $630 million Defense Systems award received on April 1, both of which are new work for Leidos. We're seeing positive business development momentum and we expect our awards this year to support our growth objectives.\nFinally, let me give you some sector-specific movements that cover our full year guidance. On the fourth quarter call, we highlighted that Health and Civil had the potential to outperform if medical examination volumes remain high. Since then, volumes have actually increased given the complexity of [ PACTA ] cases.\nThe second quarter should see similar levels of performance or even a little better. However, as a result of the increased volumes, the BBA has burned through some of its contracts sooner than planned, and we'll have to recompete them early. We are well positioned to continue our best-in-class service as a long-standing trusted mission partner to the [ VA ], but we are planning for performance in the Health and Civil segment to moderate in the back half of the year through the competitive process.\nFirst quarter revenue growth in the Defense Systems and Commercial and International segments was more robust than anticipated, although we see some potential for growth in both segments, we still see the full year revenue performance as relatively flat.\nIn commercial and international, some of the SES geographies and products we exited will be a weigh on revenue. and Defense Systems is still working to mature some of its developmental programs. Taken together, with funding certainty, positive demand signals and the performance seen across all 4 segments this quarter, we feel confident in our ability to deliver within these new ranges.\nWith that, operator, we're ready to take some questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Stuart Davis of Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we're using today.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFinally, as shown on Slide 3, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be with you today to report another strong quarter for Leidos and to put a bow on a very successful 2023. [ I'll frame ] my part of our conversation today in 3 parts: first, our 2023 results; second, the progress we've made towards building a brighter future; and third, what you can expect from us this year.\nFirst, in our fourth quarter, we delivered 8% revenue growth for record quarterly revenue just shy of $4 billion. EBITDA margin was an outstanding 11.4% and we grew non-GAAP diluted EPS at 9% year-over-year. Operating cash was also well ahead of plan. This means we delivered full year results that were above the high end of the guidance we set last quarter. For the full year, revenue growth was 7%, non-GAAP diluted EPS growth was 11% and operating cash flow growth was 17%. Consistent with my previous commitment to you about disciplined cash management, we repurchased more than $200 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nI continue to be very impressed by the people and sound business engine we have here at Leidos. And I believe our top and bottom line financial performance over the last 3 quarters of 2023 just begins to hint at our full potential. Even while affecting our recent organizational realignment, the team ran through the tape to deliver an impressive 2023. I want to thank my leadership team and our 47,000 people who made these results possible through their hard work and dedication to both Leidos and our customers' missions.\nThis brings me to my second point, the progress we've made towards building a better future. We're already working well in our new capability-focused organization and seeing the first fruits from these changes. For example, we're sharing best practices much better across digital modernization programs for greater efficiency and efficacy. In commercial and international, we're quickly redeveloping our growth playbook, especially internationally, which we'll use to extend several of our business lines outside the United States. And we're aggregating and better leveraging our robust engineering talent across our platform businesses within Defense Systems. As we go through this year, we'll see many more ways this new organizational structure unlocks value. Chris will describe a few of the tangible financial benefits of this realignment on which we already have line of sight.\nBut the team and I are acting quickly on 2 additional critical components to building for our future, reinvigorating our business capture prowess and ensuring we remain the best employer of top talent in the market. On the business capture front, we finished the year with a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x. As we focus on building quality backlog over time, this gives us a healthy $37 billion backlog, $8.8 billion of which is funded.\nStill, I believe Leidos has another gear in terms of business capture. And my new Chief Growth Officer, has stepped up to his new responsibilities in this regard with vigor. He shares my passion for winning and we are committed to delivering industry-leading win rates and above-market organic growth. My Chief Technology Officer is aggressively focusing our total IRAD expenditures in select areas to ensure we always have differentiated solutions for our customers. And my HR lead is undertaking an intense effort to rebuild our entire employee value proposition, so we remain the best employer in the market for the best talent.\n[ Cindy Greens Felder ] joins Leidos to lead our Defense Systems sector. She brings extensive aerospace and defense leadership expertise and is excited to take this part of our portfolio to the next level. And [ Dan Anto ] will rejoin Leidos as General Counsel in April, so he will be able to hit the ground sprinting with us.\nAs a result of these and other changes I've made, 75% of my ELT is now new in new positions or have newly enhanced and more focused areas of responsibilities. The momentum is building having the right people in the right positions rightly aligned. Not only is this team rightly aligned to the jobs they now perform but I've recommended and the Board has approved fundamental changes to our incentive compensation plans. This means our incentives are much better aligned to our shareholders and customers' interests. These changes are fully laid out in our upcoming proxy statement. But big picture, you'll see simpler metrics around revenue, profit and cash with increased emphasis on margin while retaining a heavy focus on relative [ TSR ] performance.\nThis brings me to my third point. Expectations for 2024. Chris will provide specifics on our 2024 financial commitments in a few minutes. Notably, our guidance fulfilled the 3-year commitments that were articulated on our previous Investor Day. We've already exceeded the margin target that we set in 2021, and this level serves as a great foundation from which to grow in the future. Our 3-year cash conversion results ought to be [indiscernible] at 100% target which is the right level of performance for our business. And we have clear line of sight to our 3-year revenue growth target.\nWhile it is important to me that we meet our prior commitments to you, I expect us to do better going forward. Our financial performance should be at or near the top of the industry. And to bring this improved profitable growth trajectory to life, 2024 will include deep strategic analysis within Leidos. Let me summarize this strategy process for you.\nEach new sector President will bring forward a best-in-class 3- to 5-year growth and profitability plan for their markets in a today forward view. And our growth and technology organizations will work together to create a proprietary hypothesis [ of the ] future of future back look, customer challenges and needs for 2033 and 2028. We'll synthesize these today, forward and future back views to identify market gaps and growth opportunities and choosing among them will enable us to crystallize our new North Star.\nThis process is being engineered to position Leidos to lead the industry in revenue, profit and cash growth. And we look forward to sharing our plan with you at our next full Investor Day likely early next year. In the meantime, this year, we'll look forward to opportunities to showcase for you many of the differentiated technology solutions, what I call [ Holden ] bolts we already use and are creating to solve our customers' most vexing problems.\nFinally, you may have already noticed the launch of a new branding campaign for Leidos this year, Making Smart Smarter. While we've gained important name recognition over our first 10 years, this campaign is about capturing brand recognition for Leidos. As you can see in the example on Slide 5, Making Smart Smarter is centered around our people. How they and the breakthrough technologies they create and a unique ecosystem with our partners and customers truly set Leidos apart from everyone else. With these 3 simple words, we'll tell the story of the collective intelligence that is uniquely Leidos. Our campaign will catapult understanding of what Leidos does differently and better than anyone else and also serve as a beacon for present and future best of the best employees.\nIn closing, with the growing promises made, promises kept culture at Leidos, we've put many of the commitments I've made to you over the past 9 months in the Done category. We've exceeded our 2023 financial commitments. We've enhanced our focus on cost controls and cash generation. We've taken down leverage substantially. We've allocated more capital to shareholders, and we've moved expeditiously to a leaner, more focused organizational structure. By delivering on our 2024 plan, we'll soon put our full 2022 to 2024 Investor Day commitments in the Done category also.\nBut we are far from done. We have a busy and productive year ahead of us at Leidos. We will continue to drive toward great full profitable growth, not just revenue growth. We will aggregate our efforts toward better customer outcomes and better business pursuits. And the new leadership team and I will be working every day to make Leidos not just successful, but awesome in every way for every stakeholder.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for more details on our 2023 results and our 2024 outlook. Chris?\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Let me echo Tom and express my gratitude to the entire Leidos team for how we executed in 2023. On balance, 2023 was an excellent year and our financial performance was well ahead of the pace we set for ourselves at the 2021 Investor Day.\nTurning to Slide 6. Revenues for the quarter were $3.98 billion. Revenues came in stronger than expected as customers continued spending [indiscernible] a continuing resolution and Congress acted to avert a government shutdown. And each quarter of '23, each segment grew year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $452 million for the fourth quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.4%. Health sustained its excellent performance, and we saw good sequential improvement in the Defense Solutions and Civil segments. With a keener focus on margins, we exceed our 2021 Investor Day target of 10.5% plus 1 year ahead of schedule.\nNon-GAAP net income was $276 million for the quarter and more than $1 billion for the year which generated non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.99 for the quarter and $7.30 for the year, increases of 9% and 11%, respectively. This strong bottom line performance came despite a drag from nonoperating drivers. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 25.2%. Net interest expense was a $2 million tailwind for the quarter based on debt paydown, but a $13 million headwind for the year given the higher interest rate environment. Taken together, tax rate and interest lowered non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.13 for the quarter and $0.14 for the year.\nNow for an overview of our segment results and key drivers beginning with the revenues on Slide 7. With a lot to cover today, I'll focus on the quarterly figures, but you can also see the full year comparisons on the slides. Defense Solutions revenues were up 7%, driven primarily by digital modernization, especially NGEN, offensive hypersonics and the Sentinel program. Civil revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year quarter. The primary growth driver in the quarter was infrastructure spending by the FAA. Health continued to be a standout performer. Quarterly revenues increased 17% year-over-year, ending the year north of $3 billion. Higher levels of medical examinations was a key driver as well as expanding capabilities on [indiscernible] increasing group events on RHRP, growing our social security administration work and breaking into new customer spaces like [ ARPA H ].\nOn the margin front, on Slide 8, Defense Solutions showed consistently strong profitability growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 9% for the quarter, up 40 basis points year-over-year. The increase in segment profitability was primarily attributable to improved program execution and disciplined cost management. Civil non-GAAP operating margin was 10.8% for the quarter compared to 11.2% in the prior year quarter, which had a rich mix of security product sales, especially rewarding to see is sequential improvement in Civil margins for 3 straight quarters. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 19%, which was essentially unchanged sequentially after excluding the $14 million [indiscernible] adjustment received in Q3, the 470 basis point increase in quarterly margin was primarily driven by [ increase ] volume, greater efficiency and better program execution and medical examination business, all of which led to higher incentive awards.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $304 million, and free cash flow net of capital expenditures, was $226 million. Net cash provided by operating activities benefited from strong collections and working capital management. Days sales outstanding for the quarter was 56, a 1-day improvement from the third quarter of 2023 and a 2-day improvement from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. For the year, operating cash flow was just shy of $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $958 million from a 95% conversion rate. Excluding the $260 million of onetime cash tax impacts primarily from Section 174, free cash flow conversion would have been 121%.\nIn the fourth quarter, we repurchased $202 million of shares and paid $51 million in dividends. As of quarter end, we had $777 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.7 billion in debt. With a leverage ratio of 2.8x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, we are comfortably below our 3x target. Our strong balance sheet gives us flexibility to return capital to shareholders and we have 13 million shares remaining under our repurchase authorization.\nOn to the forward outlook on Slide 10. For 2024, we expect revenues between $15.7 billion and $16.1 billion, reflecting growth of 2% to 4% over fiscal year 2023. Customer demand remains strong for our products and solutions, and our programs are well insulated from significant budgetary risk. But we are erring on the side of caution given the realities of the current funding environment. The government is still operating under a continuing resolution. Although we believe Congress will likely pass the budget within the next month or so, we cannot rule out the possibility of a sequester in a year-long CR.\nWe are also provisioning for a slight temporary revenue headwind as our business leadership, their team's focus to higher reward opportunities for Leidos. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin to again be in the mid- to high 10% range, above the target that we laid out at our October [ '21 ] Investor Day. We remain committed to long-term margin expansion.\nTo begin the year, we are guiding to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $7.50 and $7.90 on the basis of 134 million shares outstanding. This is down an average of 4 million shares from fourth quarter levels based on Q4 repurchases accomplished and another [ 500 million ] of repurchases anticipated in '24. This level of repurchase activity still allows for significant flexibility for additional share repurchases and other responsible capital deployment. Assumed in the EPS guidance is an effective tax rate of 23% and net interest expense of $225 million.\nFinally, we expect another strong year of operating cash flow at approximately $1.1 billion. Fiscal year 2024 cash flow guidance reflects approximately $60 million of cash tax payments related to the Section 174. 2023 cash performance was exceptional, and we expect conversion to return to normative levels near 100% in '24. From a free cash flow perspective, we're targeting capital expenditures of approximately $190 million or about 1.2% of revenues.\nWith broad bipartisan support, the House passed a tax package that restores immediate expensing of R&D costs under Section 174, with retroactive effect to 2022. The bill has yet to be taken by the Senate. Our guidance assumes the Section 174 cost capitalization rules were made place, so we would have additional cash to deploy if the house bill becomes law. In 2024, we'll be operating our new segment structure and to help your modeling, we recast 2022 and 2023 financials in the new structure and filed them with our press release.\nLet me spend a few minutes outlining these segments and how we see them performing in 2024. The largest national security and digital includes core defense and intel services, digital modernization for U.S. federal customers in our Leidos Innovation Center. Flagship programs include NGEN, [ AGES ], DES and large cyber analysis and mission software development contracts with the intelligence community. 2023 revenues for this segment were $7.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, with non-GAAP operating income margin of 10%. In 2024, we expect revenue growth within our guided range, with margins contracting slightly. Long term, we see margin upside with shared resources and best practices across the digital modernization space.\nThe Health and Civil segment will deliver customer solutions with unique capabilities in the areas of public health, care coordination, life and environmental sciences and transportation. Key programs include our disability exam work, [ DEMSUM ], national aerospace systems support for the FAA in our DOE and National Science Foundation based support contracts. Last year, Health and Civil generated $4.2 billion in revenues, up 7% year-over-year, with non-GAAP operating income margin, 14.5%. In 2024, we expect robust growth beyond the corporate average with margins coming down slightly. This segment offers the most potential upside in '24 with growing examination volumes.\nCommercial and International combines our existing SES commercial energy, U.K. and Australian businesses. Last year, Commercial and International generated $2.1 billion in revenues, up 12% year-over-year, with about 5 points of growth coming from the airborne solution business acquisition and non-GAAP operating income margin of 7.8%. Based on actions taken in 2023 within SES and the indirect structure tailored to nonfederal work, we expect margins to increase in 2024. Revenues, however, should be relatively stable and reflect a similar seasonal pattern to 2023.\nFinally, Defense Systems combines our core Dynetics work with our maritime and U.S.-sponsored airborne surveillance support. In 2023, Defense Systems accounted for $1.9 billion in revenues, up 4% year-over-year, with non-GAAP operating income margin of 8.3%. With additional engineering discipline from the combined organization, we expect to increase margins through better program execution but revenue should remain relatively flat compared to 2023. In the fourth quarter of '23, our customers accelerated hypersonics weapon testing resulting in pull-through work previously scheduled for the first and second quarters of 2024. As a result, the Defense Systems segment revenues will be back-end loaded in 2024.\nSo rolling up to the enterprise level, we expect both revenues and margin to step down from Q4 levels in Q1 and then grow throughout the year. The Q1 step-down in margins will outpace that of revenue given the timing of incentive and award fee payments, but we have good line of sight into strong margin performance for the year.\nWith that, operator, we're ready for some questions."

Welcome to Leidos' Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Stuart, you may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, Shamali, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on [indiscernible] during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and [indiscernible] financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. It's really good to be with you today. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for Leidos this morning, a quarter of record revenue, earnings, cash flow, bookings and backlog.\nRevenue grew 9% year-over-year this quarter, our fastest [indiscernible] years and well ahead of the pace implied in our guidance. Customer demand remained robust across all 3 of our segments and we are proud of the work that we accomplished with our customers to deliver on important missions. Non-GAAP EPS was up 28% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%, cash management and collections were even stronger. Operations -- operating cash flow of $795 million was already in excess of our existing full year guidance of at least $700 million.\nAs a result of this quarter's strong performance and the momentum established in our second quarter, we are raising our 2023 financial guidance across all measures. This quarter's results and our improved outlook were driven by the substantial progress the team has made delivering on our performance initiatives articulated during our last call. First, instituting a Promises Made, Promises Kept culture here at Leidos; second, analyzing and improving acquisition performance; third, enhancing business development performance and backlog quality; and fourth, sharpening Leidos' strategy.\nLet me speak to each of these initiatives in turn. First, we're executing well on creating a Promises Made, Promises Kept culture here at Leidos challenging ourselves to consistently deliver on the expectations we set for ourselves and ensuring that we're having candid conversations about what is working and what can be improved. We're taking decisive actions to reallocate resources and course correct when needed. The team understands that creating this culture is not a one and done or twice as nice event but rather a quarter-by-quarter disciplined drumbeat.\nSecond, we're taking definitive actions to enhance performance, drive predictability and derisk our [indiscernible] and security products or SES businesses. In Dynetics, we're in the final stages of this integration across all financial contracts, supply chain manufacturing and [ HR systems ]. This will result in full proactive management visibility into the business, better business efficiency and a better employee experience. We've added significant engineering and program management expertise to Dynetics to better serve our customers throughout critical programs of record.\nThe growth outlook for Dynetics is strong in the 3 priority areas I identified in our last quarter. In Hypersonics, we're ramping up production rates while looking to improve effectiveness and lower costs. In small satellite payloads, we have all 4 wide field-of-view tracking layer Tranche 0 payloads in orbit. Moreover, we're executing on Tranche 1 and recently submitted our proposal for Tranche 2. In Force Protection, we're tracking towards government level development testing of IFPC Enduring Shield in early 2024, and we're making progress on the persistent surveillance [indiscernible] of the Army and Marine Corps.\nIn SES, we saw improvement in the quarter on revenue and margin, coupled with strong bookings. We bolstered our supply chain resiliency and took costs out of the business to create more predictability. At the same time, consistent with the promises laid out last quarter, the team has critically evaluated the business to identify unprofitable product lines and unfavorable geographies and we've updated our sales projections to better reflect current customer buying behavior.\nBased on these candid evaluations and proactive measures to rightsize the business, we are taking a noncash pretax charge of $688 million. As previously posed, the market has changed since the SD&A acquisition and won't return to pre-pandemic levels as fast as previously expected. As a proof point, the TSA administered testified to Congress recently that [indiscernible] at the checkpoint would not be completed until 2042 at current funding levels. Broadly, customers are delaying recapitalizations and holding on to existing machines longer. With this as a backdrop, the team has moved to rightsize the business, discontinued sales of an unprofitable product line and exit numerous [ hair ] risk, lower return geographies.\nWe remain committed to the overall security products [indiscernible] where we offer differentiated technology-driven solutions. Security concerns will be just as, if not more pervasive going forward, providing a long-term growth opportunity for Leidos. This includes the regulated aviation and ports and border markets as well as commercial infrastructure security and loss prevention markets. The definitive actions we have now taken will better position our security business to grow from here [indiscernible] both margins and earnings.\nWe also made progress on our third initiative, delivering exceptional business development performance in the third quarter. $7.9 billion in awards is a new quarterly high watermark for Leidos. Our book-to-bill ratio in the [indiscernible] of 2.0 brings our year-to-date and trailing 12-month ratios to 1.2. But more important to me, our $38 billion of backlog is now $4 billion larger than last quarter's and supports our growth and margin objectives. This is what I was referring to last quarter when I mentioned growing our total backlog over time with quality wins.\nLet me touch on a few of those quality wins this quarter which demonstrate the ways Leidos provides differentiated solutions to meet [indiscernible]. The largest win was the Army Common Hardware Systems Sixth Generation known as CHS-6 which is a single award IDIQ with a potential value of $7.9 billion over 10 years. Through technology, we'll be streamlining and optimizing complex supply chains and transforming logistics to be a resilient to supply chain disruptions and cyber risks. Because we offered the Army a truly differentiated solution, this award was not protested, and task orders are already beginning to flow. Please note, because of the nature of IDIQ contracts, CHS-6 did not material -- did not contribute to our record Q3 bookings and backlog that I mentioned earlier.\nWe also had 2 large recompete awards in our intelligence group that secure our portfolio for years to come. On a $900 million contract to support an enhanced Department of Homeland Security Networks, will enable cross-agency intelligence sharing and secure collaboration while delivering capabilities like Quantum Resistant Cryptography, excuse me, AI operations, Robotic Process Automation and Classified Cloud Service Integration. On a $700 million contract to provide prototype and technology development support to a long-time customer, we'll identify emerging technologies and develop new tools, techniques and cyber capabilities to enhance their mission.\nMy final call out is a $125 million contract to defend Army weapon systems from Cyber Electromagnetic Activities. This award builds on the R&D and field testing we've been doing [indiscernible] for years. And it's another example of Dynetics ability to transition from prototypes to fielded capability.\nYou'll notice that cyber is a common theme on each of these wins. Cyber attacks are a persistent vexing problem for our customers, and Leidos is a top provider of full spectrum capabilities and services. In keeping with our approach of anticipatory technology investment, we continue to focus on addressing the next generation of cyber threats with emphasis in [ zero trust ], quantum proof encryption network defense and cyber physical systems. We also anticipated the convergence of cyber and AI, what we call cognitive cyber years ago. We've met a pretty number of technologies and capabilities in this area into pilots that defend against AI-based summer attacks. As a key driver of our business development strategy, we'll continue to invest in differentiators in areas of critical importance to our customers.\nFourth, we're executing a multiphase strategic sharpening under the effort we call Leidos [ Next ]. A robust journey unlocked the next level of technological innovation, the next level of execution and performance and the next level of customer success. The goal of Leidos Next is to create a company with a much clearer and even more inspiring vision, our new North Star. We want to become the best company in the world that's solving a core set of problems for our customers and the best employer in the world, hiring and retaining the most talented people in order to do this. This is the essence of Leidos Next.\nAs an enabler of Leidos Next, we will be simplifying our organizational structure to promote operational excellence, allow faster decision-making and more tightly align our business around key technology discriminators. This more focused capability-oriented structure will better enable us to create clear differentiated growth strategies for each market we serve, allow for more targeted and efficient investment in the highest areas of potential and enable repeatable solutions to drive a profitable growth. Each new sector has ample room for expansion while benefiting from the collective strength and scale of our $15 billion company.\nBeginning in 2024, we'll operate in 5 sectors that are focused on specific defined capability sets we bring to our customers. Health and Civil will deliver customer solutions with unique capabilities in the areas of public health, care coordination, life and environmental sciences and transportation. National Security will combine all our technology-enabled services and mission software capabilities for defense and intel customers in the area of cyber, logistics, security operations and decision analytics. Commercial and International will combine our existing SES, commercial energy, U.K. and Australian businesses. Digital modernization will bring together our IT operations and digital transformation programs. This will allow us to serve all our digital transformation customers with better scale and speed brought about by better repeatability of best-in-class solutions with greater efficiency. And lastly, Defense Systems will combine elements of Dynetics and our prior defense business to develop and produce advanced space, aerial, surface and subsurface manned and unmanned defense systems.\nBy streamlining the organization and encouraging decision-making at the appropriate levels, we'll be more efficient and responsive to market changes and customer needs.\nI'm also upgrading several existing executive leadership team positions. We'll centralize strategy, business development, marketing, communications, government relations, all in one value stream under a new Chief Growth Officer. As such, we'll [ regionate ] our customer-centric business approach.\nOur new Chief Performance Officer position will spearhead program execution to ensure that we keep our commitments to customers as well as drive cost efficiency through world-class supply chain management, IT delivery and real estate portfolio management.\nLastly, our Chief Technology Officer, will now also lead LInC, the Leidos Innovation Center, adding even more emphasis on tech [indiscernible] innovation and development and making a profound organization-wide commitment to discovering, developing and deploying market differentiating technology, golden boats. We're placing technology innovation at the forefront of our sharpened Leidos Next North Star strategy.\nLater this week, we'll announce our sector presidents and those who will serve in these key positions.\nFinally, as I mentioned on our last call, a key element to our approach going forward will be disciplined resource allocation, both internally and externally. Internally, last quarter, we acted to refine our investment strategy towards those areas of best overall value to the enterprise. Our BD teams have removed opportunities that do not have a clear path to an acceptable market and are reallocating our resources and realigning our pipeline to better achieve top and bottom line growth for Leidos. Externally, as promised, our team deployed capital during the third quarter towards debt reduction to reach and slightly surpass our previously announced target leverage ratio of 3x gross debt to EBITDA.\nAfter reaching this milestone and with near-term acquisitions not a priority for this business, I recommended and the Board of Directors approved the first increase in our dividend in over 2 years. Shareholders of record on December 15 will receive a dividend of $0.38 a share, a 6% increase over our past dividend. Our strong balance sheet enables us to deploy additional capital to shareholder returns. With a stock price that does not fully capture our earnings and cash generation power, we expect share repurchase to be a primary focus for excess cash in the near term. And as we look to the future, we expect earnings and cash to grow and remain committed to this disciplined capital management and deployment policy.\nIn closing, we're building momentum with 2 successful quarters as we work toward ending 2023 in a position of strength. Our Q3 results speak to our ability to focus, grow the business, grow earnings and generate robust cash conversion. I'm very excited about our new organizational alignment for 2024, our new North Star coming into focus and indications of the full potential of this business becoming evident.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for more detail on our financial performance and updated outlook.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Despite our GAAP loss, our third quarter operating results were positive across the board and speak to the underlying strength of the team, market position and management discipline. Revenue growth, profitability and cash conversion all improved, not only year-over-year, but also compared to a very strong Q2. Our enhanced outlook puts us on track for an excellent 2023.\nTurning to Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.92 billion, up 9% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth has accelerated each quarter this year and was ahead of our long-term target in Q3. Growth was robust in all 3 of our reporting segments, especially in Health. Customers continue to expand scope on existing contracts ahead of an uncertain budget environment. Adjusted EBITDA was $451 million for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points to 11.5%.\nI'll get a little more granular later, but big picture, Civil and Defense profitability were in line with the year ago quarter and Health was up substantially.\nNon-GAAP net income was $283 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.03, both up 28% compared to last year. Below EBITDA, a lower effective tax rate added about $0.08 to EPS, which offset a $0.02 headwind from increased interest expense.\nTurning to the segment drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased 7% year-over-year. The largest growth catalysts were in digital modernization, offensive and defensive hypersonics and our Australian airborne solutions business. Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating income margin increased 30 basis points from the prior year quarter to 8.4% with some milestone achievements and strong cost control. That said, we did have some unfavorable EAC adjustments as we wind down prototype development on a couple of programs, which led to the 90 basis point sequential decline in margin. As we complete systems integration and add technical depth, we are committed to delivering better and more predictable returns at Dynetics.\nCivil revenues increased 6% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by continued recovery in security products, infrastructure spending at the FAA and increased demand for engineering support to commercial energy companies. Civil non-GAAP operating income margin was 10.4% compared to 11% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year segment profitability decreased as a result of the mix of security product sales. The changes that we've implemented, including a leaner cost structure, improved supply chain and rationalize product and geographic portfolio will stabilize and enhance the margin going forward and did contribute to the 130 basis point sequential increase in Civil non-GAAP margins.\nHealth revenues increased 18% over the prior year quarter, driven by higher levels of medical examinations and growth on our Social Security Administration IT work. Non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 20.4% and compared to 15% in the prior year quarter. [indiscernible] segment profitability was driven primarily by the increased volumes from PACT Act and strong incentive fee performance in the medical examination business. In addition, we received an equitable adjustment to cover costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This adjustment added $14 million to both revenue and operating income, similar to the recovery incurred in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe'll operate in and report on these 3 segments through Q4, and then we'll move to the 5 sector structure that Tom described. For financial reporting segmentation will combine the national security and digital modernization sectors based on their similar economic characteristics. The remaining 3 sectors, Health and Civil, Defense Systems and Commercial and International will be their own reporting segments. We believe the new segmentation will enhance visibility and provide investors and analysts a clearer picture of Leidos going forward.\nWe're still completing the contract by contract mapping into the new sectors. Our Q4 call will provide supplemental disclosure to help you with modeling, including revenue and operating income for the new segments for full year 2022 and 2023.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We generated $795 million of cash flow from operating activities and $745 million of free cash flow. Cash flow benefited from strong collections and ongoing working capital improvement initiatives. In addition, we saw some benefit from our [indiscernible] government customers accelerating payment at their fiscal year-end. DSO for the quarter was 57 days, a 2-day improvement from the second quarter of 2023.\nDuring the quarter, we paid off the remaining $200 million of commercial paper to reach our target leverage ratio of 3x gross debt to adjusted EBITDA, actually achieving 2.9x, which gives us flexibility to return capital to shareholders. We ended the quarter with $750 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.7 billion of debt.\nTom mentioned the noncash charge recorded this quarter, so let me provide some additional details around that. There are 3 basic components that are added back to net income from the statement of cash flows, a goodwill impairment of $599 million, asset impairment of $88 million and $12 million of inventory and other assets associated with product lines we are exiting. Goodwill and asset impairments are both separate lines on the income statement and cash flow statements. Restructuring charge for inventory is included within the $19 million line in the statement of cash flows and then within cost of revenues on the income statement. The vast majority of the charges are associated with SES, but we also held a small unprofitable asset within Dynetics for sale, resulting in an $11 million impairment. The sale has been completed and will be reflected in our Q4 financials. In both the SES and Dynetics impairments, we've taken action to improve the margin and earnings outlook with no significant impact to current revenue projections.\nOn to the forward outlook on Slide 8. Based on our strong Q3 and year-to-date results, we're raising our 2023 on all metrics. We now expect revenue between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion, an increase of $150 million at the midpoint. Profitability has been a key focus area over the last 2 quarters, and the team has delivered. Our new adjusted EBITDA range is 10.5% to 10.7%, an increase of 40 basis points on the bottom and 20 basis points on the top of our previous guidance. With an improving revenue and margin outlook, we're raising our non-GAAP diluted EPS $0.40 at the low end and $0.30 at the high end to $6.80 to $7.10. And we're raising our operating cash flow target by $150 million to at least $850 million year, which is right at our year-to-date performance.\nLet me put some context around our guidance related to the current budget [indiscernible]. We're hopeful that Congress will be able to avoid a shutdown, but in the spirit of Promises Made, Promises Kept, our guidance explicitly includes our current assessment of the risk of a government shutdown. A potential full 45-day shutdown could put us closer to the bottom end of guidance for revenue and EPS. The shutdown's impact on cash flow is harder to predict. We expect to generate operating cash flow in the fourth quarter but our revised cash guidance reflects the possibility of a modest disruption associated with the potential government shutdown. Our strong balance sheet positions us well to navigate its potential headwinds.\nWith that, Shamali, we're ready to take some questions."

Welcome to Leidos' Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Tom Bell, our CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, includes risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Finally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Bell, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nThomas A. Bell\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today leading Leidos into our exciting second decade. I'm also very happy to report that we closed a strong Q2, driven by a healthy demand environment, we achieved revenue growth of 7% year-over-year with strong organic growth across all segments. Margins, earnings and cash flow rebounded from our first quarter driven by an improving business mix, a partial recovery in the security products business and a series of fast-acting initiatives implemented across the business focused on costs and collections.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9%, was up 150 basis points from Q1 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.80 was up 22% sequentially. Also, operating cash flow of $164 million was up $262 million from last quarter. While putting this quality quarter on the books speaks to the underlying strength of the business, even more important to me, it reflects the ability of the Leidos team to focus and deliver when expectations are clear.\nNow as this is my first quarterly call with you, I thought I'd share some of my initial observations of Leidos. Over these first months, I've met with customers, employees and analysts and I've conducted detailed operating and strategic reviews with all our business groups and each of our functional organizations. The headline from this work so far is clear. Our business foundations are impressive. I've come to think of these foundations in 3 distinct pillars: one, an incredible team; two, compelling technology creation; and three, the ability to act with pace, while leveraging scale. These 3 elements in combination enable us to uniquely solve our customers' most vexing problems in differentiated ways.\nLet me unpack that a bit. First, we're a company of exceptionally talented and dedicated individuals. Their breadth and depth of expertise is remarkable and they are palpably connected to our customers' missions. That translates into a truly differentiated culture with deep customer insights. Also, the [indiscernible] and genuine care for each other at Leidos creates an environment that embraces collaboration and entrepreneurship, critical to our continuing success. Our ability to effectively attract and motivate top talent is a distinct competitive advantage for us. And in this regard, Forbes recently named us as one of the best employers for diversity for new graduates and for veterans and Ethisphere recognized us as one of the world's most ethical companies for the sixth consecutive year.\nSecond, technological innovation at Leidos is impressive, broad and deep. The advances we are pursuing across Leidos are world-class. We leverage these key technology differentiators, what I refer to as golden bolts across our entire portfolio. And we deploy these golden bolts in disciplines ranging from secure software, to cybersecurity, to signal processing, so as to bring extraordinary capabilities to our customers. A couple of recent examples of delivering complex mission capabilities to our customer includes the successful hypersonic test launch under our MAC TB program and the last major deployment wave in the Continental U.S. of MHS Genesis, the military electronic health record system. This was done on time and on schedule, also significantly enhancing system capability.\nWe've also been at the forefront of unlocking the power of artificial intelligence for our customers for decades. We've developed and deployed trusted AI to tackle some of our nation's most challenging missions. Our debut in Applied AI was in 2004 when we built a self-driving vehicle as part of DARPA's grand challenge. By 2016, we launched the first unmanned autonomous ship. And now we're deploying next-generation computer vision for automated passenger scanning in our ProVision 2 platform. Also recently, we've deployed large language models in our Health Group, designing a trusted AI solution where humans and AI work as partners to more rapidly align resources and improve our support to beneficiaries. Differentiated technology, including AI, created, unlocked and responsibly controlled by our amazing people is and will continue to be a unique attribute of Leidos.\nNow to continue to accelerate our technical innovation, we are investing to broaden and deepen our workforce capabilities. So far this year, we've upskilled well over 3,000 of our people in fields ranging from AI, to cyber, to software, to digital engineering. And it's open to all our employees, not just our technical wizards, so that all can be conversant in our golden bolts.\nThe third pillar I found here is equally important, scale and agility. Every customer I've met with is feeling the stress about the pace of change. Hard vexing problems are coming at them at speeds they've never experienced. And they're looking for partners with speed and scale to address these holistic problems. They need us to operate with a clock speed that matches their urgency. At Leidos, we lean into this environment by challenging ourselves to operate with a strong bias for velocity. For example, within the U.S. space force, the Space Development Agency is focused on rapid delivery of space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter. This is an ideal fit for Leidos, an essential technically challenging mission where standard procurement cycles aren't acceptable. To that end, today, our satellite payload remains the only tranche 1 Transera tracking layer asset in space. And we're on track to launch Tranche 1 assets soon that will serve as the foundation for the defense of our nation from hypersonic missiles.\nAll these findings have strengthened my conviction in the potential of Leidos. However, also in my first month, I've identified some areas we must improve. First, some recent acquisitions have fallen short of plan. While I believe those acquisitions offer us significant strategic benefits, we will redouble our efforts to achieve the value envisioned in our acquisition business cases.\nSecond, all on this call recognize the fact that our financial performance has not always lived up to our investors' expectations. The team and I have had a series of candid conversations in this regard. And as a result, we have agreed that together, when we make a commitment, whether to each other, our customers or the Street, Leidos will meet that commitment. I call this simply a promises made, promises kept philosophy.\nThird, recent business development metrics have not been up to par. While we have a healthy backlog, currently $34 billion, built over the last 5 years via a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x, we can and must do better. I believe that for a business like us, total backlog is a more relevant measure of future revenue growth than quarterly book-to-bill ratios. We will be determined to grow our total backlog over time with quality wins. As such, we will be candid with ourselves about where we have a differentiated capability that the market recognizes and resource it appropriately. And where perhaps we find we do not enjoy true differentiation, we will ask ourselves some honest probing questions courageously acting on their answers.\nFinally, I believe Leidos can benefit from a certain strategic sharpening. To propel this and to optimize our success going forward, we are now in the process of crafting a clear new North Star for Leidos. As we crystallize this new North Star, we will use it to guide all our strategic decisions. And over time, this will improve our win rates, drive margin enhancement and better enable us to most successfully serve our customers' most important needs.\nWhile this North Star is currently a work in progress, I can give you a few initial indications of where we'll be going. We will take steps to simplify our organizational structure to promote operational excellence, allow for faster decision-making and more tightly align our business across our key technology differentiators. We will focus more on the bottom line via greater cost discipline and by refining our investment strategy towards those areas of best opportunity, best overall value to the enterprise. And we'll be very thoughtful and disciplined on capital allocation, both internally and externally. In the near term, I will be laser-focused on improving execution. So I don't expect much in the way of additional inorganic growth. But after we complete our next strategic plan and reach our targeted leverage ratio, select M&A will likely make sense for us again. At that time, though, we'll be crisp in our approach to ensure there is a clear opportunity to create value for Leidos and our investors.\nLastly, I believe that a regular and predictable program to return capital to shareholders drives better investment decisions across any enterprise. So we'll be looking forward to that as well. As we progress this work, I look forward to updating you on how we plan to accelerate growth here at Leidos, especially on earnings and cash.\nNow to our 2023 guidance. Based on our strong Q2 and our revenue momentum halfway through 2023, we are raising the top and bottom of our revenue guidance to a new range of $14.9 billion to $15.2 billion, an increase of $150 million at the midpoint. Revenue growth has been a key feature for Leidos in the recent past, and I'm pleased to acknowledge that this element of our business will continue to deliver for us.\nThe delta in margin performance between the first 2 quarters of 2023 indicates to me, variability in profit margin greater than that suggested by the prior 20 basis point guidance range. Today, this is primarily due to the variability in our security products business. Now the good news here is that the Civil team is aggressively knocking down these challenges by leaning out the cost structure and strengthening the supply chain. But considering the practicalities of the company becoming slightly more tied to product delivery timing, we are widening our adjusted EBITDA margin range guidance to 40 basis points. Therefore, our revised EBITDA range will be 10.1% to 10.5% for 2023.\nLastly, we're reaffirming our non-GAAP diluted EPS range of $6.40 to $6.80, and we're reaffirming our operating cash flow target of at least $700 million. In closing, I am optimistic about our future as we set course for Leidos' second decade of growth. And I look forward to meeting with you at upcoming conferences and roadshows.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for more detail on our financial performance and updated outlook. Chris?\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Our second quarter financial results were indeed strong and put us on pace for a good year. Big picture, revenue continued its growth trajectory, and we rebounded nicely on earnings. As I said on the last call, the Q1 profit shortfall was temporary, concentrated and recoverable. We had improvement in the security products business, and we work together as an enterprise to deliver solid results across the entire portfolio.\nTurning to Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.84 billion, up 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenue growth was broad-based as each of our 3 reporting segments grew at least 5% organically.\nOn to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million for the second quarter, which was up 15% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% increased 70 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $252 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.80. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS were up 15% and 13%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nEarnings growth came despite a $6 million drag from net interest expense. Both share count and the effective tax rate were essentially unchanged from last year. Non-GAAP profitability was up from Q1 levels in all 3 segments, driven by improved business mix and program execution as well as enhanced focus on indirect spending across the company. Though there were some pickups from achieving milestones and truing up completed programs, that won't necessarily recur in future quarters, we saw improvement along most key profit drivers. Specifically, EAC performance was strong with net write-ups of $18 million, and SG&A as a percent of revenue showed improvement as well.\nThe year-over-year numbers paint a positive picture, but the sequential improvement is even more encouraging. Total revenues were up 4%, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 150 basis points and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 22%.\nTurning to the segment drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased 7% year-over-year. The largest growth catalysts were in the areas of digital modernization, including Navy NGEN in Hypersonics, especially SDA Widefield View Tranche 1 as well as our Australian Airborne Solutions business. For the quarter, Defense Solutions' non-GAAP operating income margin increased to 9.3%, up 100 basis points from the prior year quarter with maturing development programs, strong execution and lower indirect spending.\nHealth revenues increased 9% over the prior year quarter, driven by growth on the SSA IT work and increased demand for medical examinations. For VBA, we're seeing higher volumes from the PAC Act and we're earning a higher work share as a result of our performance. Also, the Reserve Health Readiness Program is now building. Non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 17% compared to 19.8% in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by the $20 million equitable adjustment in the second quarter of 2022 to cover costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMore important, Health non-GAAP operating income margin was up 110 basis points sequentially, bolstered by increased volume, solid program execution and a positive outlook on incentive fee performance.\nCivil revenues increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of revenue growth were the NASA Aegis program, increased demand for engineering support to commercial energy companies and a partial recovery within the security products portfolio. Civil non-GAAP operating income margin was 9.1% compared to 6.5% in the prior year quarter, which was unfavorably impacted by an adverse arbitration ruling and associated legal fees totaling $17 million. Sequentially, Civil non-GAAP margins improved by 270 basis points, which reflects partial improvement in the security products business. Consistent with expectations, the Security Products business is recovering, but is not yet at peak levels. For perspective, year-to-date, the Security Products businesses actually up slightly year-over-year on revenue and down modestly on margin.\nAs with last year, the back half of the year has the potential to be significantly stronger than the first half. We're seeing good traction in the business with the recent Leads Airport Award, and we've implemented the changes we talked about on the last call, including a leaner, more responsive cost structure and an improved supply chain. In addition, as part of the review of the business, we're looking at pruning the portfolio of products and geographies with lower returns. This work is ongoing.\nTaking a step back, we see security as an important and growing market, and we are positioning for success with our investment in the Charleston production facility and looking to expand into new areas, such as data center protection.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. We generated $164 million of cash flow from operating activities and $124 million of free cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities benefited from strong collections and working capital management. DSO for the quarter was 59 days, a 3-day improvement from the first quarter of 2023. We are in the middle of a cross-functional review of cash generation to include harmonizing vendor payment terms and building in more favorable collection terms on our contracts where possible. We continue to expect to drive sustainably improve performance over time.\nDuring the quarter, we paid the remaining $320 million of principal on the 364-day term loan agreement that came due in May, taking on $200 million of commercial paper to do so. These were the key movers of our $125 million net reduction in debt during the quarter. We expect to clear out the commercial paper during the third quarter, which will free up capital to deploy.\nOn to the forward outlook. Tom gave you the revised ranges. Let me provide a little more color. We expect revenue to remain near Q2 levels in the back half of the year with some degradation from the focused Fox loss and a move to a single wave of deployments on dim sum by Q4. We have a large pipeline of opportunities, pending decisions, and we aren't dependent upon significant new business wins to sustain our current revenues.\nOn EBITDA, the expanded guidance range primarily reflects the range of outcomes on the Security Products business as well as the volume of special project work on fake price contracts and incentive fee determinations. We've made our best assessment of the likely outcomes and are comfortable that our wider range conservatively incorporates the reasonable potential results.\nWith a narrower range on revenue and a wider range on margin, we're comfortable with our EPS range, which also tracks well to our cash target for the year. As in prior years, cash generation is concentrated in Q3. With a strong Q2, we are ahead of our internal plan year-to-date.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to the operator so we can take some questions."

Welcome to Leidos' First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nVP of IR, Perspecta Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFinally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nRoger A. Krone\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our first quarter results demonstrate our ability to drive strong organic growth as record revenue performance was consistent with our long-term target. We expect earnings and cash performance to build momentum as we progress through the year and are fully committed to achieving our 2023 guidance.\nAs I step down as CEO, I am confident that Leidos is truly the leader in our industry with unmatched talent, technical depth, and market-facing solutions. Our dedicated team is at the forefront of our customers' most challenging missions as we make the world safer, healthier and more efficient.\nAs usual, I'll touch on our financial performance, capital allocation, business development performance and people. Number one, our top line financial performance for the quarter was excellent. Record revenues of $3.7 billion were up 6% in total and over 5% organically year-over-year. Our growth is in line with our long-term model and we continue to take share from our competitors. All 3 of our segments grew, led by Civil and Health, which speaks to the power of our diversified portfolio.\nBottom line performance was lower than anticipated, largely driven by delays in security product deliveries and continued investment in the security product offerings. The delays based primarily on supply chain issues and customer site readiness are fundamentally a matter of timing and will be resolved within the year. The strength that we're seeing across the Leidos portfolio, especially in the Health business, will help to accelerate margin and earnings performance throughout the year.\nAs planned, cash generation was decreased by the cash tax payments for Section 174 expense for 2022 and the final payment on the CARES Act deferral. Absent those unusual items, cash flow from operations was consistent with last year's levels. We remain on track to generate more than $700 million of operating cash flow this year, which brings me to point #2 on capital allocation.\nOur long-term balanced capital deployment strategy has always consisted of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. We've committed to take down our gross leverage ratio to 3x, and we expect to achieve that by the end of the year.\nIn the first quarter, we refinanced and extended our debt to position us to deploy capital in productive ways. We view our strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating as a strategic asset in the current market. The cash tax payments and upcoming debt paydown limited our ability to deploy capital in the quarter but we resolutely believe that our current valuation is not aligned with our fundamental earnings power and cash generation. Therefore, we bought back $25 million of shares through open market repurchases in the first quarter as we ramp free cash generation in the second half of the year, we'll create flexibility to allocate capital to benefit long-term shareholders.\nNumber three, business development. Most importantly, award activity is returning to normal levels after a protracted period marked by procurement delays and obligations underrunning budget authority. A more active environment bodes well for Leidos with our long history of being able to thrive in a competitive market. In the quarter, we exceeded our gross awards plan and booked a net of $3 billion in awards for a net book-to-bill ratio of 0.8. Total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $35.1 billion. Of that, $8.3 billion was funded, which is up 17%.\nYou can read about some of the key awards from the quarter in the press release, but we're particularly pleased to see intelligence -- to see the intelligence community customers making awards again. Maritime continues as a focus item for us and international airport security is beginning to rebound.\nTo ensure that we bring true differentiation to our bids, we continue to invest in strategic technologies that are core to our business. Last quarter, I talked about [ cyber, ZeroTrust, Confidential Compute ] and generative AI. We also have a rich history of delivering secure software at speed to support critical missions. We protect the software supply chain from development to deployment to operations, delivering software security that goes beyond compliance for customers like the FAA, DoD and DHS. And we're investing in cutting-edge emerging quantum technologies focused on applications such as quantum augmented communications and the transition to Quantum Resilient cybersecurity.\nWe see tremendous opportunities ahead. We have $30 billion in submits awaiting adjudication and we expect to submit another $39 billion over the remainder of the year. Based on the successful Tranche 0 launches in April and the rapid Tranche 1 time line, the Space Development Agency is accelerating the wide field of view program. So Tranche 2 should be a 2023 submit. We also expect expanded follow-on bids on our force protection and hypersonics programs this year. In addition, we're pursuing large supply chain modernization efforts for the Army and the Veterans Administration and digital transformation remains a key priority for our customers.\nAnd lastly, point number four, Leidos continues to be an attractive destination for talented people. In the first quarter, we hired more than 2,500 people and increased head count 7% year-over-year. Even more important, voluntary attrition has dropped down to pre-pandemic levels. This improved labor position provides potential uplift to our revenue plan. We're benefiting from the improved labor market for technical talent, but we believe our focus on employee engagement and career development is also a major positive factor. Our managers are living their commitments to Leidos Life by putting their employees' careers flexibility and well-being first. They are connecting with their teams and taking the time to engage with their employees around building a career.\nIn our recently completed employee engagement survey, we were above external benchmarks across almost all categories, scoring particularly strong on manager relationships, inclusion and diversity and employee growth and development. If you want to join an inclusive team and build your skills over a fulfilling career, Leidos is a great place to work.\nBefore turning it over to Chris, I'll touch on the current federal budget environment. The U.S. Congress is currently debating President Biden's $6.9 trillion budget request for fiscal year 2024. The proposed budget includes increases in critical areas that are important to Leidos, such as defense, transportation, Veterans Affairs, NASA and energy. Last week, House Republicans passed a bill that would raise the debt ceiling and cap discretionary spending. The bill will not pass the Senate, but discussions can now begin in earnest towards resolving the debt ceiling and the government fiscal year 2024 budget given the enormous challenges that we have as a nation.\nFinally, I want to speak to the CEO transition. As I look back on my 9 years at Leidos, I am proud to say that we have achieved incredible transformation and growth together, almost tripling revenues and establishing ourselves as a premier broad technology provider. Our strong leadership team helped us win numerous large competitive programs in the U.S. and abroad. We completed transformational acquisitions including integrating Lockheed Martin's Information Systems and Global Solutions business, which enabled us to expand our capabilities and better serve our customers.\nOur growth -- our efforts have not gone unnoticed as we have been recognized as a leader in our industry, providing innovative solutions to complex challenges. Our commitment to our employees has been a top priority, and we have fostered a culture of innovation, engagement and inclusion. We have built a team that is passionate about our mission, vision and values and conveys that commitment to our customers. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we took care of each individual and prioritize safety and well-being above all. Our focus on collaboration, innovation and inclusion has allowed us to create a culture that enables each employee to grow and thrive, driving our success.\nWe have also made a significant impact on our customers and communities. We have transformed logistics for the U.K. Ministry of Defense, enabling them to rapidly respond to the crisis in Ukraine. We have driven IT innovation throughout government and helped more than 200 utilities across the U.S., build a more resilient, reliable and sustainable electric grid. We have modernized health care information management across the Department of Defense on cost and on schedule and enabled our veterans to get the disability benefits they have earned through their service. And we have worked in our communities to confront opioid addiction and remove stigma associated with mental health challenges, making a positive difference in the lives of many.\nThe driving force behind our company's prosperity is undoubtedly the exceptional talent of our employees and the unwavering strength of our leadership team. Without their incredible contributions, we would not be where we are today. I am confident with this team in place, Leidos is posed for continued growth in the future.\nAs I transition out of my CEO role, I'm excited to welcome Tom Bell to the position. I've worked with Tom over the past month and I am convinced he is the right person to lead this company into the future. With a great foundation in place at Leidos, I believe that Tom's tenure will be rewarding for our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.\nI will end by saying thank you to each of you for your confidence you showed in me during my tenure. It has been an honor of a lifetime. Thank you.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nSenior VP, Corporate Controller & CAO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Roger, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Let me begin by echoing Roger's assessment of the team. This management team is laser-focused on delivering on our financial commitments and driving above-market growth across all financial metrics over the long term.\nTurning to Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.7 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues grew organically across all 3 reportable segments, given strong demand across our customer sets, robust hiring and better retention. Our growth came despite a $24 million negative impact from foreign currency movements. At current foreign exchange rates, FX will become a tailwind sometime in our second quarter.\nTurning to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $346 million for the first quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.4%. Non-GAAP net income was $205 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.47. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS were down 8% and 7%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. I'll get to the underlying drivers next, but let me be clear, the shortfall to the level of performance we expect from this company is temporary, concentrated and recoverable.\nTurning to those segment drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased 3% compared to the prior year quarter. The largest growth catalyst were the Navy NGEN, an SDA widefield review Tranche 1 contracts as well as the Australian Airborne acquisition. For the quarter, Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating income margin increased to 8.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior year quarter with better program performance and growth in higher-margin areas such as airborne surveillance.\nHealth revenues increased 9% over the prior year quarter, driven by growth on the Social Security Administration IT work and another strong quarter on the DHMSM program. Non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 15.9%, which was up 160 basis points sequentially and at the high end of the mid-teens range we've talked about, bolstered by additional [ disability exam ] volume and excellent program execution. Civil revenues increased 10% compared to the prior year quarter. The NASA Aegis program was the largest driver and we also saw increased demand from our commercial energy customers. Civil non-GAAP operating income margin was 6.4% compared to 7.7% in the prior year quarter, and 11.2% last quarter.\nThe decrease in segment profitability, which led to the sequential and year-over-year declines at the enterprise level was focused in our security products business, driven by 3 main factors: First, [ certain ] of our existing programs were delayed due to customers not meeting their schedule commitments. They were unable to take possession of equipment because they had not yet completed site preparation. Second, supply chain disruptions led to higher component prices or shortages, which then impacted maintenance schedules and triggered penalties under certain service level agreements. Third, we're investing in enhancements to our product suite particularly around our [ Mosaic ] software platform, which integrates all security components into a single management system. This innovation was key to our recent awards at Frankfurt and Luton Airport.\nMost of the fixes have already been implemented or are in process. We've reconfigured inventory management and rationalized our service provider network. We're working with customers on scheduling and expect that orders in our backlog will be delivered and accepted this year. And we're taking actions to ensure that our investment and delivery model are rightsized to withstand the lumpiness that's inherent in a product-driven business.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was a use of $98 million and free cash flow was a use of $137 million. As expected and communicated, cash flow for the quarter was reduced by $191 million in tax payments for prior year activities, primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provision requiring the capitalization and amortization of research and development costs. Cash collections were in line with our expectations and normal Q1 levels. For example, DSOs were at 62 days, which is a 1-day improvement from a year ago. We're on a path to take out at least 4 days over the course of the year, consistent with our usual pattern. Cash generation is a major focus item across the company, involving not only finance, but contracts, business development and program management, and we expect to drive sustainably improved performance over time.\nDuring the first quarter, we returned $93 million to shareholders, including $25 million in open market share repurchases, $18 million in repurchases related to incentive compensation transactions and $50 million through our ongoing dividend program. During the quarter, we also strengthened our balance sheet and increased our financial flexibility. We issued $750 million of 10-year bonds with a fixed rate of 5.75%, refinanced our term loan A and revolver and paid off the $500 million note that was due in May.\nOn balance, we put more of our debt on long-term bonds and less on the term loan, while upsizing our revolver to $1 billion. With strong demand, we were able to price the transaction at very favorable terms in the current rate environment. Once we repay the remaining $320 million on the short-term loan originally tied to the Gibbs & Cox acquisition, our next tranche of debt doesn't come due until 2025.\nOn to the forward outlook. We're maintaining our guidance from the Q4 call. Specifically, we expect 2023 revenues between $14.7 billion and $15.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3% to 10.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $6.40 and $6.80 and cash from operations at $700 million or greater. With 3 quarters to go, we believe the current ranges still encompass the likely outcomes for the year.\nRevenue, margins and cash should all build throughout the year. As Roger mentioned, strong demand and an improving labor market support revenue growth. Margins will improve through a combination of resolving the issues around the security products business, opportunities within the Health segment, most notably increased medical examinations tied to the [ PAC ] Act, appropriate cost reductions and normal seasonality in our portfolio. As is our usual pattern, cash generation will be back-end weighted in 2023 with a spike in the third quarter, which is the end of the government fiscal year.\nIn closing, I want to publicly thank Roger for his leadership over these 9 years, both in transforming this company and providing valuable mentorship to me. He's hard to replace, but I look forward to welcoming Tom Bell, introducing him to the investment community over the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

Welcome to the Leidos Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis from Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may now begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nSVP of IR, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call.\nJoining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we're using today.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFinally, as shown on Slide 3, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nRoger A. Krone\n\nChairman & CEO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us this morning. And by the way, Happy Valentine's Day. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a banner year for Leidos with record revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS, driving us to the top end of our revenue guidance range and beyond our EPS guidance range for the year.\nOur performance validated that our diversified and resilient portfolio and our investments in technology and innovation are positioning us for growth in key customer missions, including digital modernization, cyber, hypersonics and force protection. Each and every day, our 45,000 people are helping our customers execute on important missions and meet the world's most complex challenges.\nAgainst a challenging backdrop in 2022, we delivered on our financial commitments, allocated capital to deliver value for our shareholders, won multiple franchise programs that position us for future growth, and significantly grew our talent base. So let me provide more detail on each of these points.\nNumber one, our strong financial performance in the fourth quarter enabled us to deliver on our financial commitments. Record revenue of $3.7 billion for the quarter and $14.4 billion for the year, were up 6% and 5%, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7% in the quarter was up 40 basis points year-over-year, which helped drive adjusted non-GAAP diluted EPS to a record $1.83, which represents growth of 17%. For the year, adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4% helped lead to non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.60, which was well above our guidance.\nWe generated $105 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter and free cash flow of $52 million. For the year, that translates to nearly $1 billion of cash flow from operations and $857 million in free cash flow, which were right at guided levels.\nThese results came despite multiple headwinds, most notably a protracted continuing resolution to start the year, inflation, supply chain disruptions and labor constraints. Even at industry-leading scale, we're nimble enough to pivot as needed, and I'm proud of how well the team pulled together and weathered these challenges.\nNumber two, in 2022, we allocated capital to deliver value for our shareholders. Over the year, capital deployment was heavily weighted towards return to shareholders, while still layering in strategic acquisition of the Australian airborne business and investing to grow our core business through capital expenditures and internal R&D.\nWith our asset-light model, CapEx was just under 1% of revenues with large investments in airborne ISR and Dynetics, and we're seeing those investments pay off in additional aircraft, performing valuable missions and key wins in hypersonics, which takes me to number 3: business development.\nThis year, we won franchise programs in each segment that position us for growth. Programs like DES and Defense, Social Security Administration IT in Health and AEGIS in Civil contributed to performance in 2022 and have built the foundation for 2023 and beyond. They demonstrate our ability to take away work and target brand-new opportunities.\nIn the fourth quarter, which is typically the weakest in our industry, we booked $3.7 billion of net awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0. For the year, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1. Total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $35.8 billion, of which a record $8.4 billion was funded. Total backlog is up 4% and funded backlog is up 13% year-over-year.\nAfter a relatively slow start to the year across the industry, contract activity is improving. Most importantly, our submit volume picked up dramatically in the fourth quarter with $23 billion in submits, of which 92% was for new business. Taken together, the 2 Social Security Administration IT task orders that we spoke of last call were the largest award in the quarter.\nGAO dismissed the competitor's protest earlier than expected, and that program has fully ramped. We also won more than $0.5 billion in hypersonics award, including Mayhem, our first major contract on the air-breathing side and Wide Field of View Tranche 1, which is the backbone of the nation's hypersonics defense capability.\nWe're pleased that so many of you were able to join us in Huntsville last December to get a clear picture of the opportunities that we see at Dynetics. Our independent research and development investments were critical to procuring these awards, just as they were for our landmark wins in digital modernization.\nIn 2022, we invested $116 million in IR&D and IRAD has grown at a compound annual rate of 23% over the last 5 years. We continually invest to develop proprietary tools and unique processes to drive competitive advantage. We've already deployed workflow transformations using the latest generation of AI based on large language models, and we're at the leading edge of combining artificial intelligence and cyber to enable our customers to achieve security levels that are beyond compliance.\nSpeaking of cyber, earlier this month, we announced the latest version of our Zero Trust readiness level tool suite that simplifies Zero Trust adoption for government organizations, consolidating a 6- to 9-month planning process to less than 60 days. We drive digital innovations by working tightly with our product partners.\nFor example, we've partnered with Intel Corp to demonstrate confidential computing through a hardware-based independently attested trusted execution environment. And just last month, we were recognized as the 2023 ServiceNow Americas' Premier Partner of the Year.\nNumber four, we significantly grew our talent base. We hired more than 2,400 people in the fourth quarter and more than 11,000 in 2022. Head count was up 6% for the year and attrition rates continue to subside. We've seen great synergy between our people engagement and technology investment initiatives.\nEmployees in our technical upskilling programs have significantly higher retention and we more than doubled participation in 2022 compared to 2021. Our technical upskilling programs are aligned with our technology strategy and broad participation is enabling us to enhance our competitive position and deepen our culture of innovation. If you want to build your technical skills over a fulfilling career, Leidos is a great place to work.\nIn 2022, we offered courses in artificial intelligence and machine learning, software, cyber, cloud and digital engineering. In 2023, we're expanding with new offerings in cyber operations, secure rapid software development and specialized learning paths in AI/ML.\nWe also take learning and engagement beyond the classroom. Two weeks from now, we'll launch our seventh annual AI Palooza challenge, where employees around the company will engage with some of the newest AI/ML techniques in a creative and collaborative competition. Perpetual learning is part of our culture, and we make it fun.\nBefore turning it over to Chris, I'll touch on the current budget environment. Demand trends are very positive for our business. Late last year, Congress overwhelmingly passed, and the President signed the Omnibus Appropriations bill funding the government through September. Budgets across the board saw a healthy increases, including defense spending, which was up about 10%.\nThe budget addressed the critical challenges we're facing as a nation including national security concerns arising from China and Russia, and Leidos is well positioned to respond. Amidst a highly partisan backdrop, President Biden's calls in the State of Union Address to support Ukraine, protect our country and modernize our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression received strong bipartisan support.\nThat said, we're anticipating a series of noisy debates over the coming months around the debt ceiling and the 2024 appropriations, given the razor thin majorities and the deep divisions in Congress. As a matter of prudence, we're preparing contingency plans around a potential government shutdown. But we built our 2023 guidance, assuming a continuing resolution beginning in October and extending through the rest of the year with no government shutdown. We believe this is the most likely outcome.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with the performance and the momentum of the company. In the fourth quarter, we posted record levels of revenue, non-GAAP diluted EPS and funded backlog as well as the highest adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and lowest attrition rate for the year.\nWe anticipate that 2023 will be another good year for Leidos, marked by strong hiring, important new wins, solid growth in revenue and operating income.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Chris for more details on our results and our 2023 outlook.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Let me echo Roger and express my gratitude to the entire Leidos team for how we executed in 2022. We navigated many challenges throughout the year, including an unexpected adverse arbitration ruling in Q2 and to deliver at the top end of our revenue guidance range and above our EPS guidance range for the year, all while delivering for our customers.\nTurning to Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.7 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year quarter. For the year, revenues were $14.4 billion, which was up 5% compared to 2021, despite a $107 million headwind from foreign currency movements, primarily from work in the U.K. and Australia in our Defense Solutions segment. 2022 revenue performance was in line with the targets that we laid out 16 months ago for '22 through '24.\nTurning to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $397 million for the fourth quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, our highest margin of the year and above expectations based on higher growth on more profitable programs, better performance on some large programs and disciplined cost management. 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $1.49 billion for a margin of 10.4% or right at the midpoint of guidance that we've held all year.\nNon-GAAP net income was $255 million for the quarter and $919 million for the year, which generated non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.83 for the quarter and $6.60 for the year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 17% for the quarter, and essentially flat for the year as a result of some onetime events that we've talked about in the past.\nLooking at the key drivers below EBITDA. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20.1%, which was below our expectation and added about $0.09 to EPS. The tax rate benefited from certain international tax credits and limitations, increases in our federal research tax credit and higher-than-planned stock compensation deductions. In addition, net interest expense in the quarter increased to $51 million from $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nFinally, the weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 138 million compared to 142 million in the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of the $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement implemented in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nNow for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues in Q4 of $2.07 billion were essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter. 2022 Defense Solutions revenues of $8.24 billion were up 3% for the year. Civil revenues were $938 million in the quarter, up 17% compared to the prior year quarter, and 2022 revenues were $3.46 billion, up 10% compared to 2021.\nThe primary driver for growth in the quarter and the year was the ramp on the NASA AEGIS program. In addition, we had good growth within our commercial energy business as well as increased security products, sales and maintenance. Health revenues were $691 million for the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by performance on DHMSM and our new work on SSA IT.\nHealth revenues were $2.69 billion for the year, up 5% over 2021, with the same drivers that I cited for the quarter, plus strong performance on the Military and Family Life Counseling program.\nOn the margin front, on Slide 7, Defense Solutions and Civil posted their highest margins in more than a year based on mix and some excellent program performance. For the quarter, Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin came in at 8.6%, up 40 basis points compared to the prior year quarter; and Civil came in at 11.2%, up from 10% in the prior year quarter.\nDefense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 8.3%, which was down 30 basis points from 2021, primarily from investments in new program startups. Civil non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 9.2%, down from 10.2% in the prior year, driven by legal matters that we've addressed in prior calls, a $26 million gain in 2021, and a $19 million expense in 2022.\nHealth non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, consistent with what we've been talking about for some time. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the year finished at 17.1%.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $105 million, and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $52 million. For the year, operating cash flow was just shy of $1 billion and free cash flow was $857 million for a 94% conversion rate.\nIn the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Australian airborne business, which provides maritime surveillance operations for the Australian Border Force and search and rescue response capability for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, purchase consideration was approximately USD 190 million, net of $6 million of cash acquired.\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, Leidos returned $741 million to shareholders, including $199 million as part of its regular quarterly cash dividend program and $542 million in share repurchases. As of December 30, 2022, the company had $516 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.9 billion in debt.\nRoughly $1 billion of that debt will come due in this year. Most of it in May. We expect to fully repay the remaining $320 million on the short-term loan originally tied to the Gibbs & Cox acquisition and then rolled over in support of the ASR program. We'll refinance the $500 million of maturing bonds as well as the bank term loan A still tied to LIBOR in an efficient and flexible manner, but interest expense will increase given the current rate environment.\nAs we approach the debt market, we're pleased with the recent upgrade from Moody's to Baa2 credit rating, which signals their confidence in our financial stability and outlook. We're already benefiting from improved terms on our commercial paper borrowing and expect that to carry through on the debt transactions.\nAs we close out the year, we remain committed to a target leverage ratio of 3x. Our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same and consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth both organically and inorganically and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.\nOnto the forward outlook on Slide 9. For 2023, we expect revenues between $14.7 billion and $15.1 billion, reflecting growth in the range of 2% to 5% over fiscal year 2022. Demand remains strong as our customers execute robust budgets, and we enter 2023 with a number of programs that are ramping, but the procurement process is still protracted.\nWe expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.3% and 10.5%. The midpoint of the margin range is the same as 2022. And the top end is consistent with the target that we laid out at our October 2021 Investor Day.\nWe're committed to long-term margin expansion, and we'll pull multiple levers to offset the impact of inflation and supply chain on our cost structure, as we demonstrated in the back half of 2022. We're closely managing our corporate cost with a special focus on real estate.\nGAAP net income in the quarter reflected impairment charges of $37 million from exiting and consolidating underutilized leased spaces. Since beginning our journey to optimize our real estate footprint post COVID, we've exited over 2 million square feet, which is about 25% of our office space. Getting out of that space improves our competitiveness and keeps corporate costs in check.\nWe expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for 2023 between $6.40 and $6.80 on the basis of 138 million shares outstanding, which is unchanged from fourth quarter levels. To provide some context around that range, we expect 2023 net interest expense of approximately $225 million, and a non-GAAP tax rate between 23% and 24%. These 2 items amount to an EPS headwind of about $0.20 for the year.\nFinally, we expect operating cash flow of at least $700 million. This guidance reflects approximately $300 million of additional cash taxes compared to fiscal year 2022, primarily related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provision requiring the capitalization and amortization of research and development costs.\nAs we're awaiting potential congressional action, we didn't make any Section 174 related tax payments last year. So we'll need to make payments this year to cover both '22 and '23. We paid the 2022 Section 174 taxes in January, and we expect to pay the '23 taxes in quarterly installments throughout the year.\nFrom a free cash flow perspective, we're targeting capital expenditures of approximately 1.5% of revenues, based on the timing of some investments in Australian and U.S. airborne surveillance as well as in-sourcing some of the security product supply chain.\nAs is our usual pattern, cash generation will be back-end weighted in 2023, along with the tax and debt payments in Q1 and Q2, this limits the ability to deploy capital for shareholders in the first half of the year.\nAs a result, the EPS guidance range does not account for any repurchases, and we'll update you as we go throughout the year.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob, so we can take some questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nSVP of IR, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call. .\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFinally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nRoger A. Krone\n\nChairman & CEO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our third quarter results demonstrate the momentum in our business as we continue to report revenue growth at the upper end of our guidance across our diversified portfolio. In addition, our dedicated team delivered earnings in excess of our forecast and generated the highest quarterly cash flow from operations in our history. These results position us well to deliver on our full year financial targets as we make the world safer, healthier and more efficient. As usual, I'll touch on our financial performance, capital allocation, business development performance and people. .\nFirst, our financial performance for the quarter was strong and ahead of consensus at both the top and bottom lines. Record revenue of $3.61 billion were up 4% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3% was up 10 basis points sequentially and non-GAAP diluted EPS came in above our forecast and consensus. Our third quarter performance and improved visibility enables us to raise our revenue outlook and derisk our earnings for the full year.\nWe also generated a record $748 million of cash flow from operations. This puts us on track to meet our cash commitment for the year, strengthens our balance sheet and positions us for future capital deployments to benefit shareholders, which brings me to point number two, our approach to capital allocation.\nYesterday, we closed our acquisition of Cobham Aviation Services, Australia's Aviation Special Mission unit. This business provides border force airborne surveillance and marine safety, search and rescue and generates roughly USD 100 million in annual revenues. It is immediately accretive to both non-GAAP EPS and EBITDA margin. At this point in our strategic journey, the Cobham acquisition is a great example of what we're looking for. It expands market access, provides us franchise programs with a customer of strategic importance and complements our existing business, all at a multiple below ours and a price that enables our shareholders to benefit from future revenue and cost synergies.\nOur cost -- our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $807 million, as collections were especially strong in the back half of September, the close of the government fiscal year. Our plan is not to accumulate cash. We just paid for the Cobham acquisition and we'll be paying down some debt to move closer to our target leverage ratio of 3x. Our balance sheet enables us to steadily deploy capital in productive ways. Given the strength of the company and evaluation that doesn't reflect our long history of driving steady earnings growth and cash generation will lean towards share repurchase when we have deployable capital.\nNumber three, our business development results demonstrate that our strong positioning in the government technology marketplace is enabling us to navigate a difficult environment. Procurement time lines continue to extend and DoD outlays continue to lag budget authority. With net bookings of $4.1 billion in the quarter, we achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 and grew backlog to $35 billion or $35.4 billion on a constant currency basis. We also had nearly $1 billion of third quarter awards protested. Absent the protests, book-to-bill would have been $1.4 billion.\nHighlighting some important awards. We received a 5-year $1.5 billion task order to support the DoD with rapid technology insertion to enhance C5ISR emissions globally. We expect to receive the full award value over the life of the contract, but in accordance with our policy, we only booked $100 million in the quarter. This award, known as Sentinel, is all about getting capabilities into theater and to the combatant commanders quickly. As a solution agnostic integrator, part of our role is to find innovative technologies that can be rapidly matured, proven and integrated in support of multi-domain operations.\nSentinel fits within the joint all-domain command and control or JADC2 umbrella. Our positioning on JADC2 was also bolstered by the Air Force's selection of the Advanced Battle Management System Digital Infrastructure Consortium. With 4 other consortium members, Leidos will work to deliver the Air Force's vision for distributed battle management and decision advantage by enabling speed, security and integration at scale.\nNAVSEA awarded Leidos a $358 million contract to design and build a medium-sized unmanned undersea vehicle to provide autonomous oceanographic sensing and data collection for operational intelligence as well as to support mine countermeasures. We also received our first task order on the $11.5 billion defense Enclave services contract. The $138 million task order will lay the framework and begin to consolidate, integrate and optimize 5 agencies on a common network architecture through digital modernization and transformation.\nWe successfully completed the transition period and have assumed operational responsibility for DoD net and [DISA net] And in a key win for our space business within Dynetics, we received a subcontract with Northrop Grumman to develop hypersonic defense sensors for the Space Development Agency. We have more than 40 years of experience developing and flying space-based electro-optical and infrared sensors and payloads for a variety of missions. Through this award, we'll develop and build the sensor payload for a proliferated constellation of Low Earth Orbit satellites for the tranche 1 tracking layer. The tracking layer constellation will detect and track advanced hypersonic and ballistic missile threats as part of SDAs missile defense architecture.\nOn the predecessor contract, our tranche 0 payload is on schedule to launch by the end of the year. The tranche 1 design will increase coverage area while reducing payload size, weight and power. Eventually, these constellations of satellites will form the core of a new national defense space architecture, providing global coverage and adding resiliency in the countries Missile Warning Arena.\nAs a reminder, we'll be hosting an investor site visit at Dynetics in Huntsville, Alabama on December 1. Please reach out to Stuart if you're interested in attending.\nAnd the final key win that I'll touch on this morning is the reaward of our IT support to the Social Security administration. As of the second quarter call, our award was protested by the previous incumbent. And after a resubmission of proposals, the SSA reawarded all of the work to Leidos. The incumbent once again protested the award and the new GAO review period expires on January 3.\nAnd lastly, point #4. Leidos is an attractive destination for great talent. In the third quarter, we hired just over 2,800 people, and year-to-date, we've hired more than 9,000 people and increased head count by more than 2,000. It's still early but voluntary attrition is trending in the right direction, and we don't expect that staffing will significantly constrain our plans for next year. Our dedicated and capable people are a key differentiator for us and an important national asset.\nBefore turning it over to Chris, let me touch on the federal budget landscape. As expected, the federal government is operating under a continuing resolution at last year's funding levels until December 16. Congress is still working on the appropriations and authorization bills for government fiscal year 2023. Nothing gets voted on until after the November 8 elections, but we expect that robust budgets will get passed before the end of the calendar year. Outlays are beginning to improve which bodes well for future growth.\nChris, over to you.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Third quarter results were positive and in line with the picture that we gave on the second quarter call. .\nTurning to Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.61 billion, up 4% compared to the prior year quarter despite a currency translation headwind of $32 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $372 million for the third quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%, which was up 10 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP net income was $221 million or $1.59 per share. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS were down 15% and 12%, respectively compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, which had the highest earnings in our history, driven primarily by the COVID catch-up in the business.\nLet me touch on a few of the below-the-line drivers. Net interest expense increased to $50 million from $47 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 with the rise in interest rates. The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was $138 million compared to $143 million in the prior year quarter, driven by the ASR we executed in the first half of the year.\nFinally, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.8%, up 170 basis points sequentially, which reflected the cumulative catch-up for changes to the mix of revenues across foreign and state jurisdictions. The higher-than-expected tax rate lowered non-GAAP diluted EPS in the quarter by $0.04.\nNow for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6. Defense Solutions revenues increased by 3.3% compared to the prior year quarter. The largest growth drivers were the ramps on the NGEN and various force protection programs, which more than offset the end of our Afghanistan support contracts and the foreign exchange headwind. Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.1%.\nCivil revenues increased 10.4% compared to the prior year quarter. The NASA Aegis program was the primary revenue driver, but we also saw good growth on our security products and commercial energy businesses. The mix shift helped drive non-GAAP operating income margin to 11%, up from 9.6% in the prior year quarter and the highest level in 6 quarters.\nHealth revenues decreased 3.4% over the prior year quarter. Revenue in the year ago period benefited from the backlog of disability exams caused by COVID-19, and our share of certain exams has fallen with additional competitors added to 1 of our contracts. These factors outweighed another strong quarter on the DHMSM program.\nTo this point, we have not seen much benefit from the PACT Act that was passed in the last quarter, although disability exam volumes remain high. Non-GAAP operating income margin came in at 15%, which is where we've been signaling all year.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $748 million, and free cash flow was $721 million. These were record numbers for Leidos, and I'm tremendously proud of the team's focus and dedication. In addition, the government customers were looking to clear the decks at the end of their fiscal year and in some cases, paid invoices that would normally have been collected in Q4.\nDSOs in the quarter came down 3 days sequentially to 58, which is our target level. Great effort by the entire team. During the third quarter, we returned $53 million to shareholders primarily through our ongoing dividend program. At the end of the quarter, we had $807 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5 billion of debt. We closed the Cobham Aviation Special Mission acquisition earlier this week for USD 214 million, inclusive of the hedge that we had taken at the signing of the definitive agreement.\nIn addition, we continue to focus on reducing our leverage ratio, and we'll use some of our cash balances to repay part of the $1 billion of debt that matures in the first half of 2023 and reposition our balance sheet for the future.\nOn to 2022 guidance. Our new ranges are shown on Slide 8, and you can see the outlook has improved from last quarter based on strong performance across the company. The revised guidance includes 2 months of contribution from the special mission business acquisition as well. We now expect 2022 revenues between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion, so we've added $300 million to the bottom of the prior range and $100 million to the top end, even after absorbing an adverse impact of foreign exchange rates of about $70 million.\nWe're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 10.3% to 10.5%. We still have work to do to get back into the margin range for the year, but I'm proud of how the entire company has responded to the margin pressures that we spoke of on last call. For example, we decreased indirect spending and improved direct labor utilization across all 3 segments. We're also taking a look at accelerating real estate reductions to drive out additional cost, which will improve our competitiveness and our margins going forward. We'll have more to report on that front on the Q4 call.\nWe're now guiding non-GAAP diluted earnings per share between $6.20 and $6.40. So we've taken $0.10 off the top and bottom of the prior ranges. As I touched on earlier, our effective tax rate for the year is going to be a full point higher than we previously expected, which creates an $0.08 headwind to EPS. Compared to last quarter, our confidence around operating performance has improved.\nFinally, we're keeping cash flow from operations guidance at $1 billion or greater. Obviously, we had a tremendous performance in Q3, which puts us on track for another strong cash year. We continue to monitor the potential for Congress to act on the tax research cost capitalization rules. With no change in law, the cost capitalization provision amounts to a negative impact to operating cash flow of about $150 million annually. We haven't made any federal tax payments related to the amortization of research costs this year and do not plan to, although we will continue to reevaluate as conditions change. Barring a legislative fix, we expect to pay this $150 million in early January of 2023. And then make normal quarterly tax payments inclusive of this impact thereafter.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions. I'm sorry. Maria, we're ready to take some questions."

Welcome to the Leidos Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nSVP of IR, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call.\nJoining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer.

Krone\n\nChairman & CEO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us this morning.\nLeidos remains on track for another year of solid organic growth and core business profitability. The affirmation of our Defense Enclave Services contract award by the Government Accountability Office demonstrates our leadership in digital modernization across the federal government, with strong demand for our technology solutions and services across our diversified business portfolio.\nWe continue to execute on our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder value. And we are proving our ability to compete successfully for talent with another quarter of robust hiring. I'll now expand on these 4 points.\nNumber one, our financial performance for the quarter was strong, ahead of consensus at both the top and bottom lines. Revenues of $3.6 billion were up 4.3% in total and up 4% organically year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was also up 5% to $1.59, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.2%. We also generated $40 million of cash flow from operations and are on track to generate at least $1 billion of operating cash flow this year.\nNumber two, our business development results demonstrate our strong positioning in the government technology marketplace. We achieved net bookings of $2.2 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.6. Over the past 12 months, net bookings are $15.4 billion and book-to-bill is 1.1. Total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $34.7 billion, which was up 4% year-over-year, with funded backlog of $7.5 billion, up 5%. On a constant currency basis, backlog was $268 million higher.\nYou can read about some of our awards in the press release, but let me highlight a few developments in the quarter. Most importantly, the GAO affirmed $11.4 billion DES award to Leidos. We'll support [DISA's] mission by consolidating enterprise IT services at a global scale and by providing standardized, responsive and cost-effective solutions. This program should have a several year runway of growing revenue and expanding profitability, but will not add materially to the 2022 revenue or earnings.\nWe also had an outstanding outcome on our Social Security Administration position. The SSA recompeted all of the work under its primary IT services IDIQ, known as ITSSC2, in 2 task orders. And we significantly expanded our role. We were the sole large business awardee on both task orders. On the first, we'll modernize and manage the SSA's IT infrastructure, including data center, data operations, networks, telecommunications, cloud and user services. And all of this is new work for us.\nOn the second, we'll now perform all of the software development and mission application work that we previously split with other providers. As expected, both of the awards were protested last week. But should we prevail, we could double our revenue at SSA and make ITSSC2 a top 10 program.\nFinally, we've seen some initial indications of an improving airport screening landscape. We were selected by the Dominican Republic's Punta Cana International Airport to upgrade both people and baggage screening at all security lanes within the Terminal B checkpoint. In addition, bid volume and bid scale has increased meaningfully when compared to the first half of 2021. And we're getting great feedback on our ability to differentiate our offerings by bringing broader Leidos capabilities, like cyber protection. Although we're not expecting a full recovery in the airport screening business until 2024, it's good to see some positive trends here.\nThat said, the overall bookings environment has been challenging as procurement time lines continue to extend. DoD outlays, for example, are down 2% this government fiscal year-to-date compared to fiscal year '21 despite a higher budget. Still, our book-to-bill ratio understates the true strength of the business development performance in the quarter as it includes nothing for DES and the protested SSA awards. Our win rates and submit volumes remain high, and we expect procurements will pick up to match the improved budget environment.\nNumber 3, our approach to capital allocation is a core part of our investment thesis. We've talked about being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend, reinvesting for growth both organically and inorganically, and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. And we're doing all of that.\nIn Q1, we executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase. And we've just entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cobham Aviation Services, Australia's Aviation Special Mission business, for about [USD 215 million]. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, and we expect to close by the end of the year. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP EPS. The business owns and operates 14 modified aircraft, providing border force airborne surveillance and maritime safety search and rescue to the Australian Federal Government and a critical element of Australia's national security. This acquisition diversifies our Australian portfolio into capability and mission services work with both the Defense Maritime and Homeland Affairs programs. Finally, integration risk is manageable because airborne surveillance is what we know how to do well and we already have strong local leadership and infrastructure to support success.\nNumber four, Leidos is an attractive destination for talented people. In the second quarter, we hired nearly 3,600 people, a number we've only surpassed once in 5 years. And that's when we were simultaneously staffing the Navy NGEN program and the Military and Family Life Counseling program. Year-to-date, we've hired more than 6,200 people. Quarter-after-quarter, we demonstrated that talent acquisition is a core Leido's strength.\nOn the Q1 call, we talked about challenges around retention. Competition for talent remains high as critical skills for us, such as software engineers and developers, are in demand by both tech and nontech companies. Even though voluntary attrition seems to have peaked, we remain focused on keeping engaged with our people. In fact, our June leadership offsite was focused on retention, and we're now implementing many of the ideas that came out of that session.\nBefore turning it over to Chris, let me touch on the federal budget landscape. The House and Senate Armed Services committees approved versions of the Fiscal Year '23 National Defense Authorization Act. Both of which recommended healthy increases to the President's request. Congress fully recognizes the urgency of investing in our national security in the face of global security threats. The fiscal year '23 appropriations process is also underway, which should result in significant nominal increases to 2022 levels. But we expect that the government will begin the fiscal year with a continuing resolution that should be resolved before the end of the 116th Congress.\nAnd finally, I'm pleased to announce that we'll be hosting an investor site visit at Dynetics in Huntsville, Alabama this fall. Dynetics is an important part of our value proposition for investors and a key differentiator for us in the marketplace. The event will start with a dinner with the leadership team on November 30, with a mix of briefings, tours of the production facilities and Q&A with the team on December 1. Expect to come away with a much better understanding of the culture and key growth drivers for Dynetics, including the Hypersonic's Indirect Fire Protection Capability and space-based missile defense programs. Please reach out to Stuart if you're interested in attending.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Second quarter results were very positive overall. And there are a number of moving pieces I want to cover this morning, starting with the income statement on Slide 5. Revenues for the quarter were $3.6 billion, up 4.3% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues grew organically across all 3 reportable segments given robust hiring and our recent program wins.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $366 million for the second quarter, which was up 1.9% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 10.4% to 10.2% over the same period. Non-GAAP net income was $220 million for the second quarter, which was up immaterially year-over-year. And non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.59, up 5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. The performance of the base business is solid and stable.\nA couple of factors below EBITDA that drive EPS are worth noting. Net interest expense increased to $50 million from $46 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, with higher borrowing and the rise in interest rates. The weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 138 million compared to 143 million in the prior year quarter. The current share count benefits from the retirement of 300,000 shares as part of the final settlement of the ASR program.\nNow for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6.\nDefense Solutions revenues increased by 2.4% compared to the prior year quarter. The largest growth drivers were the NGEN and IFPC ramps, which more than offset the end of our Afghanistan support contracts and reduced material purchases supporting hypersonics programs. In addition, the strengthening dollar represented about a $24 million year-over-year headwind for our U.K. and Australia businesses, which lowered the segment growth rate by about 1 point. Defense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.3%, which was unchanged compared to the prior year quarter.\nCivil revenues increased 7.3% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the start-up of the NASA AEGIS program and increased demand on existing programs, including the support to Hanford and our engineering support to commercial energy providers. Civil non-GAAP operating income margin was 6.5% compared to 9.1% in the prior year quarter as a result of an adverse arbitration ruling, which led to $17 million of additional expense related to a dispute arising out of the acquisition of the IS&GS business from Lockheed Martin in 2016. Excluding this arbitration write-down, Civil margins would have been up sequentially to 8.5%.\nHealth revenues increased 6.7% over the prior year quarter. We continue to benefit from the ramp on the Military and Family Life Counseling program, and DHMSM had a nice year-over-year increase based on the deployment timing. In addition, we had a $28 million equitable adjustment to cover costs incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused non-GAAP operating margin to improve to 19.8% from 17.8% in the prior year quarter. We had originally anticipated to receive this payment in the second half of the year, so we're pleased to resolve this matter earlier than expected.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $40 million, and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $19 million. While DSOs in the quarter came down 2 days sequentially to 61, $110 million of collections that we anticipated in Q2 came in during the first week of July. We're targeting another 3 days of DSO improvement over the back half of the year, which is consistent with our historical pattern.\nDuring the second quarter, we returned $51 million to shareholders, primarily through our ongoing dividend program. We also rolled over the $380 million term loan related to the Gibbs & Cox acquisition that came due in May. At the end of the quarter, we had $339 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.2 billion in debt, including $150 million of commercial paper notes outstanding.\nThe purchase price for the Cobhom Aviation Special Mission acquisition was AUD 310 million, which we hedge to lock us in at the USD 215 million purchase price that Roger quoted. With that acquisition, we expect 2022 will follow our standard capital allocation approach, with the balance of organic and inorganic growth investments, dividends, share repurchases against the backdrop of a leverage ratio trending towards 3x.\nOn to the forward outlook. As shown on Slide 8, we're maintaining our guidance ranges for fiscal year 2022. The guidance does not include the impact of the Australian Aviation acquisition, which should be relatively small for this year. Taking a big picture view, when we put together our plan for 2022, we had expected to build momentum through the year. Our guidance calls for the second half to be more in line with the first half from a revenue, EPS and EBITDA perspective. Part of that shift is driven by overperformance in the first half. But there are a number of other factors that I'll address as I walk through the individual guidance elements.\nOn revenues, we're ahead of where we expected coming into the year, stemming from the build-out of our recent wins and on-contract growth through trusted customer relationships. This gives us increased confidence in being in the upper half of the revenue range. Increased legal expenses and the unexpected arbitration ruling are pressuring EPS and EBITDA margin. And we're experiencing a larger-than-expected headwind from broader economic issues, including foreign exchange rates and interest expense.\nIn addition, we've had more margin dilution than anticipated from the start-up of some newer programs. Accordingly, it will be challenging to perform at or above the midpoint of the EPS and EBITDA margin ranges. Even though most of the causal factors are transitory in nature, we're taking actions on items within our control. We haven't changed our long-term view of margins.\nFinally, we're maintaining our operating cash flow guidance of at least $1 billion. The arbitration ruling will result in a $25 million cash payment. We'll have to offset that payment, but I have confidence in our team's ability to deliver on the cash commitment.\nWe continue to monitor the potential for Congress to act on the new tax research cost capitalization rules. At this time, we do not expect to make any federal tax payments related to the amortization of research costs this year. If the 2022 effective date of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act research cost capitalization provision remains in place, we expect our income taxes payable and net deferred tax assets will each increase by approximately $150 million in fiscal 2022, and the related negative impact to cash will be realized in fiscal 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

Welcome to Leidos First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease note this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Stuart, you may now begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nSVP of IR, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, and as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFinally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who'll begin on Slide 4.\n\nRoger A. Krone\n\nChairman & CEO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us this morning.\nOur first quarter marked a strong start to 2022 with record levels of revenue, backlog -- and backlog stemming from our leadership position in the government technology market. We continue to build our reputation and track record of performance in digital technology, cyber and innovative systems across our diversified, resilient business portfolio. Our strong first quarter results and the improving federal budget picture increase our confidence in delivering on our full year financial commitments.\nI'll organize my remarks around four messages. First, our financial results demonstrate our ability to meet our commitments and outperform the market. Second, our business development results are a testament to our differentiated position in the market. Third, our consistent capital allocation approach drives shareholder value. And fourth, we are able to attract the workforce we need and develop them for long-term success.\nNumber one, our financial performance was strong at both the top and bottom lines. Revenues of $3.49 billion were up 5.4% in total and up 4.4% organically year-over-year, which is, once again, towards the top of the market. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.58 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.2%. All three metrics were ahead of our plan for the quarter. Finally, we generated $93 million of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $65 million. We remain on track to generate more than $1 billion of operating cash flow this year.\nNumber two, business development sustained the momentum that drove our industry-leading organic growth last year. We achieved net bookings of $5.4 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.6. As a result, total backlog at the end of the quarter stood at a record $36.3 billion, which was up 11.6% year-over-year. The awards in the quarter were rich in new business and takeaways balanced across our three segments and concentrated in key capability areas, including digital transformation and cyber.\nIn Civil, two large awards successfully completed lengthy protests. We won a $2.5 billion, 10-year Advanced Enterprise Global Information Technology Solutions, or AEGIS, program, where we'll provide communication, data center, cloud and cybersecurity services across all of NASA's centers and facilities. For the FAA, we'll continue our more than 20 years of support on the National Airspace Systems Integration Support Contract. The new NISC contract is a single-award IDIQ with a $1.7 billion ceiling across 10 years. Our work encompasses strategic and transition planning, flight procedures, security and safety, data analytics and unmanned aircraft systems in support of air traffic control modernization efforts.\nIn Health, we won 2 multiple-award IDIQs totaling about $1.7 billion over 6.5 years to provide disability examinations for the Veterans Benefits Administration. The first was a recompete for pre-discharge exams in the United States, and the second is a new area for us, exams outside the United States. Although we'll have more competition within our legacy business, we're excited about the opportunity to expand internationally.\nIn Defense Solutions, our Gibbs & Cox subsidiary won a $319 million, 5-year award for ship design engineering services for the U.S. Navy's Future Service Combatant Program. We won 2 new cyber programs totaling $340 million, focusing on agile secure DevOps, cyber inspection and assessment, continuous monitoring and audit and security management services. We also had a takeaway win on a $100 million, single-award IDIQ to modernize the Army's gunnery training simulation Systems. This work serves to enhance readiness across the operational spectrum in support of national defense. And the biggest, most impactful win for the quarter is not included in our bookings. We were awarded the $11.5 billion Defense Enclave Services contract by the Defense Information Systems Agency. The DES contract is a 10-year digital modernization program focused on consolidating common IT services into a single-service provider framework. As expected, this award is now in protest with the GAO scheduled to decide in mid-June.\nOne of the keys to our BD success is our strategic partnerships, including with Amazon Web Services. I am proud that Leidos was awarded the AWS 2021 Public Sector Consulting Partner of the Year (sic) [AWS Public Sector Partner of the Year (Consulting)]. AWS recognized Leidos with this honor because of our deep technical partnerships in areas such as edge to cloud and next-generation digital infrastructures to build solutions that drive digital and cloud transformation. This recognition illustrates the value of the Leidos Alliance Partner Network, which we founded in 2018 to deepen relationships with the most important vendor partners across our business groups. This network has fostered greater collaboration with partners to drive technology innovations and continues to be a differentiator for Leidos on a wide range of proposals and programs.\nNumber three, I view capital allocation as one of the keys to creating shareholder value. Last quarter, we talked about a greater focus in 2022 on share repurchase, and we followed through with a $500 million accelerated share repurchase. We sit near our target leverage ratio, and our ability to generate cash gives us significant firepower for further capital deployment. We're well positioned to grow, and we'll continue to look for technology add-ons and strategic initiatives that bring us differentiated capabilities for customer access. We'll pursue large M&A only for a company that truly accelerates our strategy.\nNumber four, people are at the heart of what we do. In this quarter, we hired more than 2,600 people. One reason people are attracted to Leidos is that we enable our employees to build successful careers. We regularly review talent and planned development actions at all levels of the company.\nThis quarter, we made several key moves at the executive leadership team and Board levels. We're pleased to welcome our new Chief Human Resources Officer, Maureen Waterston, who brings an impressive background and skill set to the Leidos team. Her excitement and commitment will enhance our people experience here at Leidos. With about 1,600 funded vacancies and an industry-wide shortage of cleared technical talent, recruiting and retention remains areas of strategic focus. Maureen will lead our human capital strategy and continue shaping the employee journey at Leidos through our Leidos Life initiative.\nDave King has decided to step back from his role as Dynetics Group President. He will continue in a consulting capacity, ensuring a smooth change to new leadership and advising on matters of strategic importance. I want to thank Dave for his outstanding contributions thus far, and I look forward to working with him in his new capacity. Dave's deputy, Steve Cook, is stepping up as Dynetics Group President. Steve's extensive experience and background, both with Dynetics for 13 years and leading critical programs for NASA before that, have prepared him well for his new role. He'll team with Paul Engola as his deputy. In addition, Paul will lead the national security space business for Leidos with a focus on space surveillance, missile warning and space situation awareness.\nNext, our digital modernization business is growing rapidly with an expanding portfolio of differentiated technology. To meet the demands of our growing business, Steve Hull will move from his role as CIO to lead the enterprise and cyber solutions operation within the defense group. We've moved our CIO team under Chief Technology Officer Jim Carlini to tightly align our technology and CIO capabilities.\nFinally, Pat Shanahan has joined our Board of Directors. He served at the highest levels of government, including Deputy Secretary, Defense and Acting Secretary, Defense; and industry, including more than 30 years with Boeing, where he led supply chain and operations, commercial airplane programs and many other relevant areas. While at DoD, he was a passionate champion of digital and technological advancement for the department, driving modernization in cybersecurity, AI and cloud computing as well as command, control and communication. Pat's wealth of expertise offers tremendous benefits for our shareholders and customers.\nBefore turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to address the current congressional budget environment.\nSince the Q4 call, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 Omnibus spending package, funding the federal government through the remainder of the fiscal year with $782 billion in defense spending, a 5.6% increase from fiscal year '21, and $730 billion in nondefense spending, a 6.7% increase from fiscal year '21. The budget also includes $14 billion in emergency supplemental spending in support of Ukraine given the devastation at the hands of the Russians. It will take time for the new budgets to work their way individual programs and new opportunities, but this provides positive momentum for the back half of 2022 and into 2023.\nPresident Biden has also released his $5.8 trillion fiscal year 2023 budget request. This request includes $813 billion in defense spending and $769 billion in nondefense spending.\nIn addition to kicking off the fiscal year '23 congressional budget process, Congress remains focused on finalizing a $10 billion bipartisan COVID-19 relief measure and passing legislation to increase American competitiveness with China. Congress also continues to grapple with rising inflation rates, strained energy markets, supply chain issues and the conflict in Ukraine.\nIn closing, our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and our colleagues who have family and friends in the country. The United Nations estimates that more than 11 million people are displaced. To help those impacted, we've made a significant donation to Project HOPE to mobilize emergency teams and send medical supplies. The people of Ukraine have lost infrastructure that will take lifetimes to replace. When the war ends, it will only be the beginning of their struggle.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chris Cage.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. As Roger said, Q1 was an outstanding quarter across the board, and I'm proud of the team for delivering such strong operating performance. Let's jump right into the first quarter results, beginning with the income statement on Slide 5.\nRevenues for the quarter were $3.49 billion, up 5.4% compared to the prior year quarter. Revenues grew organically across all three reportable segments given robust hiring and high labor utilization.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $358 million for the first quarter, which was down 8% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 11.7% to 10.2% over the same period. Adjusted EBITDA was down primarily as a result of the $26 million net benefit related to the Mission Support Alliance joint venture recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 as well as a return to more normative indirect spending levels as we move past the pandemic.\nNon-GAAP net income was $223 million for the first quarter, which was down 10.4% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.58, down 8.6% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nInterest expense was up $3 million year-over-year, with the additional borrowing to fund the Gibbs & Cox acquisition and the $500 million accelerated share repurchase.\nThe non-GAAP estimated tax rate was 21.2%, which was in line with our expectations for the quarter but below the projected 23% for the year.\nThe weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 140 million shares compared to 144 million in the prior year quarter.\nNow for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6.\nDefense Solutions revenues increased by 4.6% compared to the prior year quarter. The largest growth drivers were the NGEN and IDIQ ramps, which more than offset the completion of the Human Landing System based contract within Dynetics and the end of our Afghan support contracts.\nDefense Solutions non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter came in at 8.1%, which was down compared to the prior year quarter as the result of higher investments on developmental programs.\nCivil revenues increased of 3.8% compared to the prior year quarter. The revenue increase was primarily driven by volume growth on existing programs, including the support to Hanford and the FAA as well as our engineering support to commercial energy providers.\nCivil non-GAAP operating income margin was 7.7% compared to 12% in the prior year quarter. The decline in segment profitability was primarily attributable to the MSA gain in the prior period as well as a write-down taken on a minority interest joint venture program.\nHealth revenues increased by 10% compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to benefit from the ramp on the Military and Family Life Counseling program and DHMSM had a large year-over-year increase based on deployment timing.\nHealth non-GAAP operating income margin was 19.2% compared to 18.6% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in segment profitability was primarily attributable to efficiencies introduced into procurement and delivery on certain contracts. As we've discussed previously, we expect Health segment margins to land in the mid-teens for the year.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 7.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter was $93 million and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $65 million. During the first quarter, we returned $577 million to shareholders principally through the $500 million accelerated share repurchase program that we put in place 2 days after our February earnings call. We were immediately able to retire 4.5 million shares. The program will end within the next 2 weeks, and if our share price remains relatively constant, we'll retire another few hundred thousand shares at that time. We're funding the ASR with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. When the Russians invaded Ukraine, the CP market became more volatile. So we sold some accounts receivable for short-term liquidity. Since then, CP markets have cleared and we've exited the AR monetization by quarter end. So there was no impact on cash flow for the quarter. At quarter end, we still had about $75 million of borrowings outstanding through our commercial paper program.\nAs of April 1, 2022, we had $297 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.1 billion of debt. We remain committed to a target leverage ratio of 3x. Our long-term balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same and consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating, returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders, reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically, and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.\nOn now to the forward outlook.\nAs shown on Slide 8, we're maintaining our guidance for fiscal year 2022. Specifically, we expect revenues between $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA margins between 10.3% and 10.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $6.10 and $6.50 and cash from operations of $1 billion or greater.\nWith 3 quarters to go, we believe the current ranges still encompass the likely outcomes for the year. That said, I'll offer a few comments to help with modeling.\nOn last quarter's call, I mentioned a range of EPS benefits from share repurchases. When we were implementing the plan, our stock was trading in the mid-80s; we're now forecasting a volume-weighted average share price of around $105. In addition, with world events, interest rates have risen and liquidity has tightened, which has increased borrowing cost. Given these factors, we're now projecting the addition from the Q1 ASR program to be closer to $0.10 than $0.20.\nIn addition, we see the current environment as favorable towards growth, and we're exploring multiple opportunities where prudent investments could pay long-term benefits to Leidos and our shareholders. These increased investments may come in business development, R&D and program execution.\nFinally, as Roger mentioned, we remain on track to generate $1 billion of operating cash flow. As is our usual pattern, we expect the lion's share of operating cash flow will be generated in the back half of the year.\nWe still believe that Congress will retroactively delay implementation of the new tax research cost capitalization rules given the number of members from both parties who have cosigned legislation to restore pro innovation tax policy before the end of the year. However, if we were to amortize research costs and pay the taxes currently required, our operating cash flow target would be lower by approximately $150 million.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

Welcome to Leidos' Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Stuart Davis with Investor Relations. Stuart, you may now begin.\n\nM. Stuart Davis\n\nSVP of IR, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Roger Krone, our Chairman and CEO; and Chris Cage, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you will also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll use during today's call.\nTurning to Slide 2 of the presentation. Today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and, as such, does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFinally, as shown on Slide 3, during the call, we'll discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is included in today's press release and presentation slides.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Roger Krone, who will begin on Slide 4.\n\nRoger A. Krone\n\nChairman & CEO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stuart, and thank you all for joining us this morning.\n2021 was a banner year for Leidos, with industry-leading organic revenue growth and expanded profitability. In addition, we enhanced our market presence during the year with strategic acquisitions and investments that added important technical capabilities. Despite the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and an extended Continuing Resolution, we are positioned to grow in 2022, bolstered by our scale, differentiated technical offerings and dedicated workforce.\nIn my remarks, I'll address 4 topics: our financial results and outlook, capital allocation, business development and people.\nNumber one, our financial performance in the quarter was strong despite a challenging market. Revenues for the quarter were $3.49 billion, up 7% year-over-year. For the year, revenues grew organically across all reportable segments and were up 12% in total compared to 2020.\nIn 2021, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% represented the sixth consecutive year of margin expansion and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 14% to $6.62.\nWe generated $210 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter and free cash flow of $177 million. For the year, that translates to $1.3 billion of cash flow from operations and $927 million in free cash flow.\nThese results came despite well-documented headwinds, most notably a protracted Continuing Resolution, which slowed both tasking on existing contracts and the award of new opportunities; a resurgence of the pandemic, which lowered workforce productivity and limited our interactions with customers; and a national security community transitioning to new threats. I am proud of how well the team weathered these headwinds.\nIn 2021, we achieved our guidance for all of our metrics, but the standout metric was cash, which came in well ahead of our expectations through close coordination with our customers and strong operational focus. Our asset-light model, lean cost structure and efficient collections process enabled us to generate strong cash flow that we can deploy to grow our business and drive value for our shareholders, which brings me to number two, capital allocation.\nOver the fiscal year, capital deployment was balanced, with a mix of strategic acquisitions, debt paydown towards our target leverage ratio, an enhanced dividend and share repurchases.\nIn the fourth quarter, we made a strategic investment in HawkEye 360 to build on our multi-decade heritage of serving national security space customers. HawkEye 360 is driving innovative solutions around space-based radio frequency data and analytics, and we're confident this investment will enable us to better serve key customers who safeguard the United States and allied interest.\nOn the opposite side of the ledger, we agreed to divest Aviation & Missile Solutions LLC, a small CEDAR business within Dynetics. This divestiture allows us to focus on leading-edge and technologically advanced services, solutions and products that are more in our sweet spot.\nIn 2021, we put $270 million towards repurchasing our shares. Looking ahead, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 20 million shares, replacing the prior authorization. We only had 4.5 million shares remaining on our $20 million share authorization from 2018 and we thought it prudent to increase our buyback capability. Under the authorization, we can repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase transactions. Based on the current valuation of our stock, our financial outlook, our liquidity, our view of the M&A market and a consistent operating environment, we expect to be more aggressive on buybacks in 2022, and Chris will provide more color on that shortly.\nNumber three. In business development, the December quarter is seasonally -- is the seasonally weakest for our industry. Still, we achieved net bookings of $3.2 billion in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. Importantly, about half of the awards were for new work.\nFor the year, we booked $15 billion of awards for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. Our bookings don't include anything for the roughly $4 billion of protested awards we've been tracking, although earlier this month, we received positive developments on 2 of them. The FAA re-awarded us our incumbent work modernizing the national aerospace system and GAO denied the protest of our takeaway of the NASA networking communications program known as AEGIS. We're still awaiting word on whether either firm continues to object.\nTotal backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $34.5 billion, which doesn't include any future task orders for many of our large single award IDIQs, like NGEN. With total backlog almost 2.5x our 2022 revenue, we have a strong foundation for growth.\nIn the fourth quarter, we had large awards in each sector, including ISR and support for the Air Combat Command in defense, operational support to a publicly traded utility and R&D support to the National Energy Technology Laboratory in Civil and IT support to the Federal Parent Locator Service in Health.\nI want to focus on another award that speaks to what makes Dynetics so attractive to us. Our Dynetics subsidiary was awarded a 6-year $479 million cost-plus-fixed fee contract to develop Hypersonic Thermal Protection System prototypes for the U.S. Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office. Under the contract, Dynetics will also support materials research, novel inspection and acceptance efforts. The thermal protection system shields elements of the long-range hypersonic weapon system and the Navy conventional prompt strike system from extreme environments seen during flight. The Army and Navy working jointly have made hypersonic weapons their top priority, and this program is just one of the ways that we're supporting the broader hypersonic program. We're also the prime contractor for the common hypersonic glide body weapon and a key subcontractor for the long-range hypersonic weapon system. These programs are well funded and Dynetics is right at the center of them.\nNumber four, our ability to recruit, retain, motivate and grow our people is critical to our success. We were relatively flat from a headcount standpoint in the quarter but were up 11% for the year. As tough as this year has been for our customers and the market, it's been just as tough for our people. I would like to take a moment to thank the 43,000 Leidos employees for their unwavering commitment and collaboration in light of COVID challenges. We asked a lot of them and they truly delivered, whether executing a complex NGEN transition 3 months ahead of plan or successfully delivering the MHS Genesis electronic health record system to an additional 10,000 clinicians and providers as part of its largest wave deployment to date, our teams have put mission first and delivery for our customers.\nOne of the ways that we support our people is through a company culture that fosters a sense of belonging, welcomes all perspectives and contributions and provides equitable access to opportunities and resources for everyone. Inclusion and integrity are intrinsically linked by the responsibility to respect yourself and others. Our employees are empowered to uphold our values, creating a culture that we are incredibly proud of and that makes Leidos unique.\nWe're committed to continued transparency in how we're doing from a diversity standpoint as well as making the lives of our employees and their communities better. For the first time, we'll publish our consolidated EEO1 report on our website, which includes detailed information regarding workforce diversity, so we can chart our progress on the journey.\nBefore turning it over to Chris, I'd like to address the current budget environment. Since the Q3 call, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act and President Biden signed the bill into law. The NDAA legislation authorizes approximately $740 billion for defense programs, a $25 billion increase to last year and well above the original presidential request.\nBipartisan leadership of the House and Senate Appropriations panels reached an agreement on February 9 on the fiscal year 2022 top line spending numbers for defense and nondefense programs. Spending levels won't be publicly announced until after the Senate passes another CR. However, it appears there will be an increase for defense accounts and a slightly larger increase for nondefense accounts.\nUltimately, 12 appropriation bills will be packaged into a single omnibus bill for consideration. We are hopeful that the omnibus will be brought to the floor by March 8 so the President can approve it -- so it can be approved by the Senate and then signed by the President before the March 11 CR deadline.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Chris Cage for more details on our results and our 2022 outlook.\n\nChristopher R. Cage\n\nCorporate Controller & CFO, Leidos Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Roger, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. With lots to cover, let's jump right into the results, beginning with the income statement on Slide 5.\nRevenues for the quarter were $3.49 billion, up 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding acquired revenues of $52 million, revenues increased 6% organically.\nFor the year, revenues were $13.74 billion, which was up 12% in total and 9% organically compared to 2020.\nIn the quarter, we saw a continuation of the behavior that we cited on our Q3 call, where some customers, especially in the defense and intelligence sectors, worried about the extended CR and held back on funding. This was exacerbated by the limited ability to meet with customers with the onset of the Omicron variant and lower-than-anticipated direct labor given higher-than-normal paid time off usage by employees on cost reimbursable contracts. These factors led to revenues in the lower half of the guidance range that we gave on the last call.\nTurning to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $359 million for the fourth quarter for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%. Margins were down sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our prior messaging, although higher-than-normal leave-taking and lower-than-normal net favorable impacts from EACs lowered margins 20 to 30 basis points below our expectations.\nFor the year, adjusted EBITDA was $1.51 billion, which was up 14% over fiscal year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% was an improvement of 20 basis points over 2020.\nIn 2021, we benefited from a $26 million gain related to the Mission Support Alliance joint venture recorded in the first quarter and the backlog of disability exam cases that were pushed from 2020 to 2021 because of COVID. These 2 items added 60 basis points to the 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin.\nNon-GAAP net income was $224 million for the quarter and $952 million for the year, which generated non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.56 for the quarter and $6.62 for the year.\nFor the year, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were up 13% and 14%, respectively, compared to fiscal year 2020. EPS growth benefited from a reduction of about 2 million shares from repurchases during the year.\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate came in at 22.4% for the year, which was in line with expectations.\nNow for an overview of our segment results and key drivers on Slide 6. Q4 Defense Solutions revenues of $2.06 billion increased by 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the acquisitions of 1901 Group, Gibbs & Cox and a small strategic acquisition, Defense Solutions revenue were up 4% organically. The largest growth driver was the NGEN SMIT ramp, which more than offset the completion of the human landing system-based contract within Dynetics and the program supporting operations in Afghanistan. For the full year, Defense Solutions revenues were $8.03 billion, an increase of 9% in total and 6% organically.\nCivil revenues were $800 million in the quarter compared to $811 million the prior year quarter, down 1% in total and organically. In the quarter, lower deliveries of security products outweighed increased demand on existing programs with commercial energy providers, the FAA and the National Science Foundation and the transfer of a small number of programs from the Defense Solutions segment.\nFor the year, Civil revenues increased from $2.99 billion in 2020 to $3.16 billion, driven by on-contract growth across many programs and a full year of contribution from the L3 Harris Technologies Security Detection and Automation business acquisition.\nHealth revenues were $630 million for the quarter, an increase of 23% compared to the prior year quarter, and all of that growth was organic. The largest year-over-year increase was in the disability examination business, with the Military and Family Life Counseling program and DHMSM up nicely as well. As we previewed on the last call, fourth quarter revenues for the Health segment were down from the third quarter as we completed the backlog of cases from 2020.\nHealth revenues were $2.55 billion for the year, up 30% over 2020 with the same drivers that I cited for the quarter.\nOn the margin front, on Slide 7, Defense Solutions margins were relatively stable. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 8.2% for the quarter compared to 8.9% in the prior year quarter and 8.6% for the year compared to 8.2% in 2020.\nCivil non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 10%, which was up sequentially but down from 12.3% in the prior year quarter. Civil non-GAAP operating margin for the year was 10.2% compared to 11.7% in the prior year. Declines in segment profitability for the quarter and year were primarily attributable to lower volumes of security product deliveries.\nHealth non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter decreased from 18.5% in the prior year quarter to 17.8% primarily from investments to enhance long-term program execution. Health non-GAAP operating margin for the year increased from 14.4% in fiscal year 2020 to 18.8%, primarily from increased volume on fixed unit price programs.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $210 million, and free cash flow, which is net of capital expenditures, was $177 million. This was exceptional performance across every segment and enabled us to close out the year with operating cash flow of $1.03 billion, well above our guidance threshold of $875 million.\nFree cash flow for the year was $927 million for a 98% conversion rate. Without the $62 million headwind from the CAREX Act tax deferral, we would have exceeded our 100% conversion target for the fourth straight year.\nAs we close out the year, we remain committed to a target leverage ratio of 3x. Our long-term, balanced capital deployment strategy remains the same and consists of being appropriately levered and maintaining our investment-grade rating; returning a quarterly dividend to our shareholders; reinvesting for growth, both organically and inorganically; and returning excess cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner.\nOn now to the forward outlook on Slide 9. Before commenting on 2022, let me first close out the financial projections we gave at our 2019 Investor Day. FY '21 marked the end of a 3-year forecast period, and we exceeded or achieved all of our financial targets. Over the period, we grew organically at a compound annual growth rate of 7% versus a 5% target, achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.8% versus a 10% or greater target and converted 116% of adjusted net income into free cash flow above our 100% or greater target.\nAs we look towards 2022, there are some important factors to consider. There is no guarantee that we'll get an omnibus spending bill in February; the continuing impacts of COVID are unknown, and it's likely that Omicron won't be the last coronavirus variant; we can't be sure how long it will take to get our 2 large takeaway awards through the protest cycle; and we should expect that the large awards that we will receive this year will be delayed through protest. We want to take a measured, balanced approach to guidance, recognizing that there are significant outside forces to contend with.\nWith that, let's walk through the drivers for each metric. We expect revenues between $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion, reflecting growth in the range of 1% to 4% over fiscal year 2021. This growth would almost entirely be organic when balancing the remaining revenues from 2021 acquisitions with the divestiture that Roger mentioned.\nTo put that growth into context, let's consider the puts and takes moving from 2021 to 2022. On the positive side, we have NGEN and some other wins that are still ramping that provide good visibility into the upside. On the negative side, we have about $160 million of headwind from the Afghanistan drawdown, about $80 million reduction in disability exam volume and another $80 million from the human landing system program. These were all known and discussed as of the Q3 call.\nSince then, a few additional headwinds have emerged. First, we were not awarded the follow-on to our NGA UFS work that was consolidated into the UDS procurement. UFS represented about $100 million of revenue in 2021 with the opportunity to more than double that amount if we had won UDS. In addition, the customer has recently notified us that they are not yet ready to complete the RHRP transition. This program should generate about $150 million of revenue a year and the start date has now been pushed from January until September. Finally, the multibillion-dollar FAA network procurement known as FENS has just been pushed from an expected award date in Q1 to at least Q4.\nMoving on, we expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin between 10.3% and 10.5%. The midpoint of the margin range is the same as 2021 when you exclude the $26 million MSA gain and the extra disability exam case load. And the top end of the range is consistent with the target we laid out at our October Investor Day. We're committed to long-term margin expansion with multiple levers over time.\nWe expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year between $6.10 and $6.50 on the basis of 142 million shares outstanding, which is unchanged from fourth quarter levels.\nFinally, we expect operating cash flow of at least $1 billion. This guidance incorporates the final $62 million repayment of the 2020 CAREX Act payroll tax deferral.\nAs you're aware, there was a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that went into effect at the start of the year that requires us to capitalize and amortize research and development costs. Our operating cash flow guidance assumes that the provision will be deferred, modified or repealed. We currently estimate the impact of the provision on fiscal year 2020 operating cash flow -- 2022 operating cash flow to be about $150 million.\nExpanding on Rogers' capital allocation comments, we expect to deploy a significant portion of our operating cash flow towards share repurchases, assuming no unforeseen material developments in our operating environment. Depending upon the share price and timing of any repurchases, we currently estimate this could add $0.10 to $0.20 to 2022 non-GAAP EPS. The $6.10 to $6.50 range we provided does not account for any repurchases, and we'll update you all as we go through the year.\nGiven the industry factors that we've addressed, we expect a slower start to the year with a sequential decline in revenues in Q1, which is normal for us. We expect both revenues and margins to build significantly throughout the year.\nNow a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2022. We expect net interest expense of approximately $190 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of about 23%. Capital expenditures are targeted at approximately $150 million or roughly 1% of revenues.\nBefore we open up for questions, I would like to comment on something you will see in our upcoming 10-K filing related to a portion of our business that conducts international operations. In late 2021, we discovered through our internal processes activities by certain of our employees and third parties raising concerns that there may have been violations of our code of conduct and potentially applicable laws, including the FCPA. We're conducting an internal investigation led by an independent committee of our Board and have retained outside counsel to investigate. We voluntarily self-reported our investigation to the DOJ and SEC. Because the investigation is ongoing, we're not able to anticipate the ultimate outcome or impact.\nAs we look to 2022, we recognize the challenges but believe we're well positioned to navigate them. Ultimately, the issues facing our industry are transitory and what remain are urgent needs for our customers and a compelling value proposition that we can offer as the largest, most capable company in our industry. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob so we can take some questions."

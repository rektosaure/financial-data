[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President, Andrew Riker. Mr. Riker, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Andrew Riker, Dow's Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Karen S. Carter, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note, our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statements contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items.\nWe will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release that is posted on our website.\nOn Slide 2 is our agenda for today's call. Jim and Karen will review our results and discuss how we are navigating current market conditions to restore our core earnings. Karen will also provide an overview of our operating segment performance. Jeff will share an update on our in-flight actions to provide near-term cash support as well as some details on the macroeconomic environment and our modeling guidance for the fourth quarter. Jim and Karen will close the prepared remarks with Dow's view on current industry actions while demonstrating how Dow is well positioned to win in a recovery. Following that, we will take your questions.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChief Operating Officer, DowDuPont Materials Science Division and Chief Executive Officer, The Dow C, DowDuPont, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew. Beginning on Slide 3. In the third quarter, we executed against now strategic priorities to deliver sequential earnings and cash flow improvement despite continued pressure across the industry. These results reflect our focus on navigating the near term while positioning the company for profitable growth when our industry recovers.\nIn the third quarter, we delivered net sales of $10 billion. Sequentially, gains in our Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment were more than offset by declines in Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Performance Materials & Coatings. EBITDA was $868 million, and while this is lower than the same period last year, our earnings reflect an improvement over second quarter. This was driven by volume gains stemming from our new growth investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast, lower planned maintenance activity and the progress we're making on our cost reduction actions.\nCash provided by operating activities was up $1.6 billion sequentially, primarily driven by working capital improvements, and advanced payments for low carbon solutions and other long-term supply agreements. We also delivered $249 million of dividends, reflecting our commitment to competitive shareholder returns over the cycle.\nNext, Karen will provide some additional context around the more than $6.5 billion in actions that we have completed or currently have in flight.\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Jim. We advanced several strategic actions in the third quarter. We announced an expansion of our strategic agreement [indiscernible] global to formalize the contractual offtake of an additional 100 kt of ethylene supply at attractive economics for both parts. We closed the second and final phase of our strategic infrastructure asset partnership in the U.S. Gulf Coast delivering $3 billion in total proceeds for Dow this year. We completed the second of 2 previously announced noncore divestitures, delivering a total of approximately $250 million at attractive EBITDA multiples of around [ SYNNEX ]. And we issued an additional $1.4 billion bond to take advantage of tight credit spreads, providing added financial flexibility.\nWe are progressing the delivery of at least $1 billion in targeted cost savings by the end of 2026. We are on track to deliver approximately $400 million of the cost savings this year, which was clearly visible in our third quarter performance. We have also lowered our CapEx spending in alignment with our $1 billion reduction target this year compared to our original plan of $3.5 billion. This reduction is largely due to our decision to delay the Alberta project until market conditions improve. As we announced in April, this decision supports our near-term cash flow and adjust our timing to align with the market recovery. We remain committed to the long-term strategic rationale of the Alberta project, which further improves our industry-leading cost position and the growth upside that it will enable and targeted applications like pressure pipe, wire and cable and food packaging.\nHowever, our expectation for when this capacity will be needed have changed, given the prolonged down cycle our industry is facing. As we committed, we will provide an update on this during our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Any decisions related to the project time line will remain centered on maximizing value.\nSo taken all together, these near-term strategic actions demonstrating Dow's continued efforts to adjust our cost structure and response to the current operating environment. These actions also support our overarching goal to build a more simplified modern Dow that consistently delivers strong performance, profitable growth and lasting competitiveness.\nNext, I'll turn to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the third quarter, we continued to focus on margin improvement, while prioritizing volume growth in attractive end markets such as food packaging, electronics, home care and pharma. We also took decisive actions to lower our cost base and progress our cost savings actions. So starting with the results for our Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment. Net sales were down compared to the year ago period. Higher demand for flexible packaging applications was more than offset by lower downstream polymer prices, lower merchant olefin sales and lower licensing revenue.\nSequentially, net sales declined, driven by lower prices for downstream polymers and olefins. Volume decreased 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Notably, the polyethylene volumes increased in both comparison periods, particularly in flexible packaging applications, and as a result of our new polyethylene unit in the U.S. Gulf Coast. These items were more than offset by lower Olefins volumes in Europe, following our earlier decision to idle one of our crackers into [indiscernible].\nOperating EBIT was $199 million, reflecting a decrease compared to the year ago period. This was primarily driven by lower integrated margins. Operating EBIT increased sequentially due to higher integrated margins and operating rates, lower fixed costs from our cost reduction actions and the benefit of the startup of our new polyethylene unit in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is helping Dow to realize the full benefit of our integration.\nNext, turning to our Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment on Slide 5. Net sales were down 4% year-over-year driven by continued pricing pressures globally, resulting in an 8% impact on revenue. Sequentially, net sales increased, reflecting volume gains in both businesses and all regions. This was supported by lower planned maintenance activity and the start-up of one of our near-term growth projects, which partly offset lower prices. Volumes increased 2% compared to the year ago period, driven by gains in the U.S. and Canada and both businesses as well as in energy applications. Sequentially, volume increased 5% with improved supply availability following planned maintenance activities in both businesses as well as additional volumes from our new constellation unit in Seadrift, Texas.\nOperating EBIT for the segment increased versus the year ago period, driven by higher volumes and operating rates as well as lower fixed costs, which were partly offset by lower prices. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased by $138 million. This was driven by lower planned maintenance activity and higher volume in both businesses. This volume growth was enabled by the startup of our new alkoxylation unit in the U.S. Gulf Coast, which serves more resilient home and personal care end markets.\nMoving to the Performance Materials & Coatings segment on Slide 6. Net sales in the quarter were $2.1 billion, down 6% versus the year ago period and 2% sequentially, driven by pricing pressures on the upstream areas of the segment. In the third quarter, Architectural Coatings experienced normal seasonal patterns, but downstream silicones remained a bright spot, both compared to the year ago period and prior quarter, particularly in high-value applications such as home care and electronics. Operating EBIT decreased both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by upstream margin compression, partly offset by lower fixed costs from our cost reduction actions.\nTo conclude, Team Dow is focused on continuing to take actions to help navigate the challenges our industry is facing, while driving a streamlined, more modern and more simplified enterprise. We are protecting and growing our position in high-value markets while also realizing the benefit from our targeted and accelerated actions to deliver at least $1 billion in cost savings by 2026. We also continue to optimize our global manufacturing footprint as evidenced last quarter when we announced the outcome of our strategic review in Europe, resulting in the shutdown of 3 upstream assets in the region.\nI will now turn the call over to Jeff, who will share more on the actions we are taking to ensure Dow's financial flexibility as well as some macroeconomic insights and our outlook for the fourth quarter.\n\nJeffrey L. Tate\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Leggett & Platt, Inc.\n\nThank you, Karen. Good morning to everyone participating in today's call. Turning to Slide 7. We continue to advance several strategic priorities to support Dow's near-term cash flow, further enhance our balance sheet and deliver structural improvements. This positions the company for growth and better profitability and the recovery. For example, this quarter, we completed the second phase of our strategic partnership with Macquarie for the sale of a 49% equity stake in select U.S. Gulf Coast infrastructure assets, receiving approximately $3 billion in total cash proceeds this year, and we're making solid progress on several additional actions that support our near-term cash generation. This includes optimizing working capital, which we expect to be an approximately $200 million to $300 million release of cash in the second half of the year compared to the first half.\nIn addition to these items, we've completed 2 bond issuances at attractive spreads for a total of $2.4 billion this year. Doing so provides added flexibility and support while maintaining our commitment to investment-grade credit profile, and it extends our material debt maturities out to 2029. As of the end of the third quarter, our cash and cash equivalents balance is above $4.5 billion. We have an additional approximately $10 billion of available liquidity including a revolving credit facility that we recently renewed through 2030. With all these actions, we're building on our long history of navigating the cycles our industry faces. As we've demonstrated in the past, we will continue to take additional actions when and where warranted.\nWith that, I'll share some of the key indicators we're continuing to track on Slide 8. The broader macroeconomic landscape remains largely unchanged since our last update. As it relates to Dow's key market verticals, while we are seeing some pockets of stability of broader recovery has yet to take hold. Based on the visibility we have through current customer orders, we continue to see a cautious operating environment. Business investment and consumer spending are subdued due to ongoing economic uncertainty and affordability challenges. These dynamics are impacting demand across several key end markets Dow serves.\nAt the same time, recent monetary policy shifts and the beginning of a rate cutting cycle so it begin to more positively influence demand, and our packaging market vertical, global demand remains steady.\nIndustry growth in North America was supported by record September domestic and export volumes. Manufacturing activity in China continues to be modest, while Europe contracted in September. In the infrastructure sector, market conditions remain soft across the United States, Europe and China. In the U.S., 30-year mortgage rates have eased modestly, but remain above 6% this month. Demand is unlikely to increase in the near term due to limited affordability, but lower mortgage rates could spur a recovery in 2026 as conditions improve.\nConsumer spending has remained resilient, but with that, confidence is low, which has been driving value-seeking behaviors. In September, U.S. consumer confidence declined to its lowest level since April and sentiment in the EU remains below historical averages. In China, retail sales grew year-over-year in August, but at its slowest pace since last November. And in mobility, we continue to see mixed demand signals across the industry and regions. In the U.S., auto sales rose in August as consumers moved ahead of the EV tax credit expiration. And in China, government incentives for EVs also continued to support higher auto sales and production.\nThis strength has helped offset weakness in internal combustion vehicles, including in Europe, where new car registrations are down year-to-date. Given this backdrop, we will continue to focus on the actions within our control. Doing so, we have Dow to navigate the complexities of this down cycle while strategically positioning the company to capitalize when the market conditions do improve.\nNext, I'll turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 9. The macroeconomic dynamics that I described continue to limit visibility into customer buying patterns, making projections challenging. As always, we're committed to maintaining transparency and will provide timely updates if they become available. Based on current indicators and normal seasonality, we anticipate our fourth quarter EBITDA to be approximately $725 million. Our disciplined and targeted cost actions and lower planned maintenance activities are expected to provide sequential tailwinds. Normal seasonality, especially in building and construction end markets should be a headwind for our Performance Materials & Coatings and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segments.\nAdditionally, we anticipate some margin compression from our feedstock costs in the fourth quarter. In Packaging and Specialty Plastics, lower planned maintenance in the U.S. Gulf Coast in Europe will provide a $25 million sequential tailwind, along with another approximately $25 million in support from our cost reduction actions. Higher feedstock and energy costs are expected to be a headwind for the fourth quarter despite anticipating higher downstream volumes. Globally, we expect approximately $0.01 per pound of margin contraction in the quarter. This will be partly offset by higher equity earnings following an unplanned outage Estadao in July as the impacted asset is now back up and running.\nAdditionally, following a fire at our [indiscernible] polyethylene unit in Texas this month, we anticipate a $25 million unfavorable impact for the fourth quarter. Initially, the event required us to bring down 3 polyethylene units at the site. Two of those units have already resumed operations. However, we expect that [indiscernible] will remain offline for the remainder of the year. We are leveraging our global flexible asset footprint to mitigate impact and meet our customers' needs.\nIn Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, we expect fourth quarter EBITDA to be approximately $20 million lower than the third quarter. This is largely driven by seasonally lower demand in building and construction. Additionally, we anticipate margin compression from higher energy costs and pricing pressures. We'll see this primarily in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India as Asian exporters redirect volumes into the region from prior U.S. locations where those volumes would now be subject to adopting duties.\nSequential tailwinds are expected to be provided by higher demand for deicing fluids, lower turnaround spending and our cost reduction actions.\nAnd in Performance Materials & Coatings, we expect lower sequential EBITDA of approximately $100 million. Normal seasonally driven decreases in demand for building and construction and infrastructure end markets reflect an approximately $100 million headwind in the quarter. We expect this to be partly offset by continued strength for downstream silicones applications in electronics and home care.\nFinally, the incremental tailwinds from our cost reduction actions will be partly offset by planned maintenance at our Deer Park Texas site.\nSo in summary, as we look ahead, Dow remains committed to delivering accelerated cost savings actions across the enterprise as we've demonstrated throughout the year. Doing so will help offset the impact of higher feedstock costs and normal seasonality. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChief Operating Officer, DowDuPont Materials Science Division and Chief Executive Officer, The Dow C, DowDuPont, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Turning to Slide 10. The prolonged down cycle continues to weigh on our entire industry, but we're starting to see some encouraging actions in response, most notably around addressing industry oversupply. Specifically, announcements to date include significant rationalization of global ethylene, propylene oxide and siloxane capacities, each of which will benefit Dow's diversified portfolio. The vast majority are occurring in Asia and Europe, targeting assets that sit high on the global cost curve. This includes Dow's decision to shut down 3 European assets across each of our operating segments in order to rightsize upstream regional capacity, reduced merchant sale exposure and remove higher-cost energy-intensive parts of our portfolio.\nDow's rationalization announcements and those from industry peers have exceeded the majority of consultant projections, paving the way for improved operating rates, which will also be supported by anticipated polyethylene demand growth remaining above GDP for the foreseeable future.\nAs we have experienced through prior down cycles, we expect to see additional announcements and actions until more visible signs of recovery begin to materialize. As it relates to anticompetitive oversupply activities, our teams continue to be actively engaged in conversations with governments around the world to mitigate impact, progressively defend local production and to ensure a fair trade environment remains. These discussions have led to various actions and duties to protect local industries, including MDI in the United States, polyols in Brazil and more.\nDow's global asset footprint and product portfolio position us well to win in the key markets that we serve, particularly as purchasing patterns trend for buying local products and materials to mitigate any potential tariff headwinds.\nNext, Karen is going to unpack some of these advantages in more detail.\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThank you, Jim. We are pleased to see several of the industry actions that you described beginning to unfold. We continue to monitor both supply and demand signals, and we're staying close to our customers and key external stakeholders to understand their unique challenges while identifying opportunities to drive profitable growth. At the same time, our teams are working to lower Dow's cost structure, enhance our cash position and strengthen our manufacturing footprint through the shutdown of higher cost assets and the start-up of our advantaged growth investments serving high-value end markets. And as the macroeconomic environment improves, our actions will ensure Dow is best positioned to beat our competition, capitalizing on our key advantages.\nFirst and foremost, we are committed to being a low-cost producer. Currently, more than 75% of our global cracking capacity is in a top quartile cost position. This number will increase to approximately 80% once we complete the announced shutdown of our [ Bowling cracker ]. In addition, we continue to upgrade our world-class asset footprint by rightsizing higher cost capacity across a variety of value chain, including the shutdowns of 500 Kt of PO capacity in North America, 150 kt of upstream siloxanes production in the U.K. and one of our CAB units in Germany.\nOur downstream specialties capacity helps to differentiate and improve Dow's performance across the economic cycle, which will become more evident when our previously announced shutdowns are completed. And our innovation capabilities also enable strong earnings compared to our peers over the cycle as evidenced in this year's annual benchmarking report.\nSo to summarize, with the addition of our U.S. Gulf Coast investments, broad product range, leading cost efficiency and global scale that expect to gain share in premiums in markets that traditionally grow above GDP like packaging, electronics, mobility and consumer goods. And we are confident that Dow's differentiated portfolio paired with our team's strong execution will position us to outperform as the industry recovers.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChief Operating Officer, DowDuPont Materials Science Division and Chief Executive Officer, The Dow C, DowDuPont, Inc.\n\nIn closing, on Slide 11, our priorities are clear, and our teams remain focused on restoring core earnings enhancing our long-term competitiveness and delivering more than $6.5 billion in strategic actions and cash support items to position Dow well for profitable growth and value creation and the recovery.\nAs a reminder, this includes the $3 billion we received for our strategic partnership with Macquarie as well as accelerating our in-year savings from the $1 billion in cost actions that we announced in January. In addition, our diverse product portfolio, strategically advantaged asset footprint and global scale will help now to capture demand in attractive end markets growing above GDP. And our new alkoxylation and polyethylene units in the U.S. Gulf Coast are already delivering returns, providing further evidence of the value of our integration and low-cost asset footprint in the Americas.\nImportantly, we continue to engage in positive and productive conversations with several governments around the world as it relates to anticompetitive behaviors as well as changing trade and tariff policies. We remain confident that we're in a strong position to mitigate the impact of tariff costs.\nIn summary, we're focused, and we're taking strong actions to navigate the current environment while advancing our long-term strategic priorities. We remain committed to delivering strong performance, profitable growth and lasting competitiveness in key value chains. And as we have demonstrated in the past, we will continue to identify and implement the right actions that help us stay closer to our customers while outperforming the competition.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Andrew to get us started with the Q&A.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If you would like to ask a question at that time, please press star, followed by one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President, Andrew Riker. Mr. Riker, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP Investor Relations, Dow\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Andrew Riker, Dow's Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer; and Karen S. Carter, Chief Operating Officer.

Karen will provide an overview of our operating segment performance and actions we are taking to improve business results through more efficient resource allocation. She will also provide details around how our advantage footprint once again demonstrated relatively strong performance versus our peers and our full year 2024 benchmark. This includes how we expect it to provide mitigation levers that are unique to Dow against the recent geopolitical volatility we have seen. Jeff will share an update on the macroeconomic environment, our modeling guidance, and details around the progress of our unique cash levers in the near term. We will close with additional comments about our strategic focus areas. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Andrew. Beginning on slide three, in the face of volatile macroeconomic conditions, Team Dow focused on operational discipline while taking actions to reduce costs and align capacity to the slower GDP conditions that are impacting our industry. We delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth, and net sales were $10.4 billion, down 3% versus the year-ago period. This reflects declines in all operating segments, largely due to margin pressures. Sequentially, net sales were flat. This reflected lower pricing in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and Performance Materials & Coatings, which was offset by downstream growth in silicones as a result of improvements in home and personal care and electronic end markets, as well as seasonally higher demand in building and construction and deicing. EBITDA was $944 million, which is down compared to the same period last year, as volume gains were more than offset by margin compression.\nCash flow from continuing operations was $104 million, and returns to shareholders totaled $494 million of dividends in the quarter. We are taking targeted actions to further reduce costs and support near-term cash flow in response to the ongoing macroeconomic weakness. Our actions include at least $1 billion in annualized cost reductions by 2026 in areas like purchased services, contract labor, and the elimination of approximately 1,500 Dow roles. We're also delaying construction at our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada. This will accelerate our CapEx spending reductions this year, reflecting a total decrease of $1 billion for an enterprise spend of approximately $2.5 billion versus our plan of $3.5 billion. In addition, we are expanding the scope of our previously announced review of select European assets, primarily in Polyurethanes.\nToday, we announced that we have identified three initial assets that we expect to idle or shut down. We remain on track to complete the full review by mid-2025, including the best options for our Polyurethanes business. We also received regulatory approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for our strategic transaction with Macquarie Asset Management for the sale of our minority stake in select US Gulf Coast infrastructure assets. We expect to receive proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion upon closing, which is on track to be completed by 1 May, with the potential for an additional $600 billion later this year. Lastly, we received a final ruling on the pending NOVA litigation, for which we expect to receive more than $1 billion later this year.\nThe reality is our industry is in one of the most protracted down cycles in decades, facing a third consecutive year of below 3% GDP growth. This has been further exacerbated by geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns, which are weighing on demand globally. In response, Team Dow remains agile, taking quick and decisive actions to reduce our costs, adjust our supply chains, and protect and improve our margins. These proactive actions will help us to outperform our peers and ensure long-term competitiveness. We also remain committed to a balanced capital allocation approach over the cycle. Let me delve deeper into the actions that we announced today, beginning on slide four. Team Dow remains focused on disciplined execution to improve profitability and support cash flow, as evidenced by the additional actions we announced today.\nFirst, following a comprehensive review, we have made the decision to delay construction at our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan until market conditions improve. This decision supports our near-term cash flow and adjusts the project timing to align with a market recovery. We remain committed to the long-term strategic rationale of the project and the growth upside that it will enable in targeted applications like pressure pipe, wiring cable, and food packaging. However, we now see a higher probability of a lower-for-longer earnings environment, which changes our expectations for when the capacity from this project will be needed. We are steadfastly focused on ensuring returns for the project are above our cost of capital, and because of that, now is the time to delay construction before spending ramps up.\nAs a result of this decision, we now expect our 2025 capital expenditures to be $2.5 billion, compared to the original plan of $3.5 billion. In addition, we're expanding our European asset review to address the ongoing demand challenges and regulatory environment in that region. We have identified three initial upstream assets across each of our operating segments where we expect to either idle or shut down capacity. These actions will help to further enhance Dow's near-term cash flow and align our asset base to the realities of our participation in the region. And importantly, they are additive to our previously announced plans to determine the best strategic option for our Polyurethanes business in Europe.\nThe assets we announced today include an ethylene cracker in Böhlen, Germany, and chlor-alkali and vinyl assets in Schkopau, Germany, that will likely result in an idle or shutdown. Additionally, we expect to shut down our upstream siloxanes plant in Barry, the United Kingdom, to focus that site on specialty downstream silicones production. Each of these assets represents a meaningful portion of our regional capacity, which is either not fully integrated, resulting in excess merchant sale exposure, or is high on our cost curve, where we have better options to supply derivative demand and optimize margins. Next, I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will unpack our Q1 performance across Dow's operating segments. She will also provide an overview of our business in regard to the current tariff environment.\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. We are moving with urgency to deliver strong operational and financial results through this persistent down cycle. We are taking a hard look at everything across the enterprise with a sharp focus on driving volume growth, capturing price, and taking actions in the near term that will enhance profitability and improve margins. We will continue to accelerate our cost savings actions and are looking for additional opportunities to build on what we are already delivering. Now turning to Packaging and Specialty Plastics results on slide five. During our January earnings call, we acknowledged that higher feedstock and energy prices would be a headwind for us in the Q1. Although we expected these prices to moderate throughout the quarter, they remained elevated, leading to margin compression across the segment.\nNet sales in the quarter were down compared to the year-ago period, driven primarily by pricing pressures and functional polymers from increased competition in Asia-Pacific. The return of our PDH unit drove a 4% volume improvement. Sequentially, net sales were flat. While we benefited from higher olefins prices in the quarter, polyethylene sales were down, primarily driven by lower sequential export sales following record-high industry exports in November and December of last year. Operating EBIT was $342 million, reflecting a decrease compared to the year-ago period. This was primarily driven by lower integrated margins. Sequentially, operating EBIT decreased as higher input costs pressured margins. This was partly offset by higher equity earnings at our principal joint ventures. Next is our Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment on slide six.\nLooking at Q1 results, net sales declined both year-over-year and sequentially as market conditions in the segment remained difficult, particularly in our Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business, which has a high exposure to durables demand. The segment was able to deliver a 1% volume gain year-over-year, primarily driven by improved supply availability in our Industrial Solutions business. Sequentially, volume increased as a result of seasonally higher building and construction, and deicing fluid demand. We continue to experience stable demand across the energy and farming markets. These are key markets where we are positioning our business for growth. This includes our new alkoxylation expansion in Seadrift, Texas, which we expect to be fully operational by mid-2025. We anticipate the project will provide earnings upside in the second half of the year, delivering margins in excess of 1,000 basis points higher than MEG.\nOperating EBIT for the segment decreased $215 million versus the year-ago period. Results were primarily driven by lower prices and higher energy costs, which compressed integrated margins, as well as lower equity earnings. On a sequential basis, operating EBIT decreased, driven by margin compression and higher planned maintenance activity, which were partly offset by volume gain. Moving to the Performance Materials & Coatings segment on slide seven. We delivered a sixth consecutive quarter of downstream silicones growth. However, overall volume decreased for the segment. This was driven by lower volumes in upstream siloxanes and acrylic monomers. Net sales in the quarter decreased 4% versus last year. Local price also decreased year-over-year due to continued siloxanes pricing pressure. Sequentially, net sales increased, primarily driven by seasonally higher demand in building and construction and markets, which comprises a significant portion of the segment's sales.\nWe also experienced higher demand for electronics and personal care applications, which have been resilient in markets for us. Operating EBIT was up compared to the year-ago period, driven by lower fixed costs, which were partly offset by lower prices. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased, driven by seasonally higher demand for architectural coatings, which was partly offset by higher planned maintenance activity in North America in preparation for the demand high point of the painting season. Now turning to slide eight. In addition to the comprehensive set of actions underway, we are adjusting our business to current market realities by leveraging our strategic asset footprint, global reach, low-cost positions, and unmatched feedstock flexibility. More specifically, we have a leading or low-cost position in world-class manufacturing sites in every geography with well-developed, agile regional supply chains and a deep understanding of the needs of our customers.\nWe are the only company with integrated polyethylene production on four continents. In addition, Dow's unique feedstock flexibility allows us to optimize our assets based on regional advantages. We have the ability to crack the most optimal feedstocks and have the widest range to take advantage of dynamic periods. This ability to capitalize on preferred feedstocks, paired with our breadth of process technologies, enables Dow to optimize what, where, and how we produce our products to best serve our customers. While the tariff environment remains fluid, we estimate greater than 95% of our North American volume is USMCA compliant, which is an advantage for Dow. There are also areas of our portfolio, mainly MDI and silicones in North America, where we expect additional margin support from our local production, as significant Chinese oversupply has forced local markets to go long.\nLastly, we have engaged in rigorous scenario planning to identify potential additional cost pressures and mitigation strategies. Altogether, our unmatched cost positions and feedstock flexibility, superior product mix, and geographic diversity are strong differentiators that give Dow a competitive edge today and throughout the cycle. Turning to slide nine. The proof of Dow's competitive edge is in our annual benchmarking results. Our industry-leading feedstock flexibility translates to value through our ethylene and propylene derivatives. This is coupled with our leading [inaudible] efficiency and Dow's portfolio advantages, which enable higher margins. This is clearly illustrated in terms of EBITDA per pound of polyolefins capacity, which continues to deliver superior results versus competition. The breadth of our portfolio also stands out in downstream silicones, where we grew volume year-over-year in 2024 and outperformed peers on EBITDA growth.\nThis is just one highlight from our annual benchmarking efforts, which we published on our investor website today. These results once again highlight Dow's performance relative to industry peers, as we performed in line or ahead of peers across more than 80% of the metrics we tracked most closely. This underscores the power of our competitive advantages and track record of solid execution in various market conditions. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will provide an overview of the macros and our outlook.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning to everyone joining our call today. Moving to slide 10. From a macroeconomic perspective, global demand remains well below historical average GDP levels. Recent disruption from tariffs has weighed on expectations for global economic growth, as it has on business and consumer sentiment. We are closely monitoring these factors as they are increasing the probability of a longer timeline to mid-cycle earnings. This vigilant monitoring is crucial as we navigate the fluctuating market conditions and ensure our actions are aligned with the evolving economic landscape. We still expect demand to be positive for the year. However, the impact from uncertain trade flows could create additional margin pressure for our portfolio, most notably against the one area where we've seen resilience for some time, the North American consumer. Looking across our four market verticals in packaging, domestic demand continues to grow in North America.\nAlthough, as mentioned, we are closely monitoring it for changes due to growing inventories and inflation. We are not seeing any significant pattern changes in Chinese economic activity, and we see continued softness in Europe. Dow's global footprint with low-cost assets in all regions should position us well to navigate current market dynamics. Across infrastructure markets, we have yet to see any meaningful inflection in housing demand, including in China as well as Europe. In the US, mortgage rates remain high, resulting in subdued demand and the 14th consecutive year-over-year decline in building permits in March. Increasing risk to the global economy, including the potential for retaliatory tariffs between multiple countries, is also impacting consumer markets. In March, US consumer confidence declined to its lowest level in more than four years.\nAnd while retail sales were up in China, supported by government stimulus, prices have been deflationary for two consecutive months. In mobility, higher tariffs are expected to create further affordability concerns in the US, although we saw a temporary spike in auto sales in March ahead of these implementations. In the EU, new car registrations in February saw their largest year-over-year decline in six months. China auto sales benefited from government incentives and were up 8% year-over-year in March. Now turning to our outlook on slide 11. In today's world, there's a high degree of uncertainty in the market, which makes this a difficult Q2 project. Until negotiations on tariffs are finalized, we expect to see delays in both purchase and investment decisions from consumers as well as corporations.\nOur outlook today is based on everything we have line of sight to, understanding that we're operating through a very dynamic market and geopolitical times. Should we gain insights into substantial changes during the quarter, we're committed to maintaining transparency and will provide timely updates accordingly. Before I get into the details by segment, let me share a couple of enterprise-level drivers. Our cost reduction actions will ramp as the Q2 progresses, providing approximately $50 million of overall benefit versus the Q1 across all three operating segments. Additionally, we expect $50 million in sequential upside following recent winter storms, primarily in zone, that required us to proactively take units down, resulting in lost production. We will see startup costs related to our incremental higher return growth projects in the Q2, as well as higher plant maintenance activity in packaging and specialty plastics, and industrial intermediates and infrastructure.\nWe expect these to be completed through the end of the second quarter, creating an earnings tailwind in the Q3. With our continued commitment to running our plants safely and reliably, we expect full-year plant maintenance activity to be roughly in line with 2024 levels. Next, I'll turn to our outlook and Q2 guidance by segment. In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we expect sequential EBITDA to be approximately $50 million lower. This is primarily driven by higher plant maintenance activity and lower integrated margins, including fewer merchant sales, which we expect to be partly offset by the initial benefits of our cost reduction actions. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segments, we expect second quarter EBITDA to be roughly flat with Q1.\nWhile we expect to see modest seasonal demand improvements and higher margins for MDI, some of this will be offset by lower anticipated pricing for MEG, driven by increased competition in Asia Pacific as naphtha prices come down with oil. In addition, we will have costs in the quarter related to a planned turnaround, and the startup costs associated with our new alkoxylation capacity in Seadrift, Texas. This new capacity is one of the near-term growth investments we've spoken about and should support higher earnings beginning in Q3. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we expect higher sequential EBITDA. This will be driven by a $75 million benefit from seasonal demand improvements for coatings and markets. We also expect continued growth for downstream silicones, where our current expectation is to deliver the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth.\nIn summary, we expect Q2 EBITDA to be roughly in line with Q1 levels. We anticipate improved volumes, primarily from seasonality, and improved margins in certain product chains. With that, higher plant maintenance and one-time startup costs of our new assets are expected to be an offset. Now turning to slide 12. Dow's commitment to financial discipline provides important flexibility in the midst of this slow-growth environment and increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. We've outlined today several proactive actions we're taking to effectively manage this extended down cycle. In total, we expect these actions to provide approximately $6 billion in near-term cash support. This includes our strategic infrastructure transaction, unique to Dow cash levers, additional cost savings, and reduced CapEx. More specifically, our signed agreement with Macquarie Asset Management represents a strategic partnership that has been several years in the making.\nDow's sale of a minority equity stake in select infrastructure assets is expected to generate $2.4 billion of initial cash proceeds, with closing expected by 1 May. Macquarie has the option to increase their stake to 49% for an additional $600 million within six months of closing, which would increase total cash proceeds to approximately $3 billion for Dow in 2025. The newly formed infrastructure-focused company, named Diamond Infrastructure Solutions, is comprised of assets that support a wide range of services, from energy and environmental to infrastructure and pipelines, for more than 70 longstanding customers. With improved operational efficiencies, we expect to [inaudible] growth with new and existing customers while providing near-term financial flexibility for Dow.\nIn addition, the Court of King's Bench in Alberta, Canada, issued a ruling awarding Dow additional compensation for damages incurred through 2018 related to the jointly owned ethylene asset with NOVA Chemicals in Joffre, Alberta, Canada. We expect the final resolution to come this year, with cash proceeds exceeding $1 billion, allowing Dow to recover costs from a decade-long legal process. As Jim mentioned earlier, we now expect our total enterprise 2025 CapEx to be $2.5 billion, a $1 billion reduction compared to our original plan of $3.5 billion. This new target builds on the approximately $400 million reduction that we announced in January. Lastly, we also announced in January that Dow would deliver at least $1 billion in targeted cost savings on an annual run rate basis in response to the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We continue to push the number higher and faster.\nThe cost savings actions aim to improve our margins and long-term competitiveness across the economic cycle, and we expect approximately $50 million of interior savings supporting Q2. As previously shared, we've achieved the majority of these cost savings through a reduction in direct costs of $500 to 700 million, primarily focused on purchase services and third-party contract labor. We're also implementing a workforce reduction of approximately 1,500 Dow roles globally. Our collective actions to navigate the realities of the current macroeconomic environment and deliver $6 billion in cash support over the next two years enable Dow to maintain our financial flexibility. Our balance sheet remains solid, with no substantive debt maturities due until 2027. Aligned to our debt towers, we also recently completed some debt-neutral liability management to take advantage of tight spreads and extend our maturities at lower rates.\nWe will continue to seek options where Dow can proactively take action to improve our capital structure through this type of activity or derisking, as we've done in the past. We remain focused on delivering on our balanced capital allocation approach over the cycle. We will continue our practice of managing Dow's capital structure and priorities in order to better position the company to create additional shareholder value. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jim to close things out.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nClosing on slide 13. As our industry weathers the current challenging conditions, we're executing several proactive and decisive actions to improve margins, support near-term cash flow, and optimize our global portfolio. We're doing so today in a manner that is consistent with our best owner mindset and a balanced capital allocation approach. Our purpose-built asset footprint and our low-cost feedstock positions, primarily in the Americas and the Middle East, create a meaningful cost advantage for Dow and provide industry-leading flexibility to navigate global trade dynamics. We're focused on improving our margins by reducing our spending and matching regional supply to profitable demand.\nAs we've outlined throughout today's call, we have line of sight to $6 billion in near-term cash flow improvement, including completing the launch of Diamond Infrastructure Solutions, our strategic and growth-focused transaction with Macquarie for up to $3 billion, receiving proceeds from the NOVA judgment, which is expected to be more than $1 billion, delivering at least $1 billion in cost savings by 2026, delaying construction at our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan to align with market realities, which will result in reducing our total 2025 enterprise CapEx by approximately $1 billion, and expanding the scope of our strategic review of our Polyurethanes asset in Europe by identifying three additional assets that we expect to idle or shut down in the region. In addition, we are nearing the completion of our higher-return incremental growth investments in regions where we have energy and feedstock advantages.\nThree of these projects, one in packaging and specialty plastics, and two in Industrial Solutions, will begin to come online at the end of Q2 and show benefit in Q3 and beyond. The Dow team is closely monitoring the current uncertain macro environment, and we are taking the necessary actions to further improve our competitive position, including looking for additional ways to reduce costs and increase our competitiveness. Our near-term strategic priorities are focused on navigating the challenges our industry is facing. By delaying the Alberta project, maintaining financial flexibility, protecting our balance sheet, rationalizing assets in high-cost regions, reducing costs, and focusing on profitable growth, we are positioning Dow for long-term success through the cycle. With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew to get us started on the Q&A.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Jim, I'd like to ask you on Alberta to contextualize a couple of things. First, you noted in your prepared remarks a lower-for-longer environment. So I'm curious if the board came to that conclusion sort of before or after 2 April, and sort of as a follow-up to that, when you talk about taking the delay on Alberta off when market conditions improve, how would you define market conditions improving? Is that a function of where spreads are? Is it a function of your S&D outlook? Is it a function of oil prices? What are the sort of KPIs you're looking for there?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Vincent. Thank you. Good question. Yeah. So when we look at the market outlook, our original plan for Alberta was to come up in two phases: the phase I in 2027, the phase II in 2029. And our view had been that we would be seeing a cycle recovery when that first phase come up. I think with the situation that we're in now, with the uncertainty around where tariffs are going to land, with the impact that's having on demand, that's driving our lower-for-longer outlook on the environment. And we're at a point right now where we can make this decision to have minimal impact on the project. So we've done a lot of groundwork. We're finishing our engineering work. We've got our long lead time items ordered.\nWe can pause now before we have a big ramp-up in labor in the field, and then we can push some of that work out until we see how things land with tariffs. So we're going to revisit it on a regular basis. I'd say we won't revisit it until toward the end of this year. Trying to make a call if ramping up next year is the right answer or if we wait after that. But I'd say we have to start seeing things moving up, and the supply-demand balances tightening up a bit, and understand how the supply chains are going to work as we adjust to this tariff environment.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. I know it's difficult to give an outlook for the full year, but if you're going to do 1.8%, 1.9%, or so in the first half, how could EBITDA get better in the second half? I know you have some cost savings. Maybe talk about what demand environment could be worse, could be better. But what could happen in general to have a better second half EBITDA than the first half directionally?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Michael. Another good question. So I mentioned on the call that we have obviously three projects that are completing in the second half of Q2. And so those will start to be accretive Q3, Q4 capacity in packaging and specialty plastics, and also two additions in Industrial Solutions. And both of those are going into markets where we have a need for those products. And so I think you'll start to see that come through. One of the pressures we saw in Q1 was the fact that all the input costs were higher than we'd anticipated because of the winter weather and the drawdown on inventories. We're starting to see that normalize in Q2, which you would assume. So I think you're going to see some energy cost advantages roll through the back half of the year.\nI would assume next winter, depending on what the weather forecast looks like, we're going to see the same pattern again. We're going to have cost reductions. We've got $50 million of cost reductions coming in Q2. Our target for the year is $300 million. Karen continues to push for more and faster, but you're going to start to see that ramp-up to where we get to the run rate for next year, which is a full $1 billion. So that's going to step in. And then the wild card, I would say, is having some visibility to where the supply chains are going to land. We have an advantage in that we have footprint: Canada, US, Argentina, Middle East. We have the ability to flex the supply chain and to mitigate tariff impacts on where we export our materials. So that's very positive.\nWe also have the advantage that greater than 95% of everything we've moved between the United States and Canada is USMCA compliant. So I think those things will have a positive impact. But we just need a little bit better clarity on where these tariffs land and what that impact is on overall demand.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Jim, on the issue of tariffs, how are you thinking about the impact of the Chinese tariffs on imported US polyethylene and how that might impact domestic polyethylene prices going forward if we do lose that export market for US-produced polyethylene? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, David. I'll take a shot at that, and then I'll maybe ask Karen to comment on some of the things that we're doing. That's, I think, the big question: is all trade, not just polyethylene, but all trade between US and China? Where is that going to land? We have a very active tariff and trade team that is engaged on all sides of that. And of course, a lot comes down to what's going to be on an exemption list and what isn't going to be on an exemption list. So we're optimistic that some discussions will start, and we'll get some clarity around that as the quarter develops. In the meantime, we're doing things that we need to do to flex that supply chain. You want to speak to that, Karen?\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nYeah, sure. I mean, we are well on our way on reconfiguring our supply chain. The team has been working since really, you know, the middle of Q1 on this. So we are able to export quite a bit more product out of Canada. Then, of course, in the United States, our low-cost position enables us to produce for the local demand. As a matter of fact, the growth project that Jim alluded to, Poly-7, that's going to start up in Q2, is going to provide us even more flexibility to supply even more of that US demand right here. Then, of course, we've got, you know four continents integrated polyethylene production. So think about the Middle East as well as an opportunity for us to supply demand around the world, but also directly in China. So we are well positioned.\nWe feel good about where we are and able to mitigate the tariffs directly. But again, I just want to reiterate that the indirect impact is really the biggest concern on overall demand. So we'll continue to watch that as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking my question. So on one hand, the China situation is a corollary of Dave's question. On one hand, one could argue that the current situation could potentially incentivize the Chinese to further, let's say, you know, push a little bit harder in domestic capacity over the intermediate to long term. And on the other hand, in the near term, there's been a lot of debate about Chinese, you know, NGL imports, given that a decent amount of their capacity has also been growing, and there's a debate on, obviously, the feedstock side of it. So as far as Dow's view, understanding there are various scenarios here, how would Dow come out in terms of like those two, you know, the facets that we're all kind of pondering these days?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good question, Chris. I'll start with the second half of that first. I think the NGL imports into China, if you look at that today, you have to look at it in context of what's happened with oil price. So I would say the advantage right now would be oil using naphtha in China. Once you look at NGL price here, exported, landed in China, converted to ethylene, you've really driven up the cost of the ethylene. So that's not going to be a very competitive position. I think they're going to have better options there. I think on the other hand, in terms of incentivizes to make more capacity, a lot really is going to depend on grades of product.\nI think our experience is we haven't looked at moving commodity grades of polyethylene into China for quite some time. We move more specialized grades in. So I think there's a limit to the ability to be able to produce that in the country. There's also a need for those materials to make the finished products that they have to export around the world. And so this is a balance between being able to have access at a reasonable cost to the things that they need to be able to produce finished goods for their own export demand, which is global demand, not just US demand. And that's the thing people are trying to navigate right now.\nThe domestic outlook in China isn't really driving any big support for additional capacity to be added. It's moderate at best. And so, you know, there's not a big consumer-driven uptick in China. So I think we continue to watch those two angles that you talked about and try to see where that's going to land.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Perrella\n\nDirector Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. It's Chris Perrella on for Josh. Could you go into a little more detail about the moving parts of I&I and its outlook for the second half of the year? I know there's some projects coming online, but the underlying weakness there, and how does that play into the strategic review of the business as well?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI think the biggest pressures on I&I in the Q1 really were related to pricing pressures because demand is slow and higher energy costs, both in the United States and Europe. The energy costs, as I've said, are moderating. Maybe ask Karen to give a little bit of color on the outlook and what we see happening in I&I.\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. I mean, if you talk about it from a Polyurethanes perspective in particular, we expect the challenging macro to continue. I mean, think about soft demand on durables, automotive. That's a direct impact to us as well. Automotive growth is slowing. You also see the EV transition starting to slow as well, and particularly in North America and in Europe. Tariffs should, however, provide support for selected US-produced products. You mentioned this earlier before, like MDI, where, of course, the global market has suffered from Chinese oversupply. And so, you know, that could provide a bit of a tailwind, but the headline really on the outlook for Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals is that we'll continue to lean into a pretty challenging macro.\nBut let me switch quickly into our Industrial Solutions business because there, although we are seeing softening demand, we are seeing also pockets of stability in markets like energy, home care, and pharma, and markets. Data centers, as an example, is a significant growth opportunity for us, and our solutions there are used in things like thermal management. I do, though, just want to double down on the new asset that we're going to start up here in Q2 in the US for new alkoxylation capacity. That unit is going to focus on growth and attractive end markets for us, so home and personal care and pharma. And really, the good news around that asset is about 50% of that capacity is already contracted for. So we expect that to provide us with a tailwind going into second half.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nOn the question about portfolio, Chris, we're going to come back toward the end of the quarter with some guidance on where we think the best option is for those European assets, that Polyurethanes enterprise. I think one thing to remember is we have low-cost positions there. We have some very strategic positions and full integration for that whole Polyurethanes chain. So that's going to be the result of an exercise just looking at what we think the best option is in the marketplace.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. On slide 15, you say that your expected corporate expense for the year is $320 million, and I think your corporate expense was $33 million in Q1. So you're annualizing at $130 million. Why is that number $320 million? Second, cash flow from operations was $90 million in the quarter, and you did have a working capital increase, but the cash flows were low. So what's the cash flow that you expect in Q2? You know, is it low, or is there something that's unusually depressing things? And then lastly, what do you do about your agreement with Linde? That's a $2 billion outlay that they would make. Do you have to take a charge to settle that? And if it is, is it large? Is it small? Can you fill us in on some of those issues?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nAll right, Jeff, let me take the last question, then I'll ask Jeff to cover the first two. On Linde, we have had contact with Linde, and we have a contract that covers that. So a lot of that is going to depend on the length of the delay. We're in active engagement with them. The answer to your question is I don't expect that we'll have to take a charge right now in order to do that. Jeff, you want to comment on the first two?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nSure. Good morning, Jeff. First, on the corporate segment, you're right. It is seasonally lower in Q1. We had some credits that we would not expect to occur in the Q2 or beyond, Jeff. And as a reminder, there are a number of different activities that take place in our corporate segment, whether it be related to venture capital operations, some of our financial asset gains and losses, as well as some of our non-business aligned litigation and severance costs associated with some of our programs. So there are a number of different spends and takes that we will have from one period to the next that can create somewhat of a level of volatility. But the guide that we're providing right now, I would say, would be what we would expect for the full year in the corporate segment.\nMoving to your second point around cash flow, for Q1, we did have our use of cash from a working capital perspective, which is typically the case in Q1. We would normally have that as we look at the seasonal build for higher sales for the quarter, as well as preparing for our planned maintenance activity that we'll have not only in Q1, but also we'll expect to have in Q2. So that creates some level of additional use of cash between those two quarters. But I also would recognize that our cash conversion cycle continues to be eight days of improvement versus pre-COVID levels. And from a liquidity standpoint, we're still in a really good position at well over $11 billion at this time.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Blair\n\nManaging Director, Tudor, Pickering\n\nThank you and good morning. I was hoping you could expand a little bit more on how you're thinking of the security of the dividends in this environment. You know, you have $4 billion of extra cash coming in this year. You're implementing some cost reductions. You've also reduced your spending for the year. Does that make the dividend secure for this year and probably next? And then after that, we'll have to see. Or are you thinking about it differently? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Matthew. Attractive dividend yield is something that's always been a priority for Dow. We're well aware of the pressures that the current environment places on the capital structure. Certainly, the $6 billion in the near term, and of that $6 billion, as Jeff mentioned earlier, the vast majority of that will come in in 2025. That will help support the dividend. But as the macro evolves, we'll have to continue to monitor and act in alignment with our capital allocation framework. As you note, from the quarter, we're pulling every lever we can to manage cash through a difficult time. And I think we'll have better certainty once we see how tariffs are going to settle out.\nWe're just in an environment right now where, in the marketplace, if you look at downstream demand, it doesn't matter if it's a consumer or one of our customers or somebody in the B2B world. They're all just kind of taking a wait-and-see approach. And that has an impact on what we think the long term is going to look like. I'm hopeful that we get some better clarity before the end of the quarter when this 90-day pause ends. That'll help us a lot to be able to have better visibility.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\n\nHassan Ahmed\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Alembic Global\n\nMorning, Jim. You know, I just wanted to revisit the question about Chinese sort of feedstock imports from the US in particular. I mean, you know, if we could get a little more granular about things, I mean, if I take a look at ethane, it seems over 90% of the ethane that the Chinese import is from the US. And, you know, call it almost half of their LPG imports come from the US as well. So when I sort of drill that down at a cracker level, thinking about the ethane and polyethylene facilities over there, certainly the ethane-based facilities in the current tariff regime would need to shut. And then certain LPG facilities would need to shut as well. So I totally understand that it's a wait-and-see right now in terms of what happens after the 90-day pause.\nBut if there is some semblance of a continuation, maybe a 30%, 40%, 50% of these tariffs, how do you see the Chinese reacting to that sort of a tariff regime? Would they continue running those facilities? Would some of them just shutter? I mean, and I guess part of the broader question is, will we start seeing a more aggressive rationalization globally?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI think the line of reasoning, Hassan, that you have is similar to the way that we look at it. I mean, you have to look at the landed costs and then the ability to re-export. I think the challenge is with oil coming down and naphtha coming down; obviously, you've got some different dynamics there as well. But there is pressure. And currently, those assets are operating at negative cash margins. So, you know, you would have to see some activity, you would think, in that area. I think it's fundamentally one of the reasons that there's pressure on these tariffs and this tariff discussion right now, is it's not a fair and not a level playing field. And so that's the way we viewed it.\nWe're seeing that pressure come into other markets now. And so we have to see that resolve. I think over time, you're still going to have an advantage in the US Gulf Coast, in Canada, and in Argentina where you have those domestic supplies and they're continuing to grow. The LNG exports are going to continue to grow. The amount of ethane that's available here and the amount of propane that's available here, that's an advantage to us. I think the big question mark is, where's the demand? And right now, all this activity on tariffs is just stifling the demand.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research\n\nYes, good morning and thank you, Jim. I was wondering if you could speak to a few related questions on the subject of Europe. First would be, can you elaborate on how and why, I guess, you've expanded your scope of strategic review there with emphasis on Polyurethanes? And then secondly, on slide four, I think you referenced idling or shutdown for a few different assets there. So what will inform those decisions? And then more broadly, and lastly, Dow is not alone, right? We've seen so many other announcements of capacity rationalizations recently from Total in Belgium, but Versalis, SABIC, ExxonMobil.\nAs I add these up, we're now in the teens in terms of percentage destruction of ethylene capacity in the European region.And so I'd welcome your thoughts on that. Are we nearing stability looking out a year or two? Or how do you view that?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow",
    "content2": "Morning, Kevin. How and why we expanded the scope? The Polyurethanes, we looked at the region and felt there was a better owner. So that's the work that we're going to complete by the end of the quarter. I think there's an opportunity there. In terms of ethylene and look at siloxanes and what has happened around the world, and then chlor-alkali, chlor-vinyl, these all require energy cost competitiveness, which is gone in Europe. They require downstream demand. Downstream demand in Europe is still 20% below pre-COVID levels. I structurally can't imagine that coming back. We're starting to see continued pressure on downstream customers. You heard it in the automotive sector. That has a knock-on effect to other big industries that we sell to. The things that are holding up relatively well are packaging and the consumer goods there.\nA little bit as well on some of the durable goods. You know, durable goods like appliances and a few other things are under some pressure, but there's still some base business there. I think these moves, I agree with you, we're into the teens. We're probably headed towards 20% of that capacity coming out on ethylene. I think that probably gives us much more balance. Our announcement in siloxanes takes about 200KT of siloxanes capacity out. There's a fair amount of length there, but I think that brings it balanced. It really allows us to focus very on specialties, which have been growing and doing well, but that's all been masked by the pressure on siloxanes. Why idle or shut down?\nWe just have to work through the costs and the trade-offs of the two and make sure we don't make a move that we would regret longer term. I'll share a story that goes back to before the shale gas days. We've been around for a long time. You remember a lot of stuff. Before shale gas days, we were approaching a big capital expenditure for a lifetime extension down at our Saint Charles crackers. We just couldn't afford to do it. Natural gas, I think, costs were relatively high. We had the same decision. Do we idle it or do we shut it down? We decided to idle it and idle it in a way that if the market changed, we could come back and we could do the enhancements and the lifetime extension at that time.\nShale gas happened a couple of years later, and the market changed dramatically. The first project off the ranks was the rehab project on the Saint Charles cracker. And it was immediately accretive, and it's run, and it's been positive ever since. We know what we know, and there are sometimes things that we don't know. And that's the real crux of making a good strategic decision here on whether it's idle or shut down.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nHey, good morning. One follow-up and then one question. Follow-up talking about cash flow. Since you're guiding to similar EBITDA in Q2 relative to Q1, I was wondering if you could comment on the free cash flow expectations for Q2 relative to the negative $580 for Q1. And then among the biggest positives for the second quarter relative to the first quarter pertains to downstream siloxanes. And I was wondering if you could, and you also mentioned that the Chinese market is still very much in oversupply. So I was wondering if you could provide some insights into the profitability trends that you're seeing in siloxanes in the Q1 and so far here in the Q2. Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nJeff, why don't you take cash flow? And then, Karen, you want to touch siloxanes?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nGood morning, Frank. Just a couple of comments I'd make on Q2 cash flow. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do expect the infrastructure asset transaction to close on 1 May. So we'll have approximately $2.4 billion of cash that we would expect to come in during the quarter. In relation to working capital, we would expect to see similar types of uses of cash in Q2 as we continue to have a heavy turnaround season in the quarter as well. So pretty similar in terms of the cash from operations. But as you start to get deeper into the bridge around getting through the full cash flow performance, expect to get that $2.4 billion coming in around the Macquarie Asset Management transaction.\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nMaybe I'll just quickly comment on silicones because that for sure has been a bright spot for us even going back to the Q1. We continue to see growth downstream, and particularly in consumer electronics applications that, of course, go into data centers, but also AIoT, of course, artificial intelligence-of-things applications. We continue to see that coming into the Q2. I mean, if I look ahead, we'll continue to see that downstream growth. Also, some of the seasonal uplift that we normally get may be a bit muted by tariffs, but overall, the trend is still growth. I will also just indicate that the announcement on the upstream siloxanes is going to bring us back into better balance. We really look forward to continuing to leaning into downstream.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI think on siloxanes, Frank, we've seen obviously some positive pricing moves from Q1 going into Q2 here. North American and Asian demand for the downstream as well as the siloxanes product is still good. Europe, the driver for demand there is mostly specialty silicones going into health, personal care, some into the automotive sector as well. So they don't have as many upside drivers to demand there. That kind of gets back to our decision on the Barry site.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Andrew Riker for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within 48 hours. This concludes our call.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect."

Karen will then provide an overview of our operating segment performance. Jeff will share an update on the macroeconomic environment we are facing and our modeling guidance for Q3. Following that, we will share more on the strategic in-flight actions our teams are taking to navigate this prolonged downturn, specifically around cash support, operational execution, and structurally improving our global asset footprint in the near term to position DOW well for when our industry recovers. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrew. Beginning on slide three, the prolonged down cycle our industry has been experiencing was further amplified this quarter by heightened trade and geopolitical uncertainties, which have strained profitability across our industry. In this environment, it is critical that we successfully navigate the near term, protect Dow's financial flexibility, and advance our near-term growth initiatives to support higher earnings as the industry recovers. Additionally, growing signs of oversupply from newer market entrants being exported to other regions and anti-competitive economics requires an aggressive industry response and regulatory action to restore competitive dynamics. Given these challenges, we remain focused on driving operational discipline in everything we do. In the second quarter, net sales were $10.1 billion, down 7% versus the year-ago period, reflecting declines in all operating segments.\nSequentially, net sales decreased 3% as seasonally higher demand in Performance Materials and Coatings was more than offset by declines in our other operating segments. EBITDA was $703 million, which is also lower than the same period last year. Following a significant analysis and consideration, we announced this morning that Dow would implement a 50% dividend reduction effective in the Q3 of this year. This decision was not taken lightly, as we understand the importance our shareholders place on the dividend, and we carefully considered this on top of the financial impacts that we modeled. The dividend is a key element of our investment thesis, and that is not changing. We remain committed to targeting a competitive dividend across the economic cycle.\nHowever, given the current lower-for-longer earnings environment and the lack of a clear line of sight to a recovery for our industry, this is the most prudent way to maintain financial flexibility and maximize long-term value for our shareholders. Also, in the second quarter, we progressed several near-term cash support levers. The close of our strategic infrastructure asset partnership, named Diamond Infrastructure Solutions, delivered $2.4 billion of cash for Dow in the second quarter and has already captured growth opportunities with new customers. We also expect to receive cash proceeds from the Nova Judgment this year, and consistent with our Best-Owner Mindset, we recently announced two non-core product line divestitures totaling approximately $250 million at attractive EBITDA multiples of around 10x. These divestitures are additive to our announcement that we will shut down three upstream assets in Europe to address structural challenges in that region.\nWe are confident that these actions, paired with the completion of our near-term incremental growth projects, will support long-term value creation. Additionally, we are accelerating progress on our $1 billion in cost savings actions, where we now expect to deliver approximately $400 million this year. We are committed to continuing DOW's track record of operational and financial discipline, executing near-term actions to maximize shareholder value, and navigating the current environment, all to better position the company for profitable growth and higher shareholder returns as the industry recovers. Next, I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will provide an overview of our Q2 performance across DOW's operating segments.\n\nKaren Carter\n\nCOO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. In the second quarter, our teams continue to focus on price management to restore margins as we prioritize volume and attractive end markets. As we have done for the past several quarters, we are closely monitoring the macros across the markets we serve, pulling all levers to help mitigate the current lower-for-longer earnings environment, as well as the impact brought on by recent trade and tariff uncertainties. Starting with the results for our Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment on slide four. During our first quarter earnings call, we shared our expectations for flat polyethylene prices in second quarter. In April, however, prices in North America settled down $0.03 per pound, weighed down by the tariff uncertainty that halted several export channels. We believe that absent these uncertainties, prices would have remained at least flat and may have increased given healthy demand and higher feedstock costs.\nIn June, with export markets normalizing, the industry recovered the $0.03 per pound that was lost in April. Although industry margins remain below historical averages, demand remained steady, and following three consecutive months of industry inventory decreases, we see a favorable backdrop supporting further price increases. Net sales were down compared to the year-ago period. Higher volumes in polyethylene and increased energy sales were more than offset by lower downstream polymer pricing and lower volumes for infrastructure applications. Since projects in that industry are long-dated, they are impacted more by tariff uncertainty. Sequentially, net sales declined, driven by lower merchant ethylene sales. This is due to the startup of Poly7, our new polyethylene train in the US Gulf Coast. The asset will help Dow realize the full benefit of integration by absorbing our remaining ethylene length in the region. Polyethylene volumes were up, led by the US.\nand Canada, confirming resilient demand in the region, but down in Asia-Pacific as tariff uncertainty limited exports early in the quarter. Operating EBIT was $71 million, reflecting a decrease compared to the year-ago period. This was primarily driven by lower integrated margins. Sequentially, operating EBIT decreased, mainly due again to lower integrated margins, primarily reflecting pressure from the unfavorable industry price settlement in April, as well as lower operating rates. Next, turning to our industrial, intermediates, and infrastructure segment on slide five. Net sales declined both year-over-year and sequentially as market conditions across the segment remained challenging, particularly in our polyurethanes and construction chemicals business, which has high exposure to durables and building and construction markets. Volume declined 2% compared to the year-ago period.\nLower polyurethanes and construction chemicals volumes in EMEAI, where we continue to see increasing import activity from competitors in China, were partially offset by higher industrial solutions volumes across data center cooling and gas treating applications. Sequentially, a decline in demand for de-icing fluids following the winter months was only partially offset by a modest seasonal uplift in building and construction applications, which was lower than expected in a typical year. Operating EBIT for the segment decreased versus the year-ago period, as well as sequentially, primarily driven by lower prices and higher planned maintenance activity. This included activities related to the startup of our new alkoxylation unit in Seadrift, Texas. The new capacity, representing the completion of one of our near-term growth investments, will support earnings growth beginning in the third quarter and beyond.\nWe also recently finalized a long-term agreement with a major consumer brand owner to supply millions of pounds of low-carbon solutions, demonstrating our ability to capitalize on innovations that are meeting the needs of our customers and their sustainability commitments to consumers. Moving to the Performance Materials and Coatings segment on slide six, the team delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of downstream silicones growth, supported by strong demand for consumer and electronics applications. However, lower volumes for coatings applications and upstream siloxanes more than offset these gains. Net sales in the quarter decreased versus last year, and local price decreased year-over-year, driven by declines in both businesses. Sequentially, net sales for the segment increased 3%, driven by higher demand for downstream silicones in mobility and personal care applications, as well as seasonally higher demand for architectural coatings.\nOperating EBIT was up compared to the year-ago period, primarily driven by margin expansion from lower input costs, as well as better mix and consumer solutions, including more downstream silicones volumes and less upstream siloxanes. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased, driven by volume gains in both businesses as a result of seasonal improvements and continued downstream silicones growth, as well as lower fixed costs. In summary, Team DOW is focused on taking action to help navigate the challenging industry conditions. We are protecting and advancing our position in high-growth markets, optimizing our global asset footprint, and staying close with our customers. I will now turn the call over to Jeff, who will share more on the macroeconomic landscape, our outlook, and the related actions we are taking to ensure DOW's financial flexibility.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning to everyone on the call today. Moving to slide seven, as we head into the back half of the year, Dow and some of our industry peers are noting expectations that the global macroeconomic backdrop will remain challenged. Ongoing tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty have impacted demand patterns, especially in the industrial, infrastructure, and durable goods sectors. This has contributed to downward revisions in global GDP forecasts, leading to expectations of a protracted down cycle across many of the end markets Dow serves. Looking across our four market verticals, in packaging, domestic demand in North America is stable. However, export markets saw slower growth as volatile tariff policies weighed on trade flows, resulting in lower operating rates and additional margin pressure across the industry. Manufacturing activity in China remains relatively flat and continues to contract in Europe. In the infrastructure sector, US.\nBuilding permits remained near five-year lows in June, and market conditions in Europe and China have shown no signs of improvement. Consumer spending remains steady, even as US and European confidence stays below historical norms. June retail sales were up in China, largely attributed to government stimulus. However, consumer prices in China have deflated in four out of the last five months through June. In mobility, we continue to closely watch the impacts on demand from both global tariffs and government incentives. We have seen signs of softening in the US as auto sales declined for a third consecutive month in June. In the EU and China, while internal combustion vehicle demand continues to soften, electric vehicles remain a bright spot. In China specifically, vehicle production is forecasted to grow 3% this year.\nChinese auto sales and production are highly dependent on government incentives and could be affected by tariff and trade uncertainties. If the current momentum continues, it should be beneficial for our elastomers and our silicones businesses that have exposure to this market. Now turning to our outlook on slide eight. With the considerable uncertainty that so many markets are facing, making any projections right now is especially challenging. Should we become aware of significant changes during the quarter, we will share timely updates as appropriate. Although the macros remain largely unchanged, based on current indicators, we anticipate our Q3 EBITDA to be approximately $800 million, a $100 million improvement from Q2. This reflects our expectations for a sequential improvement in polyethylene integrated margins, as well as higher volumes from our growth investments that were commissioned in Q2.\nIt also takes into consideration our cost reduction program, where we have increased our expectations for end-year savings to approximately $400 million versus our original target of $300 million. Part of our sequential tailwinds are expected to be offset by higher planned maintenance spending. In addition, we expect lower seasonal demand, lower spreads in certain end markets, and lower equity earnings. In Packaging and Specialty Plastics, we expect sequential EBITDA to be approximately $95 million higher. This is largely driven by higher Integrated Margins following the June price settlement and an expectation that we will secure a price increase in July. Doing so will help us recoup some of the margin loss by elevated feedstock costs this year. In addition to margin expansion, we have the initial ramp of our new polyethylene train in the US Gulf Coast. Higher planned maintenance activities will provide a headwind in the quarter.\nWe expect lower equity earnings, primarily from Sadara, as a result of an unplanned event. In the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, we expect third quarter EBITDA to be approximately $85 million higher than the second quarter. This expected earnings uplift reflects our expectations for higher volumes from the startup of our new alkoxylation facility. In polyurethanes, we anticipate higher volumes in both MDI and polyols, although margins remain under pressure sequentially, driven by fierce price competition with Chinese exports into both Europe and Latin America. Following a heavy turnaround schedule in second quarter, II&I will have a sizable tailwind in the third quarter, in addition to the ramp in cost reductions. This segment will also experience headwinds from lower equity earnings at Sadara. In the performance materials and coatings segment, we expect lower sequential EBITDA of approximately $65 million.\nReduced turnaround spending will provide some tailwinds in Q3. We also anticipate normal seasonally driven decreases in demand in the building and construction end market, as well as margin compression in upstream siloxanes. The trade and tariff uncertainty from the prior quarter led to demand disruption in China, which drove local siloxanes prices to new record lows, with prices declining throughout Q2. In summary, with expanded margins in polyethylene, earnings tailwinds from our recent organic investments, and our accelerated cost reduction ramp, we expect to deliver sequential earnings improvement despite the slow growth environment we are navigating. Now turning to slide nine, we remain committed to financial discipline and flexibility, as evidenced by the near-term cash and operational improvements we already have underway to provide significant support.\nFor example, we announced last quarter that we expect our total enterprise 2025 CapEx to be approximately $2.5 billion, reflecting a $1 billion reduction compared to our original plan of $3.5 billion. This is largely attributed to our decision to delay our Path2Zero project in Canada until market conditions improve. And consistent with our Best-Owner Mindset, we also announced two non-core product line divestitures totaling approximately $250 million at attractive EBITDA multiples of approximately 10x. This includes completing the sale of our Telone soil fumigation product line to a strategic buyer. And we announced that Dow will sell our 50% ownership in the DowAksa joint venture, which is expected to close in Q3 of this year following customary regulatory approvals.\nTurning to our cost reduction efforts, we are on track to deliver at least $1 billion in targeted cost savings on an annual run rate basis by 2026. We delivered an approximately $50 million sequential tailwind in Q2 and are on a faster pace than we initially anticipated. In fact, we now expect to deliver approximately $400 million of the reductions this year. We also executed a debt-neutral $1 billion bond this year to take advantage of tight spreads and extend our material debt maturities past 2027. In addition, we continue to make solid progress on our unique-to-Dow items that support our near-term cash generation. In May, we finalized our strategic partnership with Macquarie Asset Management for the sale of a minority equity stake in select US Gulf Coast infrastructure assets, receiving approximately $2.4 billion in initial cash proceeds from the transaction.\nThe new entity, Diamond Infrastructure Solutions, recently announced a deal with a climate tech company named Again to build a first-of-its-kind plant to recycle waste CO2 emissions from an on-site tenant in our Texas City Industrial Park. This agreement is one of many growth opportunities the Diamond Infrastructure Solutions business model is set up to enable with both new and existing customers. And as a reminder, Macquarie has the option to increase their stake to 49% within six months of closing, which would occur no later than November. This would increase total cash proceeds from this new partnership to approximately $3 billion for Dow this year. Looking into the second half of the year, we also expect to receive cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion from the resolution for damages related to the jointly owned ethylene asset with Nova Chemicals.\nSo in total, we expect these actions to provide more than $6 billion in near-term cash support. And building on this, Karen will now cover the work we're doing to drive execution, ensure strong operational performance, and enable higher near-term returns.\n\nKaren Carter\n\nCOO, Dow Inc.\n\nTurning to slide 10, we are executing several strategic moves that will uniquely position Dow to win as the industry recovers. This includes moving aggressively on all fronts to protect and expand our industry-leading position. For example, in packaging and specialty plastics, we completed the startup of our Poly7 world-scale polyethylene train in Freeport, Texas. Using Dow's proprietary solution technology, Poly7 is designed for lower costs and increased production capacity, as well as improved efficiency and flexibility. Poly7 will support customer-driven demand in specialty packaging, health and hygiene, and industrial and consumer packaging applications. This new asset will also absorb Dow's ethylene lens in the US.\nGulf Coast, maximizing integrated margins and enabling production of higher-value functional polymers at other assets. Additionally, the completion of our new alkoxylation capacity in Seadrift, Texas, will support growth in Industrial Solutions, which serves attractive end markets such as home care, pharma, and energy. After completing this project, Dow will have no wholly owned capacity producing MEG. We're also transforming our Performance Materials and Coatings segment through downstream silicones capacity expansion, which supports high-value applications in attractive end markets growing above GDP, such as infrastructure, electronics, mobility, and consumers. In addition, our industry continues to face difficult market dynamics in Europe, including an ongoing challenging cost and demand landscape. That's why earlier this month, we announced the shutdown of three upstream assets in Europe across each of our operating segments in response to the structural challenges the region continues to face.\nEach of these assets represents a meaningful portion of our regional capacity, which is either not fully integrated, resulting in excess merchant sale exposure, or is high on our cost curve, where we have better options to supply derivative demand and optimize margins. These shutdowns are cash accretive and expected to result in an annual EBITDA uplift of $200 million by 2029, with benefits beginning in 2026 and half of that achieved by 2027. In summary, our teams are driving execution, helping Dow to navigate the realities of the current macroeconomic environment while also enabling higher returns in the near term. We are closely monitoring industry dynamics and remain committed to taking all necessary actions to drive shareholder value creation. Now let me turn the call back to Jim to share more on our consistent, disciplined, and balanced capital allocation approach.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Karen. Now turning to slide 11. In response to one of the longest downturns our industry has experienced, it is critical that we maintain financial flexibility and a balanced approach to capital allocation. With the earnings pressure the industry downturn has created, the fixed dollar amount of our dividend was outsized. This limited our flexibility to navigate this cycle and optimize total shareholder returns. Therefore, after significant and detailed analysis, Dow's board of directors determined that a 50% reduction in the dividend is the right move for our company and shareholders at this time. Importantly, our approach to capital allocation over the cycle remains unchanged. Our number one priority remains safely and reliably running our assets while we prepare for the market rebound. In addition, we will continue to target a strong investment-grade credit profile with a 2 to 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio across the cycle.\nAnd we will continue to invest in organic growth while targeting shareholder returns of at least 65% of Operating Net Income over the cycle via a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The actions we are taking today help to ensure that we're well-positioned for the industry recovery. Closing on slide 12, our near-term strategic priorities are clear, and we are working hard to mitigate the current environment and improve our competitive position. This includes a strict focus on operational and financial discipline and driving execution not only to restore our core earnings, but grow them. This is evidenced by the multiple near-term cash support items we're already delivering and the reduction in our dividend. In addition, the completion and startup of our near-term growth projects will further unlock both the value of integration and capitalize on our low-cost asset footprint in the Americas.\nWe're also taking necessary steps to right-size our footprint where we see structural challenges. Increasingly, we are seeing anti-competitive oversupply activities, particularly when it comes to imports into Europe and Latin America. Our teams are actively engaged in these regions to aggressively defend our local asset footprint and to ensure that a fair trade environment remains. We're engaging in positive and productive conversations with the governments around the world as it relates to trade and tariff uncertainties, and we're confident that we're in a strong position to mitigate the impact. Our diverse product portfolio, strategically advantaged asset footprint, and global scale position Dow to capture demand in attractive end markets growing above GDP. This is also evidenced in our annual benchmarking results, where we're generating higher polyolefin margins than our peers over the cycle.\nWe are taking the right actions and delivering several near-term improvements while staying focused on our long-term strategic priorities. We're well-positioned to deliver profitable growth as we unlock the full benefit of our growth investments, improve margins, implement cost reductions, and further strengthen our competitive advantages. With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew to get us started with the Q&A.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The floor is now open for questions. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. If you are called upon to ask your question, and are listening via loudspeaker on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Jim, I'm wondering if you can contextualize the dividend and your operating net income on a go-forward basis. Just thinking back in 2019, when you spun, you obviously had the same percentage target for the dividend of 45% of operating net income, but of course, operating net income was a lot higher back then than it is today. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that, particularly over the next three to five years in terms of what you think mid-cycle operating net income could get back to, and just sort of why the 45% ratio remained the correct ratio today versus 2019. Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nGood morning, Vincent. Yeah, a lot of analysis and forward-looking modeling of what we thought the economic recovery was going to look like went into that dividend reduction. And I would also say also a clear mindset that we weren't trying to solve this equation solely with the dividend. We also have a lot in play in terms of cost reduction actions and restoring earnings growth. That said, I don't think the mid-cycle earnings of the company have changed. I think the timeline is what's changed. We're in the third year of this downturn, and with the trade negotiations and kind of a new world order, and the trade rebalancing that's happening, it's hard to predict how long it's going to take us to recover, but it feels like we are reaching conclusion of these negotiations, which I think is a first step.\nWe're also seeing dynamics, as Karen mentioned on the call, where we think we're going to start to see some pricing power in plastics, as well as our near-term incremental growth investments. I think the mid-cycle number itself is still the same. The question is, how long will it take us to get back to that level?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.\n\nHassan Ahmed\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Alembic Global Advisors\n\nMorning, Jim. You know, a two-part question. One on the dividend. Just trying to sort of philosophically understand why even keep a fixed dividend. Industry, as we all know and have seen over the decades, continues to be cyclical. Why not just make it a variable dividend? So that's part one. And part two is just on the polyethylene side. Obviously, we continue to hear about capacity closures, shutdowns, and the like, but alongside, new sort of project announcements keep happening as well. So if you could also comment on how you're thinking about supply-demand fundamentals there.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nMorning, Hassan. Thanks for the question. I'm just writing it down so I get both parts of it here. On dividend, a dividend yield has been an important part of our stock ownership. When you think about our institutional investors and our retail investors, the dividend is very significant for them. And so having a leading dividend and a competitive dividend through the cycle has always been, for 128 years at Dow, part and parcel of the investment thesis. And we do generate good cash. Obviously, this is a prolonged down cycle, so I don't think it's fair to extrapolate where we are at this point in time. So I think a balance is what we're trying to strike here. With $2 billion moving out every year in a fixed dividend, that really puts some handcuffs on us from a capital flexibility standpoint at this part of the cycle.\nReducing that dividend gives us more flexibility to do other things as we navigate through. And as I said, we're not trying to solve the problem with just reducing the dividend. We're trying to keep a good competitive dividend, a leading dividend, which I think is what our investors are looking for, but also earnings growth. Our focus internally right now is on our cost positions. We have to establish low cost at the bottom of this cycle and on restoring earnings growth in the near term. On polyethylene, capacity closures primarily have been announced in Europe. I think so far about 15% of the European capacity has been announced. There are announcements and new capacity coming on, and we still need to remember that polyethylene continues to grow above GDP rates.\nAnd so you are going to need new capacity coming into the market around the world to support the growth of all the products that the plastics go into. Questions, timing, and supply-demand balances, and how we manage all that. So I don't think you're looking at an environment where it's the end of investing in plastics. I think you're looking at an adjustment to all the tariffs and trade situations that are going on. And then where do we go from there, and what's the timing of the new capacity coming on?\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Sison of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. I guess the first question is, I think consultants have noted that industry operating rates should get back to 90% for polyethylene in Q3. Pricing is up, integrated margins up. How do you get adjusted EBIT better? It just seems like it could be a little bit better. I just want a little bit of color on that. And then as a quick follow-up, Jim, I think you've noted that Dow sees an opportunity to leverage its 10GW power portfolio for AI data centers, maybe through the new partnership you have. Can you maybe expand on that a little bit and what the opportunity is?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nYeah, let me ask Karen to comment on operating rates. I'll just make one comment on operating rates. There's a big difference between operating rates in the Americas and the Middle East, where you have very low-cost positions, and Europe and Asia-Pacific. So we need to keep that in mind. And sometimes the consultants, when they refer to 90% operating rates, may be referring to the low-cost assets. But longer term, we do see them getting back to that stage. Karen, you want to comment on what we see coming in Q3 and beyond?\n\nKaren Carter\n\nCOO, Dow Inc.\n\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you for the question. We do see Integrated Margins and polyethylene getting better in Q3, and that's primarily because of where we ended Q2. If you think about Q2, April started off really rough, where you saw the exports frankly evaporate because of the uncertainty around tariffs when the China and US trade started to escalate. Before Liberation Day, we actually thought that prices were going to go up because you saw industry inventories come down in April. But of course, we saw polyethylene prices decline by $0.03 per pound, again, primarily because exports evaporated out of the US Gulf Coast. Then going into May, the market started to stabilize. You saw industry inventories come down again, and exports started to resume. June is really when we start to see the recovery.\nYou saw industry inventories go down for a third consecutive month. June, from an industry demand perspective, was the best month of the year, and that created the favorable backdrop for prices to go up. But because of the April down $0.03 per pound for the quarter, EBITDA was not great, and integrated polyethylene margins were extremely low. So we are capitalizing on that momentum coming into Q3, and there's a few reasons why we see integrated margins and therefore EBITDA getting better in Q3 for polyethylene. The first thing is that the industry has $0.05 to 0.07 per pound of price increases on the table for July. We expect to get those because, again, the current integrated margins are low and unsustainable.\nThe second thing for Dow is that, of course, you know that we commissioned our Poly7 polyethylene train down in Freeport, Texas, at the end of Q2. That train is fully sold out. We are targeting that volume to higher value market segments like food, specialty packaging, and health and hygiene. That train also absorbs the last length of merchant ethylene that we have on the market. And since we started up that train, we've seen spot ethylene improve. The prices improve there. And then the last piece is that because we started up that capacity, we have more flexibility to produce higher value functional polymers. So we fully expect integrated EBITDA margins to improve in Q3, and therefore we will have uplift both on margins but also on volume because of Poly7.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nOn Diamond Infrastructure Solutions, we're early days, but I'd say the range of opportunities there are all infrastructure related. We have an extensive pipeline network that connects the US Gulf Coast from Brownsville, Texas, to New Orleans and several of our sites along the way. We have 4,000 or 5,000 acres of land, which would be available for co-location. We've had outreach from people who are interested in everything from battery storage systems for grid stability and reliability. Jeff mentioned a new investment project on one of the sites. A lot of the growth that's coming in data centers, tech, and AI is companies that don't have a lot of infrastructure and utilities capability, and sometimes an interest to build behind-the-meter power, which is the way that we operate.\nHaving said that, there's no big project that I could put out in front of you right now on data centers. But I think positioning ourselves to have the capability to capture some growth there is important. It keeps our cost down as well and leverages our scale. Additionally, I think there's some opportunities with environmental operations. You think about wastewater treatment and the management of that. That's a unique capability the chemical industry has and we have in particular. And I think that's one that can be very challenging for a new entrant and can also take an awful long time to permit.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nJeffrey Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. If you went forward with the Alberta project, maybe your CapEx annually would be $3.5 billion, and you still have $1 billion in dividend payments. So if there's no improvement in the operating environment through H1 2026, is that project off the table, or would you reduce your dividend further? How do you feel about that in a world where the operating environment doesn't improve? And for Jeff, the working capital use was $1.5 billion for H1. Where do you think working capital use or benefit will stand by the end of the year?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nMorning, Jeff. Thank you. On Path2Zero, we will come back to that project, as we indicated earlier, toward the end of the year as we look forward to 2026 and beyond. CapEx plans are. But your point is noted, and that was obviously the reason that we delayed was the environment that we're in. We want to see a return to core earnings growth before we make a decision and make the move on that. I do think, as we mentioned in the previous question, long term, you do need growth in polyethylene. Given the capacity that we've got up there being very low cost, it's important for us to continue to move our footprint lower down the cost curve. But affordability is first and foremost that we got to take a look at. Jeff, do you want to take working capital?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow Inc.\n\nAbsolutely. Good morning, Jeff. In terms of working capital, the team continues to do a really solid job of managing inventories in all three aspects of working capital in the H1. What we have been managing through is obviously a heavy plant maintenance schedule throughout the H1 of the year, which will continue into Q3 and then start to tail off in Q4 as well. We've also been managing the two new growth investments as they come online, as Karen mentioned in her prepared remarks earlier. So H1 versus H2, Jeff, we would expect to see working capital improve in the H2 versus what we've seen in the H1.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank Securities. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank Securities\n\nThank you. Good morning. Jim, just on mid-cycle EBITDA, can you remind us what you think that number is and how do you get there from this year's levels? And just your comments on anti-competitive behavior in LATAM and Europe, how do you go about mitigating those impacts? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nMorning, David. Our average EBITDA from the period of 2018 to 2021 was about $8.6 billion. Our near-term growth investments are about $1.5 billion from growth in the three segments. You had another billion from, sorry, another half a billion from transform the waste targets that were in there. Alberta was a billion dollars. Of course, Alberta, as we just talked about, will depend on timing. And so I think the quantum of those numbers is still intact. It's the timing that's in question. As far as anti-competitive behavior, I think it's important that people understand that one of the things that's making this a little bit lower for longer is the fact that you've got product moving around the world differently than you did before, product that might have invested for the US.\nI may not be talking particularly here chemicals, but derivative demand that's not going to the US, but it's going to other markets, and it's flooding other ports and other markets. Obviously, it's suppressing pricing and suppressing demand around the world. So we have to work through that. We have two things going on. We have a very active international trade operations team that's well connected with the government at all levels here and abroad. They're managing the tariff trade negotiations that are going on. Then we've got to work through the normal course of business, WTO rules around how product is moved and defending fair trade. That's a separate action that we've got going on. Sometimes industry associations lead those activities. Sometimes it's individual companies that lead them. You've seen some here. You've seen them in Europe and in Latin America.\nBut there's an increasing amount of those because of the knock-on effect of tariffs being implemented, markets being closed to some imports, and then the redirection of those exports to other markets.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair of Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.\n\nMatthew Blair\n\nManaging Director, Tudor Pickering\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit more about what you're planning to do with the cash saved from the dividend? So I think in today's market, it's probably safe to assume that that cash would simply support the balance sheet. But when you get back to a mid-cycle environment, is that cash saved, would that be more earmarked for organic growth investments, or do you think that would be earmarked for share buybacks? Thanks.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nI'll take a shot at this, and then I'll ask Jeff to comment as well. But the reduction in the dividend was to keep our cash flexibility through the bottom of the cycle. And we're trying to keep CapEx low and bring CapEx down until we see improvement in the cycle. So it wasn't our intent to be able to take that cash and redeploy it in CapEx. It was to have some flexibility. We're not doing share buybacks right now, for example, but our stocks at a price where you would want to be doing that, looking at the intrinsic values. And so we have no flexibility to do it if we're paying everything out as a fixed dividend. So that's the way we went into it and the view we went into it with, obviously, maintaining our credit ratings and other important part of that. Jeff?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow Inc.\n\nYeah, Matthew, the only thing that I would add, if you look at this more in the near term, it's absolutely about navigating this lower for longer, maintaining that flexibility, continuing to focus on balance sheet strength. As we think more medium and longer term, what we want to do is ensure that we can continue to look at the most value-creating opportunities that we'll have across our balanced capital allocation framework. One thing I would note in regards to that, because of a lot of good work that's been done over the past few years around the balance sheet, we don't have any substantive debt maturities that come due before 2027. So we're in a really good position from that perspective to maintain that flexibility in the near and medium term.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYes, thank you and good morning. Jim, in listening to your comments, it sounds as though you believe that normalized earnings power has not changed very much, but the timing or the cycle shape has changed. So I was wondering if you could elaborate on that over the near term and the medium term. For example, you're guiding up sequentially in three Qs. So do you think $700 million could be a durable trough for quarterly earnings? And then over the medium term, my recollection is dating back to the capital markets day in May of 2024, you were looking at a peak period sometime between 2027 and 2030. So is it the case that we're flexing more toward 2030 at this point? Any updated thoughts there would be appreciated.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nGood morning, Kevin. Both good questions. I do think it's flexing toward the end of that time period, as you had mentioned. I will resist any temptations to call the trough given the environment that we're in, but we're taking actions to improve the core earnings. And some of them are things that we've wanted to do intentionally, which is invest for growth during the bottom of the cycle because those are the things that get us in a position to maximize the upcycle when we come out. And you know this business, it takes a while to get in position to be able to capture that. You just can't think that the cycle's coming next year and, oh, it's time to start working on a project. You have to have that already underway in flight or finishing construction. So that's the way we're looking at it.\nThe market has to absorb and has to continue to absorb some of the capacity that's come on. Then you've started to see at least an understanding, awareness, and some rhetoric in China about the amount of capacity that they've built and the amount of overcapacity that's there and the impact that that's having even on the domestic markets, especially amplified when they're limited on the export of that material. So I think that's a good thing. That brings some discipline into things that we haven't seen, and we need more discipline.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Josh Specter of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about just operating rates for Dow within polyethylene. I mean, our understanding is some of the lower EBITDA in Q2 was that you guys took down operating rates, and the industry did as well. So if you could help size what that penalty was in Q2, and it doesn't look to me that you're assuming much improvement in Q3. I guess, is that the right framing, or would you characterize that differently? Thanks.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nYeah, let me ask Karen to take a shot at that.\n\nKaren Carter\n\nCOO, Dow Inc.\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. So, operating rates in Q2, again, it was the April challenge that we had. Keep in mind that the overall industry in North America exports about 40% of its capacity on a monthly basis. And so, as I mentioned before, before Liberation Day, there was fertile ground for prices to go up because inventories had come down in April. I do want to make a comment, though, on Q3 because we actually are going to see EBITDA improvement in the Q3 because of how we exited Q2. And so, operating rates from an industry perspective are above 90%. It is the low-cost region. And so, from a Dow perspective, we fully expect to get the price increases that we have on the table for Q3 starting in July.\nThe second part, the reason we're going to have uplifts is because of our Poly7 train that just came on. As I mentioned before, it's fully sold out, and we are going to move that volume in Q3, and you'll see an earnings uplift from that. So our operating rates are up. There's a very small percentage of the industry capacity that is offline in Q3, and we expect to deliver earnings improvement from those perspectives.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, good morning. Two questions. One, Jim, can you just talk about on the anti-competitive stuff, which product chains are being most impacted there, and then where has legal action been taken already, and where should we expect it going forward? And then could you just clarify how much of the July price increase is actually baked into your Q3 guide?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nYeah, I'll take the first part, and I'll ask Karen to take the second part. Polyurethanes has seen a lot of that activity, Duffy. Of course, there's a lot of overcapacity that's been built there. So that's been a lot of moves there. It's a low-demand environment, so that's created that kind of pressure. Although it's not a particular area for us, you see it in chlorine, aromatics, and a few spots like that. You see that same kind of an impact. We're starting to see a bit of it in polyethylene. We've seen Brazil take action, some of Latin America. We're starting to see a little bit of that potentially in Europe, although I don't think it's been as prevalent in Europe on the plastic side. We're eyes wide open in all areas for that.\nAnd then I think obviously you've seen it in electric vehicles in Europe. That was one of the early cases where there was a lot of pressure in Europe on EVs. So it's not just the chemical industry, but in the chemical industry, there's a significant activity. Karen, you want to talk about PE pricing and how much is in that estimate?\n\nKaren Carter\n\nCOO, Dow Inc.\n\nSo all of our July price increase that we have on the tables is incorporated into our results. And again, we fully expect to achieve that. We are pushing to achieve that because, again, the current Integrated Margins are not only low, but they're unsustainable. So we are fully baking in Integrated Margins expansion as we get into third quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham of Citi. Your line is open.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With equity earnings continuing to trend lower, do you see any need for further portfolio restructuring actions on your JVs? And then specifically on Sadara, I believe the principal grace period is through 2026. At current earnings levels, would there need to be a reprofiling of that debt or any additional cash burden from Dow? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nMorning, Patrick. They're obviously equity earnings are depressed in the JVs because they're in the same markets that we're in. So I think we're dealing with that. Kuwait, Thailand, I feel like a relatively good position balance sheet-wise. We have an active team working together with Aramco on refinancing before we reach that time period where those grace periods end. And so we're looking to mitigate that that way. So I think so far we're in good shape there, but it's always something that's front and center that Jeff and I are keeping a very, very close watch on.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Frank Mitch of Fermium Research. Your line is open.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nHey, good morning. I wanted to come back to P&SP sequential decline in Q2 versus Q1. The guide that you gave out three months ago suggested that you'd see a $50 million headwind tied to turnaround, but cost reductions would mitigate that by $25 million. So the net of those two would be a $25 million decline. Obviously, we're down $270. Can you kind of size the buckets for us in terms of how much that was the 3% decline from April? How much of that is operating rates? How much of that might be something else that we haven't discussed right now? But I'm trying to get a better handle as to that large sequential decline. Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nYeah, let me ask Karen to comment on that.\n\nKaren Carter\n\nCOO, Dow Inc.\n\nYeah, so the two anomalies that we didn't talk about on our Q1 earnings call and weren't anticipating was the $0.03 per pound price decline that we saw in April, and then subsequently the operating drop because of that. So I would say it's about 50/50 between 50% the price declined $0.03 and then 50% the operating rate decline.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Mizuho Securities USA. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho Securities",
    "content2": "Thank you. Do you think the duration of the overcapacity in polyethylene, siloxanes, and polyurethanes are all in sync, or do you see one or another of these chains actually improving before the others?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nCEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThat's a good question, John. I think Isocyanates is in relatively decent shape within the polyurethanes portfolio. PO will take longer. We've got probably the biggest adjustment in PO coming into the year with a reduction of a train here in the US Gulf Coast. Siloxanes, the reason for our move with Barry was because our view is that that's a little bit longer on siloxanes. Silicones, downstream silicones continues to grow well. And so I think that looks good, but the drag is on siloxanes. I think polyethylene, ethylene, because of the demand that's out there and the size of the market, we'll recover quicker.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our Q&A session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Andrew Riker for closing remarks.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within 48 hours. This concludes our call.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If you would like to ask a question at that time, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President Andrew Riker. Mr. Riker, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I am Andrew Riker, Dow's Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer, and Dow's recently appointed Chief Operating Officer, Karen S. Carter. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risk and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the Earnings News Release that is posted on our website. On slide two is our agenda for today's call.\nJim will review our fourth quarter and full-year results. Karen will provide an overview of our operating segment performance, and Jeff will share an update on the macroeconomic environment and our modeling guidance for the first quarter. Jim will then provide details on the intentional actions Dow is taking to navigate the prolonged economic downturn and close out the call. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Andrew. Beginning on slide three, there's a lot to unpack in our results this quarter, so let me first walk through the headlines. In the fourth quarter, Team Dow delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth despite continued weak macroeconomic conditions. Net sales were $10.4 billion, which is down two percent versus the year-ago period and reflects pricing pressure seen across the industry in the quarter. Local price was down three percent year-over-year and sequentially, with declines across all our operating segments. Operating EBITDA was $1.2 billion, which is approximately flat compared to the same period last year. Cash flow from continuing operations was $811 million, resulting in free cash flow of $44 million. Returns to shareholders totaled $492 million of dividends in the quarter, and our total CapEx spend was $767 million.\nAs you saw in our numbers this quarter, we also had a non-cash tax adjustment impacting net income and EPS. Jeff will provide more details on that later in this call. Throughout the quarter, we announced additional actions that continue to support the optimization of our global portfolio for growth while maintaining a best-owner mindset. For example, we continue to ramp up operating rates at our Texas-8 cracker and Glycol 2 Unit. We completed the sale of our flexible packaging laminating adhesives business to Arkema for an enterprise value of approximately $150 million, and we've signed a definitive agreement with Macquarie Asset Management for the sale of a minority stake in select US Gulf Coast infrastructure assets, for which we expect to receive cash proceeds of up to $3 billion.\nDriven by persistently weak global macroeconomic conditions, we announced a strategic review of select European assets, primarily in our Polyurethanes business, where demand has been structurally challenged over the past five years, making it the highest-cost region for several of our key businesses. We are also postponing a maintenance turnaround at one of our ethylene crackers in Europe. This decision will result in us idling this asset starting in Q2 until market dynamics improve. And today, we announced targeted actions to reduce our cost by $1 billion and our CapEx by $300 million-$500 million. Collectively, the additional actions are focused on reinforcing our long-term competitiveness as we continue to navigate this prolonged economic downturn. Turning to slide four, in 2024, Team Dow continued to advance both our near-term priorities and our long-term strategy to become a stronger, more intive company.\nWe delivered net sales of $43 billion, Operating EBIT of $2.6 billion, and year-over-year volume growth of three percent, excluding merchant hydrocarbon sales. Earlier in 2024, we began construction at our Path2Zero investment in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. When complete, the project is expected to generate approximately $1 billion in incremental EBITDA annually by 2030. Dow is also recognized externally through industry-leading awards and certifications. Last year, we earned 12 Edison Awards for innovation, and Great Place to Work and Fortune named Dow as one of the top 25 World's Best Workplaces. Team Dow navigated several challenges over the past year, including weather-related and supply chain disruptions, and continued uncertainty in many regions and markets that we serve. In response to evolving market dynamics and sluggish demand recovery in Europe, we demonstrated our best-owner mindset with more than 20 proactive actions to address higher-cost assets.\nI remain confident in our company's ability to foster a sustainable future, achieve long-term profitable growth, and enhance shareholder returns. Now, I'm pleased to turn it over to Karen S. Carter, Dow's Chief Operating Officer, who will provide an overview of our operating segment performance on slide five.\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. I'm pleased to join you all today. And before I begin, I'd like to mention what an honor it is to be named Dow's Chief Operating Officer. I look forward to engaging with many of you, our owners, in the near future. In my more than 30 years at Dow, I have progressed through the organization to most recently leading P&SP, the company's largest operating segment. And I have worked across a broad range of businesses and functions, including global leadership positions within the building and construction, and consumer electronics and markets, as well as Dow's polyethylene franchise. This has given me a deep appreciation for our company's competitive advantages, the strength of our innovation engine, and our commitment to delivering profitable growth. As COO, my priorities are to further strengthen our customer engagement, accelerate the commercialization of Dow's innovation pipeline, and enhance reliability and productivity.\nI am committed to driving business and operational results while progressing our strategic priorities to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let's move to our operating segment results. In the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, we entered the fourth quarter with a challenging backdrop of ample industry supply, high feedstock costs, and a typical seasonal slowdown in demand. Segment results reflected a decrease in local price both year-over-year and sequentially. This was primarily driven by lower functional polymers and polyethylene prices as a result of the October price decline reflected in the market indices and other competitive price pressures throughout the quarter. Despite higher demand for flexible food and specialty packaging in all regions except Latin America, volume for the segment was down one percent year-over-year. This was primarily driven by lower third-party hydrocarbon sales and non-recurring licensing revenue.\nOperating EBIT was $447 million, a decrease of $217 million compared to the year-ago period. This was primarily driven by lower integrated margins and licensing revenue. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, we benefited from strong global energy demand as well as stable consumer and pharma demand. We also experienced typical seasonal improvements for de-icing, while agricultural and coatings applications saw normal seasonal declines. Looking at fourth quarter results, local price declined one percent year-over-year, while volume was up one percent year-over-year. This was driven by improved supply availability in our Industrial Solutions business as we finished ramping up our Glycol 2 Unit ahead of schedule. Those gains were partly offset by continued softness in the Polyurethanes and Construction Chemicals business. Operating EBIT for the segment increased $69 million versus the year-ago period. Results were primarily driven by higher operating rates and improved supply availability in the Industrial Solutions business.\nIn the performance materials and coatings segment, volume was up five percent, with strong gains across both architectural coatings and downstream silicones. We achieved this despite global weakness in building and construction markets as high interest rates continue to pressure spending in residential markets. Operating EBIT increased $52 million compared to the year-ago period, driven by volume gains and lower fixed costs. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will provide an overview of the macros and our outlook.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning to everyone joining our call today. Moving to slide six, while global GDP is expected to grow at similar levels to 2024, recent economic activity is primarily being led by the strength in service-related sectors. In contrast, Global Manufacturing PMI is at contractionary levels, with output and new orders declining in December. Ongoing affordability challenges also continue to pressure spending in housing and durable goods sectors. These dynamics have created a two-speed economy, and we continue to monitor key indicators for signs of positive inflection in more challenged markets. Notably, this includes the pace of interest rate cuts in the US and Europe and recent stimulus actions in China for any impacts on inflation, as well as in market demand. In addition, we are watching for any impacts from ongoing geopolitical volatility, including potential tariffs.\nNow, looking across our four market verticals, in packaging, we continue to see demand growth, especially in North America, with resilient domestic and export polyethylene demand throughout the year. In China, manufacturing activity remains tepid, and overall demand in Europe continues to be soft. Infrastructure demand remains weak globally, particularly in residential construction. In the US, mortgage rates are now back up above seven percent, representing the highest level since May, despite lower Fed interest rates. This is driving ongoing affordability issues, with US building permits remaining below their three-year average. China new home prices also declined year-over-year for the 18th consecutive month. Consumer spending continues to be constrained by persistent inflation in the US and Europe, with consumer confidence levels declining in December. In China, overall retail sales were up in December, although year-over-year growth in furniture sales decelerated from the prior month.\nIn mobility, higher auto sales in the US and China were driven by discounts to clear elevated inventory and government stimulus actions, respectively. We also saw new car registrations in the EU decline 13% in second half of 2024 compared to first half of the year. Now, turning to our outlook on slide seven, we expect first quarter earnings to be approximately $1 billion, down $200 million quarter-over-quarter. This is largely due to higher anticipated feedstock costs, which have increased due to the severe cold snap. We expect this to pressure margins as we start the quarter. We will also have higher planned maintenance activity in first quarter across our three operating segments, but expect full-year planned maintenance activity to be roughly in line with the prior year.\nIn addition, we anticipate our operational tax rate to be in the range of 25%-29%, in line with our historical rate. This reflects an improvement versus fourth quarter, which was elevated largely due to higher-than-expected non-cash tax adjustments. These tax items were primarily related to Argentina, which was amplified by inflation. Audit remeasurements in currency were also drivers for the fourth quarter tax rate. Next, I'll turn to our outlook and first quarter guidance by segment. In Packaging and Specialty Plastics, we expect higher feedstocks and energy costs to outpace price increases from a timing perspective in the quarter. As a result, global integrated margins are expected to be lower sequentially. In addition, we anticipate headwinds of approximately $50 million from higher planned maintenance activity, primarily along the US Gulf Coast.\nIn the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, we anticipate lower margins in our Polyurethanes business from higher energy costs, as well as lower catalyst sales in our Industrial Solutions business. In the quarter, we have planned maintenance activity scheduled at our ethylene oxide asset in Seadrift, Texas, which will enable the startup of additional alcohol distillation capacity in the US Gulf Coast. This new capacity is one of the near-term growth investments we outlined at our last investor day and should support higher sales beginning in second quarter. In the performance materials and coating segment, building and construction markets remain soft, with high mortgage rates in the US and sector weakness in China continuing to weigh on demand. However, we expect a seasonal demand uptick in first quarter to provide a tailwind of approximately $75 million.\nIn addition, our regular yearly maintenance at our monomers assets in the US Gulf Coast is expected to be a sequential headwind of approximately $25 million. On a final note, last week, the US Gulf Coast was impacted by a powerful winter storm. Our manufacturing sites have managed well, but we continue to monitor any further developments both at our sites as well as across the industry. The current guidance does not include any impacts favorable or unfavorable stemming from the storm. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jeff. On slide eight, in the midst of the prolonged downturn and slower-than-expected economic recovery that our industry is experiencing, Dow is taking several key actions to further reduce our costs and reinforce our long-term competitiveness through the economic cycle. First and foremost, we're taking additional targeted actions aimed at improving our margins. We announced today that we will implement cost reductions of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis by 2026. These actions will be primarily focused on third-party contract labor and purchased services. In addition, we are targeting the elimination of approximately 1,500 Dow roles. Last quarter, we announced that we would kick off a strategic evaluation of our European asset footprint, and we're on track to provide an update on this work by mid-2025.\nLastly, as we complete our in-flight higher return growth project this year, we're also taking actions to preserve our strong financial foundation. We intend to recalibrate our CapEx deployment to match the current demand and macroeconomic conditions, and we'll do so by reducing our 2025 spending by $300 million-$500 million compared to our previously disclosed target of $3.5 billion. We will keep CapEx spending roughly at these levels until we see a clear recovery materialize across broad portions of the end markets that we serve. Turning to slide nine, we continue our ongoing practice of reviewing our global portfolio. Last month, Dow entered into a definitive agreement to sell 40% equity stake in select infrastructure assets to Macquarie Asset Management, a leading global infrastructure investor. We anticipate the transaction will close by mid-2025.\nThis newly formed infrastructure-focused company, named Diamond Infrastructure Solutions, is comprised of assets that support a wide range of services at five of Dow's manufacturing sites along the US Gulf Coast. The new company will operate within Dow and has a dedicated management team with priorities in support of Diamond Infrastructure Solutions' strategy. Importantly, Dow will maintain operational control to ensure our standards for safe and reliable operations are upheld. This transaction is expected to generate approximately $2.4 billion of initial cash proceeds for Dow. Macquarie Asset Management has the option to increase their minority equity stake to 49% within six months of closing, which would increase cash proceeds to approximately $3 billion for Dow if exercised. The long-term partnership leverages Dow's operational excellence and Macquarie Asset Management's world-leading infrastructure positions to generate incremental operational efficiencies, as well as future growth opportunities with existing and new customers.\nWith enhanced financial flexibility from this partnership, Dow is in a strong position to continue to invest in growth and deliver enhanced returns to our shareholders, particularly as market conditions improve. Closing on slide ten, as we navigate a challenging near-term environment, we are committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to delivering our cash and capital allocation priorities. Our ability to proactively manage in an extended economic downturn will position Dow well for long-term success. As I mentioned earlier, last week, we postponed a maintenance turnaround at one of our ethylene crackers in Europe. This decision will result in us idling this asset starting in second quarter until market dynamics improve. This reduction in planned turnaround spending will keep 2025 turnaround spending levels in line with the prior year. We will continue to match supply with profitable demand until margins improve.\nWe continue to take proactive strategic actions to optimize our global footprint, drive operational performance, and reduce our costs and capital expenditures. In 2025, our additional cost actions and reduced CapEx spending will help us to enhance near-term cash flow, margins, and earnings growth while remaining committed to our long-term strategic priorities. In addition, our signed agreement with Macquarie Asset Management further strengthens Dow's financial flexibility and the potential to generate up to $3 billion in cash proceeds in 2025. This transaction is consistent with Dow's best owner mindset and track record of delivering unique-to-Dow cash flow levers to mitigate cyclical volatility. We're optimistic that we will continue to see demand growth in attractive end markets such as packaging, energy, and electronics. And once completed, our near-term growth investments representing higher return and quicker payback projects will enable improved underlying earnings and margins across the cycle.\nWith a differentiated portfolio and proactive actions to support our solid financial foundation, we are confident in our ability to deliver on all of our capital allocation priorities, including our industry-leading dividend. At the same time, we will continue to maintain our focus on operating and financial discipline to drive long-term shareholder value to ensure that we remain well-positioned for the cycle recovery. With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew to get us started with the Q&A.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star, then again. We kindly ask everyone to limit themselves to one question. We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nJust before we get to the first question, I wanted to make a few brief comments about the tragic incident that occurred near Washington, DC, last night. We're saddened by the news of yesterday evening's passenger plane crash. As a company with values centered on people, our hearts are heavy for all those who have been affected by this tragic event. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the passengers, crew members, and their families during this incredibly difficult time. Operator, do we have the first question?\n\nOperator\n\nYes, Mr. Fitterling, your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning. Jim, if I could just ask you to revisit the three bridge items we talked about on the last call, one of which was sort of operating rate or macro improvement. The second was the year-over-year delta and planned maintenance, which sounds like is going to be neutral now. And then third was just sort of the startup of Dow projects that we're going to contribute. So if you could just update us on where you see those for 2025 at this point. Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nSure. Good morning, Vince. Thank you. Look, on operating rate, I would say in fourth quarter, we saw some improvements in overall company operating rate, but on industry operating rate, we're still not in an expansionary level yet. Europe has been a big weight on that. Europe continues to be, for the industry, about 20% below pre-COVID levels across the board. And if you get into other sectors like housing-related Polyurethanes, it can even be lower than that. I'd say the operating rates in the Americas continue to be relatively strong. So you're talking about high 80s, low 90s percent types of operating rates. The ethylene chain is stronger than the propylene chain. Housing and automotive drive a lot in the propylene chain. And downstream silicones, obviously, are doing better than siloxanes. The siloxane rates are a drag on it, mainly from capacity adds in China. Year-over-year, we've trimmed things.\nObviously, it won't show up in first quarter, but we're targeting to be flat year-over-year on turnarounds. That was a big part of the decision to defer the maintenance on one of the crackers in Europe. Probably people don't realize that we have kind of an integration between Terneuzen, Stade, and Tarragona. In addition to managing the ethylene part of the chain, we have to balance the propylene part of the chain as well. Deferring that maintenance will allow us to save some costs this year. It'll also tighten up things from a balance standpoint around the region. We think that'll be a net positive. Then the startup of the Dow projects this year. We have several projects that are in flight. We have projects in polyethylene, which are on track to start up by the middle of the year.\nWe have a couple of projects in Industrial Solutions that are on track to start up. Longer term, we've got our Path2Zero project in Alberta, which is still on schedule for the end of 2027.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. I guess what we've heard so far is 2026 overall macro or demand, unfortunately, doesn't seem like it's going to be much better than 2025. I mean, 2025 versus 2024, sorry. You've got some headwinds here for higher feedstock costs and energy. You've got some cost savings. So if demand is unfortunately similar in 2025 versus 2024, I mean, directionally, should EBITDA be up, down, flat? I mean, how do you sort of look at that this year?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Michael. Good question. On 2025 versus 2024, obviously, a big part of the $1 billion of cost actions we're taking are to underpin, improve EBITDA in 2025. So we've got volume growth. And I mentioned the projects that we'll have starting up this year, which all of them will be able to be sold out and be accretive from the point that they start up. So you'll have that. We're obviously not counting on a tremendous amount, although we've shown five consecutive quarters of volume growth. So we're still going to keep taking advantage of our low-cost position and get our share. But I think it's pricing power is the real question. And that's the reason for the cost action is to underpin the improvement in EBITDA. I would say you also have to think about the markets. And a lot will depend on demand in the markets.\nIn P&SP, well, I'd say in the ethylene chain in general, P&SP and ethylene oxide derivatives have continued to be strong. You see that strength in Industrial Solutions. You see that strength, although we had some pricing slip in fourth quarter. Overall, you see that strength in the integrated margins of P&SP. So I think that'll continue to be a positive sign. I think we'll continue to take the actions that we need to take in Europe to tighten things up there. I don't want to be doom and gloom about Europe, but I think we have to be realistic that downstream demand is not coming back. And so we're going to have to take actions there to tighten things up.\nThen, of course, cash, we're going to manage very carefully, which is why you saw the CapEx reductions that we announced to try to stay in a better cash flow position. Keeping our dividend strong is one of the number one priorities.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\n\nHassan Ahmed\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Alembic Global\n\nMorning, Jim. You know, a question on P&SP. I'm just trying to sort of reconcile the guidance that you guys gave and what sort of polyethylene pricing you guys are baking in there. You're clearly looking for a bit of a margin squeeze over there. And we have a variety of sort of polyethylene price hikes on the table in the US contract-wise. And obviously, ethane prices have gone up as well. So I guess a two-part question. What polyethylene prices are you baking in? And what sort of ethane pricing environment are you baking in?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nHassan, great lead-in for me to welcome Karen to the call and ask her to cover P&SP in those two parts.\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning. Thank you for the question. I think it's important to go back to fourth quarter and really look at what happened from a pricing perspective. As you know, we saw market prices go down in October by three cents per pound. Then prices continued to decline throughout the quarter, really driven by not market moves, but also contract resets that occurred generally at that time of the year. So we're coming into 2025 with low prices. But at the same time, as you indicated, we saw input costs increase almost immediately as we got into the year. So we do have 12 cents per pound on the table for price increases in fourth quarter, seven cents in January, and five cents in February. And as you indicated, we are seeing both ethane and natural gas costs come up.\nThose costs are outpacing the rate at which price increases are being implemented. I just want to reiterate that it is really important that we are going to stand firm on our price increases. Margins have reached a place that they are unsustainable. You should expect to see that we are going to be resolute in getting those price increases through.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI also think Hassan that, well, the short-term moves and cost increases happen this time of year when the first blast of winter hits and everybody gets a little dose of reality. They also soften, typically, as the quarter goes on and you move into second quarter. Natural gas production is strong. It was 106 billion cubic feet per day last year. We don't see any change in that. The ethane frac spread is 50 cents a million BTU. That's a very good rate. I would say the only other thing is that propane naphtha advantage, that slipped a bit at the back half of the year in Europe. I think it's going to start to come back a little bit, but not dramatically. So it's another reason to balance things out in the cracker fleet in Europe.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. The global commodity polyethylene industry is oversupplied. Between you and CPChem, you're adding another eight billion pounds in North America. Dow is adding half of that between now and 2030. Do you really want to add that, or is your plan to close down your European assets so that there's no net addition? When we look at the Lyondell results in Europe, what we see is that they don't make any money. I assume that, or they make little money. I assume that's the same for you. So the first question is, do you really want a net addition, or are you going to balance additions with closure? Then for Jeff, what happened to the cash flow? That is, cash flow is a couple of billion lower than it was last year. EBITDA is flat. Is that a one-time event?\nHow many shares are going to be issued for management comp this year to add to the share base? Thanks.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nJeff, thanks for that. I'll take the first part on ethylene, and then I'll have Jeff come in on cash flow. On supply demand, I think it's important to remember that what we're adding in Alberta is two million metric tons of zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions, ethylene and derivatives. And we'll convert a million and a half tons to zero emissions. So three and a half million tons of zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions, ethylene. And we're in negotiations now, positively moving forward with customers for the offtake for that material. So it is a different part of the mix than what's available today. I do think your point is valid. We're seeing actions in Europe across the industry, which would tend towards reducing capacity in Europe, which is high cost. And there aren't any signs.\nI mean, there's been a lot of good discussion in Europe around the Draghi report and competitiveness, but there have been no actions that indicate that energy costs or competitive positions are going to improve. So I think you're going to see some contraction there. I think we have to look around the world at places that are not cost competitive and tighten up there. Our investments are in cost-advantage regions. Like we said in Alberta, you're talking about putting a cracker in the first quartile that has zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions. There's nothing of that scale anywhere in the world for those brand owners and those customers who want that product. Jeff, you want to cover the cash flow.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah, thanks, Jim. And good morning, Jeff. There are a couple of things here on the cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we did generate $800 million in cash from operations. And our cash conversion rate was approximately 67%. One of the things that we did intentionally do in the fourth quarter is because of our first quarter 2025 heavy turnaround activity, we did purposely and intentionally build some additional inventory, especially as some of those turnarounds are going to be in some of our high-growth areas from a business perspective. So some of that was very intentional, Jeff, in terms of the build of the inventory that we saw. In addition to that, we continue to maintain a really strong cash conversion cycle that we've taken out eight days since then.\nWe've continued to be very disciplined in our approach to maintaining that ability to not only get the eight days out, but look for opportunities to get maybe another one or two days moving forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Jim, on the cost savings you announced today, on the direct costs, are those permanent or are they somewhat temporary? And of the 1,500 roles that are being reduced or eliminated, what regions are they? I presume mainly Europe. And what businesses and functions are they attached to? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, David. On the cost savings, we're trying to get the structural costs down and keep them at a low level. So we're trying to make them as permanent as we can. It's about 75% third-party cost savings. It's about 25% direct, which is a little bit lower on the direct percent than typical. I'd say on the third-party cost savings, we feel pretty good about our ability to get that done. We expect to be at about a 60% run rate by fourth quarter and a full run rate by mid-next year. Regions, I would say it's a combination of regions, functions, and businesses. So regions that are under economic pressure, obviously, Europe and Asia is a focus. Functions where we've not seen productivity improvements is a focus. And then we haven't announced a lot of site closures here. Our European asset review is still underway.\nWe'll have updates on that by mid-year. But this is not loaded with site closure costs or anything like that, which is why the charge is relatively nice.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nSalvator Tiano\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you very much. This is Salvator Tiano, for Steve. Just wanted to go back a little bit to the full-year expectations. I wonder, are there any other discrete items besides the maintenance spend that will be flat year-on-year, such as the benefit of having the EG-2 unit operating for the full year that can help or be a headwind for 2025 versus 2024? Can you go back also on the polyethylene price increases that you spoke earlier, just for January, because there will be an on-market adjustment based on some trade publishers? How do you expect that to actually impact realizations in January versus December against the proposed contract price increases?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. So let me take a shot at the first half of your question, which is on the full year. The things that we should take a look at as we're looking at full-year outlook. Then I'll ask Karen to talk about the polyethylene prices part. So first quarter margins are going to be squeezed, as we said. I would expect the exit rate of the quarter and first quarter to be higher as we land those polyethylene prices through the quarter and as some of the feedstock costs come off. So something in the ballpark of $1.4 billion a quarter from second quarter to fourth quarter could be more in line with how we performed if you looked at last year's results and the market backdrop that we've got. Then you've got about $300 million of cost reductions that we outlined today.\nThen you have the growth levers that we remain focused on. So we've got Texas-8 ramped back up. We've got our Glycol 2 Unit back up in the market. It reached full growth rates or full production rates in the fourth quarter. You see that in the results in the fourth quarter. And then on top of that, we're counting on a little bit of help from GDP to get there. So I think we will; I would think we will see things improve. We have a bit of, in addition to the compression in first quarter on pricing in P&SP, we've got the turnarounds. But the full-year turnaround number will be flat. Karen, do you want to talk a little bit about price and what you expect on the non-market side?\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nYeah. So in the first quarter, a little bit what we saw in December is we'll continue to see some contract resets. But then we also expect to see some non-market moves as well. But I think the key thing as you think about first quarter from a margin compression perspective is really that those feedstock costs are outpacing the rate of price increases. And so if you think about it this way, we have price increases that we are going to implement over the January and February timeframe. But the higher feedstock costs occurred right at the beginning of the year. So you are right. We will continue to see some non-market moves, but again, a few more contract resets as we continue to grow our share on our volume.\nAnd then the other headwind that Jim just mentioned is that we are going to have a few more turnarounds on the energy side, but also on functional polymers.\n\nOperator\n\nQuestion comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the risk and potential mitigation activities you could do around tariffs, specifically around Canada. I mean, I assume that a lot of the tons from your facilities in Canada come into the US versus export markets. I guess first, can you clarify what that mix is? And if that is right, what can you do to mitigate the impact, or how do you plan around this?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good question, Josh. I mean, I think the most important thing is what we're doing right now, which is engage with the administration on providing data for ourselves and also for the industry to understand the situation. And we're starting to see every day more refinement on what's happening. I think it's pretty clear in the near term. The discussion is around getting control over immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the United States. We're relatively balanced with Canada. We trade both ways with Canada, a little bit more coming into the US from a finished product standpoint, but we've got product that moves both ways. So trying to just have an overall picture of what the energy complex and the petrochemicals complex looks like there so that we don't create unintended consequences.\nI don't think it's the administration's view to do something that's going to hurt the global economy. I think they want to try to create the situation where we continue to have growth and investment here.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Jim, just want to dive a little deeper. I think we did it last time, just how you're thinking about some of the EU assets by country. And I think last time we were going over the Netherlands and Germany. There are a lot of strategic reviews going on in Continental Europe right now. So just trying to think about how you fit into the larger picture in terms of these developments and how they're basically panning out over the next several years. Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nSure. That's a great question, Chris. If you look at the EU, obviously, the number one challenge is energy competitiveness. And so relatively speaking, Spain has a decent advantage right now from an energy standpoint. So there, we're looking with our partners at Repsol on how do we reduce the combined cost between the two of us on operations in Spain. When you get to the Netherlands, while we announced the idling of a cracker to avoid the turnaround cost this year, I don't want you to assume that that's the answer to the European strategic review. That really is just something that we have the ability to do this year to manage through the short-term situation. The Netherlands has been pretty competitive throughout, and our cost positions have been pretty good there. We just have to look at the market for ethylene. We're a net merchant ethylene seller.\nWe've got to look at those balances. We've got to look at the propylene market and balances, and that'll drive what we decide to do there. I'd say that the Netherlands as a country is still very focused on energy. In discussions recently, they still have a focus themselves on adding nuclear power generating capability, which I think is going to help them with their energy costs. Germany, a lot is going to depend on this election at the end of February. I think it's shaping up that there will be a change in the German government. If you look at what happened post-COVID, Germany moved fast to take action when the Russian supply on gas was stopped, and now has five LNG import facilities operating. It's really shifted the balance on LNG imports.\nHowever, the LNG import costs are $10-$15 dollars a million BTU into Europe. So longer term, we have to look at what else can we do in Germany structurally to get the cost down. I think it's going to require state action to make it happen. I don't think the EU is going to do something that drives this. I think it's going to require the states pushing back. And there's no state that has more heft in this discussion than Germany.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nThank you. Good morning and congratulations, Karen, on your new role. Jim, I want to ask about the II&I segment in terms of first quarter. You're calling out roughly $100 million sequential headwinds, mostly from one-offs, excluding higher energy. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the pace of business between the Polyurethanes, Construction, and Industrial Solutions segments? One would have thought this US Gulf Coast freeze would be fantastic for your de-icing business, etc. So can you give us absent these one-offs? What is really going on in those businesses as we sit here in first quarter?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nKaren wanted to unpack that?\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nYeah. No, thanks for that question. So if I look at the first quarter, and I'll take Polyurethanes and Construction Chemicals first, we're not really seeing any signs of demand recovering despite the interest rate cuts in the US and Europe. And as you know, we have several applications in that business that are really sensitive to interest rates. So whether you're talking about bedding and furniture, but also obviously in the housing applications as well. And if you think about US home affordability, it remains at its historic lows, but then also interest rates there are above seven percent. We also saw in the fourth quarter, automotive start to slow. And if you think about that from a US perspective, those inventories are at 10-year highs.\nThat's one of the reasons that we announced on the last earnings this strategic review of our European footprint, really where we're looking at Polyurethanes in particular. So then if I pivot to DIS there, what I would say is that overall demand really does remain stable. We are seeing some green shoots in global energy demand, and also pharma demand, which is really good for us. De-icing, as you indicated, is a seasonal tailwind. So we'll see if the cold weather continues to persist. But then one of the things that's notable in the first quarter around DIS is that we do have increased turnaround there. We're taking our unit in Seadrift down. So that will result in a tailwind for us.\nSo I would say overall, on the Polyurethanes side, just continuing to see challenging market demand, market macros, but then also on the Industrial Solutions side, with the continued ramp of Glycol 2 that's now fully back, we should see a tailwind there. But again, some of that is being muted with the turnaround that we see in first quarter.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI would just add, Frank, on automotive, the shape of automotive last year was a pretty strong start to the year in terms of production units. And you saw automotive, I think, being positive as they moved through the middle of the year, and then toward the end of the year, a lot of pull-down in inventory in automotive. So dealer discounts and things happening. You saw China moving product in advance of the end of the year because they wanted to get ahead of tariffs. And so I don't know, but we could see something similar happen this year where automotive starts strong again. And we just have to keep an eye on what happens with inventories there and demand in the automotive sector.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. On the lower siloxane pricing environment, which is impacting PM&C, are China oversupply issues getting better or worse into 2025? And with the focus on more downstream specialties, would you anticipate taking any further actions on upstream assets, or do you anticipate others to take actions on capacity here?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Patrick. Good question. I'd say it's getting better, but the pace of getting better is slow. I'd say the business is taking a look at the upstream side and what they want to do in that space. The downstream demand has been good. Karen, maybe you can make a few comments about how you're seeing things there.\n\nKaren S. Carter\n\nCOO, Dow\n\nYes. So thanks, Jim. I mean, downstream continues to grow for us quite significantly. And if you look at even last quarter, we grew above GDP, and we expect that to continue to occur as we get into 2025. I mean, we are seeing really good downstream growth in markets like electronics, but also in home and personal care. And so on the upstream, as you indicated, we did see pretty significant capacity additions, primarily in China in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. That has slowed significantly, but we're continuing to see an overcapacity situation there. Over time, though, with the higher-than-GDP growth in market segments, we do expect it to come into balance. But we are staying squarely focused on continuing to grow those downstream applications in silicones.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYes. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Jeff, I was wondering if you'd walk through your view of non-operating sources of cash flow and uses in 2025. Specifically, I'm thinking about after-tax cash proceeds from your infrastructure deal. I think you have some pending litigation with NOVA, if I'm not mistaken, and then any cash sources or uses associated with your new restructuring announced today, as well as the strategic review of your asset base in Europe and other items that you may care to call out. Thank you.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good morning, Kevin. Yeah. If you look at our cash flow for 2025, a couple of things to consider here. If you take whatever the expectations are from an EBITDA perspective for the year, I would assume right now an approximately 70% cash conversion rate over the course of the year. We just provided a guide on the CapEx now in the range of $3 billion-$3.2 billion. So on average, midpoint there, $3.1 billion. Dividend, I would make the assumption there of $2 billion. And as we've mentioned on the call, from an infrastructure proceeds perspective, that could be anywhere from a minimum of $2.4 billion up to $3 billion during the course of the year. Our net interest expense guide is approximately $600 million on a full-year basis.\nWe are continuing to make good progress on the NOVA judgment situation there, and we should have more to say about that throughout the course of the year. So I would say, Kevin, those are the primary puts and takes as you think about the cash flow walk from the beginning of the year through the end of 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho Securities\n\nThank you. How much EBITDA is involved with the new JV with Macquarie? Your minority interest for 2024 was only $85 million. If Macquarie goes to 49%, how high does that minority interest line item go to?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nGood morning, John. I'll take that one, this is Jeff. There is no EBITDA impact because this enterprise will be consolidated as part of our normal reporting results. But the impact will be more on the non-controlling interest line once the transaction closes. And obviously, the dividend impact on the cash flow statement will be the other sizable change that you will see over time. So we'll have more guidance to share once the transaction closes, and you'll be able to quantify the potential impact of that at that particular point. And again, we expect by mid-year to have the transaction close.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Chemicals, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Good morning. Two more questions on cash flow. So Jeff, I think you talked earlier about building some inventory for your planned turnarounds in the first half, but working capital ate about half billion dollars last year when sales and COGS were down pretty meaningfully. So how much release do you think you can get on a full-year basis from working capital this year? And then the second one is that other assets and liabilities line was a -$1 billion in cash flow last year. What's in that, and does some of that come back eventually?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow",
    "content2": "Sure. So good morning, Duffy. In regards to the first question around working capital, right now for 2025, we would make the assumption of a use of cash in the $300million -$400 million range on a full-year basis. Then if we look at the other liabilities line and assets, right now we're down about $900 million year-over-year. And that's really primarily driven by some of the long-term tax payables and related tax audit reassessments that we had throughout the course of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning, guys. I'll probably just put a bow on the cash questions. There's obviously been a lot of investor focus lately around the dividend, just given the ongoing trough in your current cash generation. And Dow is obviously quite proud of maintaining an industry-leading dividend based on your earlier comments and some of the actions you're taking to free up cash. So can you maybe just lay out why Dow believes maintaining this level of dividend is sort of the best priority of cash here versus, say, using that cash for balance sheet support or even further organic growth investment?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI'll take a shot at it, and I'll ask Jeff if he wants to add anything. But north of 65% of our owners count on that dividend. And so we listen very carefully to what they want to see. And we have a lot of experience on how important the dividend is to our shareholders. And so that's why it's a top priority for us.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah. The only other thing I would add, Jim, is that we don't have any substantive debt maturities due until 2027. And the ones that we have in 2025, approximately about a half of billion dollars, we're in a good position to be able to support those debt repayments during the course of this year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to clarify if your $1 billion cost reduction target includes the European actions that you will be discussing in the middle of 2025, or would those European actions be in addition to the $1 billion?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYou'll have them in addition. I think there are some things that will probably have a little bit of overlap, but the asset discussions will be in addition to what we've just announced.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes the Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Riker for closing remarks.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within 48 hours. This concludes our call.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's meeting. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If you would like to ask a question at that time, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President, Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow's outgoing Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining is our new Investor Relations Vice President, Andrew Riker, who you may remember was a member of our IR team a few years ago. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides.\nPlease refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures.\nThe reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On slide two is our agenda for today's call. Jim will review our Q1 results and operating segment performance. Jeff will then provide an update on the macroeconomic environment and modeling guidance, as well as the results of our annual benchmarking. Jim will then provide an update on key milestones for our long-term strategy, which positions us well to deliver growth through the cycle. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning on slide three. In the Q1, Team Dow delivered sequential volume growth and margin expansion. We strategically increased operating rates to capture improving demand. We maintained pricing, and we benefited from lower feedstock and energy costs. These results reflect the strength of our advantage portfolio, including our participation in diverse end markets and our cost advantage positions around the world. Net sales were $10.8 billion, down 9% versus the year-ago period, but up 1% sequentially, driven by gains in performance materials and coatings, and industrial intermediates and infrastructure.\nVolume increased 1% year-over-year, and excluding hydrocarbons and energy, volume increased 5% with gains in all regions. This marks a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth. Sequentially, volume increased 1%, and excluding hydrocarbons and energy, was up 3%, led by gains in performance materials and coatings.\nLocal price decreased 10% year-over-year and was flat sequentially, as modest gains in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, or EMEAI, were offset by declines in Asia Pacific, the United States, and Canada. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $674 million, down $34 million year-over-year, driven by lower prices in all regions. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $115 million, reflecting gains in performance materials and coatings, and industrial intermediates and infrastructure. We delivered cash flow from operations of $460 million in the quarter, resulting in a 94% cash flow conversion on a trailing 12-month basis.\nThis reflects our focus on cash flow generation and enabled $693 million in returns to shareholders. We also advanced our long-term strategy with our higher-return, highly capital-efficient Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, where construction started earlier this month. Now, turning to our operating segment performance on slide four.\nIn the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $605 million, down $37 million compared to the year-ago period, primarily due to lower integrated margins. Local price declines were primarily driven by lower energy and feedstock costs globally. Volume decreased year-over-year, driven by declines in the hydrocarbons and energy business. This was primarily due to prioritizing higher-value downstream derivative polymer sales, as well as lighter feed slate cracking in Europe.\nSequentially, operating EBIT decreased by $59 million, as improved polyethylene integrated margins were more than offset by expected lower non-recurring licensing revenue, and higher planned maintenance activity. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $87 million compared to $123 million in the year-ago period.\nResults were driven by lower prices in both businesses, which were partly offset by three items: lower energy and feedstock costs, improved equity earnings, and volume gains in polyurethanes and construction chemicals. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $72 million, driven by improved equity earnings and lower energy and feedstock costs, primarily in EMEA. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, operating EBIT was $41 million, up $6 million compared to the year-ago period, driven by volume growth and higher operating rates.\nVolume was up year-over-year, driven by gains primarily in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased to $102 million, driven by higher seasonal volumes and overall improved demand. Now, I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and actions.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. Good morning to everyone joining our call today. Turning to our outlook on slide five, we are seeing signs of improving macroeconomic conditions in several regions, which gives us cautious optimism heading into what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. That said, we are keeping a close eye on inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. The US is benefiting from improving industrial activity with manufacturing PMI and expansionary territory every month thus far this year.\nIn fact, manufacturing production expanded at its fastest rate in 22 months in March. Average chemical railcar shi`pments were also up 4.3% year-to-date compared to last year through mid-April. While high interest rates continue to temper building and construction activity in the US, building permits were 1.5% higher in March year-over-year, while existing home sales declined 3.7% in March.\nIn Europe, consumer spending and industrial activity remain weak, with manufacturing PMI decreasing in February and March. This partly reflects ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea, which have led to higher freight costs globally. Declines in inventory levels are a promising indicator, with March at the lowest levels since July 2022. Economic activity in China continues to recover steadily, with signs of improving demand. Industrial production increased 4.5% year-over-year in March.\nAdditionally, retail sales grew 3.1% year-over-year in March, supported by consumer spending around the Lunar New Year. Nonetheless, the property sector remains weak, with new home prices continuing to decline through March. Industrial activity in other regions remains constructive. In March, India manufacturing PMI reached its highest level in more than three years at 59.1. ASEAN manufacturing PMI reached an 11-month high at 51.5. And in Mexico, industrial production increased further in February.\nNow, turning to our outlook for the Q2 on slide six. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, higher global polyethylene integrated margins, resilient demand in packaging, as well as continued strength in the export markets, are expected to drive a $150 million tailwind in the quarter. Additionally, we expect $25 million in tailwinds from our site in Bahía Blanca, Argentina, which has returned to operations following an unexpected storm in December of 2023.\nLastly, we expect a $75 million headwind due to increased planned maintenance primarily in Sabine, Texas. In the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, consumer durables demand continues to be muted. However, we expect margin expansion on improved MDI and polyols spreads in Europe. We also expect modest seasonal demand improvement in building and construction end-markets, as well as resilient demand in pharma and energy end-markets. Altogether, these represent a $25 million tailwind.\nIn addition, we expect a headwind of $25 million due to planned maintenance in Europe and the US Gulf Coast. This will be partly offset by the completion of a turnaround at a PDH unit in Q1. In the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, higher global silicone prices and seasonal demand increases in building and construction end-markets are expected to drive a $75 million tailwind in Q2. We also expect an additional $25 million tailwind from a turnaround at our silicone pillar site in the US, while our Deer Park and PDH sites will come back up following planned maintenance in Q1.\nSo, with all the puts and takes at a company level, we expect Q2 earnings to be approximately $200 million above Q1 performance. Now, moving to slide seven. As we navigate the cycle and execute on our long-term strategic actions, Dow remains committed to our culture of transparency, accountability, and benchmarking. Today, we published the results of our annual benchmarking update, once again demonstrating our strong performance and value creation relative to our peers. The results can be found on our investor website.\nDow came in well ahead of peer average and broader S&P 500, with continued attractive three-year average free cash flow and dividend yields. This reflects our commitment to industry-leading cash generation and shareholder remuneration across the economic cycle. Our three-year EBITDA margins and return on invested capital are above the peer median, with return on invested capital 200 basis points above our 13% target across the economic cycle. We also delivered best-in-class net debt reduction since 2019, which allows us to deliver on our capital allocation priorities even at the bottom of the cycle.\nOur achievements in these areas point to our continued discipline and financial flexibility. As a result, Team Dow has set the stage for us to drive earnings growth and increase shareholder returns through the cycle. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jeff. Moving to slide eight, Dow is well positioned to capture demand and drive earnings growth as the economic recovery takes hold. This is reflected in our competitive advantages and early cycle growth investments, which are advancing while also demonstrating Dow's continued focus on operational and financial discipline. We have a differentiated portfolio with structurally advantaged assets, global scale, and low-cost positions in every region.\nHealthy oil to gas spreads, supported by growing natural gas and NGL production in North America, favor our cost advantage and ability to capture continued margin improvements as the economic recovery gathers strength. We've also taken actions to grow Dow's earnings as we execute our near-term, higher-value, lower-risk growth investments that are expected to deliver approximately $2 billion in incremental underlying EBITDA by mid-decade.\nSince 2021, we have added capacity that will increase our mid-cycle EBITDA by approximately $800 million, including investments in our FCDh unit in Louisiana and our consolidation capacity investments in the United States and Europe that serve attractive market segments such as consumer non-durables and pharma. In addition, we have invested in multiple downstream silicone bottlenecks to address fast-growing applications in mobility science and electronics.\nWe are on track to achieve the remaining $1.2 billion of our near-term EBITDA target by mid-decade, enabled by our lower-risk and higher-return growth projects. These investments represent a significant portion of Dow's earnings growth in the next upcycle. Moving to slide nine, Dow continues to execute with financial and operational discipline as we invest through the bottom of the chemical industry's economic cycle for long-term profitable growth.\nOur near-term growth and efficiency investments continue to progress, with our propylene glycol expansion in Thailand achieving mechanical completion this month. We are also making good progress on our decarbonizing growth strategy, including our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Construction began earlier this month, where we are installing the first of approximately 4,000 piles that will anchor the foundation of our new net-zero cracker.\nIn addition, all long lead-time equipment items have been ordered, further demonstrating our consistent focus on locking in cost efficiencies for this project. We also entered into a long-term agreement with Pembina, a leading ethane supply and transportation provider, to supply and transport up to 50,000 barrels per day of ethane. With this latest agreement, we have secured the majority of our cost-advantaged ethane supply with multiple suppliers in the region.\nOverall, we expect the Path2Zero project to deliver an additional $1 billion per year in mid-cycle EBITDA growth at full run rates over the economic cycle. In addition, we continue to advance circularity through our Transform the Waste strategy via strategic partnerships and offtake agreements. This includes a recent joint development agreement with Procter & Gamble, which will create a new recycling technology aimed at converting hard-to-recycle plastic packaging into recycled polyethylene.\nThe result will be near virgin quality and lower greenhouse gas emissions than virgin polyethylene. All in, we expect our Transform the Waste initiatives to generate more than $500 million of incremental run rate EBITDA by 2030. Turning to slide 10, our actions since 2019 have created a stronger Dow.\nOver the past five years, we have worked hard to improve our balance sheet, to improve cash flow conversion, and to build a more resilient company that maintains consistent discipline. This was demonstrated when we delivered $12.4 billion in peak EBITDA in 2021, higher than any other timeframe in Dow's history. This has created the opportunity for us to invest strategically at the bottom of the cycle for long-term profitable growth.\nAnd as implementation of our growth strategy increases our underlying EBITDA, we will continue to target at least 65% of operating net income to shareholders as we move up the next peak. This means at least 45% in dividends and 20% in share buybacks. Closing on slide 11, I want to thank you for your interest and ownership in Dow.\nThe team and I look forward to engaging with many of you at our 2024 Investor Day on 16 May 2024. As a reminder, the event will be hosted from the New York Stock Exchange. It will also be available via live webcast. More information can be found on our website at investors.dow.com. During the event, we will share progress on Dow's commitment to improve underlying earnings by greater than $3 billion by 2030 that will enable raising the mid-cycle as well as the trough and peak earnings levels.\nWe'll demonstrate our consistent commitment to operational and financial discipline, our capital allocation priorities, and our leadership in attractive market verticals. We'll show how, taken together, this creates significant value creation as we grow earnings and enhance shareholder returns over the cycle.\nBefore I turn it over to Pankaj, he mentioned at the top of the call that we have our incoming Vice President of Investor Relations, Andrew Riker, joining us today. I'd like to take a minute to congratulate Andrew as he takes charge and to thank Pankaj for leading the investor relations team over the last three years and also for his contributions to our upcoming Investor Day. Pankaj, we look forward to seeing your achievements in your next role leading our Dow Industrial Solutions business. With that, Pankaj, please get us started with the Q&A.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw that question, again, press star one. We also ask that you limit yourself to a single question. Your first question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed at Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\n\nHassan Ahmed\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Alembic Global\n\nMorning, Jim. Jim, a quick question around global ethylene and polyethylene supply-demand fundamentals. On the surface, as I sort of take a look at global utilization rates, they seem relatively slack. But then, as one sort of thinks through marginal producer economics, I mean, they seem pretty weak right now. And we're obviously hearing more and more announcements of capacity closures out in Europe. So how do you see utilization rates pan out in 2024 and beyond?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Hassan. Good question. I would say, obviously, there are differences around the globe depending on the cost positions. We have a footprint that is very highly advantaged in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. Europe is right now where you've seen most of the focus on supply reductions with a couple of announcements of crackers being shut down. I'd also say, China, there's a lot of pressure on operating rates there because the cash margins are negative and have been negative for some time.\nThere's a big arbitrage window open between the United States and China. So all of those things have really led to much higher operating rates in the cost-advantaged region. And even in Europe, where we had LPG cracking flexibility in the Q1, and propane was still a little bit high in Q1, but that advantage led to higher operating rates for us in Europe. Our overall operating rates jumped about 10 percentage points in Europe in the Q1.\nSo I think if you've got a cost-advantaged position, things are looking pretty good. Europe is a little bit islanded off right now because of the tensions in the Middle East and the Red Sea effect from shipping. And so it's relying on its domestic production for the market growth. And there has been some volume growth there. And the Middle East then has been focused more on the Asian demand. So I feel good about it. Most of the new capacity is in the market already. And we're seeing volume growth, second consecutive quarter of volume growth.\nWe're starting to see year-over-year volume growth numbers. It feels like we're starting to turn a corner a little bit.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Jim, last quarter, you gave a bit of an earnings walk up to about $6.4 to $6.5 billion of EBITDA this year. Do you still believe that number is achievable, if not beatable, given the solid Q1 results? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, David. I think with the Q1 results and the $200 million that Jeff mentioned on the call, we're right on track. I would add that as you go into Q3, know that we'll have another $100 million from the restart of Glycol 2 and Plaquemine. So $100 million Q3, $100 million Q4 kind of numbers. So you're starting to see that run rate and that trend rate right in line with what we need to deliver that 6.4. And then I would say the underlying chemical demand, I talked about last quarter, it felt like destocking had slowed. Inventory levels for us in December were lowest they've ever been. They continue to be low at the end of Q1. And chemical production, and chemical shipments are up.\nAnd so when you look at those numbers, you say this volume growth right now feels like it's demand-driven, not restocking-driven. And so I think as we start to move up this thing, hopefully, the economy keeps with us here and we start to see us pick up some momentum on this trend.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. If I could just ask in the PSP guidance for Q2 and that step up, the $150 million, could you just walk us around the world and tell us sort of how you're bridging that $150?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good morning, Vincent. Thank you. It's mostly a step up in integrated margins. I think we're looking at about $0.03 a pound globally in integrated margin increase. North America, Europe may be a little bit more than three. The rest of the world is pretty flat. We've got obviously kind of a one-time improvement. We had the Bahía Blanca down, as mentioned, in Q1 for part of Q1 to the beginning of it because of the storm they had in December. But it's back.\nAnd so you'll see a $25 million improvement there. So those two positives are $175 million. We have higher turnaround costs in the quarter. We're doing the turnaround at Sabine this quarter. That's about $75 million. So net-net, you've got about $100 million up in P&SP for the Q2. And the volume numbers are good. The margin numbers are good.\nExports are good out of the US Gulf Coast. Product is flowing. Operating rates are good. So we're starting to see the positive impacts of all those things.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nThank you. And let me also echo my congratulations to Pankaj. Best wishes in industrial solutions. Jim, I was wondering if you could talk about operating rates across the Dow portfolio in general. How has that? That appears to be one of the positives in the quarter. If you could offer some commentary on your expectations for the Dow engine in Q2 and beyond on the operating rate front.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nSure. Yeah. Happy to do that, Frank. I'd say globally, at a high level, we were at about 76%, which is up quarter-over-quarter. It's higher demand, obviously, drove that. Lower energy costs in Europe were a big driver of that as well. The United States, Gulf Coast, Argentina, and Canada have been running at well north of 80%, some as high as 90% kind of rates. Europe saw the biggest individual step up, as I mentioned previously, but all regions saw a step up in rates. So I'm optimistic that that's just a sign of underlying demand coming.\nYou probably think I think I mentioned about 10 percentage points up. That's a good ballpark for the whole global number, with North America and Latin America continuing to be strong and high rates, and Europe being a big part of that step up.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYes. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the hydrogen-fueled cracker you're building in Alberta. And then you also have the investments with the Mura Pyrolysis feedstock. For those investments, how would you expect the unit costs of those downstream crackers to compare to, say, Texas-9 on a unit cost? And to drive the return on those projects, do you have sales agreements for the product at a premium price?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Steve. On the hydrogen-fueled cracker, we recover part of the higher unit cost there through the price on carbon. And the team is working on as well, trying to get the premium pricing for that offtake. And I would say our view on that is that it will be there. There's a strong demand for low-carbon emission products, ethylene-based materials. And so we're working on that right now. But the returns on that project are going to be equal or greater than Texas-9 all in. And so when you take a look at it, we are very optimistic about where we're going to be with that project.\nAnd Texas-9 was one of the projects that obviously led us to be able to deliver the $12.4 billion in peak earnings in that 2021, 2022 timeframe. So I feel good about that. Again, remember, because of the scale and because of the fact that we get the hydrogen and methane as byproducts off the back of the cracker, the incremental cost is coming through the autothermal reformer, which part of that's recovered through the price on carbon. And then we have long-term ITCs, investment tax credits from Canada for that low-carbon investment.\nThose two things will make it very competitive with Texas-9. On Mura, Mura will be focused primarily on looking at the recycled demand, of which the supply for recycled polyethylene right now is much shorter than the demand. And so there are premiums in the market today for those materials. And the Mura process, in our view, is one of the more highly profitable ones because it uses supercritical steam to change the product back into a monomer state. So we feel good about the startup of that project.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could share some thoughts on free cash flow for 2024, since you kind of reiterated your expectations there on EBITDA. How do you see that tracking? And any update you can provide on any of the non-operating items that you thought could bridge free cash flow for this year as well? Thanks.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nJeff, do you want to walk through what you think the free cash flow outlook is for the year? And I would just say, Josh, the one thing we have to remember is we're turning the corner here. December was the low point from a pricing standpoint. And we've seen successive improvements January, February, and March. So we go from a use of cash, a source of cash in the Q4 to a use of cash in the Q1. But as we make that turn and earnings improve, we'll start generating the free cash flow out of higher earnings.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah. Well said, Jim. And good morning, Josh. Building on Jim's statement there, the other thing I would mention is that we've also started to see, as the volumes have been improving, we're seeing sales ramp up. And we saw the sales ramp up throughout the quarter. So our receivables are also ramping up as well from a working capital standpoint. We're also going into a heavy turnaround period as well, which we anticipated. So all of this is in line with our expectations and our projections, especially for the first half of the year, in terms of the working capital uses of cash that we would expect and have.\nBut as Jim mentioned, as we go into the second half of the year, continue to see the volume growth and the volume ramp up in the sales leading to earnings growth that will get us into a really good position as we think about our cash flow on a full-year basis. And we'll continue to have what we like to call unique-to-Dow cash levers. If you look over the past several years, we have had anywhere from $1 billion to almost $3 billion on an annual basis of cash levers that we've identified and executed on.\nAnd you can expect that to be very similar in 2024 as we work on our NOVA judgment, which we've talked about in the past. We continue to evaluate a number of our non-product producing assets that we have across our portfolio as well. We're going to continue to focus on structural working capital improvements that we can make while also looking at opportunities to get cash out of our joint ventures.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, guys. Nice quarter. Congrats to Pankaj again. In terms of Q2 volumes, will hydrocarbons energy be a headwind again? I guess how much? I'm just curious on sort of the core volume growth for P&SP. Then just quickly curious on siloxanes, why you think there could be improvement in Q2 versus Q1? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nSure. I think on hydrocarbons and energy, I would say as we went into Q1, because we had obviously Bahía Blanca had been impacted by the storm and because we had the arbitrage, obviously, to China and wanted to move more product, we elected not to move materials into the broader market and just focus on higher operating rates. So sometimes byproduct sales are not as high off the crackers, especially if we're cracking light like we were in Europe and in North America.\nAnd so that leads to less volume of byproducts to sell. And sometimes it's running the derivatives harder. As I mentioned, volume was up 5% on derivatives in Q1. And that was just we were moving that ethylene through the derivatives and making more product. I expect that will continue. So we might see hydrocarbons and energy be a little bit less.\nBut I think you're going to see improved margins on those volumes. And the team's working hard to continue to deliver on the volume growth numbers. We had a very good Q1 result. We've got strong volume as part of that Q2 number, plus the higher integrated margins. So siloxanes price in China has moved up. And demand for the downstream products is good, especially when you think about things like electronics, even continuing into automotive.\nHybrids and EVs both drive good demand. Data centers, chips, thermal management for silicon is big. So the only thing that's a little bit slow is on the construction side. And so you've got higher operating rates in China. You've got better siloxanes pricing. We've got personal care markets that are moving into positive territory.\nI would say before we even see a big step up in building and construction, those are already starting to improve.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. In your Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure forecast, you have sales going up sequentially 1% or 2%, and you've got your EBITDA flat sequentially. And normally, there's seasonal strength in the various construction markets. Why is your forecast so conservative? And then secondly, for Jeff, how many shares will be issued? Or what's the amount of options and shares issued that will affect the share count in 2024?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good morning, Jeff. I think the biggest thing when you look from Q1 to Q2 on II&I is because of the Glycol 2 situation in Plaquemine, we had some insurance recoveries in the Q1 that don't recur in the Q2. So that creates what looks like a bit of a headwind. I think the underlying business is good, and the underlying demand is good. If you look at polyurethanes and construction chemicals, obviously, we've seen a step up in Europe and in operating rates.\nSadara is also doing more of the marketing of some of those materials. And so we see a little bit less volume coming through Sadara from Dow marketing, the Sadara offtake. So that has a little bit of an impact. But I would say our view is we're still seeing construction slightly better.\nWe're seeing, obviously, Europe, a much better cost position, and that's driving the improved operating rates. Just that insurance delta is probably the biggest thing. Jeff.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nGood morning, Jeff. In terms of the issuance for the full year, and this captures options, deferred stock, 401(k) plan, as well as employee stock purchase plans, we're looking at approximately 11 million shares on a full-year basis.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you and good morning. Jim, I'd like to ask you about your thoughts on the likely pace of capacity rationalization across the global ethylene chain. You mentioned the cash negative margins in China today. Obviously, we've seen some of your competitors announce rationalizations in Europe in recent weeks. So my question would be, relative to prior cycles, do you think we're likely to see more supply come out of the equation this cycle based on a combination of the current energy regime in Europe and obviously a powerful drive to decarbonize?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good morning, Kevin. Always hard to predict exactly the pace that things are happening. But we've been under pressure on the high-cost assets, have been under pressure from a cash cost standpoint for some time. So it's normal around this time you would start to see retirement. The thing that we should consider when we're looking at our assets likely to be retired, the age of the asset, and the older the asset in general, you get a couple of things. Its unit costs are not as competitive. Its maintenance costs start to ramp up.\nAnd so you have to question putting in big maintenance dollars on top of that asset. And then depending on the environment you're in, CO2 and the emissions off of those assets. And what does that do to you longer term? Because there is a cost in Europe, obviously, for CO2.\nAnd if you're not going to abate that, then you have to take long-term decisions about that. So I think that's why Europe has seen the first moves. And obviously, as we've talked about before, there are a lot of policies in Europe that are continuing to drive costs up. So we've seen it not just in petrochemicals, but we see it in steel. We see it in other energy-intensive industries.\nI think we've been fortunate that we are advantaged in Europe because of our ability to crack LPGs. And that's helped us tremendously. In China, some of those assets are newer. And a lot of state-owned enterprises there. So it may not be the pace that you would see the changes in Europe. But we just have to keep an eye on that.\nI think nobody wants to run when you're bleeding the kind of cash that we're talking about between $100 and 200 dollars a ton. That's pretty ugly territory. So I think you'll continue to see some changes.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Estok\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, Jefferies\n\nHey. Good morning. This is Kevin Estok for Laurence. Just to touch back on silicone trends, I was just wondering if you guys had seen any visibility into restocking in Europe and whether you'd seen maybe any green shoots in construction globally. Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. I haven't seen big signs of restocking in Europe. I would say on construction trends, we are starting to see some positive things happening. When you take a look at existing home sales, even though some of the year-over-year trends are down, we're starting to see some marginal improvements. Building permits are starting to tick up, which is good.\nSo new homes, there's a need for new homes in North America for sure. And so you're going to start to see that demand. And what the team says to me is that when we start to see interest rate declines, see a couple of interest rate declines in a row, you tend to start to see a pretty immediate uptick in the downstream demand for products that are in our polyurethane business, our silicone business, and our coatings business. So we're watching closely for that.\nI feel like this is more underlying demand-driven. Some of the markets I talked about earlier, electronics, data centers, automotive, anything that has to deal with energy and thermal management, those have been strong. Personal care is strong. Fair amount goes into infrastructure. Infrastructure is obviously still good. So as soon as we see some pickup in the housing, I think we're going to start to see another step change.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. Good morning. Just a question around your coatings and monomers business. You had volumes up. But when you look at a lot of your big competitors or not competitors, customers who have announced already, PPG, Sherwin, AXA, their revenue is all down in Q1. What's your sense for what's happening in the coatings market this year? Are you guys overshipping, do you think, in Q1 for where the demand level for paints will be this year? And then just how do you see pricing trending in that business for you guys?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good morning, Duffy. I don't think there's any overshipping or stocking going on there. I think obviously some customers are more exposed to the contractor business, and that's very much driven by new homes and new construction. Then there's the DIY segment. We're pretty heavily impacted by the DIY segment, so painting existing homes or when existing homes are sold. We tend to see that volume tends to help us. I think obviously we had a very strong Q4. We had some turnaround activity in Q1 and still had pretty good numbers.\nI think we're well positioned for the peak of the season in Q2, Q3. Also some of the monomers demand from time to time can be an added positive on that. It doesn't all necessarily mean it's downstream coating. Some of the monomers going into other markets can help us out a little bit too.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nCongrats as well to both Pankaj and Andrew on the new roles. Jim, there are some reports about European warehouses and ports being jammed again with your customers' products. Do you think their supply chain inventory building again downstream in Europe?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nAny particular products, John, that you're thinking of?\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nI'm just the economic magazines are talking about because of the Red Sea issues. Just a lot of safety stock, I guess, being built up again across some supply chains.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI see. I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it in plastics for sure. I don't know if we've seen any of that in polyurethanes or construction chemicals. Our days of inventory are low. I mean, we're at 41 days of sales and inventory, which is a day better than we were in Q4. So I'm certainly not seeing it in our case. And we're pretty focused in Europe on the domestic market. We don't rely on Europe as an export hub. So I think that's to our advantage there. The Red Sea, I believe, is going to be the way it is for the next, for the rest of the year, probably.\nI mean, if things were resolved today, I think it would take about six months for the shipping channels to move back around. So we'll just have to keep an eye on it. It hasn't had an impact on us so far. And we're not exporting out of there. And we're still expecting good operating rates in Q2.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi. Good morning. You call it increased demand in functional polymers for the first time in a few quarters. Can you speak to some of the specific areas of strength or products for which you're seeing increased demand? And you've also called it out as the source of some higher turn, high EBITDA contribution, incremental growth projects. How meaningful is that benefit in 2024?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. Functional polymers is going to primarily be driven by infrastructure markets. You think wiring cable is big. Automotive is big. Golf balls is a big part of it. Footwear sales are improved. So all those areas are very robust. I'd say the power demand, electric, you hear about it, AI data centers. But just beyond that, the energy transition, electric grids, installations of new, it could be wind, it could be offshore wind, it could be a solar farm, it could be a telecom center, it could be a data center, it could be replacement of wiring in an existing grid.\nAll of that takes the products that we sell. And we're the market leader in wiring cable jacketing. So that's been big. And then I think we're kind of set up for year-over-year improvements on footwear, which was a little bit slow last year.\nInfrastructure also would include things tied to, imagine, membranes for lining water basins, water treatment basins, and membranes for roofing replacement. We do a lot of membranes into cool roofing for building efficiencies. So when you put a new flat roof on a building, you'll see a lot of these very white, light-colored roofs. We work with our customers who make that material and install those.\nThere's a high demand for that, and that's continued. Commercial building and retrofits of anything from an energy efficiency standpoint still continues to be high. Solar PV, I should mention. We've got a big new piece of business for solar PV encapsulation. We put on some of the outer layers that protect the solar panels. This is a product that is very durable and long-lasting, and it's really picked up over the last couple of years. So those would be the big drivers.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. So Jim, there's been a lot of back and forth in the buy-side and sell-side communities about the $0.03 increase for April and then obviously some preliminary ideas for May. Just where we stand right here right now, given the US macro, given where you anticipate USGC operating rates to be on a sequential basis, what's Dow's view of this? We all know what the consultant's view is. But what's your view in terms of how things play out during Q2 and how that ultimately sets the tone for second half? Thank you so much.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nWe're moving up in Q2. I would say it almost moved up that $0.03 at the end of Q1. The numbers have continued. The macroeconomic indicators have continued to get stronger, not weaker. So I think with the volume that we're seeing on the downstream derivatives with improved economic business, and the consumer still being strong, I think you're going to see it move up in Q2. So I think we're very firm on the $0.03 in April. As I mentioned, we started at the low point at the end of December. We just saw steady improvement through Q1. So I think we're off to start Q2 at a much higher rate and see some momentum as we move through that quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a follow-up to an earlier question on cash flow, maybe for Jeff. I guess if you hit your EBITDA targets for this year, are you forecasting working capital to be a use of cash or a source of cash this year and to roughly what magnitude? Thank you.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good morning, Mike. Yeah. We are actually looking at it still being a use of cash on a full-year basis as we work our way through, again, the recovery for a number of the dynamics that I mentioned earlier in relation to Josh's question here. But again, if we see the earnings improve based on the volume improvements that we're anticipating, right, we will start to turn that corner. But coming from where we're coming from on our working capital today, it will be a use of cash on a full-year basis.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from RBC Capital, sorry, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHi, [iaudible]. Good morning, everyone. I want to come back to silicones. Was the improvement that you saw more on the upstream silicone side or downstream? And as a follow-up, where are your downstream silicones' margins relative to your mid-cycle expectations? And therefore, what's the sort of optionality for downstream silicones' improvement?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nGood morning, Aleksey. It's from both. We saw better demand on siloxanes and better pricing. We saw better downstream. We saw improvements in building and infrastructure, which were primarily seasonality-driven. We saw gains in personal care. We saw gains in industrial and chemical processing, where some of the products are used as intermediates. We saw gains in mobility.\nWe saw gains in consumer electronics. All the downstream markets were up. The siloxanes' demand was up. The operating rates were up. The pricing on siloxanes were up. It was pretty balanced on both sides.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you guys are well. And good working with you, Pankaj, as well. And so I guess my question is, you're on a run right now, say, $63, 64, 65 billion of annual EBITDA. Do you still think maybe mid-cycle level is around $8 billion? And if that is the case, how do you bridge kind of going from $6.5 to 8 billion? That $1.5 billion, are there any discrete items maybe that you'd call out as far as capacity additions, or is it mainly going to be volume recovery-based? Thanks.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good morning, Arun. I think you're right on top of the run rate. So no comments there. Yeah. I do think mid-cycle—I mean, our view of mid-cycle is probably closer to nine. And so to get to that mid-cycle run rate, obviously, we have to have another couple of step-ups to get there. Volume is a big part of it. So as I mentioned, all the projects on the call, some that we've already put in place that equal $800 million of the step-up. And the rest that we're in flight right now, that's another $1.2 billion of step-up. So that $2 billion of improved margins is all volume.\nAnd most of that CapEx has either been spent or will be finished this year and beginning of next year. So I feel good about that. Obviously, the Path2Zero in Alberta comes later. So I think you see that billion more towards as we're getting to the next peak. That's a 27 to 29 timeframe where that's coming in. 27 is phase one. 29 is phase two. And so if we've got our timing right—and that's what we intended—was we got that up and running before we get into the next peak.\nAnd so I think we've got the line of sight to the volume that's going to come from here to mid-cycle. When we get to investor day on 16 May, we're going to unpack all that volume and that trajectory. And then we've got the line of sight then to the stuff that gets us greater than 3 billion by 2030, which is next peak-type economics. And from where we are, that's excellent growth rates for both of them. I feel like we've been through the worst of it here on the slowdown in the cycle. It should be more upside than downside from here out.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Pankaj Gupta for closing remarks.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, Krista. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within 48 hours. This concludes our call.

My name is Krista, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Dow Inc. 2024 Earnings Report. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. And if you'd like to withdraw that question, again, press star one. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Riker. Andrew, the floor is yours.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Andrew Riker, Dow's Investor Relations Vice President. Leading today's call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statements contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risk and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website.\nOn slide two is our agenda for today's call. Jim will review our Q2 results and operating segment performance. Jeff will then share an update on the macroeconomic environment and modeling guidance, followed by a discussion on how our proven playbook will advance our near-term priorities and support growth. Jim will then provide more color on key milestones for our long-term strategy, including how we will capture earnings upside as macroeconomic conditions improve. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Andrew. Beginning on slide three, in Q2, Team Dow delivered sequential top and bottom line growth, as well as a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth. We achieved this despite a slower-than-expected global macroeconomic recovery, particularly in areas like building and construction and consumer durables. Net sales were $10.9 billion, down 4% versus the year-ago period, and up 1% sequentially, driven by gains in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, and Performance Materials and Coatings. Volume increased 1% versus the year-ago period, with gains led by the United States and Canada. Excluding hydrocarbons and energy sales, which were down primarily due to lighter feedstock cracking in Europe, volume increased 4%.\nSequentially, volume increased 1% with gains in all regions except Asia-Pacific, which was flat. Local pricing decreased 4% year-over-year. Sequentially, local price increased 1%, led by gains in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, or EMEA. Operating EBIT was $819 million, up $145 million sequentially, reflecting gains in packaging and specialty plastics and performance materials and coatings. Cash flow from operations was $832 million on higher earnings and an efficient release of working capital, resulting in an 85% cash flow conversion on a trailing 12-month basis. Our focus on cash flow generation enabled $691 million in returns to shareholders, including $491 million through dividends and $200 million in share repurchases. In June, we published our 2023 Intersections Progress Report.\nThis report showcases the positive impact that we are making on the environment and society, and importantly, how those actions support long-term profitable growth. Now, turning to our operating segment performance on slide four. In the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $703 million, down $215 million year-over-year. This was driven by lower integrated margins, higher planned maintenance activity, and lower non-recurring licensing sales. Local price declines were due to lower downstream polymer prices, primarily in Asia-Pacific. Volume decreased year-over-year as higher demand for functional polymers and polyethylene was more than offset by lower merchant hydrocarbon sales, primarily due to lighter feed slate cracking in Europe.\nSequentially, operating EBIT increased by $98 million, primarily due to higher integrated margins behind both price and volume gains. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $7 million, an improvement of $42 million versus the year-ago period. Results were driven by improved equity earnings, partly offset by lower integrated margins. Local prices declined year-over-year, but volume was up, driven by gains in polyurethane and construction chemicals.\nSequentially, operating EBIT decreased $80 million, driven by higher planned maintenance activity, higher equity losses, and lower volumes. In the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, operating EBIT was $146 million, up $80 million compared to the year-ago period, driven by broad-based business and geographic volume growth. Local price declined year-over-year, but volume was up, driven by gains in both businesses and all geographic regions. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $105 million, driven by volume and price gains in both businesses and lower planned maintenance activity.\nNow, I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and share some examples of our playbook in action.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. And good morning to everyone joining our call today. Moving to slide five. In the near term, we expect macro dynamics to remain largely unchanged. While global manufacturing PMI has been positive since February 2024, the pace of the global economic recovery has decelerated slightly. This is primarily led by China, where economic growth in the Q2 was lower than the market expected. Overall, we continue to keep a close eye on the weight of inflation on the US consumer, global interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Looking across our four market verticals, packaging demand is seeing global growth, primarily in the US and Canada as the industry experiences robust domestic and export demand for polyethylene.\nIn Europe, soft demand across the value chain is reflected in manufacturing PMI levels, which, despite stabilizing, remains in contractionary territory. In Asia, packaging demand has remained steady, but the region has been impacted by port congestion and rising transportation costs. Infrastructure demand, primarily residential construction, continues to be soft across most regions. In June, existing US home sales, which tend to drive residential paint sales from both buyers and sellers, were below prior year levels. Building permits were down slightly year-to-date through June. Eurozone construction PMI remains in contractionary territory and declined to 41.8 last month, down from 42.9 in May.\nIn China, new home prices were down 4.5% year-over-year in June. Consumer spending has shown resilience in most regions, except Europe, where consumer confidence remained negative in July. In the US, retail sales are up 2.3% year-to-date through June, but furniture and bedding sales remain low. In China, retail sales increased by 2% year-over-year in June, but marked the first month of deceleration since July 2023.\nIn mobility, China auto production was down 2.1% year-over-year in June, amidst the potential for tariff increases and slow-to-materialize incentives. In the US, auto sales were down year-over-year in June after increasing by more than 2% in May. Against this backdrop, we delivered the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth and will continue to leverage our differentiated portfolio to capitalize on areas of demand strength while maintaining operating and financial discipline. I'll touch on these actions in more detail shortly. Now, turning to our outlook on slide six.\nWe expect Q3 earnings to be slightly above Q2 performance, continuing our string of sequential improvements. We experienced minimal disruption from Hurricane Beryl in the US Gulf Coast, and we expect the positive sequential signals in some markets will continue. In the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, we expect modest top-line sequential growth.\nDomestic and export demand for polyethylene in North America will remain robust, and EMEA will experience typical lower demand seasonality from the summer holidays. In addition, the completion of our cracker turnaround in Sabine, Texas, in Q2 will be offset by another planned turnaround at our St. Charles, Louisiana cracker in Q3. In the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, market conditions remain mixed. Demand in energy and pharma end markets remains resilient, but consumer durables demand has not shown any significant signs of inflection.\nWe expect an approximately $25 million headwind due to the planned maintenance activity in the US Gulf Coast. Importantly, at the end of June, we successfully started up our Glycol II facility at Louisiana operations, which will ramp through the quarter and provide a sequential tailwind of $75 million.\nIn the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, we continue to see growth in downstream silicone applications across most end markets, but the siloxane prices are still under pressure. Lower seasonal demand for building and construction end markets is expected to be a headwind of approximately $50 million, while lower planned maintenance activity will contribute a $25 million tailwind. Moving to slide seven. As we navigate the current market conditions, we are focused on executing our proven playbook to deliver increased value over the cycle.\nWe benefit from our global asset footprint with leading positions in every region. This is particularly true in the cost-advantaged Americas, where approximately 65% of our global production capacity is located, and we expect to reach 70% by 2030. With leading low-cost feedstock positions, plus our industry-leading feedstock flexibility, Dow is well-positioned to capture growing global demand for our products.\nSupported by our solid financial position, we remain on track to deliver our countercyclical growth investments. Team Dow continues to operate with discipline as we maintain our low-cost-to-serve mindset, focus on maximizing cash flow, and further strengthen our financial position. Our actions include continued derisking of our pension liabilities with minimal, if any, cash outlay. In fact, this month, we initiated the termination process for two of our US pension plans by the end of 2025.\nWhile not impacting previously earned benefits, Dow is able to provide a secure, cost-effective way of paying pension benefits and reducing administrative costs, and risk to the company. Lastly, in the near term, we expect to enhance our cash flow generation by executing over $1.5 billion in unique to Dow levers. We plan to use the proceeds to support our strategic growth investment, including our Path to Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan.\nIn addition, we expect to receive more than $1.5 billion in cash and tax incentives by 2030, which is closely aligned with our CapEx deployment for the project. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jeff. Moving to slide eight. Our expectations for 2024 reflect a slower pace of recovery in certain end markets. Dow is positioned to capture more than $3 billion in EBITDA upside as we return to mid-cycle earnings levels. We are encouraged by the positive top-line signals across our portfolio. This is demonstrated by our year-over-year volume improvement in the last three quarters, as well as price stabilization across the entire enterprise over that same period. In packaging and specialty plastics, we anticipate supply-demand fundamentals to continue improving as the recent polyethylene capacity builds in North America have been fully absorbed by growing global demand.\nWe're also starting to see rationalization of higher cost assets, particularly in Europe. And going forward, we do not expect to see any new capacity in the cost-advantaged Americas until the 2026-2027 timeframe. In Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure, we've maintained a disciplined approach to our inventory management. The beginning of an interest rate cutting cycle will accelerate demand in our polyurethane business. In industrial solutions, the majority of our US Gulf Coast capacity is aligned to higher-value EO derivatives. With the successful restart of our Glycol II facility in Louisiana, we will see positive impact in consumer, mobility, pharma, and energy end markets.\nIn Performance Materials and Coatings, industry silicone capacity additions are expected to slow due to prolonged negative cash margins impacting non-integrated players. Lastly, our coatings business is highly correlated to existing home sales, with market demand forecasted to see pre-pandemic levels by next year. With these positive indicators combined with an economic recovery, Dow is positioned to capture significant annual earnings upside at mid-cycle levels.\nNext, on slide nine, the work we've done to strengthen our financial foundation has allowed us to invest countercyclically in lower-risk, higher-return projects that will drive more than $3 billion in annual earnings growth by 2030. Our near-term investments are progressing and remain on track to deliver more than $2 billion of underlying mid-cycle EBITDA by mid-decade. To date, we have added the capacity to deliver $800 million of that $2 billion. So far this year, we've enhanced our product mix to produce higher-value elastomers for photovoltaic films and ethylene copolymers at our site in Tarragona, Spain.\nWe're also advancing multiple downstream silicone debottlenecking projects to support growth for liquid silicone rubber and adhesives. Our team in Fort Saskatchewan is making solid progress on our Path to Zero project. Phase one startup is expected in 2027, and phase two will start up in 2029.\nThe project will deliver an additional $1 billion of EBITDA annually at full run rates by 2030. Construction continued in the Q2, where we started our piling program, which will anchor the foundation of our new net-zero cracker. Major foundation work is expected to begin in the Q3. We're also advancing our transform the waste strategy to deliver more than $500 million in incremental underlying EBITDA by 2030 through partnerships and direct investments. In June, we announced the Dow signed an agreement to acquire Circulus, a leading US-based mechanical recycler.\nThis will help us accelerate our goals while enabling more high-performance circular products that brands and customers are demanding. We expect the deal, which includes two facilities with combined capacity of 50,000 metric tons of recycled materials annually, to close in the Q3.\nConsistent with our best owner mindset, we also announced in Q2 that we reached an agreement with Arkema to sell our Laminated Adhesives business, which is part of the Packaging and Specialty Plastics portfolio. That transaction is expected to close by Q4 2024. Lastly, in H2 of the year, we're planning to commercialize products with greater circularity using offtake from both the Valoregen mechanical and Mura advanced recycling facilities. In closing, on slide 10, Dow remains focused on driving earnings growth by executing our playbook, delivering on our capital allocation priorities, and closely managing costs as we advance our long-term strategy.\nWe're committed to operational and financial discipline. We've delivered returns in past generations better than our peer benchmark, and we will maintain our low-cost-to-serve mindset while capturing high-value demand and optimizing margins.Our financial flexibility allows us to invest countercyclically in higher-value areas that will raise our underlying earnings and drive circularity. With all of this, Dow is well-positioned to create significant upside in top and bottom line growth as cycle dynamics improve and we unlock the full benefit of these investments, enabling higher shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Andrew to get us started with the Q&A.\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statement is provided both by prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw that question, again, press star one. Please be advised that after you answer your first question, you will be muted. Your first question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nHassan Ahmed\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Alembic Global Advisors\n\nMorning, Jim and Jeff. Jim and Jeff, you know, just a question around Q3 sequential guidance. You know, particularly as I sort of take a look at some of the commentary around P&SP, it seems that you guys are looking for relatively flat EBITDA sequentially. Obviously, I understand you guys have the St. Charles cracker sort of planned maintenance, but I'm just trying to get a better sense of what's baked into that guidance from an underlying fundamentals perspective. Meaning, obviously, you guys, you know, the industry has North American Q3 price hikes on the table. It seems inventory levels are down. It seems exports, you know, have been sort of steadily picking up. So just, you know, if you could give me a sense of, beyond your planned maintenance, what you guys have baked into those fundamentals for the Q3 guidance.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nGood morning, Hassan. Happy to walk through that. You know, as we look at the outlook for P&SP into Q3, I do expect we're going to see prices up in North America. I think we're going to see $0.02 margin improvement there. You know, you got a combination of pricing with, I think, the macro numbers, and direction is correct. We do expect, and we have in the plan, that we expect ethane to be up $0.01 or $0.02. It is not insignificant as we sit here today. But I do expect it will be. One of the reasons methane and ethane are so low is because you had facilities unaffected due to Hurricane Beryl, and that backs up volume here at the Gulf Coast. That's going to reverse itself.\nI think when that happens, our expectation is, you know, you'll see some ethane pricing move up. In Europe, we have still positive per-amp spread, but it's a little bit less than what it was in the Q2. But it's still very advantageous for us to crack propane. I mentioned cracking light. You know, we cracked light in the quarter, which led to less byproduct sales for cracker byproducts in Europe. But the derivative demand is good. If you look at derivatives volumes, across the board, they've been up. Asia was a little bit low in the Q2, mainly because Asia was pushing a lot of export volumes out, especially in China, to get ahead of some tariff barriers. That kind of caused some congestion over there. I think that's working itself out.\nI think we'll see continued strong export environment out of the US Gulf Coast. As you mentioned, inventories are low right now. Inventories are right in line with where they've been historically. Exports are very strong. So I do think the environment is there for pricing to take hold in the Q3. I expect the derivative volumes to be strong. We've got advantage cost positions, and operating rates are strong for us. So I think net turnarounds won't be any more than they were in the Q2. I think you'll see some slight improvement in the Q3.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone. Jim, we'd love to get your sort of high-level thoughts on two things that, you know, might have opposite reactions. One, you know, it does seem like we're finally going to get into a period where interest rates are going to come down, which I would expect to be broadly positive for your business, particularly your exposure to building and construction. But politically, we may be also reentering a period geopolitically with tariffs, duties, and things like that. So I'm wondering if you can compare and contrast, you know, sort of what the impact of both of those dynamics could be for Dow as we look into 2025?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nGood morning, Vincent. Happy to do that. On interest rates, you know, we had expected that by this time, we'd probably have seen two or three interest rate cuts in the year. We haven't seen the first one yet. I do think the expectation is coming. If you look at the housing market, I think you're seeing the weight right now of the higher interest rates on housing. You're seeing it on new builds. You're seeing it on, you know, inventories that are kind of stacking up out there. Part of it's because people aren't able to qualify for mortgages at these high rates. So I think when we start to see mortgage rates get something with a five handle on them, we're going to see a couple of things happen.\nWe're going to see people who have financed mortgages at these higher rates of 7+% will get some advantage to do a refinance. You're going to see people who've been sitting on the sidelines with properties they want to sell move in to start to sell them because people can get qualified for the mortgages. You're going to start to see building credits increase. In polyurethanes and construction chemicals, when that starts to happen, you get a domino effect that happens. You get both existing home sales and new builds starting to build. That drives volume. Then, of course, anytime you have that, you've got appliances, carpets, all the other campaigns, all the other things that go on with it. That tends to ratchet up pretty quickly. We haven't seen that yet. Obviously, teams are managing it closely, but we haven't seen that kick up.\nOn the geopolitics side, you know, I think, on your view on both sides on the political spectrum, you're expecting a more protectionist tone that we're hearing coming out from both sides. I would say that the big driver behind that is, in many cases where a lot of capacity has been built in China, there's enough data to suggest that they're being subsidized and those products are being flooded into other markets. We're starting to see anti-dumping cases being brought against China around the world in different areas. So I think you are going to see activities that are going to try to halt some of that from happening in concert with trying to bring manufacturing back. To date, most of the manufacturing reshoring has been into Mexico, if you think about it.\nFrom our perspective, we haven't had time to see the impact from semiconductors and other things being invested. So that'll take a few years to get to market. But I think we're going to see increased rates on a whole host of things, most of them in the 25% to 50 range. Most of that is what people believe is the amount of subsidies going into those markets today. So we're prepared for, you know, whatever case we get, depending on the outcome of the election. As always, we just have to get in there and make sure that either side understands the supply chains, how product flows, and what's important to keep industry moving, not just here, but in Europe and around the world.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director and Senior Chemical Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you. Jim, if you change your audio in some way, it would really be helpful. We're having a really hard time hearing you. I have a couple of questions regarding your slide nine. With respect to your Fort Saskatchewan project, that $1 billion EBITDA on a per-pound basis, is that comparable to what you would expect, you know, mid-cycle for your existing assets, you know, EBITDA per pound for polyethylene, or is this an expansion?\nDo you have customer commitments that give you that confidence in that, in the profitability of that, and maybe just an extension on this, that 3 million tons of transformed waste, you know, the incremental EBITDA on that per pound, I think there must be a huge range depending on the type of product there, because you have a competitor that has a similar objective and the incremental EBITDA per pound is three times this. I would assume that it's relevant to how much is mechanical versus how much is, say, pyrolysis-driven. Can you comment on where do you see the most profitable outlook in your circular plastic platform?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I'd probably address Fort Saskatchewan first. The simple answer is it's similar to mid-cycle holdings for one or two of our previous investments. There could be some delta in those just based on the product mix and storage in there. But in general, it's pretty similar to what we see today. And as I mentioned before, I think the upside there is the ability to get the additional value out of the fact that it's zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The team is working on that right now in terms of both policy and deliverables in terms of how you calculate that and how you do those assessments to depend on it. Circularity will be a combination of mechanical and chemical recycling.\nI think we still feel that, long-term, 2/3 of our volume is expected to be in this recycling, mainly because we're paying the capital flexible films. We believe, to get the high quality, which is what you need to get those margins, you're going to have to reinvent the cycle. On the chemical recycling, the circular investment is a great place to put it. We're focused on trying to move the quality of the mechanical recycling material up. Well, typically, we're not done looking at making big investments in the chemical recycling. But I think our ability with our proprietary chemistry to take the company out of circularity, move the quality of that 50,000 tons per year of waste up, allows us to get the kind of margin uplift over virgin PE that we need to deliver that $500 million.\nIt's going to be different by different markets, but it's all going to be driven by the quality of the material that we produce out of those assets. But certainly, the demand is there right now. The issue is supply and supply of high-quality new type of content.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Jim, your run rate at roughly $6 billion of EBITDA. Consensus for next year is $7.3 billion. How much of that earnings ramp is in Dow's control?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nDavid, the biggest will be what we see in terms of the durable goods market and the housing market coming back. Plastics right now, P&SP, silicones, and coatings. I think we have a pretty good line of sight, and with Glycol II coming back in Q2 and Q1, we feel good about that. The real question mark will be how quickly does polyurethane come back? That's going to be driven by what happens with interest rates and what happens in housing and construction. That's not just here. That's Europe and Asia as well.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. Maybe a couple of questions for Jeff. Your corporate expense was $30 million this quarter, and you forecast $30 million versus $60 million in the year ago. You forecast $60 million for the Q3 versus $40 million in the year ago period. Why that higher increment? Why doesn't it stay at the $30 million level? Second, you've been repurchasing shares. Dow's share price has been, you know, pretty flat since its inception as a public company. What criteria will you use to determine whether share repurchase is a good use of capital for Dow? How will you judge that?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Jeff. Appreciate the questions here. Starting on the corporate side, when we look at the Q2, you're right, it was slightly lower, more favorable than what we traditionally had. I would say as you're thinking about the second half of the year, it's going to be pretty much in the range of $60 to 65 million of -EBITDA, which we've delivered in past times. What we had in Q2 was we had actually some gains from our insurance operations as well as some lower environmental cost accruals as well. But when you think about the H2 of the year, you can expect it to be in that $60 to 65 million range. In relation to share repurchases, you're right, we have continued to trend to cover dilution. That's one of the things from a capital allocation perspective that we've been consistent with.\nAs we think about the CapEx ramp-up that we have and our commitment to deliver, you know, overall 65% more back to our shareholders, we're going to stay consistent with that at this point because of the cash flow expectations as well as our ability to be able to manage all of those capital allocation priorities. But we will look at from a criteria perspective, you know, what will give us the greatest return over that time period in comparison to the commitments that we have for our capital allocation prioritization.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. You know, in the H1, your free cash flow didn't generate a lot. Could you give us a feel of, you know, how much free cash flow you generate in the H2 and maybe for the full year?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nJeff, you want to take that?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah. Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. You know, from our perspective, first of all, when you look at the Q2, you know, we saw some really positive signs. We were able to deliver over $800 million in cash from operations. Our conversion rate was at 55%, and our free cash flow was a +$109 million. All of those are sequential improvements over what we delivered in the Q1. So we're really trending well. If we think about the full year, Mike, one of the things that we would expect is from a working capital standpoint, you can expect the use of cash anywhere from $600 to 800 million. You know, you've seen in our slide deck here, we've got some guidance on some of the other key levers related to full year cash flow.\nBut one of the areas that we're pleased about is our ability and the joint ventures to be able to get greater dividends out of that, which we're focused on moving forward, as well as our, you know, looking at our liquidity right now. We're in a really good position. We've got well over $3 billion of cash and cash equivalent and total liquidity of $13 billion. And right now, we don't have any debt maturities of substantive levels until 2027. And the other thing I'd also like to remind you of as well is the fact that, you know, over the past several years, Dow has done a solid job of being able to deliver what we like to call unique to Dow cash levers of anywhere from $1 to $3 billion.\nOur expectation is that we'll deliver at least $1.5 billion of those levers here in 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner and Equity Research Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYes, thank you. Good morning. Can you comment, as you look across your portfolio on the monthly cadence in June as well as your order books in July, were there any businesses that stood out, varied versus your prior expectations through that period? And on a related note, can you comment on the Hurricane Beryl impact in Q3 and whether you're expecting that to have a net positive, negative, or neutral impact on the quarter? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Kevin. You know, we've seen pretty solid order book at the beginning of every month. I would say as we finished the Q2, you'd see then some softness toward the end of the month. July order book looks pretty solid as we move forward. Hurricane Beryl, we ran most of Freeport through the hurricanes. All the power plants and all the crackers ran through. We obviously had damage to electrical lines, cooling towers, and things, but within a week, we were back up. So I expect it is not going to have a significant impact on volumes. There will be some cost impact to it. We're insured for it, but there's a deductible. I don't remember how much that is, Jeff?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\n50.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\n$50 million on the deductible. But barrels, Freeport's back up and running. You know, I'd say, you know, we've gotten most of the issues identified. We're fortunate, you know, no impact to our employees or no impact to people other than the normal things that impact their homes. But we jump in and help them out so that they're able to focus on what they need to do.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Senior US Chemicals Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up on Beryl. It didn't hit the way some of the major hurricanes necessarily take down lots of capacity for long periods, but it does look like a lot of assets were taken down, including your own, for, you know, at least a week or so. Can you speak to what that did to the market for you in terms of inventory levels and how you're thinking about what that might mean for pricing in the next couple of months or so?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good question, John. I think you can already see in the market that it's starting to have some impact of firming things up because it happened early in the hurricane cycle. Early August or early July is typically not when we would tend to see the first hurricanes come through. We tend to see them more in the August timeframe. I think what you're seeing is that's firming up the sentiment that there will be price increase moves. I think what you're going to see in terms of impacts are going to be different grade by grade. So depending on what derivatives are down and what grades are going to become a little bit tighter. Then you've got, you know, some planned downtime that's happening on the Q3 as well. So you've got some planned outages for Q3.\nI'd say we're back up and running hard, trying to catch up to those volumes and get customers' stock back up at this point. There is a little bit of concern starting to come through the market from customers about being ready for the next impact. Hats off to our team for moving product out in rail cars and other areas ahead of it, you know, so we were able to get things positioned to be able to react so that we could keep product moving to customers. We always do a good job of preparing for that and doing things in advance.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could give some early thoughts on Q4. So, you know, a couple of quarters ago, you thought that there'd be some maybe unseasonal improvement as volumes improve. As we sit today, would you think about a normal seasonal in Q4, call it down $100 to 200 million in EBITDA sequentially, or are there other factors you'd call out that would buck that trend? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nWell, I think plastics is going to continue to see solid volumes, and we've got cost advantage. So I think you're going to continue to see plastics deliver through Q4. Silicones is positive. You could see the impact on volumes in the derivatives part. And because we're fully integrated, you know, we have an advantage there. So silicones, I would think, is going to hold up well. II and I is going to improve because we've got Glycol-2 back. We've got $75 million of tailwind in Q3. I think that'll ramp to closer to $90 million for Q4 and get up to the $100 million, which is kind of full run rate by Q1. And so that's good. I think the coatings had a really solid Q2.\nYou know, even though I talked earlier about housing and some of the issues in housing, our volumes were very solid there. I think what's working in housing right now is obviously higher value homes. Some of the big homebuilders you can see are actually delivering pretty good numbers. That tends to go through the contract side of the business. So the contract painters are doing better than, say, the do-it-yourself business that you would see. That's a big chunk of the market, and that's moving positively. And we're benefiting from that, and we're also getting some share gains there. So I think Q3 will continue to be good for coatings, maybe a little bit less than Q2. Q4 is typically low season for coatings anyway.\nThat's when we start to get ourselves prepared with maintenance and other activities so we're ready to run into next year's season. But on those businesses, I would expect you're going to continue to see strength on polyurethanes and construction chemicals. Volumes are improving. You even saw that even with some limitations that we had from turnaround downtime in the quarter. You saw volumes improving. Inventories are well under control. So I think if there are interest rate cuts that happen this quarter and next quarter, you're going to see some positive impact there. And then it'll be a question of how much of that will flow to the bottom line.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Co-Founder, Fermium Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. Happy to hear that the sound quality on the answers has gotten materially better. I believe the first answer that you gave concerned polyethylene, and that came through fairly garbled. I was just wondering, Jim, since you were very accurate in forecasting the April price increase, obviously June didn't go through, but I'm curious as to what your thoughts are with respect to July and the Q3 in general in terms of polyethylene pricing and margins.\nThen also on the glycol II restart, there was an expectation that it would add about $100 million in the Q3 and $100 million in the Q4. You're indicating today that it's $75 million in the Q3, which makes sense as it ramps up. You know, would you anticipate that $100 million coming through in the Q4? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Frank. Thanks. They brought me another microphone here, so I'm sorry if the first question wasn't answered or understood well. On pricing, we've got prices out around the world, everywhere except Argentina for July. In August in North America, we've got +5 and +5 out in the market. That is going to, you're going to see price stick in the quarter. So price is going to come through. Now, the question is how much of all that comes through. I think what we've put into the estimate is we've put in that we're going to see two cents per pound margin improvement. So net of price and as I mentioned, I think ethane costs will come up through the quarter. I think it'll come up a penny or two through the quarter if you look quarter-over-quarter.\nSo I think net of that ethane cost increase, you're going to see a $0.02 per lb margin increase in North America. I'd say volume on derivatives around the world supports that. Inventory levels support that. I think, you know, there's the outside things that we can't predict, like, will we have more hurricane activity? But inventories in the chain are low. So I would expect that it's going to go through. When it comes to glycol, the startup was smooth and as expected on Glycol-2. Obviously, we've got to, you know, get through the product mix, and we've got to get some safety stocks built back up. That's part of the ramp-up that happens from $75 to 90 to 100 million. Could it ramp up more than $90 million in Q4? I guess it could.\nI mean, usually year-end, there's a little bit of seasonal slowness. So our expectation is it would probably ramp more into Q1, which is when we tend to get, you know, into some higher volumes across some of the markets. But that's what we've got in the estimate right now.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. I just wanted to follow up on your discussion around, you know, potential tariff structures and how they might evolve. How do you think the response function in the industry with your customers has shifted? That is, if there is movement towards new tariffs, how significant a restock cycle do you see that triggering in advance?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI don't think anything has started yet, Lawrence, on people, you know, doing stocking in advance of tariffs. I, you know, I think primarily because there's all the uncertainty around the election and what policies are going to actually stick. I think on the same, by the same token, I think there's a little bit of view that China doesn't know what it's going to do yet from an incentive standpoint for its own economy until it gets a better feel for what's going to happen with the US presidential election. We're doing scenario planning here to look at the impacts.\nAs I mentioned, there are anti-dumping activities going on in different parts of the world because of challenges that we see from things being, volumes being dropped into markets. And so there's a lot of work going on behind the scenes. I think that we'll get a clearer picture for that by the end of the year. But right now, I would say I haven't seen any uptick in volumes or stocking because of that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you. Jim or Jeff, I'm looking at slide eight in the top exhibit on volumes. You've had relatively easy year-over-year comparisons the last three quarters, and then you have that in the Q3 as well. But the Q4 begins, I think, more challenging year-over-year comps. If we have normal seasonality, will the Q4 be down in volume?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI still think you're going to see strength, John, in plastics. I don't remember if silicones had turnaround time in Q4 last year. It should be up based on the downstream demand forecast that we've seen. Normal seasonality, I would expect out of coatings. But I think in plastics and silicones, you're going to see up. And in II&I, because of industrial solutions and Glycol-2 being back, you're going to see up. And the question mark will be how much do we see in terms of demand uptick on durable goods? And that'll be what determines whether PU is up or not.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, good morning. Two questions. First, Jim, you made a comment that you thought your coatings raw material business did quite well in Q2. A lot of the paint companies have come out, and their volumes seem weak. So can you just kind of triangulate that? Then for Jeff, the other assets and liabilities on the cash flow statement have eaten almost $1 billion of cash so far this year, which is much higher than normal. What is that, and what happens to that going forward?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, Duffy, I'll take coatings. Coatings mixed is part of it. So in addition to architectural coatings, where, as I mentioned, I think in the contractor space and with the customers who are in that space, we've done quite well. We also saw traffic paint improvements, and that's been driven by infrastructure projects that have gone along. And also, you know, continue to see good response on the innovation side there. The team's done a great job of, you know, getting their assets running well, had great uptime, and I think has been delivering on market share gains across that, taking advantage of their good cost position. Jeff, on the cash side?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Duffy. In terms of other assets and liabilities, you know, you're right. The primary driver there is we had a reduction in long-term tax payables related to some of our tax audit reassessments over the period. And you may recall, even in Q1, we had a significant item more specific to one of our regions as well. So those things were somewhat unique from that vantage point here. So it should stabilize here moving forward.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. I'm just curious on siloxanes pricing in Asia. Would you characterize this as, you know, lingering oversupply issues, or is just the pace of demand recovery not as strong as expected? I think there was maybe a bit more confidence on the pricing environment in the Q2. Did that revert over the past couple of months? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good question, Patrick. I mentioned on the call the difference between integrated and non-integrated players. I think some of the weakness you see in siloxanes in Asia is from the non-integrated players and, as you say, the capacity overhang that is there. Capacity additions have slowed. So we do think we're going to start to see, as we move into next year, some pricing improvement on siloxanes. We've been working to make investments in downstream silicone products, which have all been doing well. We continue to move that way, really trying to drive that volume growth for those downstream derivatives and sell less into that merchant siloxanes market and more into the downstream derivatives. And you're seeing that start to come through in the volume in Q2. That was one of the big drivers.\nSo that was a big driver, plus the fact that you've seen an improvement in downstream demand in things like consumer electronics. You saw a pretty strong automotive business and still good on the commercial construction side of things, which drives a lot of volume of products. Health and personal care has been pretty solid. I'd say we see good volume growth year-over-year, kind of 3%, a little bit more than 3%. Mixed is under a little bit of pressure because consumers are trading brands and trading quality maybe a little bit as they're trying to balance their spending at the grocery store and at the pharmacy.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Jim, just a bigger picture question. Dow's obviously investing a lot for medium-term growth. You've laid out a lot of 2025 and 2030 expansion targets. But at the same time, the overall demand backdrop since about mid-2022 has probably been materially worse than you or anybody has thought at that time. So as that timing gap between near-term weakness, medium-term growth sort of closes, I mean, 2025 is only five months away now. Does that give you any pause at all on some of your investments? Do you need to rethink or pivot any of these expansions in sort of a slower-for-longer economic scenario?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow",
    "content2": "It's a good question, Mike. But I would also, you know, ask you to think about it in even a longer-term time frame. It takes years to plan and make these investments. We have to look at what's happened in plastics, take for an example. Since 2019, we've seen a 20% increase in volumes in plastics. You can't obviously respond to the market when you see the increase and start to get this capacity in place. You've got to get in place and take advantage of the mid-cycle and the upcycle ahead of time. So typically, when we're at this point in the cycle, it's a common question that everybody asks, but we've got to look through at the long-term trends.\nThe long-term trends for plastics say the growth is going to continue to be there. We've tried to move into the areas where there is differentiation and there's higher growth rates, whether that's silicones, whether that's plastics, whether that's industrial solutions on the higher value, especially EO derivatives, where we're investing. That's where the dollars are going. So those three markets are consuming most of your capacity expansion. What we've been doing in polyurethanes is more rationalizing the footprint around the higher value markets, more downstream, less commodity like EO, more MDI-containing components.\nOn coatings, obviously, being able to move with the market as the housing market improves. So I feel good about the long-term direction. We're not back at mid-cycle yet. As we get back to mid-cycle, there's a $3 billion step-up in earnings at mid-cycle margins. Then once Path to Zero comes on in the 2027, 2029 time frame and you get to peak, there's another $3 billion step-up to peak.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Jim, in your $2 billion of, you know, mid-cycle upside for P&SP, you know, I understand there are obviously a lot of moving factors there. But if we stick to the US, can you just offer some insights in terms of what you're expecting in terms of integrated, you know, PE margins, just given where the current SD dynamic is, export trends, NGLs? Just any color in terms of kind of getting that back would be especially helpful? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah. So mid-cycle margins typically run in the range of $0.27 globally, but that can run from, you know, in Europe, maybe $0.20 mid-cycle margins to Americas $0.32. When we've gotten to peak, the global average on peak would tend to be more like $0.48. And maybe that range would run from Europe being in the 40 range, $0.38 to 0.40, and Americas being as much as $0.56. So that's, you know, kind of what the outlook is. And of the $2 billion of upside, I'd say some of that is capacity, debottlenecking, and things that we're adding.\nSo about $800 million of the $2 billion is from additions and tweaking on making some more higher value products available, like we announced, you know, we'd done with elastomers and things in Tarragona. And then the rest of it will come from margin expansion.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nGood morning, everyone. Jim, looking at ACC numbers, North American polyethylene demand this year is roughly at the same level as in 2018, 2019. Do you have any thoughts on this observation? Do you think there's another leg up for US polyethylene demand?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nI do. I think when we look at North American demand, we're starting to see, you know, the total domestic demand plus exports getting north of, you know, 5 billion lbs. So, you know, this is a step-up. Obviously, exports have been a big driver. Historically, you know, 30% of total demand was export. You're running about 45% of that demand in 2023. Also, I would tend to look at not just US data, but I would also look at Mexico. I mean, we move product into Mexico the same way we move into the US market.\nAs I mentioned, you know, one of the biggest consumption increases has been in Mexico with manufacturing reshoring, moving into that area. So I think we're seeing good volumes this year in the US. I think we're going to continue to see that improve at a steady rate.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun, your line is open.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nAndrew?\n\nAndrew Riker\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nYeah. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. Also, we understand there were some technical issues and audio issues to start the early part of the Q&A. We do apologize for this. As a reminder, we do post the transcript to our investor website, and we'll do so as quickly as possible today to make sure everything's addressed. This concludes our call. Thank you for your time, and thank you for your interest in Dow.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If you would like to ask a question at that time, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I am Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President, and joining me are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Tate, Chief Financial Officer. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items.\nWe also will refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On slide two is our agenda for today's call.\nJim will review our Q4 results, full-year highlights, and operating segment performance. Jeff will provide an update on the macroeconomic environment, our strong financial position through the cycle, as well as the modeling guidance. To close, Jim will provide an update on key milestones for our long-term growth and sustainability roadmap, which will continue to drive shareholder value. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning on slide three, in the Q4, we continue to execute with discipline and advance our long-term strategy in the face of a dynamic macroeconomic environment. Net sales were $10.6 billion, down 10% versus a year-ago period, reflecting declines in all operating segments. Sales were down 1% sequentially as volume gains in Packaging and Specialty Plastics were more than offset by seasonal demand declines in performance materials and coatings.\nVolume increased 2% year-over-year with gains across all regions except Asia Pacific, which was flat. Sequentially, volume decreased by 1%, including the impact of an unplanned event from a storm that was equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane at our Bahía Blanca site in Argentina. Local price decreased 13% year-over-year with declines in all operating segments due to lower feedstocks and energy costs.\nSequentially, price was flat, reflecting modest gains in most regions. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $559 million, down $42 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower prices. Sequentially, Operating EBIT was down $67 million as gains in Packaging and Specialty Plastics were more than offset by seasonally lower volumes in Performance Materials and Coatings. Our cash flow generation and working capital management enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $1.6 billion in the quarter.\nWe continued to reduce costs and focus on cash generation, completing our $1 billion of cost savings for the year. In Q4, we pursued additional de-risking opportunities for our pension plans, including annuitization, risk transfer of $1.7 billion in pension liability, and a one-time non-cash and non-operating settlement charge of $642 million. We also advanced our long-term strategy while returning $616 million to shareholders.\nWe reached final investment decision with our board of directors for our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Now turning to our full-year performance on slide four, our 2023 results demonstrate strong execution and a commitment to financial discipline. Against a dynamic macroeconomic backdrop, Team Dow continued to take proactive actions. As a result, we generated $5.2 billion in cash flow from operations for the year, reflecting a cash flow conversion of 96%. We also returned $2.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nOur efforts continue to be recognized externally through industry-leading awards, certifications, and recognitions, and we continue to outpace our peers on leadership diversity. I'm proud of how Team Dow is delivering for our customers, driving shareholder value, and supporting our communities as we progress our long-term strategy. Now turning to operating segment performance on slide five.\nIn the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, Operating EBIT was $664 million, up $9 million compared to the year-ago period. Results were driven by lower input costs and higher operating rates, where we closed out the year strong and hit record ethylene production levels on a full-year basis. Local price declines were driven by lower global prices, while volume increases were led by higher packaging demand primarily in the US, Canada, and Latin America.\nSequentially, Operating EBIT increased by $188 million. This was driven by higher integrated polyethylene margins, the impact of planned maintenance activity in Q3, and higher licensing revenue. Moving to the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, Operating EBIT was $15 million compared to $164 million in the year-ago period. Results were driven by lower local prices in both businesses, as well as reduced supply availability and industrial solutions.\nSequentially, operating EBIT was down $6 million, driven by seasonally lower volumes in building and construction end markets, which were partially offset by seasonally higher demand for de-icing fluid and higher demand for mobility applications. In the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, operating EBIT was a loss of $61 million compared to a loss of $130 million in the year-ago period, driven by lower costs and reduced planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nVolume was up year-over-year, driven by higher demand in project-driven building and construction end markets. Sequentially, operating EBIT decreased $240 million, primarily due to seasonally lower volumes. Next, I'll turn it over to Jeff to review our outlook and actions on slide six.\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. Before I begin, I'd like to mention how excited I am to have rejoined Dow last November. I've been connecting with key stakeholders, analysts, and shareholders, including many of you, on this call today. I look forward to meeting with so many others in the future. After four years serving in a CFO role outside of Dow, I'm pleased to see that Dow's culture of execution, commitment to advancing our ambition, and the focus everyone has demonstrated on delivering on our financial priorities since then remains. This is an exciting time for the company.\nAs CFO, I'm proud to carry forward Dow's commitment to maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation over the economic cycle as we advance our growth strategies and deliver long-term value for shareholders. Now, for our outlook on slide six.\nAs we enter 2024, we expect near-term demand to remain pressured by elevated inflation, high interest rates, and geopolitical tension, particularly in building and construction and durable goods markets. That said, we are seeing some initial positive indicators. While inflation is still elevated compared to pre-COVID levels, its growth rate is moderating, supporting more stable economic conditions.\nIn addition, the destocking that began in late 2022 has largely run its course, resulting in low inventory levels throughout most of our value chains. In the US, industrial activity continues to be moderate. In December, industrial production increased 1% year-over-year, and chemical rail car loadings are up 9.6% in January versus the prior year. US consumer spending has remained resilient, with retail trade sales up 4.8% in December.\nWe're also encouraged by recent forecasts from the American Coatings Association, which expects market demand to grow approximately 3% in 2024, following three consecutive years of declines. In Europe, while inflation has moderated, consumer demand remains weak, with retail trade sales down 1.1% year-over-year in November. In December, manufacturing PMI remains in contractionary territory, and new car registrations fell 3.3% year-over-year after 16 consecutive months of growth. We continue to monitor China, where we see improving conditions, which could provide a source of demand recovery following the Lunar New Year.\nIndustrial production was up 6.8% year-over-year last month, exceeding market estimates of 6.6%. December auto sales also continue to be strong in China, supported by year-end incentives. In other regions around the world, industrial activity remains constructive. While India manufacturing PMI remains expansionary, ASEAN manufacturing PMI entered contractionary territory last month.\nIn Mexico, November marked the 25th consecutive month of industrial production growth. On slide seven, our competitive advantages, early cycle growth investments, and operational discipline position us well to capitalize on a recovery and deliver growth when economic conditions improve. Our differentiated portfolio with structurally advantaged assets, global scale, and strong cost positions enable us to competitively support global demand growth over the cycle. Healthy oil-to-gas spreads, supported by growing natural gas and NGL production in the US, favor our cost advantage and ability to capture margin momentum.\nWe've also taken actions to position the company for profitable growth, including ongoing execution of near-term investments that are expected to deliver approximately $2 billion in incremental underlying EBITDA by mid-decade. In addition, we've improved our cost profile, delivering $1 billion in targeted savings in 2023 that included lower plant maintenance spending and structural improvements to raw materials, logistics, and utility costs.\nIn addition, more than 90% of the 2,000 impacted roles exited by year-end. Our strong balance sheet allows us to navigate the bottom of the cycle and have the strength to capitalize on the next upside in the global economy. Turning to our outlook for Q1 on slide eight, in the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, lower feedstock and energy costs will be more than offset by lower earnings from non-recurring licensing activity from the prior quarter, resulting in a $25 million headwind.\nAdditionally, we expect a $50 million headwind due to higher planned maintenance activity at select energy assets in the US Gulf Coast. In the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, we expect margin expansion on higher MDI and MEG spreads, as well as lower European energy costs, resulting in a $50 million tailwind.\nIncreased seasonal demand for de-icing fluid is expected to provide a $25 million tailwind, despite being partly offset by continued weakness in consumer durables demand. We also expect a headwind of $50 million due to planned maintenance activity in the quarter, primarily related to a PDH turnaround and catalyst change. In the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, downward pressure is expected to continue due to excess supply from competitive supply additions that will keep margins at depressed levels. However, we expect higher seasonal demand in building and construction end markets to contribute a $150 million tailwind for the segment.\nWe also expect higher planned maintenance turnaround activity at our Deer Park Acrylic Monomer site and PDH to result in a $50 million headwind in the quarter. With all the puts and takes, we expect Q1 earnings to be approximately $25 to 50 million above Q4 performance. Next, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jeff. Moving to slide nine, our Decarbonize and Grow and Transform the Waste strategies uniquely position us to capitalize on demand for more sustainable and circular solutions across our attractive market verticals. Altogether, by 2030, these investments enable us to deliver an increase of more than $3 billion to our underlying earnings through the cycle, while reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 5 million metric tons and commercializing 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually.\nIn November, we reached a key milestone as our Path2Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta achieved final investment decision by our Board of Directors. We also continue to advance our Transform the Waste strategy via intentional action, strategic partnerships, and offtake agreements. In Q4, Valoregen's 15,000-ton-per-year mechanical recycling line in France achieved mechanical completion.\nMura Technology in the UK commenced commissioning, which is expected to contribute 20,000 tons per year of advanced recycling capacity. Both Valoregen and Mura expect to reach commercialization in the first half of this year. As the next step of our sustainability strategy, Dow has established a Green Finance Framework, which was published on our investor website today. This allows us to further align our funding with our goals and targets, while also providing an opportunity for the investor community to take part in the execution of our sustainability strategy.\nAltogether, we remain confident in our long-term earnings growth with continued focus on a more sustainable future while maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. Now turning to slide 10, polyethylene demand is expected to continue to grow at approximately 1.2 to 1.4 times GDP through 2050. A growing population, regulations, and consumer preferences support this.\nOur customers have expressed an increasing need for low- and zero-carbon emissions and circular products. As global demand grows, no new cost-advantaged ethylene capacity is expected to come online in North America until the late 2026 to 2027 timeframe, which is expected to tighten the supply-demand balance in the near term. We are well-positioned to capture new and growing demand with our existing assets and partnership agreements.\nIn addition, we are investing in low-carbon emissions infrastructure to capture growing demand for polyethylene, as you will see on slide 11. Our Fort Saskatchewan project will build upon the strong foundation of our Texas-9 cracker, where we have proven our best-in-class execution, capital efficiency, reliability, and emissions reduction. Canada's feedstock cost advantage provides Dow with lower cash costs compared to the rest of the world, even more advantaged than the US Gulf Coast.\nWe also anticipate potential upside from the commercialization of low and zero-emissions products. Total CapEx spend is expected to be $6.5 billion on this key growth project, excluding any incentives, with Dow's total enterprise CapEx to ramp in 2024 to approximately $3 billion and exceed depreciation and amortization levels annually through 2027. We remain committed to keeping our CapEx within BNA across the economic cycle and expect to return to those levels as we complete this project.\nWe expect to receive governmental support totaling more than $1.5 billion in cash and tax incentives that will bring the net capital outlay for this project to $5 billion. The majority of these incentives are expected to be received by Dow through 2030, which is closely aligned with our CapEx deployment for the project.\nWe will begin construction in the first half of 2024, with phase I startup of approximately 1.3 million tons per year of capacity expected in 2027. In phase II, we will add another 600,000 tons of capacity, which is expected to start up in 2029. Phase II also includes the retrofit of our existing cracker, reducing net 1 million metric tons per year of CO2 Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\nClosing on slide 12, the actions we've taken since spin have strengthened our balance sheet, increased cash flow, and enhanced the financial flexibility and resilience of our business. In 2023, we built on that foundation, moving swiftly to deliver $1 billion in cost savings and focus on cash generation as economic conditions remain challenging.\nAs a result, we delivered on all of our capital allocation priorities, including a fully funded dividend, $625 million of share repurchases, and growth investments, all while maintaining the strongest balance sheet we've ever had at this part of the cycle. With all of our debt at fixed rate, we have no substantive debt maturities due until 2027 and $13 billion of available liquidity. Additionally, we have returned approximately 90% of our net income to shareholders since spin, well above our 65% target across the economic cycle.\nWith global reach, presence in attractive end markets, an advantaged cost position, and early-stage growth investments in flight, we are well-positioned to capture attractive growth opportunities as economic conditions recover. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks as well as the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question only. Your first question comes from a line of Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is open.\n\nHassan Ahmed\n\nAnalyst, Alembic Global\n\nMorning, Jim. Jim, you know, a couple of times through the prepared remarks, you talked about inventory. You know, it just seems that there are two camps out there in terms of the thought process with regards to, you know, what a potential restocking may look like. I'd love to hear your views about that.\nYou know, on one side of the debate, you know, people are sitting there and saying, \"Hey, look, you know, since the second half of, call it, 2022, you know, the destocking was quite significant, and, you know, maybe as and when we should expect an equally impressive restock.\"\nThen on the other side of the camp, you know, you have some of the folks sort of, sort of debating that, you know, buying patterns across, you know, the supply chains changed quite dramatically, you know, coming out of the pandemic, and maybe a restock, you know, could, you know, not look that impressive. I'd, I'd love to hear your views, and if you could also sort of elaborate on that, you know, within some of the main product chains, be it polyethylene, polyurethanes, and the like.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nGood morning, Hassan. I think that's a great question. I think one of the reasons that December and Q4 ended up stronger than expected, especially, I'll use Packaging and Specialty Plastics as an example, was because, you know, you had a pretty mixed year in 2023. You know, in December, you can sometimes see the behavior that the last half of December, things slow down, and people manage cash, and they don't buy.\nThat was not what we experienced in December. We actually experienced strong demand right through the month. I don't think that's an indication of restocking, but I do think it's an indication that inventories are low through the supply chains, and the consumer demand was resilient, and so people had to buy to keep their supply chains moving.\nI would say through the value chains today, and almost all the businesses, it looks like there's not an excess of inventory out there, and as demand is coming, people are having to buy to keep the chains full. Secondly, inventories are low in areas like P&SP, industrial solutions, because, you know, the arbitrage is open, and our own footprint, 85% of our own global footprint, is in light-cracking jurisdictions where we crack ethane and propane, which have been highly advantaged.\nThat's what allowed us to set an ethylene record for the year. I would say we're not. I don't think we're in a restocking cycle yet. I think people are, you know, coming together around a soft landing here. I mean, we're seeing positive signs on housing permits.\nThat doesn't turn into housing demand until we start to see, say, maybe interest rates come down. If interest rates come down in Q2, maybe you start to see some pickup in housing, construction, and that starts to show up more toward the back half of the year.\nYou've got to remember that energy costs are low, and so if people are thinking, you know, that energy costs are low and I'm still able to buy at reasonable prices going forward, there may not be a reason for them to do a big restock right now. This will turn, and as energy costs start to move up and the whole complex starts to move up with demand, I think at that point, I think we would be wise to keep our eye on what's happening with the potential for restock.\nIt might just be a little soon right now.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Mike Sisson from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMike Sisson\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, guys. Nice, nice end of the year. Just curious, you know, you had good volume growth in P&SP in the Q4. Do you expect that to continue into the first? Maybe any of your thoughts on how your operating rates for polyethylene will sort of improve sequentially, and the cadence for the year?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, thanks, Michael. Good question. Operating rates in the advantaged region, especially Canada, US Gulf Coast, and Argentina, were strong through the end of the year. I mentioned ethylene production record. We saw rates above 90% in those regions for the Q4. Obviously, we, you know, we saw a little bit of an improvement in Europe. I'd say the Suez Canal situation means not as much material from the Middle East is flowing into Europe, and so that's given Europe a little bit of a lift on operating rates as we go into the Q1.\nOf course, with propane being where it is, we've, you know, we're cracking LPGs in Terneuzen and in Tarragona, and that's helping out a bit there. I, I would say I think P&SP is going to continue to see good volume growth. That's what our outlook is going forward.\nI think industrial solutions is holding up relatively well. We have our own self-inflicted issue with the Plaquemine Glycol plant, but I'm expecting that back up in Q2. You know, we're watching carefully on construction chemicals demand and durable goods to see if we see an uptick there. We saw some good movement in consumer electronics, and so, you know, that's got me a little bit optimistic.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, thanks. Maybe two quick ones from me. Just on slide seven, you have some project starts that are going from 2024 to 2026. Talk about how material some of that might be for 2024, and then also, if you could just give us an update on what you did with the pension, ending the year.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, on project starts, you know, we've got things that we've got coming up. Obviously, as we've got some alkoxylation capacity that came up, you know, in 2022 and 2023, that's running really well. We started up the MDI distillation facility in Freeport in Q3. I think that'll start to show some positive benefits as we move forward. That's about a 30% increase in MDI distillation and also reduction of a footprint, getting us out of the La Porte site.\nWe've got Seadrift alkoxylation second wave expansion in Q4 of this year and then Terneuzen in Q4 2025. Both of that supports growing demand and energy, and also consumer solutions and pharma business, so that's good. Amines' business for carbon capture is growing well, and so that's good.\nIf you look at the plastics industry, there's really no new capacity coming out of plastics, save one train at the Shell plant in the United States. Otherwise, all the plastics capacity is in the market. Inventories are low. Export channels running strong, and we saw volume growth year-over-year in the Q4. So, you know, I feel good about the overall outlook for plastics as we're going into 2024. When you get into polyolefins, our polyurethanes, and propylene oxide, a little bit different story.\nWe've had capacity come on in China. We've seen the same in siloxanes last year. I think we're working through that. The silicones growth is going to eat up that siloxane capacity, but we've got to see the durable goods market and the housing market come back to tighten up PO.\nPropylene Glycol side has been strong, but as you know, housing and automotive drives PPE a lot. Those two things drive the propylene markets, and we've got to keep a close eye on them.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nOn pension. Jeff, do you want to cover pension and what we did?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nSure, Jim. You know, as we've been communicating to the street here in recent quarters, one of the things that we're consistently looking to do is, with solidifying our financial position, is look for ways to de-risk our pension plans. You know, one of those could be around amortization as well as risk transfer of our liabilities. Specifically in Q4, we were actually able to reduce our pension liabilities by $1.7 billion. The execution of those transactions did not require any additional cash from the company. As Jim mentioned in some of his opening remarks, you know, the impact of that was a one-time non-cash, non-operating settlement charge of $640 million in the quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. Recently, there was a cold snap in Texas, and I didn't notice that there was any penalty in EBITDA for Q1. Are you still assessing what the amounts might be, or do you think that it's zero? Then, secondly, you pulled out $1 billion in costs. Can you allocate the $1 billion across your three segments?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nSure. I'll take the cold snap, and then, Jeff, I'll have you take a look at the costs. Look on the freeze, Jeff. I just want to go back, you know, to two years ago. This is the third consecutive year of freeze on the Gulf Coast, and we've improved plans every year to be able to be ready for that. This year will be the lowest impact that we've had of any of the three years, and so, you know, the big impacts that hit us were at Deer Park and at Seadrift, but almost all of that is back up and running now, so we were able to rebound pretty quickly. You know, you never go completely unscathed, but I think we managed through it pretty well.\nWe haven't had to disrupt any customers because of downtime, and I think we're going to recover pretty strong here and, and be running hard by the end of this month. I feel that we've navigated it pretty well, and we didn't, we didn't see enough of an impact that we put that into Q1 estimates. I think our biggest, our biggest hit in Q1 is we've got quite a few turnarounds in Q1, and so that's our, our biggest impact, about $200 million of turnarounds in the quarter, $150.\nThen, you know, we expect some margin and some seasonality in Q1, say, + $200 million on margins and - $150 million on turnarounds in the quarter. That's the biggest net net on the Q1 2024 guidance. Jeff, do you want to hit, you know, how the $1 billion costs fell across the business?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nAbsolutely, Jim. In the simplest terms, about 50% of those cost savings are in P&SP. 25%, 20% to 25 are in the other two segments, respectively, and we also have a little bit in corporate as well. Pretty well distributed based on our operations and our our revenues as well.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nWe ended the year at a $1.4 billion run rate on that. If you look at full-year 2024, Jeff, we've still got another $400 million coming in in terms of the cost savings for 2024, but we have $200 million of higher turnarounds in 2024. Net net, $200 million coming into 2024. I hope that covers what you're looking for.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you. I'd like to get some help from you on, you know, why were the earnings in P&M, P&SP so much lower than what you were expecting, say, in the Q3 slide deck? Would you attribute this to just lower pricing, higher ROS? You know, help me on this one. Maybe in particular, coatings, you know, you got a key customer raising price and targeting mid-single digit lower ROS. You know, your propylene costs are higher. Why not able to push more price in this segment or cut back on operating rates or something along those lines? What's your outlook for that segment?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good, good question, Steve. I'd say starting at the top, siloxanes and monomers, in the silicones, siloxanes and silicones to monomers and coatings, and monomers are both oversupplied, and so that put pressure, obviously, on both volume and pricing in the quarter. You had volumes decrease sequentially across all regions and all markets, and that's not unusual, especially in coatings and monomers. That's pretty typical in Q4 that we would see that. Silicones was a little bit softer, and I think that was the biggest delta there.\nYear-over-year, they were down on price, which was because of that supply demand for both siloxane and acrylic monomers. The downstreams in terms of the coating, the binders business, and coating, held up relatively well and actually had decent volumes in Q4.\nWhat we supply to the downstream coatings customers looked good, and as we mentioned, our view going forward is about a 3% increase this year in downstream coatings. I'd say downstream silicones demand continues to hold up pretty well. I'd say the one thing we're keeping an eye on is what happens with EV volume production. EV drives a lot of silicones content, a lot into batteries, and so we need to keep an eye on that. The other segments in silicones are also on pretty substantial growth for 2024. It's those upstream monomers markets that we're going to keep an eye on, and I think things will start to tighten up a bit in China, and that'll help on siloxanes.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. I was wondering if you'd comment on your polyethylene price assumptions in Q1. I think within your bridge, you talk about lower costs and some other moving pieces, but there's not really anything there on price. Are you assuming that you get positive pricing in February and March, like some of the consultant data shows, or are you assuming something different? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Josh. We've got $0.05 price increases on the table for January and February. I would say, you know, globally, we're looking pretty flat, quarter over quarter on pricing. I'm expecting to see some price up in AMEA. I'm, I mentioned the Suez Canal and the impact that had on Middle East volumes going up into AMEA, so I think we're going to see that up. I think we're going to see price up in Asia Pacific, and I think we're going to see it relatively flat in the Americas.\nIntegrated margins for the Americas ought to be about where they were in the Q4. Integrated margins in Europe should be up a few cents. That's what the market markers would look at right now. Input costs are in line. I mean, even though we had that cold snap, natural gas costs are very competitive. I think costs are very competitive. Propane's been a little bit high because of the heating demand, but I think that may start to come off a little bit as we move through this cold spell.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Jim, you highlight the US chemical rail car loadings up 10%. What do you think is driving that? Given the strong start to the quarter, do you expect volumes to be up in all three segments in Q1? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, look, I think on chemical rail car loadings, industrial production in the US is starting to come back. The US has a tremendous cost advantage. Operating rates in most of the sectors are up, and I, you know, I think the destocking, you know, it's always hard to have enough visibility to call the end of it, but I think what we saw in December were signs that destocking has worked through.\nAny downstream demand is turning into orders, and I think that's what you're seeing with the rail car loadings. You know, I also remember, you know, rail car service the Mexican market as well. Mexico's been very strong. They've benefited a lot from nearshoring, and so having both China volumes up and Mexico volumes up, I think is a positive here.\nI would say on volumes, my expectations, we have volume growth for all three segments for 2024. I think that's going to start to materialize. I think plastics is underway right now. I think construction chemicals, housing-related demand on polyurethanes, will probably be geared more towards the back half of the year. I think downstream silicones, industrial solutions, will be throughout the year, and then we'll have a step up in industrial solutions when we get the Glycol 2 plant back in Plaquemine. I think I can speak for the business here. You know, as soon as we get that plant back up, we'll have it sold out. We're working really hard to get that thing back online.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nDan Rizzo\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my call. Can we just discuss your strategy on mechanical recycling? What do you expect by 2030, and longer term, do you expect that to outgrow the market?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I think when we look at, if you look at what we put in the deck on, on polyethylene demand, you know, our view is that both mechanical recycling and advanced recycling are going to continue to grow. There's going to be demand drivers to grow, you know, all of those segments. We're in the middle of discussions on a global plastics treaty right now. We've got a big conference in Ottawa at the end of April, beginning of May. There's another one in Korea toward the end of the year.\nI think what's coalescing around the industry and also the consumer brand owners, and some of the NGOs that we work with, is a focus on enhanced producer responsibility as part of it to drive circularity, focus on recycled content mandates, a focus on all forms of recycling, and bio-based products that are made from waste or alternative feedstocks. In some cases, like we have a project that's making bio-based materials from waste from corn production, corn stover that's used to convert into bio feedstocks.\nYou're going to see demand for all forms of that in place. We've got some capacity coming up in Europe, and we started there because the enhanced producer responsibility schemes are there. Some of the mandates are there, and the demand from the downstream is very strong.\nThat's coming, when you look around the States in the United States, that's coming, in Canada. I think we're going to see it come globally. I, I feel that over time, you're going to see more focus on low-carbon, fossil approaches like we're doing with Alberta. How can you make plastics from fossil fuels that have zero CO2 emissions? You're going to see focus on advanced recycling and mechanical recycling, and all of the above. We're just going to place bets in different regions based on what the market, market demand dictates.\nGood uptake from the customers. We see good volume growth there. We see pricing ahead of virgin materials, and of course, virgin materials are relatively low right now, and we continue to work to get plants certified with ISCC PLUS so that we can certify that recycled content for our, for our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYes, good morning. Jim, on a year-to-date basis, we've seen polyethylene export prices rise by, let's say, $0.04 to 0.05 a pound. I'm curious as to what you think is driving that. Would you attribute that pattern to better demand or some of the logistics challenges that have emerged in the Red Sea, or perhaps other factors? Then maybe as a related question, if you don't have any unplanned outages, how hard do you think you might be able to run your US Gulf Coast, you know, ethylene-linked assets in Q1? Just trying to get a sense of whether the export market might be strong enough to lift up the US domestic market.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, it's a good question, Kevin. I would say if you look back at 2023, in the first half of the year, really, the limit on PE export volumes and prices was just more on the volume side, on the supply chain side of it, was the ability to get marine-packed cargo moving. That improved considerably as we worked through the year. In fact, December was one of the highest months of the year for PE export sales, and we've got the export channel full and lined up.\nOverall, you know, we're running Canada, United States, Argentina, as hard as we can. You know, we ran at rates on crackers above 90% for the back part of the year, especially in Q4. To your point, unconstrained, if there's no freeze impact or anything else, we're going to be running them hard.\nThe arbitrage is open. The volumes are there. We had up double-digit volumes for the year, in plastics going to China. We actually were up year-over-year in China on P&SP as well as industrial solutions, and I think a little bit in coatings, consumer solutions. I'm sorry, in consumer solutions. So, we were off in industrial solutions because of the Plaquemine outage, but we were slightly up in PU, slightly up in consumer solutions, and up double digits in P&SP.\nI think the market is there, and that is, you know, everybody's talking about China being relatively light GDP last year, and we can move those kind of volumes. My expectations are taking actions that are going to help 2024 be better. As we do the walk on 2024 for the full-year EBITDA walk, we've got about $300 million of margin expansion.\nWe start with $5.4 billion in 2023 of EBITDA. We have about $300 million from margin expansion. We've got about $800 million from volume growth. It's in all three segments. We've got turnarounds, which cost us $200 million, and then we've got about $100 million of improvement from equity earnings in the JVs. Net-net, you know, you're walking it up to the $6.4 to 6.5, kind of a range for 2024. I think with soft landing scenario in the United States, that'll help domestic market. We saw good domestic volume in PE as well here.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nGood morning, and Jeff, nice to hear your voice again. Hey, Jim, really appreciate that walk-up into 2024. I want to take a step back to slide seven, where you talked about the projects, mid-cycle that started up in 2022, should contribute $400 million. The projects that started up in 2023 should contribute another $400 million. Can you just look at those $800 million worth of mid-cycle earnings and suggest what you're anticipating they're going to contribute in 2024?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I think, Frank, you know, I think coming back to that, and I probably didn't answer what Vince was asking very well, at the beginning. You know, I think you're probably looking back half of this year to 2025 before you start to see mid-cycle types of returns. We're not, we're not to mid-cycle yet. I mean, obviously, we're navigating the bottom here. I think with interest rates potentially coming off in the first half of the year, some amount that stimulates some demand and mid-cycle probably get there. Maybe $300 to 400 million of that, you'll see in 2024, the balance into 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, good morning. If you could, just on the $50 to 100 million on the equity income improvement, can you walk through your major JVs and just kind of say what's additive, what's subtractive from that number?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, sure. I, you know, I think you're going to see on the, you know, the Sadara JVs, year-over-year should be up, I don't know, say about $100 million. Remember, they had some outages in the first part of the year, so they had some volume impact in the first part of the year. Obviously, they're seeing the same improvements in arbitrage that we're seeing out of US Gulf Coast.\nYou're going to see Kuwait JVs up about $60 million. Obviously, that's a strength on ethylene glycol. We saw a bit of that in the Q4, and their ability to run hard as well. I think the Thai JVs will be down. A lot of pressure, obviously, on naphtha cracking, and they're based on naphtha cracking. I expect them to be down about $20 million, and then everything else down about $30 million.\nNet, net-net, you're up about $100 million.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThanks. It looks like a pretty smooth transition in finance, so congratulations on the stability there. I believe you were considering some additional infrastructure divestments. Could you give us an update on that?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nSure. Nice to hear your voice on the call, John. Welcome back. Yeah, we've got a number of non-product-producing infrastructure assets that we continue to evaluate. We have in-flight for this year greater than $1 billion. I said same, I think maybe even greater than $1.5 billion of additional cash proceeds from transactions related to that. We had a very successful divestiture in 2020 of our rail and marine infrastructure assets, and that is working well.\nThe idea there was to liberate some cash but keep a competitive cost structure. That same mindset is in place here. We think, you know, obviously, the cash proceeds are going to help us with reinvesting in revenue-generating assets like the Alberta project as we move forward.\nThen the other, you know, cash-related, kind of unique levers to Dow for the year is we've got, you know, the last part of the settlement from the NOVA litigation, which should wind all that up, and that's about $500 million for the year. I'd say net-net, you know, we're pushing north of $1.5 billion, plus the NOVA litigation to try to get those kind of unique cash levers into the company. Anything else you want to add, Jeff?\n\nJeff Tate\n\nCFO, Dow\n\nYeah, Jim, the only other thing and, and good morning, John, and thank you. The only other thing I would add is the working capital, structural working capital improvement opportunities that we'll continue to focus on. If you recall, we reduced eight days of and made eight days of improvement around our cash conversion cycle since then. Tremendous work across Team Dow. We're going to look to continue to get at least another one to two days of improvements out of that, which should also give us another unique to Dow cash lever.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Patrick Cunningham from Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nHi, good morning. You mentioned you know, turnarounds, you know, maybe weighted towards the Q1, Plaquemine coming back in Q2, you know, Freeport bringing on the increase in MDI distillation. Should we expect, you know, more significant sequential earnings improvement throughout the year, and maybe help size where we can exit the year for the segment? Then, if you could also just briefly comment on what's driving the direction of MDI and MEG spreads into Q1, that'd be great. Thanks.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I think, I think generically that's, that's true, Patrick, that I think you'll see that build through the year. Q1, obviously, we mentioned the turnarounds. Q2, we expect to get Glycol 2 back and Plaquemine. That'll be positive. Then Q3 will be more positive, so we'll ramp into the back half of the year. On isocyanates, obviously, the biggest driver is on construction-related and durable goods-related markets.\nObviously, there's some impact in automotive as well. Any, any of the rigids is where most of that volume gets consumed. As those volumes start to pick up, you'll start to see MDI take off. That's usually a driver of value across the entire portfolio, both the Polyols and the MDI side of things.\nI'm hoping that we start to stimulate some of that demand in the back half of the year. I think with what China's doing, in the markets, in the financial markets, to try to stimulate some things, between US interest rates and what's going on in China, that we see some momentum build in the back half of this year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Mike Leithead from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning. Two questions on your Sadara joint venture. First, I believe there was a report earlier this month that Aramco is raising feedstock prices. Will that impact Sadara, or should we expect input costs there to remain relatively flat? Second, EBITDA remains quite depressed right now relative to net debt at the JV. Should we expect any further restructuring or, or cash infusion needed over the next year or so, or, is the runway there sufficient to get back to saying more mid-cycle type EBITDA levels?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, that's a good question. We've had no cash contributions that needed to be made to Sadara 2021, 2022, 2023. I'm not expecting any going forward. Sadara itself, like us, when you're navigating the bottom of the cycle, is focusing on self-help actions to try to pull levers to keep costs down. There is talk in the kingdom about a raise in feedstock prices, and so we'll obviously have to look at things that we can do within Sadara to offset those costs. Those haven't taken hold just yet. Then obviously the market comes back. You know, Sadara is very levered to oil price, and so oil clears the market for plastics, especially because that drives the Asia Pacific operating prices and costs.\nWhen oil price comes up, which the expectations are that that's going to be constructive as we move into 2025 and beyond, there hasn't been a lot of investment in oil production. Demand is back above. Demand for oil is back above where we were pre-pandemic, and yet we have big parts of the market that are not back above where we were pre-pandemic.\nI think the outlook for demand is that the demand is going to come as the global markets improve, but the supply is going to lag. Where we're sitting here at $80 oil, that could firm up. You could start to see the top end of oil, you know, be pitched more toward $90, $100 as you get into the 2025, 2026 timeframe. That has a pretty substantial impact to the bottom line in Sadara. Near term, we're going to navigate our costs at Sadara to keep the costs down and to be able to handle those feedstock costs longer term, obviously lean into the market as the economy improves.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim you, you just made a couple of comments that siloxane's capacity could be absorbed by, by demand growth. To me, you sound a little more positive here than than in the past. Do you think this upstream silicones market could, could see margin uplift maybe within the next 12 months, or is this a, a longer-term project?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow",
    "content2": "Yeah, if you look at the amount of capacity that's coming on in 2024 versus what came on in 2023, it's down quite a bit. You've got a couple of projects. There's four projects in China that are coming on, and I think a couple of them could delay beyond 2024. The downstream markets have been continuing to grow, and we've been continuing to invest and debottlenecking. It's just the amount of upstream that's come on has added to that.\nThe other positive that's happened is obviously silica metal prices have come down too, and so that helps on the input side of things. I think you're going to see that, you know, as the downstream demand continues to improve and as the global economy continues to improve, we're going to see that as the project pipeline for buildings continues to grow.\nRemember, this goes into everything. It can go into high-rise buildings. It can go into new airports. It can go into schools and all kinds of other construction. Those are big volume pools. I think as you start to see construction activity pick up, and then you're going to see that ramp. We're seeing strong demand in areas. Obviously, EVs were a big part of it. 5G and connectivity is a big part of it.\nData centers, so as you're looking at things like how to handle cooling on data centers, silicon fluids are dielectrics, and some immersive cooling applications in data centers, which are big energy hogs and need energy efficiency. That's a growth area for us as well. Then the normal downstream demand in consumer goods and beauty care products continues to be good. I'm optimistic.\nYou know, maybe it may take more into late 2024 and into 2025 to see it, but I, I do feel like we're going to start to move toward mid-cycle in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. That's a good segue, actually, to what I was thinking about was, you know, if you think about the guidance that you're issuing here for Q1, it looks to be in the $1.3 billion or so level for EBITDA, give or take a little bit. Annualizing that will get you to $5.2, you know, or, and then you maybe add in a little bit for seasonality.\nIt gets you to closer to $6 billion. Would you consider that kind of trough-like conditions? As you move through the year in 2024, what are some of the things that makes you excited that we could, you know, maybe achieve mid-cycle by when you're exiting the year? I guess maybe if you can just comment on what your expectations are for China growth going forward. Obviously, we'll likely see a maybe a slower growth environment for the next four or five years versus the last four or five years. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that as well. Thanks.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I think that, you know, the things that are concerning to me as we're moving forward is no new capacity coming in in plastics and Packaging and Specialty Plastics. You've got high operating rates in all the cost-advantaged regions of the world, and you've got export arbitrage window open to China, as I mentioned, double-digit growth for us in China.\nI think our view is we're able to move, continue to move products. India has been strong, so we're moving product into India. Mexico has been really strong. We supply a lot of plastics to Mexico by rail. I think that's all positive. I would say, you know, our view in the Americas, our view in Asia Pacific is China comes back, you know, so will the rest of Asia Pacific. Then our view in Europe is a bit mixed.\nEnergy cost is better in Europe, which I think in the short term helps. It's not as big a drag as it was. I think longer term, you know, Europe's got some structural issues. If we can't get energy costs down even lower, it puts a big weight on the consumer, which puts a big weight on demand, but puts additional weight on the industrial economy.\nFortunately, we've got some cost-advantage positions there that help us. I think we'll navigate through that. Back half of the year, you know, we've got industrial solutions coming back to full strength. We've got our new projects coming on that I just mentioned, $3 to 400 million from that. You know, that's all in that volume growth number that I talked about.\nThen margin expansions, just the oil to gas spread on our existing business and the strength that we're going to see in some pricing and polyethylene for the year. I think we're going to ramp in to 2025, get ourselves kind of back onto a mid-cycle run rate. You know, we're going to, well, in the meantime, we're going to pull the levers like we've been doing to manage cash, keep the balance sheet strong, and be the first mover in the next wave with the Alberta project, just like we were with Texas-9. This is the right time to do it. This is the time to lock in the low cost for construction, and we're ready to roll.\n\nOperator\n\nThis ends our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Gupta for closing remarks.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nYeah, thanks, Rob. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call, and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within approximately 48 hours. This concludes our call. Thank you again.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If you would like to ask a question during that time, please press star followed by the one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I am Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President, and joining me are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note our comments contain forward-looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the earnings news release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the earnings news release and slides that are posted on our website. On slide two, you will see the agenda for our call.\nJim will review our Q3 results and operating segment performance. Howard will provide an update on our cost-savings actions and financial position, and share our outlook and modeling guidance. To close, Jim will outline how our long-term growth and sustainability roadmap continues to enable value creation as we navigate challenging short-term dynamics. Following that, we will take your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning on slide three, for the Q3, we continue to advance our long-term strategy while also taking action to reduce costs and maximize cash generation in the face of slow global macroeconomic activity and higher sequential feedstock costs. In particular, we continue to implement targeted actions to deliver $1 billion in cost savings in 2023 and delivered a sequential improvement to operating cash flow of more than $300 million. Net sales were $10.7 billion, down 24% versus a year ago period, reflecting declines in all operating segments due to slower global macroeconomic activity. Sales were down 6% sequentially as volume gains were more than offset by lower local prices. Volume decreased 6% year over year, mainly due to lower merchant hydrocarbons and energy sales. Volume was up 1% sequentially, led by gains in Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure and Performance Materials and Coatings.\nVolume was up 3% sequentially, excluding merchant sales and hydrocarbons and energy, with gains across all operating segments. Local price decreased 18% year over year, with declines in all operating segments and regions, primarily due to lower feedstock and energy costs. Sequentially, price was down 7%, primarily in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India, or EMEA. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $626 million, down from $1.2 billion in the year-ago period and $885 million in the prior quarter. Our consistent focus on cash flow generation and working capital management enabled Team Dow to generate cash flow from operations of $1.7 billion, resulting in cash flow conversion of 129% for the quarter and 103% on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to invest in our long-term strategic priorities while also returning $617 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.\nYear to date, we've returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders. Our cash flow generation continues to enable Dow to fully cover its capital allocation priorities, and our balance sheet remains the best it has been in four decades, supported by strong investment-grade credit ratings with no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027. Now, turning to our operating segment performance on slide four. In the packaging and specialty plastics segment, operating EBIT was $476 million, compared to $785 million in the year-ago period. Local price declines were driven by lower polyethylene and olefin prices in all regions, primarily as a result of lower global energy costs. Volume declined as increased polyethylene demand across all regions was more than offset by lower volumes in merchant hydrocarbons and energy sales. Sequentially, operating EBIT decreased by $442 million, driven by lower integrated polyethylene margins, increased planned maintenance activity, and lower licensing revenue.\nMoving to the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $21 million, compared to $167 million in the year-ago period. Results were driven by lower prices and demand in both businesses, as well as reduced supply availability due to an unplanned event in industrial solutions at our Louisiana operations. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $56 million, driven by volume gains and lower costs, which were partly offset by the Louisiana event. In the performance materials and coatings segment, operating EBIT was $179 million, compared to $302 million in the year-ago period, driven by local price declines in both businesses. Volume was down as gains in commercial building and construction end markets were more than offset by lower demand for personal care and coatings applications in residential construction. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $113 million, driven by higher operating rates and cost savings.\nNext, I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and actions on slide five.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. We expect the challenging macroeconomic dynamics to continue through the Q4, including sluggish industrial activity. Global manufacturing PMI has declined for the 13th consecutive month in September. It also includes weak demand in Europe and a slower-than-expected recovery in China. While inflation continues to moderate, it remains at elevated levels, resulting in a continuation of a tighter monetary policy. In the US, we're seeing some mixed indicators as September manufacturing PMI improved to 49.8. Retail sales growth remains positive, while consumer confidence has declined for the last two months. In Europe, industrial and consumer demand remains weak despite sharply lower inflation. PMI has contracted for 15 consecutive months through September, and consumer confidence remains low. With that said, automotive demand is showing signs of resilience. In China, while manufacturing PMI remained in expansionary territory in September, China exports fell for the fifth straight month.\nAutomotive sales and production are a bright spot, rising in August both sequentially and over the prior year in September. Around the rest of the world, India's manufacturing PMI remains expansionary, while in Mexico, industrial production rose for more than 20 months in August. However, ASEAN manufacturing PMI contracted for the first time in two years in September. Against this macroeconomic backdrop, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our operations while leveraging our diverse global portfolio and our cost-advantaged assets. Turning to slide six, our commitment to financial and operational discipline continues to be reflected in the proactive actions we are implementing to lower our costs and maximize cash flow. We achieved $700 million in cost savings year to date and remain on track to deliver our $1 billion commitment in 2023.\nIn addition, we are further enhancing our financial flexibility as we execute on our capital allocation priorities across the economic cycle. For example, we're implementing continued actions to improve our working capital to maximize cash flow. As a result, our cash conversion cycle has improved by approximately eight days from pre-COVID levels, and we have unlocked approximately $600 million of cash from working capital in the Q3. Since spin, we have taken actions to strengthen our balance sheet, ensuring ample liquidity while reducing net debt and pension liabilities, and we are continuing to take actions to further de-risk our pension plans. Dow's pension-funded status has greatly improved, driven primarily by changes in the discount rate and the $1 billion voluntary contribution we made in 2021. Our decision to freeze the US deferred benefit plans at year-end 2023 further reduced the pension liability.\nWe expect to pursue additional de-risking opportunities for our pension plans in the Q4, including annuitization and risk transfer of some pension liabilities. If these transactions are executed, we expect to record a one-time non-cash and non-operating settlement charge in the range of $500 million to $1 billion in the Q4 of 2023. All in, our targeted actions have given us the ability to continue investing in growth while delivering more than 80% of operating income back to our shareholders, well above our 65% target. Turning to our outlook for the Q4 on slide seven, in the packaging and specialty plastics segment, industry data shows a continued decline in US Gulf Coast inventory levels, driven by resilient domestic demand and export market strength. Higher polyethylene prices and elevated oil-to-gas spreads continue to favor our cost-advantage footprint and are expected to generate a $100 million tailwind in the quarter.\nAdditionally, we expect a $25 million tailwind as we complete planned maintenance activity at our cracker in St. Charles, Louisiana. We also expect a $50 million headwind to equity earnings due to a planned turnaround at our joint venture in Thailand. In the Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure segment, we expect seasonal demand increases in de-icing fluid to offset seasonal volume declines in building and construction end markets. Additionally, we expect a headwind of $25 million due to elevated energy and feedstock costs, particularly in Europe, impacting our polyurethanes and our construction chemicals businesses. In the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, we expect the current macroeconomic conditions to limit consumer discretionary spending in non-service areas. We also expect margin pressure to continue in upstream siloxanes from competitive supply additions, which will result in a $25 million headwind.\nAdditionally, the seasonal decline in building and construction demand is expected to contribute an approximately $50 million headwind in the quarter. All in, we expect Q4 earnings to be in line with the Q3. Next, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Howard. Moving to slide eight, we continue to make progress on both our Decarbonize and Grow and Transform the Waste strategies, which by 2030 position us to deliver more than $3 billion in underlying earnings while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5 million metric tons and commercializing 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually. Starting with Decarbonize and Grow, in September, we achieved startup of a new MDI distillation and pre-polymers facility at our manufacturing site in Freeport, Texas. This new facility replaces Dow's existing capacity in La Porte, Texas, and expands supply by an additional 30% at the site to support high-value demand growth in polyurethane systems, while also reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 45% compared to the La Porte asset. Our Path to Zero project in Alberta remains on track.\nWe expect a final investment decision by year-end, pending completion of our subsidies and incentives with the Canadian federal government. Additionally, we recently announced a solar power purchase agreement with MSU Green Energy in Bahia Blanca, Argentina, which will drive the site to source 75% of its electric power supply from renewable sources by 2025. In Terneuzen, the Dutch government informed us that they need more time for adjustments to certain rules and regulations critical to enabling carbon capture and clean hydrogen. The public-private partnership is a crucial element of our Path to Zero effort at Terneuzen. Dow investment and timing will depend on the level of collaboration, subsidies available, and a clear regulatory framework. We will continue to engage with the Dutch government to advance these efforts. We continue to advance our Transform the Waste strategy. In the Q3, we successfully leveraged our U.S.\nGulf Coast assets for bio and circular feedstock processing, accomplishing a key milestone to utilize existing assets to quickly scale production of recycled and bio-based products. This was a direct enabler to the commercial launch of our sustainable SURLYN ionomers, which support high-end applications like perfume and cosmetics packaging. In addition, Valoregen in France and Mura Technology in the UK remain on track to start up their respective mechanical and advanced recycling facilities by year-end. All in, we expect that our initiatives to develop a circular ecosystem will generate more than $500 million of incremental run rate EBITDA by 2030. Altogether, we remain confident in our long-term growth with continued focus on a more sustainable future while maintaining a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. Next, an update on our Path to Zero project in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, on slide nine.\nThe project will enable Dow to capture sustainable growth opportunities while also delivering on our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and advancing our long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Construction is planned to begin next year, with phase one startup expected in 2027 and phase two expected in 2029. We expect to spend an average of $1 billion of CapEx annually on this key growth project, with total enterprise CapEx ramping above depreciation and amortization levels in the 2025 to 2027 time period as we implement the first phase. We remain fully committed to keeping our CapEx within D&A across the economic cycle and expect to return to those levels as we complete the project. We are expecting bottom-line returns on our Alberta Path to Zero project equal to or better than our Texas-9 investment.\nTurning to slide 10, we are partnering with brand owners and leaders across the value chain to strategically enable and scale waste management transformation through mechanical recycling, advanced recycling, and bio-based solutions. This allows us to lead the way to a more circular economy and become a major offtaker of circular feedstock while also minimizing capital outlay for Dow. Robust industry demand for these solutions is expected to outpace supply through the end of this decade. We expect Dow's differentiated innovation portfolio to create opportunities that will result in more than $500 million in incremental earnings by 2030. Continuing on slide 11, our actions to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually are driven by a robust pipeline of strategic partnerships. These collaborations enable us to deliver innovative solutions to meet increasing brand owner demand.\nFor example, our partnership with P&G China to enable recyclability of air capsule e-commerce packaging delivers an effective and efficient way to protect products while avoiding excessive packaging. Dow's SPECFLEX CIR foam system uses recycled waste from the automotive industry to produce circular polyurethane-based materials matching the performance of existing products, as seen in the recent launch of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. Our collaboration with LVMH Beauty is pioneering circular feedstocks for sustainable packaging in the cosmetics industry. This has enabled Dow's first sales of bio-based and advanced recycling polymers in the Q4. Closing on slide 12, since spin, we have executed against our strategic priorities and consistently demonstrated financial and operational discipline. As a result of our proactive actions, our underlying earnings and cash flow generations are well above pre-COVID levels, and our balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been, especially in this part of the cycle.\nOur global scale and leading positions across key value chains, paired with our cost-advantaged assets and industry-leading feedstock flexibility, position Dow well to respond quickly to evolving market trends and capture above GDP demand growth across our attractive market verticals. These distinct competitive advantages will continue to enable us to execute our capital allocation priorities while also driving long-term value growth for our shareholders. Finally, before we move to Q&A, I would like to speak to the announcement this morning that Howard has elected to retire from the company following 33 years of dedicated service. I want to personally thank Howard for his significant contributions to Dow over the last three decades. He's been an incredible business and strategic partner, created a financial and leadership team that guided our company through numerous challenges and accomplishments, and most importantly, he's been a tremendous colleague and friend.\nIn addition to recognizing and thanking Howard, we're pleased to share that the board has elected Jeff Tate to the role of CFO effective 1 November 2023. As we thank Howard for his years of service, and there will be time to honor and recognize him for that, we're excited to welcome Jeff back to Dow. Many of you will remember Jeff, who also previously led Dow's investor relations team. He returns to us following a four-year stint as the CFO of Leggett & Platt. Prior to that, Jeff had 27 years with Dow in various finance roles, including VP of Finance for Packaging and Specialty Plastics, and was our lead auditor. Jeff is joining us here today, and we'll look forward to him joining our next earnings call in his formal role. In the meantime, more to follow as we all work together through this transition.\nAs I noted, this change will become effective 1 November, and Howard will stay on to support the handover through early January when he'll formally retire from Dow. Howard, I'll now turn the mic over to you for a few comments.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. I really appreciate those comments and thoughts, and I would like to share a few personal thoughts of my own. You know, I've had the good fortune of being Dow's CFO for nearly a decade and president for the last five, and they have truly been the best roles of my career. Jim, it was an absolute honor to serve with you and the rest of the leadership team. We have accomplished a great deal together, and I am extremely proud of not only what we have delivered for all of our stakeholders, but also how we have done it. Dow is a great company. Our Decarbonize and Grow strategy is absolutely the right path forward, and our balance sheet, as you've said, is in the best shape it's been in four decades, and that's as a direct result of our disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach.\nThe Dow culture and the incredibly smart, hardworking people who embrace it each and every day all over the world are absolutely second to none. After more than 33 years at Dow, this is the right moment for me to move on to my next chapter, and I could not be more excited to hand the finance reins over to Jeff Tate. Jeff and I have known each other for more than 25 years. We have worked alongside each other, and I consider him to be a great professional as well as a friend, and he is absolutely the right leader to help take Dow to the next level of performance together with Jim and the leadership team. While I'm retiring from Dow, I am not heading to the beach or the golf course. I am excited about my next chapter and the opportunities that lie ahead.\nWith that said, I bleed Dow red, Pantone 185 for those of you checking the color wheel, and I will always be a supporter, a fan, and a friend of Team Dow. With that, I'll turn it to Pankaj to open the Q&A.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, Howard. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you wish to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star one again. We ask that you restrict yourself to one question, please. One moment for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is open.\n\nHassan Ahmed\n\nCo-founder and Head of Research, Alembic Global\n\nMorning, Howard and Jim. Howard, sorry to see you leave, but obviously wishing you the best wishes for your future sort of endeavors. You know, in terms of my question, you guys obviously talked about $100 million worth of tailwind, EBIT tailwind on the P&SP side of things, and you cited, you know, expanding oil to natural gas ratios. I just want to sort of delve a little deeper into that. What sort of pricing regime for polyethylene are you baking into that? What sort of pricing regime for ethane are you baking into that?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nGood morning, Hassan. Yeah, as we mentioned, we're guiding for the Q4 in line with the Q3. It'll obviously be a different mix. I expect packaging, especially plastics, to be up. They had, obviously, the weight of the St. Charles turnaround on them in the Q3, and they also had the fact that we were out of the merchant ethylene market. When you look at the core underlying volumes, polyethylene volumes were up in all regions year over year, and they were up sequentially 3% in Asia, Latin America, and EMEA, so those are good signs. Things that you should take into account is we obviously don't have the St. Charles turnaround in the Q4. We do have a little bit of a headwind from the Thailand turnaround. We're expecting. We saw prices up in September.\nI'm expecting Q4 integrated margins to be up about $0.02 in P&SP, and that's mostly on the back of pricing. The outlook right now is for ethane to be flat. It could be slightly better than that, but I think for right now we've got it in as flat. We've got inventories down for three consecutive quarters in the US and plastics, and US Gulf Coast exports were up 7% versus the previous quarter, and the previous quarter was up about 3.5% versus the quarter before. So I think all in all, I would expect volumes to be good. We'll be back in the merchant ethylene market to some extent. Propane spread in Europe is positive at about $120 a ton, and our assets are the lowest cost in Europe.\nI think when you factor all that in, the guide for Q4 is heavily on the back of P&SP delivery.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you again, Howard. It's been an absolute pleasure, and best of luck. Jim, Howard, second-half EBITDA is running around $5 billion annualized, maybe a little bit more than that. How do you grow? If the macro stays the same as it is today, how does EBITDA increase materially next year?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, David. Good question. Obviously, we're about 12 to 15 months into this economic slowdown, and typically when we see a slowdown like we saw starting mid-last year, about 12 to 18 months we start to see things turn in a positive direction. Inflation is the thing that's weighing on people's minds right now. You know, we're continuing to invest in organic growth while at the same time manage our costs. We've got investments in all three segments, both incremental investments as well as new plant investments. They will start up, you know, through this year. This year we expect those add an underlying $400 to 500 million of EBITDA mid-cycle run rate to the bottom line. On top of that, you know, we're continuing to see strength in areas like telecommunications and data centers.\nAutomotive, even in the face of the strikes, is holding up relatively well, and our view is that it should bounce back once the agreements are made between the UAW and the auto workers. Our cost positions are good, and so I think that we're positioned that once the weight of inflation starts to moderate, that things start to turn back in a positive direction, and our view is that we could be in a better shape for 2024. Additionally, we've taken $1 billion of cost out since spin, so if you think about where we're operating today, we're able to meet all of our capital allocation requirements, be free cash flow before financing break-even. You saw a $300 million improvement this quarter in operating cash flows, and we were still able to opportunistically buy back some shares in Q3.\nSo we've done our best to really manage to be able to get through the bottom of the cycle, and it's the right time for us to continue to make our organic investments to get the benefit in the next upcycle.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nDavid, this is Howard Ungerleider. Thanks for your comments, Hassan. Same to you as well. The only other thing I would add, David, to your question is don't forget about cash, right? So, I mean, Jim laid out our EBITDA or our EBITDA improvements, but we've equally been doing cash flow improvements really every year since spin, if you think about it. So the last five or six years, every year we've been able to increase cash flow. We'll see if we can do that this year, but a couple of things. You know, we are able to cover all of our capital allocation priorities, inclusive of continuing to buy stock back even at these low EBITDA levels, and every year we've had between $1 and 3 billion of what we like to call unique to Dow cash levers, and I would expect that to continue into next year.\nWhen you think about, you know, the $500 million plus judgment that we will likely get finally from Nova on the last tranche, continued structural working capital improvements, additional cash that we can pursue out of our joint ventures, and other projects that we currently have in the pipeline. So, you know, you should expect at least another billion dollars of unique to Dow cash flow levers coming out of next year on top of the organic investments that Jim talked about.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nResearch Analyst, Morgan Stanley.\n\nThank you, and let me also echo the prior remarks and congratulations to you, Howard. Very, very exciting for you. If I could ask, just looking at slide nine on the CapEx, I just want to make sure I understand. I mean, obviously we know where 2023 is. It looks like 2024 is going to go to that D&A line, and then at 2025 to 2027, it looks like there's quite a, you know, there's sort of a zone there. Could you speak to a little bit of maybe a range that you could give us to make sure we have that right in our models and sort of what would define it at the lower end or the upper end of the range?\nBecause I see, you know, you do have Alberta at about $1 billion a year, but is it maybe going to be a bit chunkier in some of those years, or just how should we be thinking about the cadence and the range of CapEx during that period of time?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nHey, good morning, Vince. Yeah, as we get into the Alberta project, it'll be 2025 to 2027. That is the peak construction of that project. Phase one starts up in 2027. You would expect that we would get to somewhere in the three to three and a half range for CapEx during that 2025 to 2027 timeframe. That's very similar to where we were during the Gulf Coast project. We peaked at kind of that same level. Obviously, we're in a little bit different spot than we were at Gulf Coast. We're just doing Alberta Path to Zero, but we're also funding growth in industrial solutions, which is high-value growth and downstream incremental growth in our consumer solutions business.\nSo I think it'll be very manageable, and as we get closer to those dates, we'll try to titrate more specifically so that you have some, you know, year-over-year expectations on what CapEx is going to look like.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Zekauskas\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. In your $1 billion cost-cutting program, how much of that comes out of SG&A and R&D? And in your slides, you say that your share count in Q4 is 710, and in Q3 it was 707.5. Are you rounding, or is the share count going up?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, Jeff, good morning. On the cost, about half of the costs come out of our structural operating cost model, which would include, obviously, making sure that we're controlling SG&A during this time period. It also includes things like contract labor and what we've been doing there to reduce headcount. On our operating cost side, it's things like purchase raw material and logistics costs, utilities costs being down, our turnaround spend, which is down about $300 million, and while SG&A is down both in cost and as a percent of sales, we're obviously still continuing to invest in research as we go forward. Howard, do you want to touch on the share count?\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nYeah, Jeff, I was smiling. So yes, it is just purely rounding. The share count actually went down about 2 million shares quarter-on-quarter. Year on year, it went down 11 million shares. You know, and I would say two things. We are going to continue, as long as we have the free cash flow before financing, to continue to buy at dilution, and we will also continue to be opportunistic when we have cash available and/or we believe it's a great investment. And so we're continuing to buy shares on a regular basis, and you should expect that to continue in the Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nThank you, Howard. Hey, congrats. Thanks for all the help and friendship over the years, and certainly looking forward to your next chapter. You know, this Q3 was the Q3 in a row of sequentially higher volumes. I was wondering what your expectations are as we finish the year and into 2024. Is this a trend that we can continue to see?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Frank. I think on volumes in P&SP, I would still be positive around what we see on polyethylene demand in all the regions. I also mentioned telecommunications and the fact that we've seen a lot of demand in infrastructure, data centers, etc., and so the wire and cable business is one which is very positive. I would say industrial solutions will be limited a bit in Q4 because of the outage in Plaquemine, but the demand, other than that, the demand is there once that plant is back up and running. In PM&C, you know, for consumer solutions for coatings, you're going to see Q4 slowdown, which we typically see with architectural coatings, but other than that, the silicones downstream demand has been holding up pretty well.\nThis is Q1 that we've seen core underlying volumes in all three segments better year over year. I mean, if you take away merchant ethylene sales in Q3 because we had the cracker down in St. Charles, the underlying downstream demand for all three segments was better in Q3 than it was last year. That's the first time we can say that in several years. So I'm optimistic with that. We can see the automotive strike resolved. I think we'll see a tick up in that demand as well. China continues to be good. We saw a good quarter-over-quarter demand in China in P&SP, slightly up in polyurethanes quarter-over-quarter, up in consumer solutions, and flat to just slightly down in the other two.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sisson of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nRichard Garchitorena\n\nVP of Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, this is Richard on for Mike. I was just wondering to follow up on that, if you could give us some color on where your operating rates are across your segments, where do you see them for the industry, specifically for polyethylene, and how should we think about the potential improvement in EBITDA if we do get a stronger demand environment next year and you can ramp those operating rates up to optimal levels? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I'll take a look at it both by segments, but I think you also have to take a look at it by regions. In P&SP, you're going to see operating rates substantially north of 80%. Obviously, when you think about Canada, the US Gulf Coast, Argentina, our Middle East assets, all cost-advantage positions, even Terneuzen and Tarragona with prop-naph spreads of greater than $100-$120 a ton, that advantages them versus their competition within Europe. So I think you'll see all those operating rates continue to be strong, and we're not building inventory. We're obviously able to meet that and move into the export market. Where you see things a little bit softer, obviously construction-related segments, so in polyurethanes, which has a pretty heavy European footprint, we see lower operating rates there. We see that as well even on the Gulf Coast.\nIn industrial solutions, operating rates have been good. Our own issue in Plaquemine is the thing that has that capacity out. And then in consumer solutions, on silicones, we tend to see good operating rates in the quarter, above 80%. And if you take a look at PM&C, you know, those are slightly down because of the typical year-end slowdown in demand in coatings. So all in all, I feel good that we're positioned to be able to ramp up to meet demand as it comes up. Our cost-advantage regions are continuing to run strong, as you would expect, and we're watching closely for the demand signals that'll pull us into 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYes, good morning. Jim, I'd appreciate your outlook for Dow's construction-facing businesses heading into 2024. Some of the companies that we cover are pointing to meaningful benefits from infrastructure and reshoring-related investments, basically fiscal stimulus. On the other hand, we've got rising rates, and you know, that typically has a chilling effect. So how do you see those countervailing trends netting out for Dow and affecting the way you're planning for the future?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Kevin. The things we watch on construction, obviously on commercial construction, just the completion rates on existing builds and the permit work that's going on on new builds. I would say this has been a relatively strong year on commercial because there have been a lot of projects that were in flight. We're starting to see, obviously, some tick up in applications for permits on residential for, you know, the non-commercial side of things, which is good. But I think as long as there's a question out there on rates and will rates continue to rise, that's going to put a lid on what we'll see on residential construction. In terms of infrastructure, we are seeing some movement in that space.\nI would say the biggest rate-limiting step on infrastructure is permitting, so the speed at which people can get permits, whether that's for, it could be for pipelines, it could be for transmission cabling, you name it, but there could be some limitations there, and we keep an eye on that. Overall, I feel good about the fact that, you know, we're moving through the toughest phase of it right now, and if we could see some positive growth come back in the construction markets in China and the US, that'll be a nice upside for us in 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you. The inventory chart you have on slide six is intriguing. What I'm curious about is, for each of your businesses, do you have a view as to how much your customers have destocked your products relative to their end-market demand? And thus, how much of this, you know, sequential decline that you've seen 12, 15 months is destocking versus just end-market underlying demand weakness? You showed some sequential improvement in each of your businesses in this Q3. Is that just destocking coming to an end, or do you think that this is really some firming demand by your customers?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Steve. It's a good question. Obviously, we get industry data that we published on the chart that you see there. When it comes to downstream, when we get into the consumer brands and the retailer space, we have to go on reported data that we glean out of their public reports. But just a few things to keep in mind. We know in the auto sector, for example, that with the OEMs, it's been pretty much hand-to-mouth because there have been other rate-limiting steps, like the ability to get computer chips. We haven't seen a big restocking with the OEMs. We've seen the OEMs continuing to run because they want to be in a position to ramp up when the strikes get settled. So I would say I don't feel like there's a lot of restocking going on there.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nI would say, on the consumer brands and the pharma companies, lately seeing them obviously watching inventory levels, I don't get any sense of any stocking or big destocking going on there. I think it's running more to meet demand. And then the other thing we take a look at is obviously what's going on with the construction segments, as I just mentioned. But it's a little bit harder. It's a little bit fuzzier when we get into the downstream. We don't have as much published data to rely on, so we look more at PMI. We look more at retail sales. We look more at what they comment on in their public filings.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nChemicals Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. And Howard, again, congratulations. You've been a huge help over the years. So the question would just be on the II&I segment. It came in; it looks like solidly better than kind of what you were expecting when you gave the outlook on the Q2 call. So curious what the factors were that drove it. And I guess if we back out the operations problem, you know, you're kind of at a 250 run rate in terms of EBITDA. Is that a reasonable way to think about how you start out looking at 2024?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, John. On II&I, we obviously saw strong demand on the energy side, which is industrial solutions, and the mobility side, which is more the polyurethane side. You know, durable goods are still lower than they were in the year-ago period. We also had, you know, a little bit better because Sadara had had some lower operating rates from some maintenance time and is coming back out of that, so I think that'll continue to be a positive upside. You know, there's price pressure, obviously, on polyurethanes. We're going to see some positive impact from the new isocyanate capacity down in Freeport, which will be there. The business also did a lot of work on their costs, so their EBITDA was up because they're also managing their costs. I don't think in Q4 you'll see any higher impact on Plaquemine unplanned event.\nYou know, we saw about $100 million in Q3. You'll see that kind of flat to Q4. Then the target is to try to get that asset up and running in Q2 next year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Specter of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and I want to echo my congrats to Howard and [inaudible] for joining. Thank you both of you. So I just wanted to ask on the siloxanes side within PMC, made some comments on kind of some increased pressure there. I mean, you've been under pressure in that business all year from added supply. Has anything changed in the last few months, or is that just a reiteration of what you've seen? And as you think about next year, how much did things have to improve for that business to get back to a normal, healthy level?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good morning, Josh. Obviously, in siloxanes, there was significant new capacity in 2022 and 2023, and we expect that to moderate in 2024 and beyond. That's put pressure on siloxanes prices, primarily in Europe or in Asia, which are at the lowest levels that they've been at in quite some time. They're starting to move up a bit in Q4, some demand-related, some obviously related to higher silicones pricing, upstream silicon metals pricing, which is kind of moving things up. But I think what you're going to start to see is that you're going to have less capacity coming on, and the downstream market continues to grow at good rates, and we'll start to absorb some of that, and we'll start to see operating rates improve 2024, 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham of Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVice President and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. On the long-term decarbonization strategy, you know, given the weaker macro and, you know, what seems to be some deceleration in appetite to tackle the green transition, how do you think about the risk to public-private partnerships, subsidies, incentives in North America and abroad?\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nYeah, good question. Obviously, our view on the Alberta project is we're working in an environment that's supportive of decarbonization. There's a price on carbon in Canada. There's existing carbon capture infrastructure, and there's obviously some investment credits for the hydrogen portion of the project. And so those are all positive. As we mentioned, though, we have to keep in mind that this is also going to be a very low-cost asset from an ethane supply capability standpoint. So that's why we say our expectation is the returns will be at or above our Texas-9 Cracker, which is the best project that we've ever had in our history. Having said that, we always have to keep our eyes wide open to what's going on on the incentive space. We're not going to build just on the back of incentives.\nWe've got to make sure that we make investments that are long-term, low-cost operating investments where we have advantaged feedstocks and we have access to market. That same thing is true when we get into circularity projects. And when we talk about our advanced and mechanical recycling projects, we've got to make sure that the partnerships that we have are looking long-term at where they're going to access the waste. Will they be the low-cost position, and will they have the right access to market? So we're looking at them project by project. We're absolutely convinced that our timing is right on the Alberta project. We get this one final issue nailed down with the Canadian federal government. We should have FID before the end of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst of Chemicals and Packaging, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I'll add my congrats to you, Howard. Definitely a pleasure working with you over the years. Appreciate your insights. Yeah, I guess I just had a question on China. Maybe you could just update us on what you're seeing there. Obviously, very important for most of your markets. You know, you noted that volumes were up across the three businesses year on year if you remove the merchant ethylene sales. But I guess, what are you seeing in China? Maybe if you could characterize kind of polyethylene demand, you know, maybe some impacts from on the consumer side as well as construction, that'd be great. Thanks. And your outlook?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, good question. I mean, obviously, GDP growth this year is expected to be about 5%. That's been on the back of consumer demand, and that's really been the government's position as consumer-driven recovery from a slowdown. Our expectation is, because of what's going on in the housing construction markets, there will be some pressure on the government for some stimulus activity to get things moving there. Manufacturing PMI in September was up, so it's the second consecutive month up, which is good. Automotive sales were up about 9.5% year over year in September. EV sales are up about 38% year to date. Retail sales were up 5.5% in September, and we saw rises in the sale of clothes and textiles, as well as some refined oil products.\nI would say, you know, one of the things that we've always looked at in terms of coming out of a slowdown is the price of MEG. One of the things that drives the price of MEG is the operating rate on the polyester plants, which are above 70% right now. We haven't seen that in quite some time. I think it's a little bit early to call that as the turn, but it's something to keep an eye on. And the volume moves quarter over quarter are good. Packaging has held up really well, and it typically does in an economic slowdown because of the nature of food packaging, medical packaging, day-to-day consumer, non-durable items.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Chemicals, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, good morning, guys. In both PMC and IQ, if you could walk through pricing you called out is down sequentially in each of the SBUs, but yet EBITDA was up in both segments sequentially. So could you walk through and just tell us, like, where was the spread getting better because raw materials were falling more than price was down, and how much of that was kind of the structural cost that you guys are trying to take out that we would put in as kind of permanent?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, so if you look at II&I, the Louisiana outage was obviously a headwind. And then you had some turnaround tailwinds and cost savings, about $40 million. Variable costs, you know, on the benzene and propylene side really compressed there. And then equity earnings from Sadara were a little bit better. So those were the moving parts. In PM&C, you had tailwinds of about $60 million from the turnaround and cost savings, so that's to the positive. You had some seasonality and lower siloxane prices to the negative. And, you know, we had also improved supply availability of siloxanes and some opportunistic monomer sales in the coating side of the business. Acrylates were strong in the quarter. So that was the, those were the things that net-net made the swing in those two segments.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc\n\nThanks. Good morning. And Howard, congratulations. Just wanted to follow up on PMC. I would say a pretty healthy number. Is this a good level that we can use for thinking about next year? It sounded just in the previous answer there were some opportunistic sales. So that's sort of where my question is coming from. Is this a real sustainable number to think about going forward earnings in the segment?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I think as siloxanes improve, you can see some positive uptick in consumer solutions and silicones. The downstream demand has continued to be strong, so that hasn't been the primary issue. And we're seeing still continued good positive signs in the downstream demand sector, things like EVs and battery production. We'll have to watch, you know, the commercial construction markets. I think residential will start to improve somewhat, but household and personal care, consumer products, health and beauty, I would say, are going to continue to be positive in that space. Coatings have been slow due to construction. I think there's some signs starting that applications for permits are starting to pick up on construction. That's kind of a US-centric view. And in China, we'll have to watch if there's any stimulus to get the construction markets going there. Automotive, I would say, is a bright spot globally.\nEven Europe, in spite of a slow GDP, has seen pretty strong automotive builds through the year. I would say once we get the strikes resolved here with the UAW and the big automakers, I think you'll see a step up in demand because they'll start to be competing again for that market share.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nSo good morning. I just want to revisit the inventory level. If you think about lessons learned from this cycle, where do you see inventory days and working capital days shaking out at the next mid-cycle? And separately, Howard, just thank you for your help getting ramped up on Dow.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow",
    "content2": "Yeah, maybe. Howard, do you want to touch inventories? You got the working capital team, and they've been pretty focused on this all throughout.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nYeah, sure, Jim. And Laurence, thanks, and appreciate everything that you've done to cover Dow over time, and hopefully we'll continue. Yeah, we've been. Look, I've been very proud of the whole organization and how we've really, if you think about one of the big changes that we've made, I think as a leadership team, as an organization the last five or six years, is really a big step change on cash and managing cash just as well as we were managing margins, EBITDA, operating rate, and AU. You know, we have structurally taken out about eight days. When you think about it on a cash conversion cycle since spin, eight days has been structural. And the other improvements have been more around the cycle. So obviously, that will continue.\nYou know, as we've headed into this down cycle period, probably we've taken out about $1 billion of cash just on the releasing revenue from working capital as we head into a normalized macro and eventually a cyclical peak out into the future. You could expect a $1-billion use of cash. But overall, eight days out cycle to cycle, I think, is a good target so far. And I would expect that under Jeff's leadership, together with Jim and the leadership team, I would expect at least another day, maybe another two days in the next year or two will come out structurally. So I think a nice target is 10 days cycle to cycle from a structural standpoint.\nWe've implemented OMP or are in the process of implementing OMP in almost all of our businesses now and really thinking about it end-to-end from the customer back. You know, the team is still working on it, but that gives you a good range.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nJeff's going to make me cut you off before you say any more targets for him.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nJust one more day, maybe two. That's it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your last question comes from the line of Mike Leithead of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Appreciate you squeezing me in here. Just briefly on packaging, I think sequentially EBIT was down about $440 million on $480 million lower sales, almost 100% drop-through. Can you help us better understand the moving pieces in the quarter there?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nSure. The lower sales were primarily due to being out of the merchant ethylene market. So that obviously had an impact. You had the cost of the turnaround in Q3 for the St. Charles Cracker. That was a drag. That drag becomes a positive as we go into Q4. We had some stronger equity earnings, which were up from the previous quarter. But then pricing and the impact of really a surge in feedstock and energy costs that happened in Q3 were the big delta. Prices ran up on us in Q3. Then, you know, the pricing came in September, which kind of lagged the increase in the feedstock and energy costs. So you saw that margin squeeze. I think we're back to even with that, and we'll get a little bit ahead of that.\nLike I said, I expect about $0.02 integrated margin improvement as we go into Q4.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Gupta for closing remarks.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nYeah, thanks, Jill. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today, and we appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on Dow's website within approximately 48 hours. This concludes our call. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYou may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If you would like to ask a question at that time, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our webcast today. The accompanying slides are provided through this webcast and posted on our website. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President, and joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note our comments contain forward looking statements and are subject to the related cautionary statement contained in the Earnings News Release and slides. Please refer to our public filings for further information about principal risks and uncertainties.\nUnless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in the Earnings News Release slides and are posted on our website. On Slide 2 you will see the agenda for our call. Jim will begin by reviewing our second quarter results and operating segment performance.\nHoward will then share our outlook and modeling guidance and then provide an update on our cost savings actions and financial position. To close, Jim will outline how we are continuing to advance our long-term decarbonize and grow as well as Transform the Waste. Strategies while navigating challenging short term dynamics. Following that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3, we continued to navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment with slow global growth in the second quarter despite lower year-over-year sales and earnings. The Dow team delivered sequential earnings improvement by executing on our financial and operational playbook. We leveraged our diverse portfolio to capitalize on gains in packaging and modestly higher seasonal demand in building and construction. This resulted in a sequential improvement in volume. In addition, we continue to implement our $1 billion of proactive and targeted cost savings actions, delivering $250 million of savings in the quarter and $350 million year to date.\nNet sales were $11.4 billion, down 27% versus the year-ago period reflecting lower demand and prices due to slower macroeconomic activity. Sales were down 4% sequentially as volume gains were more than offset by lower local prices. Volume decreased 8% year-over-year led by a 14% decline in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India or EMEA. Volume was up 1% sequentially driven by gains in Asia Pacific and Latin America as well as in industrial intermediates and infrastructure and performance materials and coatings. Local price decreased 18% year-over- year and 5% sequentially due to lower demand on weak macroeconomic activity as well as lower global raw material costs.\nOperating EBIT for the quarter was $885 million down from $2.4 billion in the year ago period, primarily driven by lower local prices. Operating EBIT increased $177 million sequentially driven by gains in packaging and specialty plastics. We generated cash flow from operations of more than $1.3 billion up more than $800 million versus the prior quarter driven by improved working capital. On a trailing 12 month basis, our cash flow conversion is 98%. Our strong financial position gives us the flexibility to continue to advance our long-term strategic priorities supported by our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy.\nIn the quarter, we returned $743 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $1.4 billion, and our balance sheet remains healthy supported by strong investment-grade credit ratings. We also published our 2022 Intersections Report in June. The report once again received limited assurance by our external audit firm and showcases Dow's continued progress on our ambition to be the most Innovative, Customer-Centric, Inclusive, and Sustainable materials science company in the world.\nNow turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4, in the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $918 million compared to $1.4 billion in the year-ago period. Local price declines were driven by lower global energy and feedstock costs, which in turn impacted polyethylene prices across all regions. Volume decline, primarily in EMEA, were driven by lower demand for olefins and aromatics. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved by $276 million driven by lower energy and feedstock costs. Moving to the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was a loss of $35 million compared to earnings of $426 million in the year ago period.\nResults were driven by lower local prices and demand in both businesses. Volume declines were primarily driven by lower demand for consumer durables, building and construction, and industrial applications. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $158 million due to lower local prices and increased planned maintenance turnaround activity. In the performance materials and coatings segment, operating EBIT was $66 million compared to $561 million in the year ago period.\nLocal price decreases were driven primarily by declines for siloxanes and acrylic monomers. Volume was down on lower global demand for silicones and coatings applications. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $31 million, driven primarily by seasonally higher volumes. Next I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and actions on Slide 5.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We continue to expect a challenging macroeconomic environment in Q3. While inflation is beginning to moderate, the lagging effects of higher monetary policy on consumer demand and a slower than expected demand recovery in China have resulted in a slowdown of industrial economic activity around the world. In the US, industrial activity remains weak with June manufacturing PMI in contraction at 46.3. However, consumer demand has remained resilient, supported by low unemployment levels. With inflation starting to ease, consumer confidence in June is now at the highest level since early 2022.\nIn Europe, recessionary conditions persist and are expected to continue despite lower energy prices and inflation declining to a 17-month low. Industrial activity in the region continues to contract with PMI reaching the lowest level since May 2020. In China, while we are experiencing growth, the anticipated economic rebound following the end of zero-COVID restrictions has yet to fully materialize. June manufacturing PMI continues to hover around neutral level of 50, and China's exports were impacted by the global demand slowdown, contracting at the fastest pace since the beginning of the pandemic.\nAround the rest of the world, India's manufacturing PMI expanded to 57.8 in June as demand outpaced higher input costs, and ASEAN Manufacturing PMI remained in expansionary territory. Manufacturing activity in Japan, however, retreated back to contractionary levels following improvements in PMI for three consecutive months. Given these regional dynamics, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to managing our operations and adapt our business to the evolving market realities. Turning to our outlook for Q3 on Slide 6, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, industry polyethylene demand increased 4% in June.\nDespite this tailwind, we exited Q2 at lower price levels, which are expected to drive lower average prices sequentially. We're also experiencing increased feedstock costs, primarily driven by higher ethane prices on the US Gulf Coast. All in, we anticipate these market dynamics will be a $50 million headwind in the quarter. Additionally, increased planned maintenance turnaround activity at our cracker in St. Charles, Louisiana, is expected to be a $100 million headwind, and we see another $100 million headwind from the lack of project-based licensing sales from the prior quarter, which will not occur.\nHowever, we do expect to generate a $50 million tailwind in the quarter as we continue to implement our cost savings actions in the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment. While demand and energy end markets remain resilient, we expect continued demand pressure in consumer durable end markets. We anticipate a $15 million tailwind from our cost savings actions as well as a $25 million tailwind following the completion of a planned maintenance turnaround from the second quarter. Additionally, following an unplanned event at our Louisiana Operations this month, our preliminary estimate reflects a $100 million headwind to earnings.\nI want to please reinforce that this estimate is only preliminary at this point, as we get a more refined estimate we will update if needed. In the Performance Materials and Coatings segment, we expect continued price pressure in Siloxanes while seasonal demand remains below normal for building and construction end markets. Together contributing a $50 million headwind, our cost savings are on track to deliver a $35 billion tailwind for the segment. Additionally, the completion of Q2 turnarounds at our Carrollton and our Zhangjiagang siloxane facilities are anticipated to contribute a $25 million tailwind in Q3.\nOperationally, our earnings are expected to be flat with the prior quarter as our self-help is expected to fully offset the estimated margin compression. All in, we expect Q3 earnings to be down approximately $150 million sequentially before the impact of the Plaquemine outage as a result of the $50 million higher turnaround expense and the $100 million in project-driven licensing sales which will not recur. Turning to Slide 7, our commitment to financial and operational discipline enables Dow to navigate the near-term market challenges while continuing to invest for the future.\nWe are on track to deliver our $1 billion of cost savings in 2023. We achieved 35% of the savings in the first half of the year and continue to expect we will deliver the remaining 65% in the second half. This includes our previously announced global workforce reduction program, 75% of the 2,000 impacted roles exited at the end of the second quarter, and more than 90% are expected to exit by the end of the year. Our $300 million reduction in planned maintenance turnaround spending remains on track, and we're continuing to execute improvements in our raw materials, logistics, and utility costs.\nWe're also continuing to execute actions to rationalize select higher cost lower return assets in our polyurethanes, coatings, and industrial solutions businesses in line with market fundamentals. These actions support the strong financial position that team Dow has purposely built since spin. Our debt and our credit profile gives us significant flexibility and optionality to continue to advance our strategic priorities across the economic cycle. All in our actions have allowed us to lower our cash commitments by approximately $1 billion since spin driven by significantly lower cash interest and pension liabilities, reduced share count, and no joint venture cash contributions.\nFor 2023, we expect our annual net interest expense to be down more than 40% versus 2019, and we have no substantive debt maturities due until 2027, and we see more than $1 billion of unique to Dow additional cash levers going forward, including resolution of our pending NOVA litigation, structural working capital improvements, and our intervention actions. Next I'll turn it back to Jim for an update on our long term strategy.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nThank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 8, we remain confident in our long-term growth as we drive the transition to a more sustainable future with a focus on profitability and maintaining our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities. Our decarbonizing growth strategy is expected to increase underlying earnings by $3 billion annually while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 versus 2005 levels. Notable updates this quarter include our FCDh unit is now fully operational and is ramping up rates leveraging breakthrough technology. The unit expands our capacity at lower capital and cost intensity while reducing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions relative to conventional PDH units.\nIn collaboration with X-energy, we are preparing to submit a construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission for our small modular nuclear energy facility in Seadrift, Texas. We plan to break ground in 2026 and the project is expected to provide the site with safe, reliable, low-carbon power and steam. In parallel, we are utilizing a capital efficient approach to quickly scale production and grow our supply of recycled and bio-based products. By 2030, we expect to advance our Transform the Waste Strategy by commercializing 3 million metric tons per year of circular and renewable solutions.\nOur collaborations with Valoregen and Mura Technology both remain on track to start up their respective mechanical and advanced recycling facilities in Q4. Together, these investments will help us unlock long-term growth opportunities as we meet increasing customer and brand owner demand for more sustainable and circular solutions. Taking a closer look at our Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta Path to Zero project on Slide 9, this flagship project will create the world's first net zero CO2 emissions, ethylene and derivatives complex, another example of how we're delivering long-term value growth through sustainability.\nBy 2030, the project will decarbonize 20% of our global ethylene capacity while expanding our global polyethylene supply by 15%, and tripling polyethylene capacity at our Alberta site. We are on track to secure partner agreements and subsidies during the second half of this year, and we are targeting board and regulatory approval along with a final investment decision by year-end. Construction is projected to begin in 2024, and startup of the project will occur in two phases. Phase 1 will add approximately 1,300 kilotons of ethylene and polyethylene capacity annually by 2027. Phase 2 will contribute another approximately 600 kilotons annually by 2029.\nWe expect to spend on average roughly $1 billion of CapEx annually on the project beginning next year through project completion by mid decade. Our total CapEx for the company is projected to ramp above D&A between 2025 and 2027. As we implement Phase 1 of the Alberta project, we remain fully committed to keep our target CapEx within D&A across the economic cycle and expect to return to those levels after the completion of the first phase of this project at full run rates.\nWe expect the project to deliver $1 billion of EBITDA annually and targeted returns on invested capital above our enterprise goal of 13% over the economic cycle, driven by the Alberta feedstock cost advantage, which provides Dow with lower ethane costs compared to the rest of the world, even more advantaged than the US Gulf Coast, industry-leading capital efficiency building on the success of our Texas 9 Investment, which has delivered over 15% return on invested capital since startup with best-in-class capital intensity, conversion costs, and CO2 emissions, a higher value sustainable product offering.\nWhich drives value as we capitalize on technologies that deliver low- and zero-CO2 emission solutions with enhanced performance for our customers, and by leveraging third-party investments for decarbonization and CO2 infrastructure assets, which will reduce our capital spend consistent with our best owner mindset. Altogether we are well positioned to lead the industry and meet the needs of customers and brand owners as they seek products with a lower carbon footprint. Our disciplined and phased approach will enable us to decarbonize our assets, grow earnings, and keep CapEx within D&A across the cycle.\nClosing on Slide 10, Dow remains focused on advancing our long-term strategy while navigating challenging short-term market dynamics. We're proactively reducing costs and maximizing cash flow while maintaining a broad focus on financial flexibility and operating discipline. The actions we've taken since spin to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our cash generation profile are enabling us to be more resilient in the, as we deliver on our capital allocation priorities across the economic cycle.\nAs a result, we have raised our underlying earnings above pre-pandemic levels substantially, improved our three-year cumulative free cash flow, reduced our net debt and pension liabilities by more than $10 billion, and delivered around 84% of net income back to our shareholders since spin well above our target of 65% across the economic cycle. At the same time, our diverse, differentiated, and global product portfolio is well positioned to capture the above-GDP demand growth across our attractive market verticals with increasing customer demand.\nFor more sustainable and circular solutions, we'll continue to advance our decarbonize and grow and transform the waste strategies, which will raise our earnings profile, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and create a more circular economy. With that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open the Q&A.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you wish to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star one. Again, we please ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to conserve time. One moment please for your first question.Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you and good morning everyone. Wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color, perhaps by region and packaging, especially plastics for Q3, that $50 million headwind you see on a net basis between the higher feedstock costs and the lower average pricing. How do those dynamics play out in each region?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Vince. Great question. Packaging, especially plastics, was strong in all four regions of the world. We saw volume increases in all four of them, and we saw overall the biggest volume increases across all the businesses in P&SP for the quarter. In terms of the $50 million headwind, obviously June closed out a little bit softer on pricing. North America prices settled down $0.03 in June, and that's because you had some new capacity that came online during that time. Inventories came down actually during the month of June, I think, which is a reflection of the strength in China also India also exports to Mexico.\nAll three of those regions are relatively strong. Asia Pacific and Latin America led in terms of volume, and obviously Europe was the weakest of the three of the four regions. My expectations is that while feedstocks have come up a bit in North America, a lot of that is really due to the hot weather that we've had and ethane strain in natural gas. The projection is that that will continue through Q3. But if the weather breaks, then obviously we'll see some of that come out. Our expectations is we'll start with that lower pricing in July, and then we've got actions out there in July of up $0.03, up $0.05 for August and as we speak, Asia is increasing about $20 to 30 a metric ton in July.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning, Jim. Staying on the $50 million decline in feedstocks and pricing, looking at integrated margins that would suggest it would be worse than down $50 million. What are you doing to offset the perhaps great headwinds in at least consolidated margins versus your forecast, down $50 million? Thank you.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, David. Look, on integrated margins for the second quarter, I think they ended slightly higher than where we were in the first quarter, and that was good news in North America. Our expectation is that they will improve in Europe in the third quarter. Obviously, the pressure that's been on here in North America has really been from the feedstock costs. As I mentioned, there's, it's hard to project how long the feedstock costs are going to stay where they are. We know new capacity is coming in both natural gas liquids and in frac capacity. So that's going to mean there's plenty of ethane available.\nThere's more than 750,000 bbl a day of ethane in rejection today. I think some of it stayed in rejection because natural gas demand has been so strong because of the warm weather. But it doesn't take much for that to turn, and there will be an incentive to break that out. Frac spreads are good right now. I also think that inventories on NGLs are above the five-year average, about 15% above that five-year average, even with this warmer weather. And that's a reflection of record natural gas production. We've had record ethane production in the year so far.\nWhile that seems like we've got cost pressures coming at us, the reality is those things can be very dynamic, and they can change during the quarter. Exports continue to be strong. We continue to see month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter improvements and ability to move exports out. Our experience with China, even though China is relatively slower from a GDP growth standpoint than previous years, it's still in the 4.5%-5 GDP range, which is relatively good. We've been able to move good volume into China.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nDave, in terms of what additional tailwinds are there to help compensate or offset some of those headwinds that you talked about? A big chunk of it. We continue to ramp our marine pack cargo and our shipments. So you should expect sequential volume growth in P&SP from Q2 to Q3 and then also it's the self help that the team delivered in the second quarter.\nIf you look at all of the at a high level from an enterprise perspective, a big chunk, if not almost all of the delta of sequential improvement came from the self help and the interventions and so at the end of June we had about 75% of those 2,000 roles. And these are enterprise level numbers exit. I think about half of that is impacted in P&SP. The self help and the interventions will also be a tailwind sequentially for P&SP.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nHassan Ahmed\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Alembic Global Advisors\n\nMorning, Jim and Howard. Just wanted to sort of ask a quick question around the supply addition side of things. Ethylene, polyethylene specifically. There have been some rumblings in the press about China potentially considering rationalizing inefficient facilities. What are your thoughts around that and also around the pace of capacity additions, given the macro the way it is.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Hassan. Look, I think if you look over the near term, the pace of capacity additions versus demand increases is really going to be net short. Most of the capacity is on now and I think that's what's leading to obviously some of the pricing pressure that we've seen. But the volume growth is there, and so as that volume growth increases, we're going to see that eat up that capacity relatively quickly. On China, obviously China's had the benefit from a naphtha standpoint. China's moved into a better cost position than Europe. Obviously Europe's naphtha, the crack cost position has become higher, but China's moved into a better cost position, and so that means they've been able to supply more domestically.\nStill we've been able to export out of the US to supplement that because the US has an overall lower cost position. There's obviously pressure on high cost producers. There's plenty of methanol available today, but MTO producers aren't really running, which I think speaks to the naphtha advantage there and then I think if you look at the industry capacity, about 1/4 of the industry capacity is greater than 40 years old and if you think about assets that are high carbon footprint, assets that are in high cost position, those are highly suspect and they're going to be under pressure. I haven't seen any announcements to shut down, but I think usually those things lag a little bit.\nMy expectation is that polyethylene typically holds up the best through an economic slowdown. That continues to be true today. Our cost advantage and our feedstock cost advantage with our flexibility is showing true in the results. We're seeing that even in Europe, where we're cracking more LPGs right now, maxing out on LPGs, and that improves our European position and I think that's going to carry through the back half of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Zekauskas\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. Two-part question, can you comment on? Sequential MDI price trends in the United States? Secondly, you bought back $250 million in shares, so that's maybe about 5 million shares. Your shares went up 2 million sequentially and you have them flat for Q3. What's the magnitude of share issuance this year?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I'll take a look at MDI and then I'll have Howard get the share buyback part of that. Look, on MDI, I think things are in relatively good position. We've seen MDI continue to be relatively strong in markets where MDI impacts; obviously, automotive has continued to be strong. Where we've seen demand down is obviously in durable goods like appliances. That has, in some systems offerings there, put some pressure on prices. I think we are in the process of starting up MDI distillation down in Freeport, which is an expansion off of the La Porte capacity, but allows us to retire.\nThe La Porte asset relatively speaking, MDI is holding up relatively well from a supply, demand, balance standpoint, our expectation is that some of the capacity that's been announced out there is going to come on later than expected. And I think that's going to offer a little bit tighter operating rates than what the industry analysts might be predicting.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nYeah, Jeff, good morning. Look, this is Howard on the share count issue. Good eyes. What I would say is, look, in the first quarter, because we had a GAAP loss in the period, we had to use the basic share count, not the diluted share count. All else equal, it would have been 711. If you were doing an apples to apples in Q1, in Q2, we opportunistically repurchased $250 million worth or 5 million shares and what we continue to say is we're going to buy back at least a dilution and we will continue to be opportunistic. I would say you should at least expect another $125 million of stock buyback in Q3. In terms of what's left on the program, we've got $1.7 billion left on the current open share repurchase program.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey guys, good morning. You know your volumes were down 8% in Q2. I think it's the fourth quarter in a row of down volumes, and it sounds like Q3 will be down as well. Are you seeing any bottoming in any year-end markets and do you think the volumes in the second half will maybe improve on a year-over-year basis at some point?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Mike. Good question. Volumes were down 8%, obviously Europe was off 14%, so that's a pretty significant part of that volume being down. Asia Pacific, and Latin America volumes were stronger, and so they've held up relatively well. North America has been relatively flat, about 1% on volume. You can see obviously the pressure on Europe showing up in some of those markets. In terms of the look at the macro economy, my feeling is this. We know we're in a global economic slowdown. It really started mid last year. We saw GDP decline through the back half of last year.\nWe saw a little spike up in Q1 of this year, but it's been down in Q2, and the expectation is it'll be down in Q3 and Q4. I think it's setting up for a ramp back in 2024. People ask a lot of times, are we in a recession? I think we'll determine if we're in a recession or not when we look in the rearview mirror. But the leading indicators, the destocking that happened in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter appears to be over. Inventories are in relatively good control. MEG ethylene glycol typically leads into a slowdown. We saw that happen last year, and obviously it led into this slowdown. Then a lagging indicator into a slowdown is caustic and chlorine, both sides of the electrochemical unit.\nObviously we saw a time where chlorine demand was relatively strong and caustic demand was relatively strong. Then we saw caustic fall off, but chlorine stay high. And now we see both caustic and chlorine fall off, and that's a lagging indicator that you're into a slowdown. So I would say all the indicators say we are in it right now, and it feels to me like Q3, Q4 is going to be that low point and then we start to ramp back from there, and with the Fed seem to be nearing the ending of rate increases, a little bit of green shoots in housing, people moving back into the housing market. I think there's some areas to be optimistic for 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin McCarthy\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYes, good morning, Jim. With regard to your industrial intermediates segment, can you speak to some of the actions that you're taking there in terms of propylene oxide and your two-way resupply arrangements with Olin on site there and then more broadly, maybe as a follow-up to Mike's question, you're guiding Q3 a little bit lower. Do you think you're at or near an earnings bottom in Q3 and industrial intermediates, or how would you frame that? In terms of the bigger picture cycle there?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Kevin. Good questions. Let me just break it up into polyurethanes, construction chemicals, and industrial solutions, look at them differently. In polyurethanes and construction chemicals, we've been overweight propylene oxide and underweight isocyanates for some time. You see what's happening with the asset moves. They've been trying to right size a bit on PO and exit the merchant market PO business, and that's what has been announced so far. Also, increase the MDI distillation capacity in Freeport, which is what we're doing, and retiring the La Porte asset.\nI think that balances us out better with the growth in polyurethanes, which is in the downstream systems businesses where we make higher value. I think you'll continue to see us do that in terms of the Olin relationship. We've completed the negotiation of a series of contracts in the US Gulf Coast that extends now through 2035, which means that the value, the sustainability, and that integrated economics for both parties remain in place. We're going to continue to supply ethylene, energy, and site services to Olin in the US Gulf Coast and Germany. Stade is the site primarily affected there.\nOlin's going to continue to supply us chlorine and cell effluent for the PO businesses in Plaquemine, and also chlorine to the MDI assets in Freeport. I feel good about the working relationship with Olin. I think we've continued to manage this well, and I think we both understand that the best value for each company is to continue to work together and keep that integrated economics alive. In terms of industrial intermediates, I would say has been growing well.\nOur focus there is to continue to invest in downstream alkoxylates means to support the growth in things like home and personal care, areas like low VOC solvents for the paints and coatings industries, the intermediates for the agricultural sector, and obviously all of the higher value derivatives that we make that go into pharma applications and energy. Think oil and gas and gas treatment, gas scrubbing, all which have great growth drivers. To de-emphasize our exposure to ethylene glycol, which is commodity, most people probably won't remember when we did the deal with MEGlobal, we still had a couple of assets here that made ethylene glycol. Longer term, it doesn't make sense for us to make ethylene glycol in small scale assets.\nWe'll move to purified EO-only assets for industrial intermediates and then all the higher value downstreams and really emphasize the specialty side of that business versus the commodity. I do think, had the additional drag in the quarter of the fact that ag intermediates were very slow in the second quarter because of the hot weather. Farmers did not spray in the second quarter, so they missed a whole spray of crops. That's a pretty significant volume on II&I intermediate capacity, and that's really why you saw the drag on them. I do feel like with housing and construction being at the bottom right now, I do think you can say we're at the bottom in that space, and I think things will look optimistic, more optimistic, as we move into 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nHey, good morning. Clarification and a question. Jim, just to clarify, your expectation is that we're going to see ethane pricing come back down more in balance with where natural gas is in the relatively near term. Is that correct? Secondly, Sadara has been impacted by planned maintenance and the macros. Last couple of quarters. Can you give us some outlook on what your expectations are for Sadara in the back half?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nRight. Morning, Frank. Yeah, I look, I think ethane supply is going to continue to increase. There's about 15% of additional supply coming on in the 2023-2024 time frame, and there's 700,000 bbl a day in rejection today. This is after the startup of new assets. I think the supply is there. I think some of it has obviously been left in the gas because you've had really strong fuel demand for natural gas with the heat in the United States. That's put a big pull on baseload power, which today in the US is very dependent on natural gas. I think some of that will come off. You see in storage, I think it is going to hit its peak before the winter season comes.\nI think as we see some moderation in the weather, I think you're going to see potential for ethane pricing to come off. Sadara, you're right, had a couple of turnarounds that impacted the results. Of course, they have a strong exposure to Asia Pacific. They have a very good cost position. With them back online now and fully operating, and with the demand in Asia continuing to be strong, and remember India has GDP rates above 7%, I think you'll see that Sadara will come back a bit in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nYeah, Frank, I would also just add that Sadara, just like Dow with self help, they have a number of structural and operational improvements underway, including some product mix enhancements to increase margins, and then their own cost intervention. You should start to see that build through the back half of the year as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We please ask that you restrict yourself to one question for time constraints. Your next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Rizzo\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nGood morning, this is Dan Rizzo for Laurence. Just in terms of free cash flow conversion, it's obviously very high now, but I was wondering how we should think about it over the next few years given what you're expecting in terms of the new projects you kind of went through during the call.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nHoward, you want to take that one?\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks for pointing that out. I mean our second quarter trailing 12 month cash conversion was 98%. Really, the team, you know, team is doing a great job on working capital management. We also got some dividends from our JVs, and just an overall continued focus on cash flow. You know, I would not expect 98% going forward. You know, over the long run, an 80% cash conversion is a good number. Obviously, during periods of low macroeconomic activity, that number will be high because we tend to release working capital dollars. A 90% number in the bottom of the cycle, probably a 70% number at the top of the cycle, and then using 80 kind of as a normalized conversion is probably in line.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nDuffy Fischer\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, good morning. If you could on your Slide 6. Just walk through each of the segments. On the top line guide sequentially, roughly what are you looking volume versus price within those ranges?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Duffy. Well, obviously on the top line I think sales obviously are going to be down about 5%. On the high side, it could be down as much as 9%. I think you're going to see, obviously, we talked a lot about feedstocks and packaging, especially plastics. That'll be one element. We have the one-time related items from second quarter to third quarter that won't repeat on licensing, so that's about $100 million. Cost savings is about $50 million to the positive. We just finished, we just have the turnaround at the cracker in St. Charles, which is $100 million. I'd say on price volume, my expectation is volume is going to continue to move.\nAs we've seen in the second quarter, we have advantage cost positions around the world, and we're taking advantage of that. They're running at high rates, and we're able to export. We're going to take advantage of that in the third quarter, and then we're going to navigate the price. Obviously, the headwinds that we have on raw materials, I would say the team's already shifting on flexibility. We've got butane in some cases and propane back in the slate in some areas to mitigate some of the higher ethane costs. If you look obviously the big impact will be the loss of capacity out of Glycol and Plaquemine.\nThat will be a $100 million headwind. That's partly lost margin on those sales and partly the cost of rebuilding the asset and getting it back. Operational cost savings and maintenance activities are actually about a $40 million tailwind, and then we'll continue to see how demand holds up. Automotive demand has been relatively good, but housing and construction has been relatively weak on the polyurethane side. Performance Materials & Coatings, I think volumes are going to hold up well. The price pressure in siloxanes has been the biggest headwind there, although it's flattened, and if it maintains flat, then we may not see as much of a headwind there.\nCost savings and lower planned maintenance activity are about a $60 million tailwind for them. On PM&C, I'd say the other seasonal impact will be a slower. Seasonal return to kind of a normal seasonal outlook for coatings because architectural coatings have been relatively weaker, industrial coatings have been strong, but architectural coatings compared to last year have been relatively weaker. That's kind of the outlook on all three. I'd expect at the high end all three of them will be down primarily due to price, not so much on volume. As obviously demand returns, we'll start to see some pricing power come back in.\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nDuffy, look, I would just say at a very high level, if you think about, if you take a step back at the enterprise and think about what we're trying to guide to, it really is on an operating basis essentially flat sequentially. You've got our self help, which we're guiding, $100 million increase in cost savings. We expect that that will be eaten up by the margin compression that Begleiter talked about, that the third party indices are projecting. That leaves you with $150 million of stuff that either happened in the second quarter that won't recur. The project driven licensing sales from Univation, we don't expect another $100 million in the third quarter, although the team continues to work on additional licensing.\nThe $50 million turnaround headwinds at an enterprise level are net, so that's operationally flat. Of course, we've got to repair and restore the Plaquemine Glycol plant that Jim said. We're guiding on that $100 million kind of one-time impact on margin, on lost sales, and then the cost to rebuild, recommission, and get that returned to operations. That's a preliminary number. As we learn more through the root cause investigation and the implementation plan to get it restarted, we'll give a further update.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho Securities\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. I just want to hit back on Slide 9 if I may. Just given the outlook for the CapEx versus D&A and some of the comments on Alberta, can you hit on any incremental thoughts you'd have on buyback activity in the second half of the year, dividend growth throughout that period in terms of the current coverage ratio, just what are the kind of the puts and takes and how your thought process entering the 2024 through 2027 period. Thank you so much.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nHoward, you want to hit view on buybacks?\n\nHoward Ungerleider\n\nPresident and CFO, Dow\n\nYeah. Look, we're going to continue to be. Opportunistic as we think about the back half. I would say we're going to have my mindset, our mindset, which is what I think I gave the answer on Jeff's question, $125 million. That's our estimate for dilution. All things equal, we're going to cover dilution each quarter, Q3 and then Q4, but we're going to continue to be opportunistic as we have the free cash flow. The Dow team has done an exceptional job on working capital and just managing cash in a much tighter way. Remember, that was one of the big changes we decided together as a leadership team to make at spin is that every P&L leader will also have their own balance sheet, and also their own cash flow statement.\nEvery single leader in our company that manages a P&L now manages a cash flow, and that rolls up to the one that Jim and I and the leadership team are responsible for. They've been doing a phenomenal job. The 98% cash conversion. We did $250 million of stock buyback in Q2, and you could see that similar kind of number potentially in Q3, and we'll see in Q4. The other thing, and I don't think we touched on it in this call, but we've talked about in the past, is look, we continue every year since then, we've had about $1 billion or more of what I would call unique to Dow cash flow interventions or levers. Structural working capital is $200 to 300 million. Our tax team continues to do a great job around the world.\nWe're looking at any cash that we can potentially extract from our joint ventures, just as several examples. We also have the NOVA litigation, which is several hundred million dollars that we fully expect to win in, I would say, the final round of that Canadian litigation. There's another billion dollars out there over the next 12 to 18 months. As we get that money and we have the room, we will continue to be even more opportunistic on stock buyback.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat.Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the Q2. As far as the Q3 outlook goes, you know, it looks like you mentioned. Still sluggish markets in China, recovery there. Would you call out that as really the main driver of when we can expect things to get better, that is, should we be looking mainly for an improvement in China that would help lower the. Days across many of your segments. Signal better demand or what do you think are the main drivers of improving volume from here?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nMorning, Arun. Look, I think China, even though it's slower than what we're expecting, is still relatively good in global GDP. I mean, 4.5%-5 global GDP in the second largest economy in the world is pretty good. India has been greater than 7%, and Mexico has been strong. We're well positioned to serve all those markets, and we're seeing that as we increase the exports. Obviously, both China and India still need higher value functional polymers, which are a highly profitable part of what we export from the US Gulf Coast. I feel good about that. I don't think it's totally just dependent on China improving.\nI also think it's dependent on things like housing starting to improve again in North America, and the European economy coming back. Energy costs have come down in Europe. Natural gas LNG prices in Europe have kind of flattened around $10 a million BTU, which is a lot of relief from where they've been. Obviously, still much more expensive than the United States, which is in the three handle on natural gas, but still much, much improved. I think a lot will depend on the European economy coming back, which has been under a ton of pressure. Of course, we have a lot of exposure in Europe about 30% of our footprint is in Europe, and it's most heavily in polyurethanes and construction chemicals.\nI think in North America, we're looking for housing to take a step back, which has started to show some positive signs on new permits and mortgage applications. I think high rents and lack of supply on the housing market are leading to more people thinking about moving in some other bright spots in the economy that I think are coming. We had all the passage of the Infrastructure Bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, which are meant to have a big impact obviously here in the United States. There is a lag between the passage of those bills and the capital spend that goes along with it. We've already seen in areas like wiring cable for telecommunications and high voltage transmission.\nWe've already seen very strong demand with our downstream customers. I don't think that's going to back off. You see that demand already, the return to travel has meant that aerospace production, plane production is back up. You see that in the coatings sector, especially those that have exposure to coatings for the aerospace industry, obviously automotive continues to be relatively strong, and stronger than last year. Heavy machinery continues to be strong because in a lot of parts of the world we need to increase mining to keep up with the metals that we need to make this happen.\nThen automation, we don't talk about it much, but with inflation on wages, many companies are looking more to AI, machine learning, and automation of existing manufacturing to get productivity out of manufacturing. If you're thinking about components that are going into controls and automation and either new construction of new manufacturing lines or revamping existing ones, those companies have pretty big backlogs right now. I think if housing picks up, it's going to pick up construction, and it's going to pick up consumer durables, which had been weak all year, really since mid last year. I think we look at that to be kind of the indicator of the turn. That'll be an indicator in China, that'll be an indicator here in North America as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHi, good morning. Price declines in PM&C continue to be fairly substantial. How do you expect demand to trend for the balance of the year? What are your sort of expectations for new siloxane capacity in 2023?\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow",
    "content2": "Morning. Good questions on PM&C. Let's just take a look at 2023 in consumer solutions, which is primarily silicones and some of the higher end of Dow industrial solutions that goes into those applications. The two areas that are a little bit slower than last year in terms of growth are electronics and mobility. They're up this year, but not to the same extent as last year. Commercial buildings are relatively flat, industrial slightly up, home and personal care is up. That has driven the demand. When you think about electronics and mobility and construction, those are the biggest volume uses. I think that's what's put the pressure on as well as the siloxane capacity in China.\nIn coatings and monomers, the strongest parts of the sector right now are automotive, and think liquid applied sound dampening for undercarriage of cars and road marking applications. Infrastructure builds are really driving the volume increases there. Architectural's off, but it's off by a couple of percent. Obviously, the contractor business has come back where during COVID it was mostly do it yourself business. We've got good dynamics, I think, starting to happen. In the contractor side, the paper business has been off. Paper coatings have been off year-over-year, I think on siloxane capacity coming in. In 2022, we saw about 450,000 tons of new siloxane capacity added. I'd say in 2023.\nYou've got probably in that range of about 300,000 tons. Then beyond 2024 and beyond, you've probably got another 300,000 tons that comes out beyond that time frame. I think you're looking at kind of the trough on siloxanes right now and maybe a little bit into 2024, and then the demand will start to eat that up.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have time for one more question from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah, hi, thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick one on the cost savings. I guess if I look at Slide 7, it looks like really Q3 is maybe the last large tranche, a sequential step up, I guess. Is that right? Fourth quarter has a much lower step up. Can you just remind us what we should be expecting there into 2024? Thanks.\n\nJim Fitterling\n\nChair and CEO, Dow\n\nYeah, I think when we looked at the guide for third quarter, there's a $100 million step up from second quarter. That'll be, on a year-over-year basis, about $350 million of cost saved. Fourth quarter is going to be in that $300 to 350 million as well. 2/3 of the billion, you know, $650 to 700 million, comes out in the back half of this year. Obviously, there's some sequential carryover into next year. You get about $150 million in first quarter of next year from the sequential carryover. The kind of the year-over-year in first quarter will be a step up as well. Those are the spending impacts. Obviously, the businesses are all working on margin improvement within their portfolios.\nHoward mentioned in addition to the billion of cost saves, we're working on a billion dollars of cash levers unique to Dow cash levers. I think he just outlined them on the previous question. I'd say net net we're focusing on cash both on the cost side and on the cash levers where we can liberate some cash, and also improving mix within the businesses, and taking advantage of our low cost positions and running those assets hard, then trimming on the high cost side where we can to set ourselves up for the ramp up in 2024.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nI think that's all.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. Please turn the call over to Pankaj Gupta for closing remarks.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Dow\n\nThanks everyone for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Dow. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on our website within about 48 hours or so. This concludes our call. Thank you once again.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn it over to Dow Investor Relations Vice President, Pankaj Gupta. Mr. Gupta, you may begin.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining Dow's first quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast.\nI'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President. And joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements, Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today as well as on the Dow website.\nOn Slide 2, you will see the agenda for our call. Jim will begin by reviewing our first quarter results and operating segment performance. Howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance. To close, Jim will outline how our decarbonize and grow and transform the waste strategies enable continued value creation. Following that, we will take your questions.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChief Operating Officer, DowDuPont Materials Science Division and Chief Executive Officer, The Dow C, DowDuPont, Inc.\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3. In the first quarter, Team Dow demonstrated its agility delivering sequential earnings improvement in what continues to be a challenging environment. These results reflect our competitive advantages and operating discipline as we leveraged our structurally advantaged feedstock positions proactively aligned our operating rates with market demand and focused on higher value products where pockets of demand remained resilient, such as pharmaceutical applications, energy, commercial building and construction and mobility end markets.\nAdditionally, our actions to deliver $1 billion in cost savings in 2023 are progressing with $100 million achieved in the first quarter. These actions will ensure we continue to focus on cash flow generation through our low-cost-to-serve operating model.\nTurning to the details of the quarter. Net sales were $11.9 billion, down 22% year-over-year. Declines in all operating segments were driven by continued soft global macroeconomic activity. Sales were flat sequentially as gains in Performance Materials & Coatings and Packaging and Specialty Plastics offset declines in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Volume decreased 11% year-over-year led by declines in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India or EMEA. However, volumes increased 2% sequentially on gains in Performance Materials & Coatings and Packaging and Specialty Plastics. Local price declined 10% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter due to industry supply additions and some businesses amidst soft global economic conditions.\nOperating EBIT for the quarter was $708 million, down year-over-year due to lower local prices and volumes. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved by $107 million with gains primarily driven by Performance Materials and Coatings. Cash flow from operations was $531 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow conversion was 85%. With ample financial flexibility and a strong balance sheet, we are continuing to execute on our strategy as we advance our disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities for long-term value creation. We returned $621 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, and our balance sheet continues to have no substantive long-term debt maturities until 2027.\nNow turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, operating EBIT was $642 million compared to $1.2 billion in the year-ago period, primarily due to lower integrated polyethylene margins. Continued margin resilience in Functional Polymers was more than offset by lower polyethylene and olefins margins. Volume declines were primarily driven by lower consumer demand in EMEA. Sadara also had lower export volumes due to planned maintenance activity. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down by $13 million. Improved input costs and higher operating rates in our most cost-advantage assets were more than offset by lower sales from nonrecurring licensing activity and lower equity earnings.\nMoving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Operating EBIT for the segment was $123 million compared to $661 million in the year-ago period. Results were driven by lower pricing and demand as well as higher energy costs, particularly in EMEA. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $41 million. Lower energy costs were more than offset by decreased demand and pricing for propylene oxide, its derivatives and in isocyanates and polyurethanes and construction chemicals.\nIndustrial Solutions experienced lower volumes due to weather-related impacts and a third-party supply outage combined with lower demand in industrial end markets. And in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, operating EBIT for the segment was $35 million compared to $595 million in the year ago period. Local price declines for siloxane were driven by competitive pricing pressure from supply additions in China. Volume was down as resilient demand for commercial building and construction, mobility and industrial coatings was more than offset by volume declines in siloxanes and architectural coatings. Sequentially, operating EBIT increased $165 million, driven by improved supply availability, seasonally higher volumes and reduced value chain destocking.\nNext, I'll turn it over to Howard to review our outlooks and actions on Slide 5.\n\nHoward I. Ungerleider\n\nChief Financial Officer, DowDuPont and President and Chief Financial Officer, The Dow Chemical Compa, DowDuPont, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we expect to continue navigating challenging macro conditions around the world. While the pace of inflation has slowed, elevated levels continue to pressure both input costs and demand, particularly in industrials, durable goods and housing. On the bright side, demand in agriculture and energy markets remains resilient as does consumer demand for personal care and household items.\nIn the U.S., consumer spending continues to moderate, while retail sales were up 2.9% year-over-year in March. After contracting for 5 straight months, normalizing value chain inventories are driving improvements in manufacturing PMI which reached 50.4 in April. Residential building and construction markets remain under pressure, with housing starts and building permits down around 20% year-over-year in March. However, builder confidence increased for the fourth straight month in April on growing demand in the new home market due to limited resale inventory.\nIn Europe, while energy prices have remained lower than previously anticipated, higher inflation levels continue to weigh on both consumer and business sentiment with manufacturing PMI continuing to contract since July of last year. In China, large industrial production rose 3.9% year-over-year and is recovering gradually with manufacturing PMI now at 50. March retail sales also rose 10.6% year-over-year at their fastest pace since July 2021. The recovery following the pandemic lockdowns has been slow, we continue to expect growth over the medium term. Against this backdrop, we continue to take disciplined actions to manage our costs and deliver our target of $1 billion in cost savings in 2023.\nWe're implementing our global workforce reduction program of approximately 2,000 roles. Notifications have begun and 75% of the impacted roles will exit by the end of the second quarter. We're also continuing to review our global asset footprint on a business-by-business and region-by-region approach, rationalizing select higher-cost, lower-return assets in line with market fundamentals. Additionally, we're executing opportunities to reduce operating costs. This includes decreasing maintenance turnaround spending by $300 million year-over-year and driving efficiencies through the value chain, including streamlining our logistics networks and reducing our spend of purchased raw materials and contract services. All in, we expect to deliver approximately 35% of our cost savings in the first half of the year and the remaining 65% in the second half of the year.\nTurning to our outlook for the second quarter on Slide 6. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we see signs of improving domestic demand versus the start of the year as well as continued easing in marine pack cargo, allowing for increased export volumes. We expect healthy oil-to-gas spreads to continue to favor our cost-advantage positions as rates increase to meet seasonally higher demand levels. All in, we expect these factors to have a $75 million tailwind versus the prior quarter, along with another approximately $70 million tailwind from cost savings actions. We anticipate these will be partly offset by a $25 million headwind from a seasonal increase in planned maintenance activity.\nIn the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, demand remains resilient in energy and pharmaceutical end markets. However, we expect continued demand pressure in consumer durables and building and construction, which is also driving a decline in cost pricing from its recent peak. We anticipate a $25 million tailwind from improved volumes in Industrial Solutions following third-party outages and the winter weather-related impacts as well as a $20 million tailwind from cost savings actions. Additionally, that will begin to turn around at our Louisiana Glycols facility, which is projected to be a $50 million headwind for this segment.\nIn the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, while demand for consumer electronics and industrial end markets is softening, we're seeing a seasonal increase in demand for coating applications as well as improvement in mobility. Our cost saving actions will deliver a $50 million tailwind for the segment. The completion of our first quarter turnaround at our Deer Park acrylic monomers facility will be offset by impacts from the planned maintenance at our Carrollton and Zhangjiagang siloxanes facilities. All in, with the puts and takes mentioned and listed on our model and guidance slide, we expect a sequential earnings improvement of $150 million to $200 million versus the prior quarter.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChief Operating Officer, DowDuPont Materials Science Division and Chief Executive Officer, The Dow C, DowDuPont, Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 7. While we expect near-term conditions to remain challenging through the year, we continue to see positive underlying demand trends driving above GDP growth across our attractive market verticals over the next few years. Packaging is vital to delivering a lower carbon footprint. Through our 3 million metric ton transform the waste commitment, we will capture demand growth for recycled polyethylene, which is accelerating as brand owners and customers increasingly seek more circular products.\nIn infrastructure, more than $3 trillion in investments will be needed to meet global infrastructure plans. Green buildings are driving demand for Dow products including low-carbon footprint silicone sealants for high-rise buildings, reflective roof coatings and lower carbon emissions cement additives. An expanding middle class will support growth in consumer spending where our products help deliver a lower carbon footprint and enable more sustainable materials through technologies such as biodegradable polymers or bio-based surfactants for home care and thermal conductive silicone gels and adhesives for electronics and batteries.\nAnd in mobility, stable global vehicle production growth is expected. With increasing demand for electric vehicles, which contain 3 to 4x more silicone content than internal combustion engine vehicles. Lighter weight vehicles are also aided by our high-value polyurethane systems and EPDM technologies. Further, we continue to execute our targeted suite of higher-return, lower-risk projects which are expected to add $2 billion in underlying EBITDA by the middle of the decade. These investments put us in an advantaged position to capture demand as economies recover and raise our underlying earnings profile.\nTurning to Slide 8. With growing consumer and brand owner demand for more sustainable and circular products leading in the transition to a more sustainable future remains critical to our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value creation. In collaboration with X-energy, in the second quarter, we expect to select and announce a site in the U.S. Gulf Coast to develop a small modular nuclear energy facility by 2030. Nuclear technology will be key in generating safe and reliable power and steam at our sites while enabling 0 CO2 emissions manufacturing.\nIn Alberta, we recently ordered Fluor with a contract to provide front-end engineering and design services for our Path to Zero project. Today, we achieved another key milestone by selecting Linde as our industrial gas supplier to supply nitrogen and clean hydrogen for the site. Securing partner agreements and subsidies is our next step. All of these actions are critical to reaching a final investment decision this year. As a reminder, this investment for the world's first net zero CO2 emissions ethylene and derivatives complex will decarbonize 20% of our global ethylene capacity. At the same time, it will grow our global polyethylene supply by 15% and triple our Alberta site polyethylene capacity.\nWe're also taking a capital-efficient approach to meet increasing demand from our circular solutions as we scale up production for both advanced and mechanical recycling with strategic partners like Valoregen, Mura Technology and WM among others. Valoregen's 15-kiloton mechanical recycling facility in France will start up during the second half of this year. This hybrid recycling plant is expected to process up to 70 kilotons of plastic waste per year by 2025. And Mura remains on track to start up the first of its kind, 20-kiloton per year advanced recycling plant in Teesside in the United Kingdom in the second half of this year. This is the first step in our strategic partnership with Mura to launch as much as 600 kilotons per year of advanced recycling capacity by 2030.\nAs the key offtaker of post-consumer and advanced recycled feed from both of these partnerships, Dow will commercialize circular polymers and high demand from global brands. Altogether by 2030, we are on track to deliver an additional $1 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement through our Alberta project, commercialized 3 million metric tons per year of circular and renewable solutions and reduce Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by 5 million metric tons compared to our 2020 levels.\nTurning to Slide 9. We remain focused on delivering on our commitments with transparency, accountability and a culture of benchmarking. Today, we published our annual benchmarking update as we have every year since spin, which can be found in the appendix of this presentation and is posted on our website. The results once again demonstrate our strong performance relative to peers. In particular, Dow delivered best-in-class free cash flow yield and net debt reduction since spin. We also achieved above peer median return on invested capital and returns to shareholders.\nTaking a closer look at the results on Slide 10. Our free cash flow yield on a 3-year average is nearly 2x the peer average and 3x the sector and market averages. Our differentiated portfolio, cost-advantaged assets and operating discipline have resulted in 3-year EBITDA margins and return on invested capital well above the peer median. This includes our 15% return on invested capital, which is above our 13% target across the economic cycle. Our focus on cash flow generation has supported strong shareholder returns and our strengthened balance sheet has resulted in improved credit ratings and outlooks.\nAdditionally, all operating segments achieved best-in-class or top quartile, free cash conversion and cost performance. Notably, Packaging and Specialty Plastics further expanded its outperformance over the next best peer on an EBITDA per pound of polyolefin basis by $0.05 per pound. It also delivered 5-year average EBITDA margins 500 basis points above the peer median. Looking forward, our growth investments throughout the decade will further enhance our competitive advantages and shareholder value creation.\nClosing on Slide 11, Dow continues to execute with consistency and discipline to deliver resilient performance in the near term and sustainable growth and cash flow generation over the long term. We're implementing targeted actions across the enterprise to reduce costs and maximize cash. Our strong balance sheet provides financial flexibility as we continue to deliver against our capital allocation priorities, and our decarbonize and grow and transform the waste strategies will raise our underlying earnings profile while reducing our carbon footprint and increasing recycled content. All combined, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering against our financial targets across the economic cycle.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open up the Q&A.",

Thank you for joining Dow's fourth quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today.

Fitterling\n\nChairman & CEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter, Team Dow continued to take proactive actions to navigate slower GDP growth, challenging energy markets and customer destocking. We proactively lowered our operating rates to effectively manage working capital, implemented operational mitigation plans and cost saving measures and prioritized higher-value products where demand remained resilient, including in functional polymers and performance silicones as well as in mobility, renewable energy and pharma end markets.\nThese actions, combined with our continued focus on cash enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.1 billion in the quarter. Cash flow conversion was 166%, and we returned $620 million to shareholders.\nDow's cash generation reflects our continued focus on operational and financial discipline, which was important as we navigated an extremely dynamic year in 2022, as you see on Slide 4. In the first half of the year, we capitalized on strong demand across our diverse global portfolio, while leveraging our derivative and feedstock flexibility and low cost positions to mitigate higher raw material and energy costs.\nIn the second half of the year, economic conditions deteriorated driven by record inflation, rising interest rates, ongoing pandemic lockdowns in China and continued geopolitical tensions. In the face of these evolving market dynamics, Dow was resilient, generating cash flow from operations of $7.5 billion for the full year while executing our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation. We delivered returns on invested capital of 15%, above our 13% across the economic cycle target, as we prioritized higher return, lower risk and faster payback investments.\nWe achieved credit rating and outlook upgrades as a result of our strengthened balance sheet, and we have no substantive debt maturities due until 2027. And we returned a total of $4.3 billion to shareholders, including $2.3 billion in share repurchases and $2 billion in dividends.\nAt the same time, we continue to advance our Decarbonize & Grow strategy and accelerate circularity to create long-term shareholder value as we meet growing customer demand for more sustainable solutions. I'm proud of how Team Dow continues to deliver for our customers, drive shareholder value and support our communities as we progress toward our 2050 carbon neutrality target, and you can see a number of those highlights depicted on this slide.\nNow turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 5. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, net sales were $6.1 billion, down 16% year-over-year as price gains across all regions and functional polymers were more than offset by lower polyethylene and olefin prices. Volume declines were driven primarily by lower olefins and packaging demand in Europe, which was partly offset by a resilient global demand for functional polymers. Sequentially, net sales were down 17% driven by lower hydrocarbon sales and polyethylene prices.\nOperating EBIT for the segment was $655 million compared to $1.4 billion in the year ago period, primarily due to lower integrated polyethylene margins. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $130 million as lower raw material and energy costs were more than offset by lower polyethylene prices and operating rates.\nMoving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Net sales were $3.7 billion, down 20% from the year ago period. Volumes declined primarily due to lower demand in Europe for industrial, consumer durables, and building and construction applications. Sequentially, net sales were down 10% as seasonal demand increases for de-icing fluid were more than offset by declines in building and construction, consumer durables and industrial applications.\nOperating EBIT for the segment was $164 million compared to $595 million in the year-ago period, driven by lower demand and increasing energy costs, particularly in Europe. Sequentially, operating EBIT margins expanded by 40 basis points as lower energy costs versus the prior quarter were partly offset by lower volumes.\nAnd in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we reported net sales of $2.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year as local price gains for performance silicones and architectural coatings were more than offset by lower prices for siloxanes and acrylic monomers.\nVolume was down as resilient demand in mobility was more than offset by declines primarily in building and construction end markets. Sequentially, net sales were down 22% due to seasonally lower demand for coatings, industrial and building and construction applications as well as local price declines for siloxanes and acrylic monomers.\nOperating EBIT for the segment was a loss of $130 million compared to earnings of $295 million in the year ago period due to local price declines primarily in siloxane and lower operating rates in the quarter. Sequentially, operating EBIT declined $432 million, driven by lower prices, demand and operating rates.\nI'll now turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and actions on Slide 6.\n\nHoward I. Ungerleider\n\nPresident & CFO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We expect the market dynamics we experienced in late 2022 to continue into early '23. While the pace of inflation has moderated, overall cost levels remain elevated, which has continued to trigger tighter monetary policy in most parts of the world and is weighing on both business investment and consumer sentiment. The majority of economic forecasts are calling for slower GDP growth globally relative to 2022, although dynamics differ by region, with most regions except Europe still forecasting positive year-on-year growth. In the U.S., we see signs of moderating demand and the continuation of year-end destocking trends early in the quarter. Building and construction end markets have been particularly impacted by inflation and rising interest rates with housing starts declining by more than 20% year-over-year in December.\nManufacturing PMI contracted for the third consecutive month of 48, while light vehicle sales in the U.S. were down for the full year by 8 percentage points. Easing inflation is leading to improving consumer confidence, albeit from depressed levels in late 2022, while consumer spending remains resilient.\nIn Europe, we expect demand to remain constrained despite recent improvements in regional energy prices. While the move to 5-year highs in gas storage is a positive sign, changing weather forecasts are leading to volatility in the futures markets. High inflation and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on consumer spending and industrial production. December manufacturing PMI has been contracting since July, and construction PMI reached its lowest level since May.\nIn China, while we're very encouraged by recent shifts in COVID policy to ease restrictions and open up orders, we expect these actions to take some time to improve economic activity. This is an area we're closely monitoring as it has the potential to provide a source of significant demand recovery following the Lunar New Year.\nAnd in Latin America, overall economic growth is expected to slow, driven by political tensions, high inflation, and restrictive monetary policy. Given this dynamic backdrop, we will continue to take a region by region, business-by-business approach to managing our operations and adapting our businesses to the evolving market realities.\nTurning to Slide 7. As we highlighted at our last earnings call, we are proactively responding to the current economic environment with a playbook of targeted actions to deliver $1 billion in cost savings. This begins with maintaining a low cost to serve operating model by implementing actions to optimize our labor and service costs, including a global workforce reduction of approximately 2,000 roles. We will continue to increase productivity with end-to-end process improvements now that our digital foundation is in place, and we will also shut down select assets while further evaluating additional actions across our global asset base, particularly in Europe to ensure long-term competitiveness while also enhancing our cost efficiency.\nThese structural actions are expected to deliver a total of $500 million in EBITDA savings this year. Additionally, we will deliver another $500 million of savings through actions to maximize cash flow while reducing our operational expenses. This includes decreasing turnaround spend, purchased raw materials, logistics and utilities costs. Importantly, we will do this while maintaining safe and reliable operations, which, as always, remains our top priority. These proactive actions will optimize our cost structure in response to the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty while maintaining our long-term value-creation focus.\nTurning to our outlook for the first quarter on Slide 8. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, improving logistics and lower operating rates led to the fifth consecutive month of inventory declines for U.S. polyethylene in December. Reduced global operating rates are continuing to drive feedstock and input costs down, with ongoing destocking through the value chain impacting functional polymer strength and demand in Europe. While lower turnaround costs will be a sequential tailwind, we expect lower demand levels in Asia to impact equity earnings and lower nonrecurring licensing activity from the prior quarter will impact earnings. In total, we expect a $75 million headwind for the segment sequentially.\nIn the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, demand remains stable for energy markets, and we're monitoring demand for de-icing fluids with a warmer-than-average winter. However, inflationary pressures in contracting PMIs continue to impact industrial demand, and we expect lower seasonal volumes in building construction end markets. We also anticipate an approximately $25 million headwind due to a third-party outage, which is causing a supply disruption on the U.S. Gulf Coast from Winter Storm Elliott.\nIn the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we expect demand recovery for performance silicones following year-end customer destocking as well as improved supply availability and lower costs. However, we also anticipate lower siloxane pricing in the quarter as we continue to see pressure from increased industry supply. We expect higher planned maintenance turnaround costs in this segment at our Deer Park acrylic monomer site in Performance Monomers. All in, we anticipate a $25 million tailwind for the segment.\nIn total, we expect the first quarter to be in line with the fourth quarter performance with the $75 million in discrete headwinds I mentioned.\nTurning to the full year. We're continuing to provide our best estimates of several income statement and cash flow drivers. I will highlight a few notable year-over-year inputs. We expect lower equity earnings in the year down approximately $300 million to $400 million. Total turnaround spending is anticipated to be down by $300 million as we implement our playbook of cost savings actions while maintaining safe and reliable operations. We expect share count to remain relatively flat as we plan to continue covering dilution.\nAnd finally, we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to $2.2 billion, well within our DNA of $2.8 billion as we continue to advance our higher return, faster payback projects and continue to execute on our Decarbonize & Grow strategy.\nOverall, the macroeconomic backdrop remains dynamic in 2023. We see the potential for additional upside from higher oil to gas spreads, reopening in China following the Lunar New Year, and easing inflation in supply chain constraints. We also continue to pay close attention to a range of indicators, including pressure from higher interest rates on building and construction, PMI levels, global energy markets and geopolitical dynamics. Dow remains well positioned based on our global footprint, feedstock flexibility and the sustainable solutions we provide for our customers. We will continue to leverage these competitive advantages to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChairman & CEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. Moving to Slide 10. While the near-term environment remains challenging, we continue to see attractive secular trends across our market verticals of packaging, infrastructure, consumer and mobility. With resilient cash flow generation and a strong credit profile, we are well positioned to continue advancing our Decarbonize and Grow strategy to capitalize on these opportunities. We delivered on our growth investment commitments outlined in early 2022. These investments are expected to collectively generate $2 billion in run rate EBITDA by the middle of this decade.\nIn Packaging & Specialty Plastics, we mechanically completed and began final commissioning of our FCDh unit in Louisiana in the fourth quarter. This breakthrough propylene technology features up to 25% lower capital outlay while reducing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% versus conventional PDH units.\nIn Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our latest alkoxylates capacity investment in the United States was completed in the third quarter of 2022, and our next in Europe will be completed in the first quarter of this year. These projects will further serve high-value markets in home care and pharma and are just a start. Our next wave of alkoxylates capacity investments remain on track. In fact, Dow has already successfully begun locking in supply contract with several consumer and pharmaceutical customers to support the next wave of growth.\nAnd in Performance Materials & Coatings, we completed 16 downstream silicone debottleneck projects in 2022 to meet demand for high performance, building and construction, personal care and mobility applications.\nAdditionally, we accelerated the delivery of our digitalization initiatives and now expect the full $300 million run rate EBITDA to fully materialize by the end of 2023, well ahead of our prior target of 2025. As a result, we anticipate our digital sales to comprise 50% of total revenue by 2025.\nLooking forward, we expect to continue growth investments in our global operations, including key capital investments in higher-margin polyurethane systems and additional alkoxylates capacity, incremental projects to expand downstream, high-value ethylene derivative capacity and continued coatings and silicone debottlenecking projects. We will also continue progressing our operating investments to improve production capabilities and reliability as we shift our product mix toward higher growth and higher-value markets.\nTurning to Slide 11. Decarbonizing our assets and driving circularity remains a significant growth opportunity for Dow. We have a clear road map to reduce carbon emissions by another 5 million metric tons by 2030. We continue to invest in innovative, renewable energy and efficiency technologies, such as our collaborative program with Shell to electrically heat steam cracker furnaces, which is on track to start up in 2025.\nIn Alberta, we reached a preliminary investment decision for our Path2Zero, and we are working with the Canadian government to confirm necessary incentives so that we can make a final investment decision by the end of this year. And our Terneuzen 2030 project, where we have a clear road map to reduce carbon emissions at the site by more than 40% by 2030 is making progress as we secure partner and government agreements and subsidies. We are also advancing our transform the waste target to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually by 2030.\nBy leveraging our pipeline of strategic partnerships to invest in innovative solutions and scale up production, we are well positioned to meet this growing customer demand in a disciplined and capital-efficient manner.\nMost recently, Dow and WM announced a bold new collaboration to address hard-to-recycle plastic films by enabling them to be placed directly into residential curbside recycling. By 2025, the program is expected to divert more than 120,000 metric tons of plastic film from landfills.\nWe continue to see sustainability as essential for our long-term earnings growth. Altogether, by 2030, we remain on track to deliver $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvements while reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% compared to our 2005 baseline.\nTurning to Slide 12. The actions we've taken since spin to strengthen our balance sheet while improving our financial flexibility and operating cash flow generation are enabling us to be more resilient as we deliver on our capital allocation priorities across the economic cycle. Our free cash flow performance is now more than tripled on a trailing 12-month basis. We substantially improved our liquidity position, ending the year with nearly $14 billion. And through our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, we've significantly reduced our liability profile with a combined reduction of more than $11 billion in our net debt and underfunded pension position since spin.\nClosing on Slide 13, we have a clear playbook of actions to drive resilient performance in the near and long term. We have plans to achieve $1 billion in savings through targeted actions to increase efficiency and maintain a low-cost structure that is best in class. We're maintaining a strong financial position with a continued focus on disciplined and balanced capital allocation, and we're advancing our Decarbonize and Grow and circularity strategies, delivering incremental run rate EBITDA improvements through the end of the decade, positioning us for economic recovery while lowering our carbon dioxide emissions.\nAs we leverage our competitive advantages, operational agility and focus on cash flow generation that has served us well since spin, we will continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open up the Q&A.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of IR, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.

(Operator Instructions). I will now hand over to Pankaj Gupta, Investor Relations Vice President.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of IR, Dow Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining Dow's third quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website, and through the link to our webcast. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President. And joining me today on the call are Jim Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides.\nDuring our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today as well as on the Dow website.\nOn Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our third quarter results and operating segment performance. Howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance. And then to close, Jim will discuss how our actions and long-term strategic priorities enable us to deliver value growth in a dynamic environment. Following that, we will take your questions.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChairman & CEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning on Slide 3. In the third quarter, Team Dow continued to proactively navigate higher energy costs and geopolitical uncertainties that are impacting consumer demand, particularly in Europe. As macroeconomic conditions began to erode in the quarter, we responded quickly by implementing a set of actions to prioritize resources toward hiring products, align production rates to supply chain and logistics constraints as well as demand, and reduce operational costs across the enterprise. In addition, our advantaged portfolio enabled us to capitalize on demand strength in higher-value functional polymers in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and performance silicones in Performance Materials & Coatings.\nThird quarter net sales were $14.1 billion, with sales declines of 5% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Local price increased 3% year-over-year with gains in Performance Materials & Coatings and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Sequentially, price declined 6% and was down across all operating segments and regions. Volume was down 4% versus the year ago period as declines in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, or EMEAI, more than offset volume growth in the U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific. Sequentially, volume was down 3%, led by EMEAI. Continued strength of the U.S. dollar also impacted net sales by 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Operating EBIT for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Our consistent focus on cash flow generation and working capital management in the quarter supported cash flow from operations of $1.9 billion or a conversion of 104% of EBITDA and free cash flow of $1.5 billion. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $800 million in share repurchases and $493 million in dividends. And our balance sheet continues to have no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027.\nTurning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, net sales were $7.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year as price gains and resilient demand in functional polymers were more than offset by lower polyethylene pricing. Sequentially, net sales were down 11%, also driven by lower polyethylene prices with reduced volumes as we decreased operating rates in response to both continued global marine pack cargo logistics constraints and lower demand in EMEAI. Operating EBIT for the segment was $785 million compared to $2 billion in the year ago period and $1.4 billion in the prior quarter. These results were impacted primarily by higher raw material and energy costs and lower local prices.\nMoving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment. Net sales were $4.1 billion, down 9% from the year ago period, with price gains in both businesses. Volume was down as strong demand for pharmaceutical, agricultural and energy applications in Industrial Solutions were more than offset by declines in polyurethanes and construction chemicals due to inflationary pressures in EMEAI, decreased consumer durable demand and the slowing housing market. Sequentially, net sales were down 7% at stable volumes, primarily in mobility end markets were more than offset by lower local price and currency. Operating EBIT for the segment was $167 million compared to $713 million in the year ago period, and $426 million in the prior quarter as lower EMEAI demand and increased energy and raw material costs were partly offset by higher prices. Sequentially, operating EBIT margins declined by 560 basis points on lower price and higher energy costs.\nAnd in the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we reported net sales of $2.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year with price gains in both businesses and all regions. Volume was down as resilient demand in mobility and home care end markets were more than offset by declines in building and construction. Sequentially, net sales were down 12% driven primarily by lower demand and decreased local price for siloxanes due to supply additions in China as well as planned maintenance turnaround activity. Operating EBIT for the segment was $302 million compared to $284 million in the year ago period as margins expanded by 20 basis points due to price gains for both silicones and coatings applications. Sequentially, operating EBIT declined $259 million, driven by lower prices for siloxanes and increased raw material and energy costs.\nI'll now turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and actions on Slide 5.\n\nHoward I. Ungerleider\n\nPresident & CFO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue navigating high inflation, supply chain constraints and the impact of geopolitical tensions. In Europe, high energy and feedstock costs are driving record Eurozone inflation, reaching a new high of 10% in September. As a result, we see reduced industrial production and consumer spending.\nIn China, COVID-19 related lockdowns continue to hinder economic activity with weaker-than-expected regional consumer spending and infrastructure investments. That said, we're seeing continued strength in the mobility sector with automotive sales up more than 25% in September year-over-year.\nIn the U.S., healthy consumer spending and low unemployment rates have supported resilient underlying demand despite high inflation, with U.S. consumer confidence rising in September for the third consecutive month. Looking forward, we're closely monitoring the impact of rising interest rates on demand.\nAnd in Latin America, we continue to see robust demand for flexible food packaging and consumer durables, as well as transportation and infrastructure end markets.\nTo manage these evolving dynamics, we continue taking actions region by region and business by business. Throughout the third quarter, Dow implemented plans to reduce natural gas consumption at our sites in Europe by more than 15% due to high energy costs. In August, we also temporarily lowered our polyethylene nameplate capacity by 15% and have now implemented a cold furnace idling program at our crackers for fixed and energy cost savings. In parallel, we continue to prioritize higher-margin functional polymers to capitalize on continued demand strength while working to ease logistics constraints along the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nWe're also reducing operating rates and shifting production across polyurethane, siloxane and acrylic monomer assets in Europe to manage our costs and our inventory levels. And as we plan for next year, we have additional actions focused on production optimization, turnaround spending and reductions in purchased services with the potential to deliver more than $1 billion in cost savings on a run rate basis.\nTurning to Slide 6. You'll see our current expectations for the fourth quarter. In the Packaging and Specialty Plastics segment, we see stable demand for consumables and food packaging applications. We anticipate global energy markets to remain volatile in response to geopolitical dynamics, as well as weather in the Northern Hemisphere and continue to expect lower consumer spending, primarily in Europe. While lower turnaround costs will be a sequential tailwind, in total, we expect $150 million seasonal headwind for the segment versus the prior quarter.\nIn the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, demand for energy applications, particularly in the U.S. and a seasonal increase in de-icing fluid demand are expected to positively impact the quarter. Inflationary pressures, however, continue to impact consumer durables and building and construction demand, particularly in Europe. We also expect continued pressure on propylene oxide and MEG margins due to increased supply from producers in Asia. After completing major planned maintenance activity in the prior quarter, on a net basis, we expect similar dynamics with a typical seasonality on a sequential basis.\nIn the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, demand for personal care and mobility applications remains stable as consumers move toward holiday season buying patterns. However, we also anticipate a seasonal decline in demand for coating applications. Lower spending on planned maintenance activity will partially offset margin pressure from supply of both siloxanes and acrylic monomers from Asia, particularly to Europe. All in, we anticipate a $250 million headwind for the segment.\nSo in total, for the fourth quarter, we expect a $400 million net EBITDA headwind compared to the third quarter. We have also provided updates to the full year modeling inputs in the appendix of the presentation. Equity earnings have been revised to align with the current market conditions and the weaker margins in Asia. We've lowered full year CapEx from $2.1 billion to $1.9 billion, and the full year tax rate is now expected to be slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the geographic mix and lower equity earnings. This upward pressure on the full year rate is also expected to increase the fourth quarter tax rate to account for the typical year-to-date true-up.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChairman & CEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 7. As a result of our actions over the last several years, we've created a streamlined portfolio with unique levers to manage through the current macro backdrop. We have global scale and leading positions across a diverse set of attractive market verticals, geographies and value chains. This gives us significant flexibility to quickly respond to evolving demand trends and capture demand better than our peers. 65% of our production capacity is in the cost advantaged Americas, and we have 2x to 3x more LPG flexibility in Europe versus our peers. Our advantaged cost position and unmatched feedstock and derivative flexibility enables us to optimize our margins. And our commitment to operational and financial discipline underpinned by a culture of benchmarking and a best owner mindset have resulted in a low-cost operating model and strong cash conversion. These advantages have served us well since spin, providing a solid financial foundation that supports long-term value creation despite the current unprecedented events impacting the market.\nImportantly, our early cycle growth investments and our efficiency programs are enabling us to raise our underlying mid-cycle earnings above pre-pandemic levels. We've nearly tripled our 3-year trailing cumulative free cash flow since spin across a variety of macro environments, and we'll continue to execute on levers to drive even higher cash flow, including working capital improvements, joint venture dividends and cash interest savings. And our balance sheet is now the strongest it's been in my more than 35 years with the company, creating a solid financial position that offers significant flexibility.\nThe combination of robust cash flow generation and a strong credit profile enables us to deploy capital in a disciplined and balanced manner as we advance our decarbonize and growth strategy while also consistently returning cash to our shareholders through the economic cycle.\nMoving to Slide 8. In 2022, we expect to deliver an incremental underlying EBITDA run rate of approximately $300 million to $400 million comprised of $300 million from growth initiatives across our operating segments, as well as $50 million to $100 million from efficiency levers. We have 2 consolation investments coming online this year to serve high-value home care and pharma end markets. Our 60-kiloton project in the United States started up in the third quarter, and our 34-kiloton project in Spain is on track to start up in the fourth quarter. Our 150-kiloton FCDh pilot plant in Louisiana is also on track to start up in the fourth quarter. And year-to-date, we have completed 13 downstream silicones debottlenecking projects. Longer term, we remain on track to grow underlying EBITDA by greater than $3 billion by 2030, while reducing our carbon emissions by 30% versus our 2005 baseline.\nOur suite of higher return, lower risk and faster payback investments will deliver $2 billion in additional run rate EBITDA while we also reduce our carbon emissions by approximately 2 million metric tons by the middle of this decade. These investments target higher-value applications that enable us to capitalize on increasing demand for more sustainable and circular solutions.\nLet me highlight a couple of examples. Our ENGAGE elastomers, increase the lifetime of solar panels and enable over 50 gigawatts of solar power generation around the world. And we recently launched SiLASTIC, the world's first silicone-based self-sealing tire solution that can be easily recycled, which is being commercialized in upcoming Bridgestone tires under the technology name B-SEALS. We also remain on track to reach preliminary investment decision by year-end for our Path2Zero project in Alberta to build the world's first zero carbon emissions, ethylene and derivatives cracker complex, which will grow our global polyethylene supply by 15% while decarbonizing 20% of our global ethylene capacity. This project will generate an additional $1 billion of underlying EBITDA by 2030.\nAs we deliver on our growth strategy, we remain committed to the disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation that has served us well since spin. Our first priority is to maintain safe and reliable operations. We continue to advance our growth investments with CapEx at or below D&A and drive return on invested capital greater than 13% across the economic cycle.\nWith adjusted debt-to-EBITDA inside our long-term target range of 2x to 2.5x, we have the financial flexibility to deploy cash to maximize long-term shareholder value creation, and we're targeting to return 65% of our operating net income to shareholders. Since spin, we've exceeded this target, returning an average of 78%.\nTurning to Slide 9. Despite near-term macroeconomic challenges, innovating circular and sustainable solutions remains a key aspect of our long-term decarbonize and growth strategy. We see increasing demand for these products, which represent a significant growth opportunity for Dow with attractive pricing that will support longer-term higher quality earnings. We have continued to accelerate our actions to capitalize on this opportunity and create a circular economy.\nAnd we recently announced a new commitment to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable plastic solutions annually by 2030. This new goal expands our sustainability targets and our focus on advancing a circular plastics business platform to meet our customers' increasing demands for more sustainable and circular products, as evidenced in the recent letter published by the Consumer Goods Forum citing demand for advanced recycled plastic material.\nTo achieve this goal, we will exceed our original target to enable 1 million metric tons of plastic waste to be collected, used, reused or recycled. And we're well on our way as we scale a robust pipeline of more than 20 strategic collaborations to enable recycling infrastructure, to partner across the value chain to bring hard-to-recycle waste into the circular economy and to help communities address waste management and recycling gaps. This includes our most recent and significant commitment to date to scale advanced recycling with Mura Technology, which positions Dow to be the largest consumer of recycled plastic feedstock for polyethylene globally.\nThese collaborations are a unique advantage as demand for circular solutions continues to grow. When you consider together the circular and renewable sales target, along with the additional capacity from our Alberta project, in 2030, our combined circular, renewable and zero carbon emissions capacity will comprise greater than 50% of our global polyethylene capacity.\nI'll close on Slide 10, our strategic priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to operate with agility as we navigate the current market dynamics as evidenced by our recent actions to balance production while ensuring we remain well-positioned to capture demand as market conditions improve. At the same time, we remain focused on executing our long-term growth strategy, expanding our competitive advantages, and delivering on our financial priorities to position the company for long-term success.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open up the Q&A.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of IR, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instructions.",

Please go ahead.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of IR, Dow Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining Dow's second quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast.\nI am Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President.

And then to close, Jim will discuss how we continue to advance our decarbonize and growth strategy to deliver value growth. Following that, we will take your questions. Now let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChairman & CEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning with Slide 3. In the second quarter, Team Dow delivered top line growth both year-over-year and sequentially. These results reflect the strength of our diverse global portfolio, our focus on execution and our proactive pricing actions. As such, our team was able to navigate dynamic market conditions, the impacts of pandemic lockdowns in China, continued logistics constraints, and higher energy and raw material costs.\nSales increased 13% year-over-year with gains in all operating segments and regions. Sequentially, sales were up 3% with gains in all regions except Asia Pacific. Local price increased in all operating segments, businesses and regions, up 16% compared to the prior year period and up 6% sequentially with gains in all operating segments and regions.\nVolume was consistent with the prior year as growth in Packaging & Specialty Plastics was primarily offset by declines in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. Sequentially, volume declined 2%, primarily due to lower demand in Europe and China in the quarter. With our low-cost position and industry-leading feedstock and derivative flexibility, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.9 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion.\nOur disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation enabled us to further strengthen our balance sheet. We redeemed $750 million of outstanding notes in the quarter, lowering our annual interest expense by $27 million. As a result, we have no substantial long-term debt maturities due until 2027. We also returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $800 million in share repurchases and $505 million through our industry-leading dividend.\nFurthering our commitment to transparency and accountability, this quarter, we also published our annual integrated ESG report INtersections. The report highlights our ESG leadership advancements and aligns our data and disclosures with key ESG frameworks. Notably, this year's report features convenient access to data as well as enhanced disclosures and carbon emission reporting for Scope 1 and 2, intensity metrics and full TCFD implementation.\nKey highlights from the report include, executing our plan to decarbonize and grow, accelerating sustainability investments to enable design for recyclability and more circular plastics, taking deliberate actions to drive inclusion, diversity and equity, and improving governance, transparency and accountability.\nDow's report is one of few in our industry to receive limited assurance against formal standards by its external audit firm. And with our latest report, we added our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting in accordance with greenhouse gas protocol reporting to the assurance review. We're proud of our progress. And if you haven't already accessed the report, we welcome you to do so through the link included in this presentation or on our website.\nNow turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, Operating EBIT was $1.4 billion compared to $2 billion in the year ago period, which was elevated due to weather-driven events. Price increases year-over-year were more than offset by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs. Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $202 million and operating EBIT margins increased by 120 basis points due to improved product mix and increased integrated margins despite higher raw material and energy costs, primarily in the United States and Canada.\nMoving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $426 million compared to $648 million in the year ago period, as increased raw material and energy costs and planned maintenance activity were partly offset by higher pricing. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $235 million and operating EBIT margins declined by 490 basis points, also primarily due to higher costs and planned maintenance.\nAnd finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $561 million, up $336 million year-over-year as margins expanded by 960 basis points, primarily due to price gains for both silicones and coatings applications as well as improved monomers supply compared to the prior year.\nSequentially, operating EBIT declined $34 million, as lower siloxane prices in Europe and China were partly offset by margin expansion in the Coatings & Performance Monomers business.\nI'll now turn it over to Howard to review our outlook on Slide 5.\n\nHoward I. Ungerleider\n\nPresident & CFO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. We continue to closely monitor the evolving economic landscape, including inflation, interest rates, ongoing supply chain challenges and geopolitical risks. And as we have continued to prove, we are well positioned to adapt to market dynamics while continuing to advance our long-term decarbonized and growth strategy.\nRecent economic indicators show continued growth in global economic and industrial activity, albeit at a slower pace. U.S. PMI remained positive in the second quarter as higher U.S. industrial production and capacity utilization levels were supported by continuing demand for consumables and services.\nIn Europe, the geopolitical and inflationary environment is driving moderation in consumer confidence and spending. However, PMI was still at expansionary levels at the end of the quarter. In China, economic activity began to recover at the end of the quarter with manufacturing PMI expanding in June, and Chinese output and new orders lifting to expansionary levels for the first time since February. And as the regional economy continues to reopen, we expect industrial output and consumer spending to benefit from easing supply chain constraints as well.\nWhile the macroeconomic environment remains dynamic, we continue to see areas of underlying strength across our market verticals where demand and consumer spending have been resilient. Our unique competitive advantages, including our global footprint, our industry-leading feedstock and derivative flexibility, combined with our chemistry toolkit and our innovation engine, enabled Dow to remain agile to changing geographic, energy and market conditions.\nImportantly, oil to gas spreads, as you can see on the slide, continue to support our structurally advantaged feedstock positions along the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, Argentina and the Middle East. These advantages enable us to mitigate the impacts of higher raw material and energy costs as we navigate the market dynamics around the world.\nTurning to Slide 6, you'll see our current expectations for the third quarter. In the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, we continue to see healthy demand in food packaging and consumable end markets, largely connected to economic expansion in the services and travel sectors.\nHigher energy costs and near-term regional supply imbalances are expected to be a headwind of approximately $125 million in the quarter. We also have 3 planned maintenance turnarounds at crackers in Texas, Argentina and Canada that will be a $75 million headwind versus the prior quarter as well.\nIn the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, while industrial activity and infrastructure spending in the U.S. remain resilient, we expect inflation to continue impacting global consumer durables demand, including furniture and bedding and appliance end markets. Industry supply recovery of propylene oxide in China will likely drive higher global polyol and other PO derivative supply and combined with higher energy costs in Europe will likely result in an approximately $125 million headwind.\nWe completed our significant planned maintenance in Stade in the prior quarter and will execute additional turnarounds at our alkoxylates facility in Seadrift and at our EDC/VCM facility in Germany, in total, contributing an approximately $25 million tailwind in the quarter.\nIn the Performance Materials & Coatings segment, we expect sustained U.S. consumer spending for home and personal care applications as well as a continuation of seasonal construction activity. Industry siloxane capacity additions and supply recovery in China, along with higher energy costs, are expected to generate a $200 million headwind in the quarter.\nAll in, for the third quarter, we expect a $500 million net impact compared to the second quarter, which is aligned with current first call consensus for the quarter. We remain confident that our focused and disciplined approach, combined with our competitive advantages, will enable us to maintain our industry leadership and continue to drive value in a dynamic market environment.\nFinally, on Slide 7, we have also updated our full year modeling inputs. Notably, we executed a $750 million make whole call on our 2026 debt in the second quarter in line with our previous full year target. We also raised our expectation of dividends from our joint ventures to $900 million and a year-end estimated share count of 700 million shares due to a strong cash generation profile.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChairman & CEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 8. We continue to advance our Decarbonize & Grow strategy, which we expect will deliver greater than $3 billion in additional run rate EBITDA while reducing our carbon emissions by 30% by 2030.\nAs a reminder, our path to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings is a phased side-by-side approach that both retrofits and replaces end-of-life assets with low carbon emission facilities while also expanding our capacity. This plan will deliver a 30% reduction in our CO2 emissions between 2005 and 2030 through a disciplined approach based on affordability, macro and regulatory drivers around the world.\nAs a progress update, we continue to invest in renewable energy with access to more than 900 megawatts now. We're also making asset efficiency improvements and investing in innovative carbon-efficient technologies like electric cracking and carbon capture.\nRecently, we announced the startup of an e-cracking research scale unit in the Netherlands that represents a key milestone in our joint technology program. Engineering and development efforts are ongoing for our plan to build the world's first ever net-zero carbon emissions ethylene cracker and derivatives complex in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, with formal resource loading, vendor selection and project investment decisions by year-end all on track. And work is underway to develop detailed plans to reduce CO2 emissions at our sites in both Europe and in the Americas.\nThese projects collectively demonstrate Dow's leadership in the transition to a sustainable world while driving underlying earnings growth. To that end, on Slide 9, while we decarbonize, we also continue to invest in higher return, faster payback projects, capture our efficiency levers and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, including circularity.\nIn the near term, our in-flight investments remain on track to deliver an incremental underlying EBITDA run rate of approximately $2 billion by year-end 2025, which includes approximately $300 million of run rate EBITDA in 2022 with growth levers across each of our operating segments.\nFor example, in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, our 150-kiloton FCDh pilot plant in Louisiana is expected to start up in the fourth quarter of this year. In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our alkoxylates capacity investments are on track to start up in the second half of this year.\nAnd in Performance Materials & Coatings, we completed 2 debottlenecking projects and 2 growth projects in the second quarter with 9 additional projects expected to be complete by year-end. Importantly, circularity is also a key enabler of our growth strategy as brand owners and our customers increasingly demand more circular solutions. We are leveraging our more than 20 strategic partnerships globally as we accelerate our circular product capabilities and technologies to meet this demand.\nToday, we announced a series of circularity projects, including a plan with our existing partner, Mura Technology, to construct multiple world-scale advanced recycling facilities in the United States and Europe. These projects will add up to 600,000 tons per year of plastic waste recycling capacity by 2030, representing Dow's largest commitment to date to scale advanced recycling.\nAs a major off-taker, Dow's capacity of circular polymer products will expand significantly as we utilize recycled plastic feedstock to produce new virgin grade and 100% circular derivatives serving fast-growing brand owner needs across our market verticals.\nIn parallel, we continue to accelerate our mechanical recycling capabilities through partnerships like the one we announced today with French recycling company, Valoregen, to build the largest single hybrid recycling site in France. Dow will be the main recipient of its post-consumer recycled resin for our REVOLOOP PCR product range, which recently received certification for plastics recycling traceability and content in Europe.\nThese collaborations will support approximately 2/3 of Dow's 2030 target to enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected, reused and recycled.\nIn addition, our efficiency levers are on track to deliver roughly $600 million of run rate EBITDA from our restructuring program and digital investments by year-end 2025.\nIn 2022, we expect these investments to deliver a run rate EBITDA of $50 million to $100 million. We already achieved the full run rate benefits from our 2020 restructuring program at the end of 2021, and we will see run rate benefits from our digital investments ramping up over the next few years.\nFor example, we have accelerated modernizing and automating our warehouse management systems, and we improved our supply chain planning process using new digital capabilities, enabling us to consolidate multiple customer shipments, lower costs and reduce our carbon emissions. We also improved the customer experience through enhanced real-time delivery tracking capabilities across all modes of product shipping. These digitalization improvements are particularly valuable when global supply chains are as dynamic as they are today.\nMoving to Slide 10. Dow is well positioned to generate resilient cash flows and deliver value across a variety of economic environments. This reflects our approach to manage the business with more agility and efficiency, operate with the best owner mindset and continue to ensure accountability, transparency and a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation.\nOur 3-year average EBITDA is now at more than $9 billion, driven by our early industry cycle growth investments and efficiency programs that have collectively raised our underlying earnings above pre-pandemic levels as well as improved our cost position versus the previous cycle. We nearly tripled our 3-year trailing cumulative free cash flow since spin.\nWith respect to the balance sheet, we have reduced gross debt by more than $6 billion in spend with a target ratings agency leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x compared to 2.5 to 3x at spin. All of our debt is fixed rate, with less than $1 billion of maturities due over the next 5 years, which represents a reduction of approximately $7 billion in near-term debt maturities since spin.\nOur underfunded pension status now stands at approximately $3 billion, less than half of where it was at spin. The significant progress we've made has been reflected in our credit ratings, including a recent upgrade from Moody's and positive outlook revisions from Fitch and S&P. With ample cash generation, we remain focused on executing our value-creating decarbonize and growth strategy, while continuing to deliver attractive shareholder remuneration.\nTo that point, we completed our previous share repurchase program in the second quarter and initiated our new $3 billion program, aligned with our target of returning 65% of operating net income to shareholders over the economic cycle.\nAs Dow looks ahead, our strong cash flow, balance sheet and attractive growth prospects collectively enabled increased optionality to remain agile through a variety of economic environments and continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Pankaj to open up the Q&A.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of IR, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.",

    "content": "Half Year 2022 Downer EDI Ltd Earnings Call\n\nHalf Year 2022 Downer EDI Ltd Earnings Call\n\nDOWASXFEB 9, 6:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for standing by, and welcome to the Downer Half Year Results Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to Grant Fenn, CEO. Please go ahead.\n\nGrant Anthony Fenn\n\nMD, CEO & Director, Downer EDI Limited\n\n(technical difficulty) will go through the financials in more detail. And I'll then discuss the outlook before we open up the call for your questions.\nSo let's move to Slide 2 highlights and priorities. First of all, it's hard to talk about the last 6 months' results without acknowledging upfront the impact that COVID-19 and in particular, Omicron, to somewhat normality. Now I'd particularly like to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of our people and our customers. And they've continued to put in an amazing effort, remembering that the vast majority of Downer people don't have the option of working from home. They're out there every day making it happen.\nIn summary, the results announced today are very good in a touch factor of what's been thrown at them. It's also clear to me that in times like these, the benefits of our diversification coming to their own. For the half, we've delivered 4.4% growth in core earnings, with normalized cash conversion of 91.2%. Our core revenue has increased by 13.3%, which just highlight (technical difficulty) a little bit complete on the construction of the new Sustainable Resource Center at Rosehill, and this will be the most efficient asphalt manufacturing and recycling plant in the country.\nWe continue to fill out our asphalt manufacturing and services footprint with the acquisition of Fowlers Asphalting in Gippsland in Victoria. And we've been successful in resetting the Reviewable Services at Royal Adelaide and Bendigo Hospitals as we roll through the presentation. Given the strength of the business, we've decided to increase the interim dividend from $0.09 to $0.12 per share. And we've spent $123 million so far in our market share buyback. The program has been suspended since 31 December just because of blackout with the results, but we'll now recommence buying back shares (technical difficulty) development, communication capabilities and infrastructure investment that will drive growth in our markets for the next decade at least. We're setting up the business to take advantage of those challenges. And we've got to continue to drive our sustainability performance. We are a leader in ESG in our markets, and I will like to be proud of. If you haven't already, please have a good look at our sustainability report on our website.\n(technical difficulty) extensive capabilities we have across our group, particularly in HV power transmission and power generation, including renewables and battery storage means we can help our customers decarbonize. The increasing focus on sustainability by our customers and capital providers is a real opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves, and we will be slanting the business to the massive decarbonization effort that is required across the economy.\nRevenue in these difficult times shows that we will grow organically through increased customer spend in our market areas, but also through strategic acquisitions like Fowlers, which we've done in the last 6 months. And just think for a minute of the size of the effort required for the nation to meet its 2050 net zero target. The demand from our customers for decarbonization (technical difficulty) governments can't or won't put numbers to what needs to be spent. It's too large, and this all lies ahead of us.\nI will now move to Slide 3 and our management of COVID in the last 6 months, just to give you a sense of how businesses like ours are managing. So despite the obvious challenges, I am very pleased with how our management teams have organized our labor availability center off at the moment, isolating for one reason or another. Now business continuity strategies have been generally well managed with percentage in isolation now stabilizing or declining in all of those areas. So things are getting much better.\nPleasingly, we've had limited impact on our ability to service customers. Customer labor shortages on the (technical difficulty) So on the customers side, the labor shortages are impacting workflow and delaying new projects. And you can see that as we roll through the individual divisions. But we think this will reverse as infection rates, as we can see, are in decline. On workplace management, the compliance effort has been quite complicated with different safe work requirements across each state and territory. Most states have been -- have seen multiple changes in rules, or most days have seen multiple changes in rules and requirements across the states and New Zealand. Unfortunately, it's just something that has to be managed. And thankfully, we are well versed in managing through change.\nThere is undoubtedly a productivity impact increasing the cost of service, but we anticipate this will be temporary. Mitigating the ongoing risk of COVID is obviously key. Now we've long established safe -- COVID safe standards, practices and mature continuity plans, which have held us in good stead, and we share those and coordinate with our customers. We are proactive with our customers, both on the service side but also commercially.\nWe're focusing in on our supply chain management and are planning as far ahead as we can trying to predict bottlenecks and future shortages. Our workforce is directed to priority works, continuity of critical regulatory roles, particularly where we operate customer infrastructure and smaller work groups that are more severely impacted by staff shortages. And we're also using alternate contract partners or subcontractors where we need to. But on the contract management side, customers are generally supportive and are providing KPI relief where appropriate.\nIn a number of cases, COVID-related variation claims over the last 2 years continue to progress. I would say that the volatility in materials, adverse supply and pricing is making it difficult for everybody in the market to commit to cost and program timing for new contracts, and this is a key focus for our risk reviews. And generally, the circumstances are requiring a more collaborative approach to risk sharing with customers. Now that's not a bad thing.\nNow given the understandable interest in the prospect of much higher inflation levels and wage growth on the businesses like Downer, I thought I'd include the following slide, which you may have seen from the last full year presentation. Now I'm not going to go through that slide in detail, but what you'll see is that long-term contracts adjust to the impact of cost increases, including wages. Now over the past decade, these adjustments have been generally detrimental to margins due to lower movement in CPI and wage indexes, in some cases, being outstripped by actual costs.\nNow I think we're entering a phase where this could turn around, where higher CPI and wage indices provide price rises that exceed actual cost increases in some cases. It will, of course, require close cost and labor management. But in my view, it is an opportunity that we haven't had over the last number of years.\nI will now turn to the performance of our 3 core businesses, Transport, Utilities and Facilities. So as you know, Transport is the powerhouse of the group, both in Australia and New Zealand, contributing half of the group's revenue. Our revenue was up 14.6%, $359 million, with strong performances across the business units. EBITA was up 15.9%, with increased contributions from rail and transit systems and projects.\nNow the results would have been better, but the Roads business, which was having a cracking half, was unfortunately impacted by terrible weather in the second quarter. Now we commenced the operation of Adelaide's Metro Trains and the Region 8 bus contract in Sydney, and both have started very well. I spent some time at the Brookvale bus depot last week, and all looks very good. Now we're hopeful of being successful in other bus operations being tendered in Sydney at the moment.\nWe've also recently picked up the Transurban CitiLink road services contract in Melbourne, which is really pleasing. And as I said, the new Rosehill Sustainable Resource Center is in commissioning. Now it's a game changer for us being the most efficient asphalt and recycling facility in the country. And we've also, as I said, acquired Fowlers Asphalting in Gippsland in Victoria, further strengthening our geographic footprint in bituminous products and services.\nSo now to Utilities. Now it contributes 15% of group revenue, and we've got a well-balanced portfolio across power and gas, water and telecommunications. Revenue was down 5.6%, $51 million, due to lower volumes and a change in mix away from higher margin minor capital works. Now these are all COVID-related. We think the change is temporary, but it certainly had an impact on the half. EBIT (sic) [EBITA] was down 26.5% or $12 million as a result of the mix and volume change, with a more significant impact in New Zealand. On the bright side, we are winning good business in Australia and New Zealand, and our customer feedback is great.\nWe've recently been awarded a key 3-year Chorus field services contract in New Zealand, further extending our leading market position there. And we're also now converting decarbonization opportunities for our customers in what we are calling new energy, and this will grow.\nSo let's now go to Facilities. So Downer is the largest integrated facilities provider in Australia and New Zealand, with strong positions in a number of government areas, including health, education, defense and social housing. We're also the leading provider of asset maintenance and specialist services to Australia's critical economic infrastructure, including oil and gas, power generation and industrial sectors. Facilities contributes about 35% of group revenue.\nNow revenue for the period was up 22%, driven mainly by COVID-related volumes in health and education. And as you know, there's been a lot more work in that area. Also industrial maintenance in Australia, compared to the prior comparative period, and building projects in New Zealand. There was a strong earnings performance from most areas, but EBITA was up just 7.5% due to COVID acts on 2 areas. So project volumes in asset and development services and in lower levels of work in power and energy. Again, the impact is temporary, it's COVID-related, and the projects will return.\nOn the positive side, we were awarded the $1 billion New South Wales Police property portfolio capital works contract during the period, and this was very pleasing. I'm also pleased to report that we've successfully renegotiated Royal Adelaide Hospital contract and the Bendigo Hospital contract, and this is quite a milestone. We've also now exited the majority of our hospitality contracts. And finally, like Utilities, the Facilities business is very well positioned to meet our customers' requirements to decarbonize.\nSo now to work-in-hand. Downer's work-in-hand is a substantial $35 billion, and 92% of this is government related. The pie chart on the right of the slide shows that 91% of our work-in-hand relates to services contracts, predominantly long-term contracts servicing critical infrastructure. Around 9% of our work-in-hand is attributable to construction, and only 1% of our $35 billion of work-in-hand relates to what we'd call lump sum construction contracts. And of course, we manage the risk in those very, very heavily. The extended profile of our workbook, as you can see there, also provides stability and confidence in our relative market position is strong and improving.\nSo I'll come back in a moment. I'll hand over to Michael now who will present the financial results, and I'll come back a little later to talk about the outlook.\nOver to you, Michael.\n\nMichael James Ferguson\n\nCFO, Downer EDI Limited\n\nThanks, Grant, and good morning, everyone. Slide 10 provides a summary of the group's financial results, including statutory and underlying financial performance, cash flow performance and key balance sheet metrics. I'll talk through the detail of each in the following slides, commencing with group underlying financial performance on Slide 11.\nOn a consolidated basis, the group reported total revenue of $6 billion for the 6 months to 31 December 2021. This was 2.3% lower than the prior corresponding period, predominantly due to the impact of the divestment program. Similarly, EBITDA and depreciation have also declined 24% and 30%, respectively, due to the impact of the divestment of laundries and mining.\nUnderlying EBITA declined 17.8% to $182 million with an EBITA margin of 3%. There is a detailed breakdown between core earnings growth and the loss of noncore earnings set out on the next slide. Margin reduction has been driven by COVID disruptions and the losses incurred in the hospitality business. Net interest expense reduced by 11.6%, reflecting lower debt levels and an improved average cost of funds. We expect this to continue to trend down following the successful refinancing of our sustainability linked loan in November.\nThe effective tax rate of 28% remains slightly below the Australian statutory tax rate of 30% due to nontaxable distributions from joint ventures and a lower corporate tax rate in New Zealand. Downer delivered an underlying NPATA of $97.6 million, which is 18.1% lower than the prior corresponding period. Return on funds employed increased 1.4 percentage points to 11.3%. The Downer Board has declared an unfranked interim dividend of $0.12 per share. While this represents a payout ratio of 87% of underlying NPATA, it is consistent with the final FY '21 dividend and considered appropriate given the group's strong liquidity position at 31 December. Downer expects to return to frank dividends either for final FY '23 or interim FY '24.\nMoving now to Slide 12, outlining the business unit performance. Downer's core Urban Services businesses delivered EBITA of $238 million, up $10 million or 4.4% on the prior corresponding period. Grant has discussed the performance of the core business in the earlier slides. Consistent with Downer's new structure following the divestment program and as flagged at our FY '21 full year results, this is the first reporting period we have disclosed our core business under the simpler Transport, Utilities and Facilities segments. The most notable impact of this change is the inclusion of asset services in the Facilities result and the transfer of Downer's Defense Consulting business from Utilities to Facilities.\nWe have also adjusted the comparative periods for consistency with the reconciliation included on Slide 25 of the supplementary information. Noncore business EBITA resulted in a net loss of $4.4 million for the half. This includes the contribution from the mining businesses, Open Cut East and Otraco, up to their divestment dates of $8.1 million offset by the loss from hospitality of $12.5 million. The result reflects -- the hospitality result reflects the significant impact of COVID during the period at a number of venues, most notably the prolonged lockdown affecting the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Included in the result is approximately $8 million of monthly minimum guaranteed customer payments that were paid under the MCG contract that were not incurred in previous lockdown periods.\nDowner has now completed its contract at MCG, and hand it over to the new catering services provider at the end of January '22. Downer has now exited all but a small number of hospitality contracts, with the remainder expected to be sold or run off before the end of FY '22. Corporate costs rose by 8.8% to $52 million. Whilst we have reduced our head office costs during the half as part of the divestment program, the full benefit of these reductions has not flowed through the first half as yet. We have also seen continued increases in other costs, particularly insurance and IT security costs.\nSlide 13 lists the 5 items that reconcile Downer's statutory result with the underlying result. The net impact of these items results in the statutory profit exceeding the underlying profit by $1.4 million. The first item relates to the noncash fair value movement on the Downer contingent share obligation liability arising from options issued as part of the Spotless minority acquisition. The fair value of these options are required to be recognized as a financial liability at issue date, with the future movements being mark-to-market through earnings. As a result, we have recognized a noncash charge of $5.4 million for the half year.\nThe second and third items relates to divestment and exit costs and portfolio restructuring costs incurred as part of Downer's divestment program totaling $51.3 million. Divestment and exit costs include the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the divested assets, including an allocation of IT systems and property costs. Portfolio restructuring costs include redundancy costs incurred as the group reduces its management layers and corporate headcount as part of its post-divestment restructure.\nIt is expected that the write-off of these costs will lead to future annual savings of approximately $8 million through reduced amortization, leasing and employee costs. The fourth item relates to bid costs relating to Queensland's Rollingstock Expansion Program. $2.8 million in bid costs were incurred during the period, and we have highlighted this item as we expect total bid costs to be material for FY '22.\nThe final item relates to the compulsory acquisition of land by Sydney Metro at Downer's Rosehill asphalt and recycling facility. The transaction has resulted in Sydney Metro reimbursing Downer on a like-for-like basis for the actual costs incurred on the construction and commissioning of a replacement facility. Downer expects the compulsory acquisition and reinstatement of operations at the new site to be cash neutral in net terms.\nThe replacement facility is expected to be completed by May 2022 with no expected disruption to operations. The $60.1 million after tax gain during the period is reflective of the difference between the historical written down book value of the existing facility and the reimbursement of costs for the replacement facility and relocation costs.\nTurning to cash flow on Slide 14. Total operating cash flow was $270.4 million, resulting in a statutory cash flow conversion of 85.1%. Adjusting for the remaining payments recognized in FY '20 and funded as part of the July '21 capital raising, underlying conversion was 91.2%. Pleasingly, Downer's portfolio transformation continues to drive lower capital intensity with net capital expenditure for the core business of $65.2 million. Downer has also invested $22.8 million in IT-related capital with just over half of this focused on improving Downer's cybersecurity.\nTotal funds from operation was $78.7 million. Below funds from operations, proceeds from divestments totaled $247.6 million for the period, whilst the repayment of borrowings relates to the early repayment of Downer's medium term note during March 2022. Cash applied to the share buyback program was $99 million. The group also acquired Fowlers Asphalting during the period. Cash held at 31 December was $676.7 million, which when combined with undrawn facilities of $1.4 billion, provides us with significant liquidity of $2.1 billion.\nAs Grant indicated, Downer's balance sheet is in good shape with net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5x, well below our target range of 2 to 2.5x. The successful refinancing of our sustainability linked loan during the period and prudent debt management have seen our weighted average debt duration extend from 3.8 years at 30 June 2021 to 4.2 years. We have included further details on cash flow, debt maturity and balance sheet in the supplementary information on Slides 21 to 24.\nThanks very much, and I'll now hand back to Grant.\n\nGrant Anthony Fenn\n\nMD, CEO & Director, Downer EDI Limited\n\nYes. Thanks, Michael. So the key messages and outlook. With the arrival of Omicron, it's been a tough 6 months to navigate, or tougher 6 months to navigate than we expected in August 2021. Despite the challenges, Downer has delivered solid earnings and strong cash conversion for the first half of 2022. Our market positions and diversity give us strength that others don't have and confidence through to the other side of COVID-19. Our brand and our relationships are very strong.\nThe financial capacity of the group has never been so robust with gearing at just 16.5%, and net debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5x. In August '21, we predicted that our core Urban Services revenue and earnings would grow in FY '22. In the first half, our core revenue was up 13.3% and earnings were up 4.4%. But the impact of Omicron on the supply chain, work volumes and mix is difficult to predict and presents risk for the second half, so we'll not be providing specific earnings guidance. We'll do our best to manage that risk with our customers, and we'll provide an update at our Investor Day in April.\nSo thank you, and that's the end of the formal presentation, and I'll hand over to the moderator to organize the questions. Thanks.",

(Operator Instructions) Also, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Pankaj Gupta. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of IR, Dow Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining Dow's fourth quarter earnings call. This call is available via webcast, and we have prepared slides to supplement our comments today. They are posted on the Investor Relations section of Dow's website and through the link to our webcast. I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow Investor Relations Vice President, and joining me today on the call are James Fitterling, Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Howard Ungerleider, President and Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the earnings news release and slides. During our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures is contained in the Dow earnings release, in the slides that supplement our comments today as well as on the Dow website.\nOn Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. Jim will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year highlights and operating segment performance; Howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance; and then Jim will discuss how we will continue to execute on our priorities to deliver value growth. Following that, we will take your questions.\nNow let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChairman & CEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Pankaj. Beginning with Slide 3, in the fourth quarter, Dow once again delivered top and bottom line growth year-over-year with sales growth and margin expansion in every operating segment. Our results reflect the strength and resilience of our advantaged portfolio and the incredible efforts of the Dow team as we continue to ensure well-being and safety of our team and our communities. We delivered year-over-year sales growth of 34%, with gains in every operating segment, business and region. While volume declined 4% year-over-year due to supply constraints from several factors, including our own maintenance, lingering effects of weather-related outages and global logistics challenges, we continue to see robust underlying demand across our end markets particularly for higher-margin downstream and sustainability-led applications. Prices were up 39% year-over-year, reflecting gains in all operating segments, businesses and regions.\nOur discipline and agility enabled us to navigate the supply constraints and logistics challenges I just mentioned, dual control actions in China and rising energy costs. We delivered operating EBIT growth of $1.2 billion year-over-year, with margin expansion in every operating segment. Equity earnings were also up year-over-year with margin expansion at our joint ventures in Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Kuwait. These results translated into significant cash generation for the quarter, with cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion, up $901 million year-over-year and cash flow conversion of 88%. And we returned $912 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $512 million through our industry-leading dividend and $400 million in share repurchases.\nOur performance in the fourth quarter capped a record year for Dow, which you will see highlighted on Slide 4. In 2021, Team Dow capitalized on the economic recovery, achieving record sales and earnings performance despite pandemic driven uncertainty and industry-wide weather-related challenges. Our focus on cash flow and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to deliver on our financial priorities. We achieved $7.1 billion of cash flow from operations bringing our total cash flow from operations since spin to $18 billion. We enhanced our balance sheet by reducing gross debt by another $2.4 billion in the year, bringing down gross debt by more than $5 billion since spin. We have also no substantive debt maturities until 2026. We proactively funded our U.S. pension plans, and successfully executed Sadara's debt reprofiling, lowering Dow's guarantees by more than $2 billion. Dow has returned a total of $7.3 billion to shareholders since spin through our dividend and share repurchases, including $3.1 billion in 2021. And we kept CapEx well within D&A as we continued to invest in our higher return and faster payback growth investments. In 2021, we achieved a return on invested capital of greater than 22% on strong earnings growth.\nAs we turn the corner on the pandemic, we do so with a strong balance sheet and a deliberate and disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow. We achieved this record financial performance in 2021 while advancing our ESG leadership. Importantly, we announced our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our assets, while improving underlying EBITDA by more than $3 billion as we capitalize on our participation in attractive, high-growth end markets and sustainability-driven solutions.\nOur ESG efforts continue to be recognized externally as we were recently recognized by JUST Capital for the third year. Dow earns a top spot in the chemicals sector overall as well as the #1 position in the workers and stakeholders in governance categories in the industry. I'm extremely proud of Team Down's dedication to deliver for our customers and drive value for all of our stakeholders. We will build on these achievements in 2022 as we advance our ambition.\nMoving to our operating segment performance for the fourth quarter on Slide 5, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, Operating EBIT was $1.4 billion, up $662 million year-over-year, primarily due to margin improvement and partly offset by lower supply volumes. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $512 million and operating EBIT margins declined by 520 basis points on lower olefin and co-product pricing combined with higher raw material costs and energy costs. The Packaging & Specialty Plastics business reported higher net sales year-over-year driven by price gains in all regions as well as in key applications such as flexible food, industrial and consumer packaging. Volume declined year-over-year, primarily in Asia Pacific due to supply constraints.\nMoving to the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment, operating EBIT was $595 million, up $299 million year-over-year, primarily due to continued price strength. Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $118 million and operating EBIT margins declined 280 basis points, primarily driven by higher energy costs in Europe and our planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nThe Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period on broad-based price gains in all regions. Volume declines were primarily due to a planned transition away from a low-margin coproducer contract and our planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nThe Industrial Solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period with local price gains in all regions. Volume was flat year-over-year as higher volume from a renewable energy contract was offset by fewer licensing and catalyst sales.\nAnd finally, the Performance Materials & Coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $295 million compared to $50 million in the year ago period. as margins increased 900 basis points due to strong price momentum for silicones and coatings offerings. Sequentially, operating EBIT improved $11 million as price gains were partly offset by our planned maintenance turnaround activity.\nThe Consumer Solutions business achieved higher net sales year-over-year with local price gains in all regions and across end market applications. Volume declined as strong demand, particularly for industrial, electronics and personal care applications, was offset by lower supply availability due to our own decision to pull forward maintenance activity to coincide with dual control actions in China. The Coatings & Performance Monomers business achieved increased net sales year-over-year as higher raw material costs and strong industry demand led to price gains in all regions. Volume declined as stronger demand for architectural coatings and industrial coatings, primarily in the U.S. and Canada was more than offset by lower merchant sales of acrylic monomers partly due to Dow's own higher captive use.\nI'll now turn it over to Howard to review our outlook and modeling guidance.\n\nHoward I. Ungerleider\n\nPresident & CFO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 6. Our diversified portfolio continues to enable us to capitalize on attractive end market trends with higher-margin downstream products. Our 4 primary market verticals are each growing at rates of 1.3x to 1.5x GDP and benefiting from sustainability macro trends. We are meeting this demand with higher-margin solutions such as functional polymers, alkoxylates, surfactants, polyurethane systems, sustainable coatings and performing silicones. In the packaging vertical, demand for lower carbon emissions recyclable and circular materials are driving demand for Dow's industry-leading plastics portfolio and in-house application design capabilities.\nDow's broad suite of products and hybrid innovations targeting infrastructure will continue to benefit from government investments and incentives, with particular demand resiliency in the Americas, Europe as well as in the Middle East, Africa and India. We see global demand across the diverse consumer market vertical remaining at elevated levels, particularly for applications like electronics, 5G, appliances, pharma and home care, where several of Dow's growth investments are targeted. And in mobility, Dow's portfolio of specialty silicones, polyurethanes and elastomers is uniquely positioned to benefit from growing electric and autonomous vehicle trends. Importantly, these attractive market verticals are supported by favorable balances across our key value chains with continued strength across consumer and industrial end markets, which we'll see on Slide 7.\nWe expect the economic recovery to continue as forecasts call for above historical average global GDP growth in 2022. While the Omicron variant has resulted in some near-term disruption, we do not expect it to materially change the current recovery path, particularly as global immunization levels and treatment options continue to increase. Several factors support continued strength across our end markets. Consumer balance sheets remain healthy, with significant pent-up demand driven by more than $5 trillion in additional savings accumulated through the pandemic. Manufacturing growth is expected to remain robust, supported by increasing investments in infrastructure and accelerated adoption for 5G, EV and sustainability trends. And with retail inventories remaining low and backlogs elevated, easing supply chain issues should unleash additional volume growth in 2022 as manufacturing activity increases to meet strong consumer demand. This will certainly be a focus for Dow as we work closely with our customers to fill order backlogs and replenish inventories to meet the robust demand and increase service levels.\nTurning to Slide 8, in the first quarter, we expect these demand trends to drive growth, particularly following the Chinese Lunar New Year. Demand remains resilient in Packaging and Specialty Plastics. Although domestic polyethylene supply improved through the fourth quarter, comonomer supply remains constrained and trade sources are predicting another year of higher-than-average turnaround activity. These factors, coupled with improvements in shipping logistics that will help meet demand in the export market, are leading to more constructive supply and demand balances domestically.\nEquity earnings are expected to be lower sequentially due to rising feedstock costs impacting Asian olefin margins, and we anticipate higher raw material and energy costs, particularly in Europe and Asia. Altogether, we anticipate an approximately $200 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment. Utilizing our best-in-class feedstock flexibility and our differentiated portfolio, Dow will continue to be agile to mitigate potential volatility and meet demand.\nIn Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, strong demand for our high-value materials in appliances, construction, pharma, home care and energy applications, combined with tight supply and increased global infrastructure investment are supporting a constructive demand outlook. We anticipate approximately a $100 million benefit in this segment from completed turnarounds in the fourth quarter, including Sadara's isocyanate facility and several in our core polyurethane business. And we expect the elevated energy costs in Europe will be a $75 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment.\nIn Performance Materials & Coatings, increasing industrial activity and consumer demand for electronics and construction continues to outpace supply for our differentiated silicone products. The industry also anticipates resilient demand for architectural coatings as rebuilding from low inventory levels in preparation for the Northern Hemisphere spring and summer months.\nThe completion of our turnaround in the fourth quarter at our siloxane facility in China will allow us to take advantage of tight global market conditions as silicon metal supplies improve and energy curtailments in China continue to ease. We will also be executing a turnaround at our methacrylates facility in Deer Park. All in, we expect a $25 million net tailwind versus the prior quarter from turnarounds for this segment.\nTurning to the full year. We're continuing to provide our best estimates of several income statement and cash flow drivers. Notably, we expect lower equity earnings sequentially due to margin compression versus the tighter conditions in 2021, particularly in Asia as oil remains constructive, putting upward pressure on the naphtha-based feedstock costs in the region. Total turnaround spending for the year will be up approximately $100 million versus 2021 as we have another heavy turnaround year with 3 crackers slated for maintenance activity and increased inflationary pressure on materials and labor. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $600 million, benefiting from our proactive deleveraging actions since spin.\nFor cash flow, we anticipate higher joint venture dividends from increased earnings in 2021 and a $1 billion tailwind toward pension-related items following our actions last year. Continued investment in our digital initiatives will drive efficiency and enable us to achieve our $300 million EBITDA run rate on the program by 2025. We will also complete the spending portion of our restructuring program which is now delivering the full $300 million EBITDA run rate as we enter 2022.\nAnd finally, as we highlighted at our Investor Day, we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to $2.2 billion, well within our DNA target as we continue to advance our higher return, faster payback projects and execute on our decarbonized and growth strategy. Overall, the macroeconomic backdrop remains favorable in 2022, and Dow is well positioned due to our global footprint, feedstock flexibility, productivity programs and sustainable solutions for our customers. We will continue to leverage these advantages as we navigate higher oil prices and continue to deal with inflation and logistics challenges. And as the year progresses, we intend to drive operating rates and service levels higher and do expect widening oil to gas spreads. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\n\nJames R. Fitterling\n\nChairman & CEO, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. Turning to Slide 10, at our Investor Day in October, we laid out our disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow the company, supported by a series of in-flight earnings growth programs that will drive over $3 billion in underlying EBITDA growth. In 2022, our capital and operating investments are on track to deliver $200 million to $300 million in run rate EBITDA and will serve higher-margin, differentiated applications where demand is accelerating as customers work to reduce their own carbon footprint.\nIn Packaging and Specialty Plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion completed last year will deliver a full year of earnings growth to support increasing polyethylene demand. And our FCDh pilot plant in Louisiana will start up this year to produce propylene for coatings, electronics and durables end markets. Notably, the technology enables lower CapEx, OpEx and CO2 emissions compared to conventional PDH technologies. These projects serve faster growing, more sustainable market segments such as renewables to drive lower carbon emissions for our customers. For example, our Endurance compounds for cable systems support next-generation, longer life and lower carbon emissions infrastructure, including on and offshore wind farms by reducing the cable manufacturing carbon emissions footprint by 80%. And our Engage elastomers deliver 35% improved performance and efficiency for solar photovoltaic applications.\nIn Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, our alkoxylates and PU systems expansion projects are closely linked with brand owner demand for higher value, differentiated downstream applications across home and consumer care, agricultural and infrastructure end markets. For example, our Surfactants offer an improved environmental profile for leading brand owner laundry and home care products. and our polyurethane system PASCAL technology enables up to 10% greater energy efficiency and appliances without raising manufacturing costs.\nIn Performance Materials & Coatings, we're expanding capacity in formulated solutions for coatings and silicones through incremental debottlenecking projects. Our products enable higher performing, more sustainable solutions, targeting mobility, consumer and infrastructure end markets. For example, FASTTRACK coatings enable autonomous mobility infrastructure and have approximately 45% lower greenhouse gas emissions. And our Dallas technology enables higher density, lower-cost battery packs for the fast-growing electric vehicle market. Finally, as Howard mentioned, our restructuring program and digital investment will continue to support our low-cost operating model and top quartile cost structure.\nTurning to Slide 11, the increasing demand for sustainable products represents a significant growth opportunity for Dow with attractive pricing that will support longer-term higher quality earnings. Our customers are looking for opportunities to enhance their sustainability, and we are meeting those needs with lower carbon emissions solutions beginning with our own operations. Our Alberta project will decarbonize approximately 20% of Dow's global ethylene capacity while growing our global polyethylene supply by about 15%. We are also working with our suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 carbon emissions. To date, we have more than 150 supplier agreements in place and have adopted third-party frameworks like CDP, together for sustainability and Ecovadis to drive tangible improvements in environmental performance along the value chain.\nWe continue to advance a circular economy for plastics and see a consistent trend across our brand owner customer base, toward redesigning packages to be recyclable and incorporating 30% post-consumer recycled content in their packaging by 2030. Six of our largest sites have now received international sustainability and carbon certification plus recognition for tracking the use of sustainable feedstocks. We're advancing our partnership with Mura technology to scale advanced recycling solutions and secure circular product supply. Mura broke ground on the new plant with an expected startup around the end of the year.\nEarlier this month, we announced an investment in Mr. Green Africa, the first recycling company in Africa to be a certified B Corporation, which includes socially responsible waste collection and plans to codevelop new flexible plastic packaging that will enable more sustainable packaging solutions. A first of its kind investment for Dow in Africa, this business model will be scaled to other developing regions around the world.\nWe continue to grow our recyclable offerings, recently doubling sales with Chinese laundry brand, Liby, and increasing our addressable market opportunities. And like the partnerships, Dow recently announced to source pyrolysis oil from Gunvor and New Hope Energy. These investments in circularity are examples of our progress and solid foundation as we grow and scale circular solutions.\nTo close on Slide 12, 2021 was an outstanding year for Team Dow. We delivered record financial performance and continued our disciplined execution of our strategic priorities. Building on this foundation, we're focused on advancing our plan to decarbonize our assets and grow earnings. Our competitive advantage enables us to meet the increasing needs of our customers and consumers who are demanding more circular and sustainable products while we work to achieve 0 carbon emissions in our own operations. And as we look ahead, our priorities remain consistent. Our focus on profitable growth, while maintaining a low-cost position and best owner mindset, will enable us to deliver on our earnings growth levers.\nWe'll continue to maintain our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation, driving higher returns for the company and our shareholders while retaining the financial flexibility that has served us well. And we'll continue to advance our leadership in ESG with a clear path to achieve our 0 carbon circularity and sustainability targets. The world and our customers are demanding a more sustainable future.\nAs we execute our ambition, I am confident that we will create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Pankaj to open up the Q&A.\n\nPankaj Gupta\n\nVP of IR, Dow Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.\nOperator, please provide the Q&A instructions.",

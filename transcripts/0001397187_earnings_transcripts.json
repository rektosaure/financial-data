Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.\nActual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour, so please limit yourself to 1 question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed.\nAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard, and welcome to our quarter 2 earnings call. As you've seen from our press release, while EPS this quarter exceeded our expectations, revenue fell short of our guidance and we are reducing our revenue and earnings expectations for the year.\nWhile we continue to see positive momentum overall in our international regions, we're not happy with the current results in the U.S. business. lululemon has been in a period of hyper growth for several years, more than tripling our revenue in just 6 years, and we have successfully managed through a number of market shifts. We are facing yet another shift today within the industry. related to tariffs and the cost of doing business. The increased rates and removal of the de minimis provision have played a large part in our guidance reduction for the year.\nAs we navigate current market dynamics, I see an opportunity to reset some key areas of the business as we continue to drive long-term growth. During our time together today, I will provide an update on our business and my perspective on the near term as we continue to plan and adapt for the future. Specifically, I will share my insights on the state of the U.S. business, our assessment of our current product offering, what we've learned, has worked and what has not worked and the actions our teams are taking to reaccelerate growth in the U.S., my perspective on our strength globally and the opportunities this continues to create for our brand going forward and the impact of the new trade environment, implications of higher tariffs and the removal of the de minimis exemption on our revised guidance. Finally, we'll conclude by taking your questions. So let's begin.\nAs I speak to the U.S., I'd like to set some context for you. During the second half of last year, our teams were focused on bringing our newness penetration back to historical levels. We achieved this, as we shared last quarter through a combination of new styles and an increase in seasonal color within our core styles. While the guest is responding well to many of our new styles, they are not reacting as we had anticipated to the updated seasonal colors we brought into our core assortment.\nGiven this, we have recently conducted a deeper product diagnostic, the results of which I will share with you today. I now believe we have let our product life cycles run too long within many of our core categories, particularly in lounge and social. We have become too predictable within our casual offerings and missed opportunities to create new trends.\nAt the same time, we are seeing shifts within the industry. The overall market for premium athletic wear in the U.S. remains challenging with declines continuing in quarter 2. Consumers are spending less on apparel overall, spending less in performance activewear and are being more selective in their purchases, seeking out truly new styles. This makes it even more important that we meet and exceed the expectations of our guests.\nFor further context, let me provide some additional details on what we are seeing is working well and what is not working well within our product assortment. Our brand-building initiatives and several of our new product innovations are working. In addition, we continue to see growth in our performance apparel. Within our brand initiatives, our brand health continues to be strong, with growth in both total and retained guests and we continue to acquire new guests and retain existing guests across all age demographics.\nIn addition, our membership program continues to build and now has approximately 30 million members. Within product, our guests continue to respond well to many of the new styles and innovations we bring into the assortment, including Align No Line, Daydrift and BeCalm. By leveraging our science of field product development platform, our view is that these offerings demonstrate the impact of our approach to innovation and our ability to solve the unmet needs of our guests.\nWe also continue to differentiate lululemon from our competition with our performance apparel, and we're seeing continued growth overall across our key activities, yoga, run, train, golf and tennis. As you know, performance apparel is a key differentiator for us in the marketplace and an important launch pad for us to showcase innovation.\nAnd importantly, we have continued to gain market share within performance apparel even as the sector has declined according to the latest Circana market share data for the U.S. Activewear space. So we know that we have a very loyal guest who continues to trust and prioritize the brand for their high-performance apparel needs and when we deliver new innovation across the assortment, they respond and are ready to purchase.\nHowever, on the other side of the equation, let me now turn to what we believe has not been working well based upon our recent diagnostics. Our lounge and social product offerings have become stale and have not been resonating with guests. Specifically, we have seen a less enthusiastic response to some core franchises across lounge and social, such as Scuba, Softstream and Dance Studio. And we feel that our opportunity remains in frequency and conversion, which is impacting their total spend. The data related to engagement and loyalty of our guests remain strong.\nMy view now is that we have relied on the same product playbook across certain categories for too long. The competitive landscape is different today than it was even 2 or 3 years ago. And while no single competitor is having a meaningful impact on our business, there are now many players in the market. This makes it imperative that we are consistently better and stronger than ever and create the right balance of our core product in new styles across our merchandise mix.\nLet me zoom out and speak to what we now see as the root causes of our current product challenges in the U.S. The primary cause is that we relied too heavily on some of our core franchises across lounge and social for too long. We did not have the appropriate balance between existing and new styles across our casual offerings and the guests stop responding as they had in the past.\nI would also mention as a secondary cause that in the current environment, we have the opportunity to create more agility within our go-to-market process to allow us to go faster, to test new styles and to react to guest demand. We introduced several great new styles this spring, but couldn't chase into the demand quick enough and let some of our guests disappointed. Our teams are now focused on increasing the number and frequency of new styles we bring into the assortment and rebalancing our go-forward merchandise mix.\nI will now share details about the actions underway to elevate our product assortment and to improve how our teams continue to work to support our growing business. My view is that it's now time to reset many of our practices related to how we develop and create the range of products that will fuel the next phase of our growth. We have seen that when we get our product right, everything else can follow.\nlululemon is a beloved brand with deeply loyal guests who have come to expect unparalleled product from us in terms of design, fabrication, innovation and newness. And I'm excited by the work of our Global Creative Director, Jonathan Cheung, who joined us early last year. In this time, he has built a strong team of lead designers for men and women who are infusing new energy into the lululemon product playbook. This is an essential investment in our future, both in terms of time and talent.\nSome areas of focus for our new design team include maintaining our momentum in performance activities, designing into several new products across lounge and social and giving a fresh perspective to some of our most iconic items. As a result of their work, we intend to increase new styles as a percentage of our overall assortment from the current 23% and to approximately 35% next spring. We will continue to gauge guest behavior and adjust this penetration in future seasons based upon their response.\nWe are also enhancing our capabilities to go faster within our go-to-market process. By working with our vendors, we have and will continue to improve our ability to chase into strong-performing styles outside of our mainline product development process. We have also improved our fast track design capabilities, which reduces lead times by several months for select styles. These have been fully incorporated into the upcoming seasons to give us added flexibility to anticipate, meet and potentially exceed guest response and demand.\nAnd through these actions, we expect to create the anticipated improvement in our product portfolio and business performance with the most meaningful impact beginning in 2026.\nI would also like to speak to the recent announcement that Ranju Das has joined lululemon as our new Chief AI and Technology Officer. This is a new role at lululemon and represents an elevated mandate to enable AI and technology to help expedite our product innovation process, improve our agility and speed to market, and increased personalization across our guest experience. I'm excited Ranju has joined us, and I look forward to partnering with him as he and our technology teams implement and accelerate these strategies.\nThese plans create a clear path forward and are intended to create a better balance across our product assortment, reaccelerate our business in the United States, and we feel these will also benefit each market where we operate. Our teams have been working with the right sense of urgency and focus, and I'm excited about the enhancements we're making to some of our existing capabilities and the new ones we are developing to set up our next phase of growth.\nI want to also touch on our international business, where our momentum remains strong overall and where our market expansion efforts continue at a steady pace. In China, our second largest market, total revenue increased 25% and or 24% in constant currency. We opened 5 new stores in China Mainland this quarter, and we continue to drive brand awareness through a variety of activations and experiences, including our fifth annual highly visible Summer Swipe Games.\nIn our Rest of World segment, total revenue increased 19% and 15% on a constant currency basis. We continue to open new markets as part of our growth plans, including our new company-operated store in Italy, in Milan, as well as franchise locations in Turkey and Belgium. And looking ahead, we announced the selection of our franchise partner for India with the goal of opening our first lemon store in this market in the second half of 2026.\nWe remain in the early stages of international growth and are seeing success across all our markets. The opportunity to drive unaided awareness, gain market share and grow our guest base is significant. And while our growth rates remain strong, I expect the changes I just detailed for you in the U.S. will benefit our business across all these important markets as well.\nBefore I turn it over to Meghan, I'd like to speak more about the macro environment and specifically the reality of the new tariffs and the removal of the de minimis provision. Companies across our industry are looking at various levers to navigate this period, including opportunities across their supply chains, expense management and strategic pricing actions. We are doing the same, however, realizing additional benefits will take time. And given our financial strength and profitability, I am determined that we will not make any near-term decisions that could hurt or damage our brand positioning over the long term.\nFor the year, we now expect revenue growth of 4% to 6%, excluding the 53rd week in 2024 and EPS to be in the range of $12.77 to $12.97. These reductions relative to our prior expectations are being driven predominantly by North America. In the U.S., we now expect a 1% to 2% decline in revenue and in China, we anticipate growth in the 20% to 25% range. We continue to expect Rest of World will grow approximately 20%.\nWhen looking at China, quarter 2 revenue came in at the low end of our expectations. As we're beginning to see some signs of macro driven headwinds in Tier 1 cities. We have adjusted our guidance for the year to factor in this continued performance. Looking out to 2026, I believe the product plans discussed today will benefit our business in China as well, given the importance of lounge and social products in this market. Meghan will share more with you on our revised guidance in just a few minutes.\nIn summary, I see this period as an opportunity for lululemon. We have a brand people love with extremely loyal guests who respond well to our new styles and innovation. And we are clear on the path forward to meet and potentially exceed the expectations of our guests. I believe we will leverage our financial strength and once again demonstrate our agility to navigate this period while we steadily make progress on the product opportunities discussed today. We have learned a lot as a leadership team this year, and we are a stronger organization as a result. I expect to see the most impact of our learnings and insights into 2026 and beyond.\nWith that, I will now hand it over to Meghan.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Calvin. While Q2 earnings per share exceeded guidance, our top line results fell short of our expectations, driven predominantly by underperformance in North America. As you heard Calvin say, we have opportunity within our product assortment and the teams are in action on bringing in style newness, differentiation and increased agility, and you'll see the most meaningful impact of this work in 2026. In addition, we are navigating increased costs related to tariffs and the removal of the de minimis exemption.\nGiven these factors, we believe it's appropriate to be prudent in our planning and financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We are taking actions in both the near term and long term to mitigate the increased tariff costs, including strategic pricing actions, supply chain initiatives, including vendor negotiations and enterprise-wide expense savings initiatives.\nWhile implementing these cost-saving strategies, we do not plan to take our eye off the long-term growth potential for lululemon. Given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flow generation, we will continue to invest strategically in our growth initiatives to help ensure we realize the full potential of our brand while also navigating today's dynamic environment.\nI'll share our detailed guidance with you in a moment. But let's first take a look at our Q2 results in detail. For Q2, total net revenue rose 7% or 6% in constant currency to $2.5 billion. Comparable sales increased 1%. Within our region's results were as follows: Americas revenue increased 1% on both a reported and constant currency basis with comparable sales down 3%. By country, revenue increased 1% in Canada on both a reported and constant currency basis and was flat in the U.S. China Mainland revenue increased 25% or 24% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing 16%. And in the Rest of World, revenue grew by 19% or 15% in constant currency with comparable sales increasing by 9%.\nIn our store channel, total sales increased 3% and we ended the quarter with 784 stores globally. Square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 63 net new lululemon stores since Q2 2024. The which includes 18 locations in Mexico. During the quarter, we opened 14 net new stores and completed 6 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues increased 9% and contributed $1 billion of top line. 39% of total revenue. And by category, men's revenue increased 6% versus last year, women's increased 5% and accessories and other grew 15%.\nGross profit for the second quarter was $1.48 billion or 58.5% of net revenue compared to 59.6% in Q2 2024. The gross profit rate in Q2 decreased 110 basis points and was driven primarily by the following: an 80 basis point decrease in overall product margin driven by higher markdowns and tariff impact, markdowns increased 60 basis points versus our expectations of 20 to 40 basis points, 40 basis points of deleverage on fixed costs and 10 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange.\nRelative to our guidance for a decline in gross margin of 200 to 210 basis points, the upside was driven predominantly by favorable mix, lower ocean freight costs, print management and fixed expenses, lower-than-expected tariff impact related to timing and a stock-based compensation accrual reversal.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be granted in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $952 million or 37.7% of net revenue compared to 36.8% of net revenue for the same period last year. This was favorable to our guidance for deleverage of 170 to 190 basis points due predominantly to the stock-based compensation accrual reversal.\nOperating income for the quarter was approximately $524 million or 20.7% of net revenue compared to 22.8% of net revenue in Q2 2024. Tax expense for the quarter was $162.6 million or 30.5% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 29.6% a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $371 million or $3.10 per diluted share compared to $3.15 for the second quarter of 2024.\nThe stock-based compensation reversal added $0.15 to Q2. Excluding this reversal, EPS would have been above our guidance range $2.85 to $2.90. Capital expenditures were approximately $178 million for the quarter compared to approximately $145 million in the second quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to the timing of store openings.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.16 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory increased 21% and was $1.7 billion at the end of Q2. On a unit basis, inventory increased approximately 13% and was in line with our expectations. The difference between dollar inventory growth and unit inventory growth relates predominantly to higher tariff rates relative to last year as foreign exchange. We've repurchased approximately 1.13 million shares at an average price of $247 during the quarter. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $860 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase program.\nLet me now share our updated guidance outlook for the full year of 2025. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $10.85 billion to $11 billion. This range represents growth of 2% to 4% relative to 2024. Excluding the 53rd week that we had in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to grow 4% to 6%. By region, we now expect revenue in the Americas to be flat to down 1%, with the U.S. down 1% to 2% and Canada approximately flat, China Mainland to be 20% to 25% and we continue to expect rest of world to be approximately 20%.\nOur updated expectations for the Americas and China Mainland take into account the most recent trends we're seeing in those regions. Looking out to 2026, we would expect all markets to benefit from the product-driven strategies we are currently implementing. We now expect to be at the high end of our 40 to 45 range for net new company-operated stores in 2025 and complete approximately 35 optimizations versus our prior guidance of 40. We expect overall square footage growth in the low double digits.\nOur new store openings in 2025 will include approximately 15 stores in the Americas, with nearly half of those openings planned in Mexico. The remainder of our new stores are planned for our international markets, the majority of which will be in China. We remain pleased with our new store productivity and the results we are seeing from our optimization strategy. While we are taking a disciplined approach to capital spending, we continue to see positive returns from new store openings and store expansions as these strategies contribute to an improved shopping experience for our existing guests and new guest acquisition, along with building brand awareness and community engagement.\nFor the full year, we now expect gross margin to decrease approximately 300 basis points versus 2024. Relative to our prior guidance for a 110 basis point decrease, we expect the additional 190 basis points decrease to be driven predominantly by increased tariffs, including the removal of the de minimis exemption offset somewhat by several of our enterprise-wide efforts to mitigate these costs.\nWe now expect markdowns to be approximately 50 basis points higher than last year versus our prior expectation of 10 to 20 basis points. This change reflects higher levels of seasonal clearance but does not contemplate a change to our markdown and promotional strategy. We will continue to clear end of season and end-of-life products through our normal channels, including in-store, online or outlets and from time to time in the past, we've utilized warehouse sales.\nLet me provide some additional details on the increased tariff expense, which now includes 2 components: higher reciprocal rates and the removal of the de minimis exemption. Our prior guidance assumed a mitigated impact of 40 basis points for the year based on 10% incremental tariffs on most countries where we source and 30% on China. As rates in total have actualized higher, and the de minimis exemption has been removed. We now expect a 220 basis points or approximately $240 million mitigated impact on gross margin for the year. This impact reflects our best estimate, recognizing the actual effect could vary, depending on how conditions evolve and our mitigation efforts perform.\nIn terms of de minimis, given that we have DC infrastructure in Canada, we have been well positioned to shift some of our e-commerce orders to our U.S. guests. As most of these shipments were under $800, they qualify for the de minimis exemption and we realized meaningful duty savings. This removal will have a significant impact on our gross margin and represents approximately 170 basis points of the 220 basis point tariff-related decline we now expect for the year.\nKeep in mind that in 2025, based on timing, we are only benefiting from half a year of mitigation strategies. As we look out to 2026, while offsetting all the incremental de minimis expense will not be possible we will benefit from a full year of mitigation and expect an approximate $320 million net impact on operating margins related to both higher tariffs and the removal of the minimums.\nTurning to SG&A for the full year. We now expect deleverage of approximately 80 to 90 basis points versus 2024, modestly above our prior guidance of 50 basis points. While we have implemented several enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, the modest increase in deleverage is driven by the impact of lower top line, FX headwinds and ongoing investments into our Power of Three x2 road map, including investments to support market growth and international expansion, and continued investment in technology.\nWhen looking at operating margin for the full year of 2025, we now expect a decrease of approximately 390 basis points versus 2024. As I mentioned, 220 basis points of the decrease is driven by increased tariffs and the removal of de minimis. For the full year 2025, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For the fiscal year 2025, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $12.77 to $12.97, which is EPS of $14.64 in 2024. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases but does include the impact of our repurchases year-to-date.\nWe now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million to $720 million in 2025 versus our prior estimate of $740 million to $760 million. This reduction reflects our discipline with regard to capital spend that relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nShifting now to Q3. Looking at Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $2.47 billion to $2.5 billion, representing growth of 3% to 4%. We expect to open approximately 14 net new company-operated stores and complete 18 optimizations in Q3. We expect gross margin in Q3 to decrease approximately 410 basis points relative to Q3 2024. The decrease will be driven predominantly by the impact of increased tariffs and removal of de minimis, deleverage on fixed costs and our ongoing investment in our multiyear distribution center project.\nThe impact from tariffs and de minimis combined will be approximately 230 basis points. We expect markdowns to be 80 basis points higher than 2024, driven by increased seasonal clearance. In Q3, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by approximately 150 basis points relative to Q3 2024. This will be driven predominantly by increased foundational investments and related depreciation and strategic investments, including those to build brand awareness.\nWhen looking at operating margins in Q3, we expect deleverage of approximately 560 basis points with 230 basis points related to tariffs and minimums.\nTurning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.23 versus EPS of $2.87 a year ago. We expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to grow approximately 30.5%. And looking at inventory, we expect units to increase in the low double digits in Q3 and with dollar inventories up in the low 20s, due in large part to the impact of higher tariff rates and foreign exchange. We expect a similar dynamic in inventory growth for the remainder of the year.\nAs we look out to next year, we aim to manage our inventory in line with sales trends, and we would expect our inventory growth on a unit basis to moderate beginning in Q1 2026.\nBefore turning it back over to Calvin, I would emphasize that while there are external factors we are navigating, we know we can perform better, and we have several initiatives in place to reaccelerate our business, particularly in the U.S. Looking out to 2026, I believe we will see improvements in our product assortment when we have the full impact of our new creative team. In addition, we'll continue to work on and pull to navigate the new realities of higher tariffs.\nI'll reiterate that while we're managing the near-term dynamics, we have the flexibility to keep our eyes on the future and continue to prudently and strategically invest in our growth potential. However, we are planning for multiple scenarios, and we continue to look across the enterprise for ways to operate more efficiently, including expense management, capital spend on, square footage growth and inventory management.\nAnd with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Meghan. We look forward to taking your questions in just a moment. As you heard me say, we are not satisfied with the results for the quarter, and we know our brand can and will perform better than these results. We are clear on our assessment of the situation, which takes into account the current dynamics within the consumer environment and competitive landscape. We are learning and adapting and are focused on the path forward to create and deliver product that lives into our high-performance and high style philosophy.\nI feel confident in our leadership team and the plans we have in place. The guest is responding well to many of our new styles, our future pipeline is strong and the positive impact of our new design vision remains in front of us. We will navigate this period successfully given the passion, commitment and agility of our leaders and teams. We will now take your questions."

McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. It's good to be here with you today to discuss our first quarter results. As you've seen from our press release, our revenue growth for the quarter came in at the high end of our guidance range. I'm pleased with this performance, which was relatively consistent with quarter 4. I'd also note that our revenue in the United States grew 2%, which is an improvement in the trend we've seen over the last several quarters. Based on our quarter 1 revenue performance and what we're seeing thus far in quarter 2, we are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year.\nAs we look ahead, we will continue to leverage our financial strength and our position in the marketplace to play offense, remain agile and successfully manage the environment around us. I'll begin by sharing the details of our quarter 1 performance, including high-level financial metrics and key highlights regarding our regional performance, product innovation and our brand campaigns and activations.\nNext I'll provide insights into the planning and strategies we're deploying related to the increase in tariffs Meghan will speak to the specific financial implications, and I'll share some insights into the opportunities we have across the business. I'll then share my thoughts on quarter 2 and the remainder of the year, Meghan will review our financials and our updated guidance and we will conclude by taking your questions. So let's get started.\nIn quarter 1, total revenue increased 7% or 8% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 58.3% and and earnings per share were $2.60, ahead of our expectations. In addition, in quarter 1, we continued repurchasing shares and bought back another $430 million of stock. Our ongoing repurchases demonstrate the strength of our balance sheet and our continued confidence in the long-term prospects for Lululemon.\nLooking at our regional performance, we continue to see strength across markets driven by our high-performance, high-style merchandise and the compelling ways we engage with our guests through brand activations and community events. In North America, momentum continued in Canada where sales grew 9% in constant currency, and in the United States, revenue growth improved to 2%. We are making progress on our assortment, and we've seen good response to many of our new innovations. But my sense is that in the U.S., consumers remain cautious right now, and they are being very intentional about their buying decisions. Even with this, we gained market share across both men's and women's in the premium methodic were markets in the United States.\nIn China Mainland, revenue increased 22% in constant currency. As you are aware, Chinese New Year shifted from quarter 1 of this year to Q4 of last year. While we estimate that this calendar shift had a negative impact of about 4 percentage points on Q1 revenue growth, we remain pleased with the underlying momentum in this very important growth market.\nAnd in the Rest of World, revenue increased 17% in constant currency as we continue to see a strong acceptance of our brand by guests across the APAC and EMEA regions. We are executing against our strategy to maximize our existing markets, expand in newer markets while also seeding others for future growth. I'm excited by the recent store openings in 2 of our franchise markets, Denmark and Turkey, which are off to a strong start, and we remain on track to enter Italy as a new company-operated market in Belgium and the Czech Republic under a franchise model later this year.\nWhen looking at the full year, our view on revenue is unchanged, and we continue to expect 7% to 8% growth. By region, we continue to anticipate revenue in North America to increase in the low to mid-single-digit range, China Mainland to grow in the 25% to 30% range and revenue in the Rest of World segment to increase about 20%. Key to our success within all our markets is our product, which offers unique and innovative solves for guests across both athletic and lifestyle product categories.\nThroughout quarter 1, guests responded well to the newness we introduced into our assortment. For women, our defined franchise continues to perform well across our markets globally, and we are pleased with the response to our recent launches, including Day drift, Shake it out and Be Calm. For men, we're seeing strength in several of our key franchises, including Zeroed In, Smooth Spacer and show 0. In May to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of our aligned franchise, we launched the line no line. which offers the same fit and feel as the iconic legging but without a front team.\nWe're pleased with the guest response both online and in the 80 doors where it was offered. We plan to build on this momentum for the fall when we roll it to all stores. I'm excited with the innovations we've rolled out this year and will continue to bring to market going forward. We have significant opportunity to expand all 5 of our key activities, yoga, run, train, golf and tennis and become the top-of-mind destination for guests who enjoy these activities. Recent examples include our new fasten free running short for men.\nAnd for women, we launched additional styles, which leverage the research and development our teams conducted last year for our further ultramarathon event. Switching now to our brand activations. Our teams continue to develop unique and compelling brand campaigns and community events that engage our guests, increase brand awareness and support our product launches. Let me highlight a recent example.\nTo support the launch and to celebrate Align's anniversary, we created our Summer of Align campaign. This fully integrated campaign included traditional and social media, exclusive experiences and events and featured several influencers and ambassadors. We hosted events around the world, including our Lululemon Roller rink activation at the Bottle Rock Festival in Napa Valley and our largest ever yoga experience in China, attended by 5,000 people in Beijing. This campaign and the other events we activated in quarter 1 is a great example of how we remain focused on our grassroots approach to guest engagement while at the same time, leveraging traditional media assets and our roster of ambassadors to support product launches and build our brand.\nIn fact, our unaided brand awareness in the United States grew from the mid-30s in quarter 4 to 40% in quarter 1. I would now like to talk for a moment about the current environment related to tariffs. Meghan will speak to our assumptions and the implications of potentially higher rates during her guidance discussion, but I first want to spend a few minutes sharing our approach. The current tariff paradigm has brought uncertainty into the retail environment as consumers try to assess the impact they will have on daily life.\nAs businesses evaluate these impacts as well, I believe we are better positioned than most to navigate the near term while also maintaining our focus on investing in our growth potential over the long term. We are operating from a position of strength. Our brand remains strong, our guest engagement is high, and we offer a compelling value proposition, and we are a highly profitable business. Let me share a few details.\nWe have an industry-leading operating margin. This allows us to continue investing across our strategic road map to enable long-term growth while managing any increased costs associated with tariffs. Our balance sheet is strong with $1.3 billion in cash and no debt, which provides us significant financial flexibility. We are making progress with our newness, have a robust pipeline of innovation and our guests are responding well to many of the new solutions we are bringing into our assortment and our premium positioning in the performance athletic apparel category yields different elasticity for our products relative to fashion-oriented brands.\nWe believe our guests will continue to live an active and healthy lifestyle and turn to us for the technical apparel we are known for.\nShifting now to how we have been navigating this situation. Over the past few months, our teams have been looking across the enterprise for how we can offset increased tariff rates. Our work streams include prudently managing expenses, identifying efficiencies within our supply chain and evaluating our position in the marketplace related to pricing. During COVID, we developed a strong muscle across our teams to be agile, pull levers across the business within a rapidly changing external environment and simultaneously planned for multiple scenarios.\nWe are applying the same approach now as we maintain a disciplined focus on expenses look across our supply chain, leverage our dual sourcing capabilities and engage in costing discussions with our vendors and reviewing pricing scenarios to ensure we sit where we want in the market. Our pricing appropriately for the innovation in our assortment and maximize any opportunity to gain market share. We have always been and will continue to be very intentional with our pricing decisions. These actions will be targeted and will reflect the work we've done on style elasticity. We remain nimble in our approach and feel we are well positioned during this period with many levers to pull.\nBefore handing it over to Meghan to discuss our financials, I wanted to share my perspective on quarter 2 and the remainder of the year. It's been approximately a year since we've made the changes in our product organization, and I'm pleased with our evolved structure, the way the teams are working together and the efficiencies we're seeing across our processes. We still have work to do to create new products that have the potential to grow into core franchises and further optimize our merchandise mix.\nHowever, we are moving in the right direction and looking at the remainder of 2025, our teams are focused on strengthening our product pipeline and bringing more innovation into our core assortment while also introducing new styles with the potential to become key franchises and core items in the future, expanding deeper and bringing new technical solves into our 5 key activities while further developing our lifestyle assortment, engaging more deeply with our guests through community activations, brand campaigns and leveraging our membership program and expanding our highly productive square footage profile through new store openings and optimizations.\nAs I hand it over to Meghan, I want to also say that while we recognize that quarter 2 has some pressures related to our planned business investments and additional expenses related to tariffs, we feel good about the full year and our ability to maintain our revenue guidance for 2025. There is considerable opportunity ahead for Lululemon and we're intent on successfully navigating the near term while we plan for and invest in the long term.\nWith that, I'll now hand it over to Meghan.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Calvin. I'm happy we delivered Q1 results that exceeded our expectations. Guests are responding well to our product newness and innovations. And as a result, we are maintaining our revenue guidance for the full year.\nGiven the uncertainties in the macro environment, our approach to planning remains balanced by managing the dynamics of the current year while also maintaining our focus on the long term. We are managing expenses prudently while also continuing to invest to drive long-term growth and set ourselves up for future success. This includes new store openings and optimizations, new market entries, growing brand awareness and ensuring we have adequate capacity across our supply chain. I'll share a detailed guidance with you in a moment, but let's first take a look at our Q1 results in detail.\nFor Q1, total net revenue rose 7% or 8% in constant currency to $2.4 billion. Comparable sales increased 1%. Within our regions results were as follows: Americas revenue increased 3% or 4% in constant currency with comparable sales down 1%. By country, revenue increased 4% or 9% in constant currency in Canada and increased 2% in the U.S. China Mainland revenue increased 21% or 22% in constant currency with comparable sales increasing 8% and in the Rest of World, revenue grew by 16% or 17% in constant currency with comparable sales increasing by 7%.\nIn our store channel, total sales increased 8% and we ended the quarter with 770 stores globally. Square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 59 net new Lululemon stores since Q1 2024. We -- during the quarter, we opened 3 net new stores and completed 4 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenue increased 6% and contributed $961 million of top line or 41% of total revenue. And by category, men's revenue increased 8% versus last year, while women's increased 7% and accessories and other grew 8%.\nGross profit for the first quarter was $1.4 billion, or 58.3% of net revenue compared to gross margin of 57.7% in Q1 2024. The gross profit rate in Q1 was ahead of our guidance and increased 60 basis points, driven primarily by the following: A 130 basis point increase in product margin, driven predominantly by lower product costs, improved damages and improved markdowns, offset somewhat by higher airfreight, 20 basis points negative impact from foreign exchange and 50 basis points of net deleverage on fixed costs.\nRelative to our guidance, which was for gross margin approximately flat with last year, the upside was driven predominantly by lower product costs leverage on fixed costs and slightly better markdowns.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be granted in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $943 million or 39.8% of net revenue compared to 38.1% of net revenue for the same period last year. SG&A was above our guidance of 120 basis points of deleverage due predominantly to the negative impact from an FX revaluation loss.\nOperating income for the quarter was $439 million or 18.5% of net revenue compared to operating margin of 19.6% in Q1 2024. Tax expense for the quarter was $136 million or 30.2% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 29.5% a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $315 million, or $2.60 per diluted share compared to EPS of $2.54 for the first quarter of 2024.\nCapital expenditures were $152 million for the quarter compared to $131 million for the first quarter last year. Q1 spend relates primarily to investments to support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Dollar inventory, which was impacted by higher AUC related to tariffs and foreign exchange increased 23%. When looking at units inventory increased 16%. We repurchased 1.36 million shares in Q1 at an average price of $36. Share repurchases remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders and we currently have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our repurchase program.\nLet me now share our updated guidance outlook for the full year 2025. We continue to expect revenue in the range of $11.15 billion to $11.3 billion. This range represents growth of 5% to 7% relative to 2024. Excluding the 53rd week that we had in the fourth quarter of last year, we expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. We continue to expect 40 to 45 net new company-operated stores in 2025 and to complete approximately 40 optimizations. We expect overall square footage growth in the low double digits. Our new store openings in 2025 will include approximately 10 to 15 stores in the Americas for the rest of our openings planned in our international markets, the majority of which will be in China.\nFor the full year, we now expect gross margin to decrease approximately 110 basis points versus 2024. Relative to our prior guidance for a 60 basis point decrease, we expect the additional 50 basis points of deleverage to be driven predominantly by increased tariffs, offset somewhat by our enterprise-wide efforts to mitigate these costs and slightly higher markdowns. When looking specifically at tariffs, the assumptions we've made regarding rates include 30% incremental tariffs on China and an incremental 10% on the remaining countries where we source.\nFrom a mitigation standpoint, as Calvin said, we've looked across the enterprise and have identified several levers which will help offset much of the impact of these higher rates. Based on our implementation strategies, we expect our mitigation efforts to be most impactful in the second half of the year.\nTurning to SG&A for the full year. We expect deleverage of approximately 50 basis points versus 2024, relatively in line with our prior guidance, driven by FX headwinds and ongoing investments into our Power 3x 2 road map, including investments in marketing and brand building aimed at increasing our awareness and acquiring new guests, investments to support our international growth and market expansion and continued investment in technology.\nLooking at operating margin for the full year 2025, we now expect a decrease of approximately 160 basis points versus 2024. For the full year 2025, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For the fiscal year 2025, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.58 to $14.78 versus EPS of $14.64 in 2024. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases, but does include the impact of our repurchases year-to-date.\nWe expect capital expenditures to be approximately $740 million to $760 million in 2025. The spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nShifting now to Q2. We expect revenue in the range of $2.535 billion to $2.56 billion, representing growth of 7% to 8%. We expect to open 14 net new company-operated stores in Q2 and complete 9 optimizations. We expect gross margin in Q2 to decline approximately 200 basis points relative to Q2 2024, driven predominantly by increased occupancy and depreciation, higher tariff rates, modestly higher markdowns and foreign exchange.\nIn Q2, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 170 to 190 basis points relative to Q2 2024. This will be driven predominantly by increased foundational investments and related depreciation and strategic investments, including those to build brand awareness. In addition, as I mentioned last quarter, we were layering back in certain expenses, including store labor hours, which are having a more pronounced impact on Q2 relative to the remainder of the year.\nWhen looking at operating margin for Q2, we expect a year-over-year decrease of approximately 380 basis points. I wanted to add some additional context on our operating margin guidance. In Q2 last year, margin improved by 110 basis points, which was our strongest performance of the year. This year, as I mentioned, we are also being impacted by external factors, namely tariffs, where our mitigation efforts are more pronounced in the back half and foreign exchange.\nIn addition, we are continuing to invest in our strategic road map to set ourselves up for ongoing success. While these items are having an outsized impact on Q2, when looking at the full year, the decrease in operating margin is significantly less.\nTurning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.90 versus EPS of $3.15 a year ago. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be approximately 30%. When looking at inventory, we expect units to increase in the low double digits in Q2, with dollar inventories up in the low 20s and due in large part to the impact of higher tariff rates and foreign exchange. We expect a similar dynamic in inventory growth for the remainder of the year.\nIn Q2, the low double-digit unit growth reflects our investments in newness and innovation, in addition, we are comping a 6% decline in units in the prior year. We are pleased with both the level and composition of our inventory, which positions us well.\nAnd with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan. I feel we are well positioned to navigate the current period. We intend to leverage our strong financial position and competitive advantages to play offense while making deliberate decisions and continuing to invest in our growth opportunities. In closing, I want to thank our talented leaders and teams who make these results possible and demonstrate their agility and passion each day. We'll now take your questions. Operator?"

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Lululemon Athletica Inc Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for Lululemon. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Brett Tubin\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Lululemon's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. .\nBefore we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of Lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.\nActual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nAny forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.\nBefore we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site, where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the third quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour, so please limit yourself to 1 question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Howard. I'm happy to be here today to discuss our quarter 3 results, which exceeded our expectations as well as our outlook for the holiday season and the fourth quarter overall. On today's call, I'll start with some highlights from Thanksgiving and Black Friday weekend. I'll then discuss our quarter 3 performance, beginning with North America and the progress we are making in our U.S. business, Next, I'll share insights on our international business, where momentum remains very strong. Then I'll speak to product, Megan will review our financials and guidance outlook, and we will close by taking your questions.\nSo let's get started. We are pleased with our business over the extended Thanksgiving weekend and the traffic trends we saw across both our store and e-commerce channels. In fact, on Black Friday, we had the most visits ever to our Shop app and e-commerce site. Unlike others in this space, we do not run sale events across our entire store. We leveraged the increased traffic over this period to clear through product we are not taking forward and to feature full-price style.\nWe are happy with how the guests responded to both with full price sales driven by some of our key franchises, including Define. While we feel good about the start of the holiday season, we still have large volume weeks in front of us and given the shorter holiday shopping season, we continue to be thoughtful in our planning for quarter 4 overall.\nNow looking at quarter 3. Total revenue increased 9% or 8% in constant currency. By region, China Mainland increased 39% or 36% in constant currency. The rest of world grew 27% or 23% in constant currency, and the Americas increased 2%. The -- by merchandise category, mens increased 9% and women's and accessories both increased 8%. Adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 20.5% and adjusted earnings per share increased 13%.\nIn addition, demonstrating our continued confidence in the business, our Board recently authorized a $1 billion increase in our share repurchase program. In quarter 3, we repurchased $409 million of stock, which brings us to $1.4 billion year-to-date. Including the additional authorization, we have $1.8 billion available to repurchase our shares.\nI'll now turn to the details about our quarter 3, beginning with our performance by region. In the Americas, revenue increased 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Positive momentum continued in Canada, where revenue increased 9%. In the U.S., revenue was flat, which was consistent with our performance in quarter 2 and in line with our expectations.\nLast quarter, I laid out our plans to drive improvement in our U.S. business. These plans include implementing a new reporting structure within our product team, increasing the penetration of seasonal newness within our assortments by quarter 1 2025 and chasing into updated colors, prints and patterns to provide guests with more options in the second half of this year.\nSo let me share the progress we are seeing. When looking at our product team, we are beginning to see the efficiencies and anticipated benefits of our new reporting structure with our Global Creative Director reporting to me and our Chief Merchandising Officer reporting to Nikki Neuberger in her expanded role as Chief Brand and Product Activation Officer. Our merchandising and brand teams are now more fully integrated, which leads to better coordination and faster decision-making regarding how we bring our innovation to life. I'm proud of how our leaders and teams push forward this quarter and how we have made meaningful progress in creating the product organization to drive our future success.\nWhen looking at the composition of our assortment, we are on track with our efforts to increase the penetration of seasonal newness and expect to be in line with historical levels in quarter 1 2025. I feel good about the quality and quantity of newness the teams have planned, and I believe we are well positioned for spring.\nFinally, our teams have been agile and have been chasing into seasonal colors, prints and patterns. I'm sure you've seen several examples across our key franchises. These efforts have contributed to the sequential improvement in newness within our assortment in the back half of the year.\nWe continue to see significant potential for growth in the U.S. Our guest retention remains high, and we see an opportunity to drive higher revenue per guest with more newness in the assortment. We continue to grow our membership program, and we are now 24 million members strong. Our variety of benefits, including early access, partner perks and members-only events are resonating well. And our unaided brand awareness remains low in the U.S. at 36%, which provides a significant opportunity for growth as we continue to open and optimize stores and launch new brand campaigns and activations.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with our progress so far as our teams are in action to return our level of newness back to historical levels in quarter 1 2025. The -- in addition, we are benefiting from and seeing the efficiencies from the new leadership structure within our product team with the rest of our regions performing well, I feel confident in our growth plans and strategies for 2025.\nI -- turning to our international business. Momentum remains strong in all of our markets as we continue to see great acceptance of the Lululemon brand across the globe. Overall, we saw international revenue increased 33% and -- or 30% on a constant currency basis. Here are some highlights.\nIn China Mainland, our brand positioning of made to feel allows us to authentically connect with gas by offering technical product that helps enable them to live an active and healthy lifestyle and bring to life compelling activations focused on movement and well-being. This aligns well with the government's Healthy China 2030 initiative. In quarter 3, our local team executed our largest activation yet centered around World Mental Health Day, and the release of our fourth annual global well-being report.\nWe hosted events in 9 cities anchored by our activation in Shanghai. For 1 week in early October, we hosted a variety of sessions for guests, including sweat sessions and experiences along the West Bund. In total, we had 15,000 guests participate in our activations across the Mainland, and we generated $3.8 billion impressions. I'm excited with the success and scale of this activation, 1 example of many from our team in China Mainland, which are intended to increase brand awareness, which remains low but is growing, bring new guests into the brand and increase engagement and loyalty with existing guests.\nNow let's focus on the Rest of the World segment, which is comprised of APAC and EMEA regions. We remain in the early stages of growth in these markets and have significant opportunity to expand our footprint through new store openings and expansion of key locations. In our more established international markets, we are leveraging the success of our North America optimization program.\nFor example, in Australia, we are seeing meaningful benefits from the strategy, including an enhanced and more premium shopping experience for our guests, an increase in our men's business through additional square footage and improved visual merchandising and an increase in online sales as these stores help attract both local guests and tourists into the brand.\nOur new store in the Emporium Mall in Melbourne is a terrific illustration of the effectiveness of this strategy. At 11,000 square feet, it is our largest store in APAC and is on track to be our #1 store in the region in terms of revenue. We opened our first store in Australia more than 20 years ago, and this shows the growth that is possible even within our more established markets.\nIn EMEA, we are also executing against our store optimization strategy as we recently increased the size of our stores in Berlin and Oslo and we're happy with the performance of both. I'm thrilled with the response we are seeing from guests as we improved the shopping experience in markets where we currently operate. This is a key strategy for us across all regions, including North America, as it allows us to better position our store portfolio to support our product plans, continue to drive success in key growth categories, including men's, accessories, outerwear and footwear and -- and drive overall sales while continuing to deliver best-in-class store productivity.\nIn addition to maximizing existing markets, we have significant opportunity to bring Lululemon to new countries across the globe. Our plans for 2025 include opening in Italy as a new company-operated market and in Denmark, Belgium, Turkey and the Czech Republic under a franchise model.\nLet me shift now and spend a few minutes on product. In quarter 3, in women's, we saw strength in short skirts and leggings and seasonal colors, while in men's, guests continue to respond well to our pace breaker and Zeroed In franchises and performance and key lounge franchises. In accessories, bags continued to perform well, driven by backpacks in the cross-body styles. We built upon our success this past spring in Gulf by focusing on another play category, tennis, when we dropped our Lululemon tennis club collection during the U.S. opened in New York this quarter.\nBased on the strong guest response we continue to see an opportunity to grow our play activities and intend to evolve our strategy from a seasonal approach to one where we introduced newness into these collections consistently throughout the year. And we have been pleased with the performance of 2 strategic partnerships we launched recently, Fanatics in the National Hockey League and Disney.\nAs you are aware, we have a targeted strategic sales business where we sell product to select partners, including fitness studios and university bookstores. Our Fanatics and NHL partnership builds upon the success of our campus strategy. We know there is an opportunity to bring a premium option to sports fans, which allows them to celebrate their favorite teams through our most iconic styles.\nOur limited edition product collaboration with Disney combines iconic Disney imagery with our best-in-class technical apparel and taps into the appreciation guests have for both brands. As I step back and look at our entire product assortment, I'm excited with the newness we have planned. Our technical product is a key competitive advantage for us and our positioning as a premium athletic brand offering high-style, high-performance product truly differentiates us from others.\nBefore I turn it over to Megan to discuss our financials, let me say that we remain committed to delivering on our Power of Three x2 revenue target of $12.5 billion in 2026, and we remain ahead of schedule. Using our revenue guidance for 2024, which we updated today, our 3-year revenue growth CAGR from 2021 through 2024 is 19%, ahead of the 15% CAGR target in our plan. The solid results this quarter show the inherent strength of our brand and highlights the continued opportunity for Lululemon around the world with existing and new guests.\nMegan, now over to you.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Calvin. In Q3, both revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations. Top line strength was driven by continued momentum in our international regions in Canada, while EPS also benefited from stronger-than-expected gross margin. .\nLooking at Q4, as Calvin mentioned, we're pleased with the results over Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the holiday season. I would also keep in mind that nearly 2/3 of the quarter remains in front of us and the macro environment remains dynamic. As such, we continue to plan the business prudently, and I'll share our detailed Q4 guidance shortly.\nLet me also mention that we closed on the purchase of our Mexico franchise. The transaction closed on September 10 and -- and had an immaterial impact on our Q3 financials. However, you will see an increase of 15 stores in our company-operated store count related to Mexico. These stores were not included in our new store opening plans or square footage growth guidance for the year, hence they're additive.\nLet me now share the details of our Q3 performance. For Q3, total net revenue rose 9% or 8% in constant currency to $2.4 billion and constant dollar comparable sales increased 3%. Within our regions, the results were as follows: Americas revenue increased 2% with a comparable sales decline of 2%. China Mainland revenue increased 39% or 36% in constant currency with comparable sales increasing 24% and -- and in our Rest of World segment, revenue grew by 27% or 23% in constant currency with comparable sales increasing by 20%.\nIn our store channel, total sales increased 13% and -- and we ended the quarter with 749 stores globally. Square footage increased 16% versus last year, driven by the addition of 63 net new Lululemon stores since Q3 of 2023. We -- during the quarter, we opened 13 net new stores and completed 14 optimizations.\nIn addition, as I mentioned, we added 15 stores in Mexico, which are included in the 63 net new stores and $0.16 square footage growth metrics. In our digital channel, revenue increased 4% and contributed $945 million of top line or 39% of total revenue. And by category, men's revenue increased 9% versus last year, while women's and accessories both increased 8%.\nGross profit for the third quarter was $1.4 billion or 58.5% of net revenue compared to adjusted gross margin of 58.1% in Q3 2023. The adjusted gross profit rate in Q3 increased 40 basis points, ahead of our guidance and was driven primarily by the following: A 50 basis point increase in product margin, driven by lower inventory provision expense versus last year and favorable IMU offset by higher freight costs. Markdowns were flat year-over-year. 20 basis points of net deleverage on fixed costs and 10 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange.\nRelative to our guidance, which was for a decline in gross margin of 50 to 60 basis points, the upside was driven predominantly by prudent management of fixed expenses within gross margin, better IMU, lower DC operating costs and the timing of expenses related to certain store real estate projects.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be granted and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $910 million or 38% of net revenue compared to 38.2% of net revenue for the same period last year. SG&A was slightly worse than our guidance of 40 to 50 basis points of leverage due to approximately 20 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange.\nOperating income for the quarter was approximately $491 million or 20.5% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 19.8% in Q3 2023. Tax expense for the quarter was $153 million or 30.2% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.1% a year ago.\nNet income for the quarter was $352 million or $2.87 per diluted share compared to adjusted EPS of $2.53 for the third quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures were approximately $178 million for the quarter compared to approximately $163 million in the third quarter last year.\nQ3 spend relates primarily to investments in support business growth including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Inventory increased 8%, lower than our guidance for an increase in the mid-teens. We repurchased 1.58 million shares in Q3 at an average price of $259. Year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of stock.\nShare repurchases remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, and we currently have approximately $1.8 billion remaining on our repurchase program, including the recent $1 billion increase in authorization.\nLet me now share our detailed guidance outlook for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned, we are pleased with our performance at the start of the holiday season, but given fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and an uncertain macro environment, we continue to plan the business prudently. Starting with full year 2024, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $10.452 billion to $10.487 million. This range represents growth of 9% relative to 2023.\nExcluding the 53rd week that we have in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow 7%. We -- I'd also note that our revenue range now includes an incremental $20 million of negative impact related to recent fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nWe expect to open approximately 40 net new company-operated stores in 2024, excluding Mexico, and complete approximately 40 colocated optimizations. Excluding Mexico, we expect square footage to grow in the low double digits and including Mexico, we expect overall square footage growth in the low teens.\nOur new store openings in 2024 will include approximately 10 stores in the Americas, inclusive of 2 company-operated stores in Mexico in Q4 with the rest of our openings planned in our international markets, primarily in China Mainland.\nFor the full year, we now expect gross margin to increase approximately 10 to 20 basis points versus our adjusted gross margin in 2023. We continue to expect markdowns to be relatively flat with last year.\nTurning to SG&A for the full year. We expect it to be 20 to 30 basis points higher versus 2023. We are prudently managing our expenses while continuing to invest strategically into our Power of Three x2 road map including investments in marketing and brand building aims at increasing our awareness and acquiring new guests, investments to support our international growth and market expansion and continued investment in technology infrastructure and data analytics capabilities.\nWhen looking at operating margin for the full year 2024, we continue to expect a decrease of 10 to 20 basis points versus adjusted operating margin in 2023, which expanded 110 basis points versus 2022.\nFor the full year 2024, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For the fiscal year 2024, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.08 and to $14.16 versus adjusted EPS of $12.77 in 2023. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases but does include the impact of our repurchases year-to-date.\nWhen looking at inventory, we continue to expect dollar inventory to increase in the mid-teens in Q4. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2024. We -- the spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation for a multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nShifting now to Q4. We expect revenue in the range of $3.475 billion to $3.51 billion, representing growth of 8% to 10% or 3% to 4%, excluding the 53rd week. This range includes the incremental negative $20 million impact from foreign exchange I've previously mentioned. We expect to open 18 net new company-operated stores in Q4, including 2 in Mexico.\nWe expect gross margin in Q4 to decrease 20 to 30 basis points relative to Q4 2023. We -- the decrease will be driven predominantly by deleverage on fixed costs and our ongoing investment in store growth and our multiyear distribution center project. We expect product margin to increase 60 to 70 basis points, inclusive of approximately 40 basis points of higher freight costs. We continue to expect markdowns to be slightly improved versus Q4 2023.\nWe -- in Q4, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 90 to 100 basis points relative to Q4 2023. We -- this will be driven predominantly by increased foundational investments and related depreciation and also strategic investments, including those to build brand awareness to support future growth. When looking at operating margin for Q4, we expect deleverage of approximately 110 to 130 basis points.\nTurning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.64 versus adjusted EPS of $5.29 a year ago. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be approximately 29.5%.\nAnd with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Megan. As you can see from our results, our business continues to deliver across our international markets, and we are pleased with the start to the holiday season in North America.\nLooking ahead, we are excited about the work underway across our product organization to create the pipeline of newness that guests expect from us, both in the near and long term, and as we build our brand awareness and continue to strategically expand globally, the opportunities in front of us are significant.\nAs we head into the final weeks of the year, I want to thank our teams around the world who made these results possible. I continue to be impressed by the agility and resilience of our teams who demonstrate why Lululemon is one of the enduring growth stories within retail. Thank you all for joining us. Megan and I look forward to taking your questions now. Operator?"

Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of Lululemon's future.\nThese statements are based on current information which we have assessed, but by which it's nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.

Today's call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time, to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin McDonald\n\nChief Executive Officer, lululemon athletica, Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I'm glad you could all join us on the call today to discuss our business in quarter two, and our revised outlook for the second half of the year. On today's call, I will speak to the strength in our international business, I also will spend time discussing our business in the US. Including some missed opportunities in women's, our assessment of the root causes, the plans underway to address these in the near term, and the many reasons for our continued optimism regarding our growth potential in the US.\nNext, I will speak to our recent brand campaigns and activations, Megan will review our financials, and we will close by taking your questions, so let's get started. In the second quarter, total revenue increased 7% or 8% in constant currency, by merchandise category, women's increased 6%, men's grew 11%, and accessories increased 7%. Earnings per share increased 18% driven by strong gross margin which contributed to 110 basis point increase in operating margin. In addition, demonstrating our continued confidence in the business, we repurchased $584 million dollars of stock in quarter two, which brings us to $1.2 billion dollars a year to date.\nLet's now discuss our regional performance, beginning with our international business. In quarter two, we continued to see strength in our international markets, as the Lululemon brand resonates with guests around the world. Growing our business outside of North America remains one of our largest opportunities, and we remain on track to quadruple international revenue from 2021 levels by the end of 2026. Momentum remains strong with total international revenue increasing 29% or 31% in constant currency. By region, our results were as follows, China mainland increased 34% or 37% in constant currency, rest of the world grew 24% or 27% in constant currency.\nIn China mainland, our business remained robust in the second quarter as we continued to bring new guests into the brand through our stores and multiple e-commerce platforms. In addition to our innovative product offering and on the operating model, we are requiring guests through our unique mate to field positioning, which comes to life through our commitment to movement and community, all of which supports the Healthy China 2030 initiative. In quarter two, we built upon the success of our Summer Sweat Games series with our largest activation yet.\nThis year, we expanded the games to more than 70 stores in nearly 40 cities with approximately 10,000 guests signing up to participate. The National Finals were held this past weekend in Beijing. Looking to quarter three, we will build upon last year's success and bring attention to the World Mental Health Day in October with unique activations across several cities in China mainland. In addition, we will expand our activations to other markets this fall, including South Korea, Germany, the UK and the US. This is a great example of how our teams from around the world share ideas and activate global campaigns.\nShifting to our rest of world segment, where we continue to perform well in both AMA and APAC. We expanded further in Southeast Asia with the opening of our second store in Thailand and our fourth in Malaysia. And in France, our pair of stores and the Lulemon brand overall benefited from the energy and excitement of the Olympics, which I'll speak to in more detail shortly. Turning to our business in the Americas, revenue increased 1% or 2% in constant currency, we continued to perform well in Canada, with revenue growth of 8% or 11% in constant currency, while revenue in the US was flat.\nThis is a key area focus for us, and I will now dive deeper into our US business. Our brand remains strong in the US market, traffic was up across both channels and Google search queries remain positive. Guests are looking for our product, coming into our stores, and visiting our e-commerce sites. While we continue to see growth in our men's business, we have experienced a slowdown in women's, we have improved our in stocks in smaller sizes through Q2 and our entering Q3 better positioned.\nAs we've analyzed our women's business in more detail, we have determined the most significant factor was a product plan that introduced less newness across core and seasonal styles. By newness, I'm referring to the seasonal updates we bring into the assortment, typically expressed as color, print, patterns, and silhouettes, I'm not referring to our pipeline of innovation, which remains full and the details of which I will share with you shortly.\nAs we have learned more, it's become clear to us that this reduced newness, which is below our historical levels, and stems from earlier product decisions, has impacted conversion rates, given the fewer new options available to our female guests. While this reduction was seen across our women's assortment, it had a more pronounced impact in bottoms and in our online channel, the newness that we had performed well, we simply did not have enough to inspire her to purchase.\nAs most of you know, we announced changes within our product organization in May of this year, we implemented a new reporting structure in which our global creative director Jonathan Chung reports to me and our chief merchant Liz Bender reports to Nikki Newberger in her expanded role as chief brand and product activation officer. Since this shift, Nikki and I have both spent considerable time with the teams, and we are pleased that this new structure puts design and merchandising on equal footing, and reestablishes the healthy balance that must exist within a product organization. The teams are working well together, and already in action.\nOur near term action plan leverages our capabilities in chase and fast track design to bring more seasonal newness into our women's assortment as quickly as possible. The teams have been chasing into some of our strong performers, including align leggings and colors and prints, our gold zip scuba and soft dream and new silhouettes and seasonal fabrications. Our fast track design capability allows us to bring newness into our assortment quicker while also testing and learning from new silhouettes. For 2025, we are fast tracking several new styles within performance shorts, tops and track suits.\nWe are optimistic that we will begin to see the benefits of these strategies over the upcoming quarters, and return to our historical levels of newness no later than spring 2025. Moving forward, I feel confident that the new structure and relationship between design and merchandising will lead to more ongoing conversations and consistent decision making. And I'm excited about the newness and innovation that will be flowing into our upcoming product assortments, while we are disappointed with the recent performance in women's, we see many strengths in our US business.\nOur store portfolio remains highly productive with significant opportunities ahead. Our industry leading sales per foot, the success of our new stores and the positive results from our optimization program all underpin our comfort with our power of three times to target of approximately 5% square footage growth annually in the Americas through 2026. We are only beginning to leverage the power of our membership program, which allows us to engage more deeply with our guests, drive loyalty, and increase long-term value.\nWe now have more than 20 million essential members, and I'll share more in a moment about how we're expanding our offerings. And while we have experienced positive increases across our brand funnel metrics in the market, there is still substantial opportunity to drive [inaudible] brand awareness, introducing Lululemon to new gas segments. As you can see, there are many reasons we feel optimistic about our US business, and it's growth potential, let's shift now to our recent and upcoming product innovations.\nBeginning with men, the business remains robust, and we continue to gain market share, in quarter two, we saw strength across the assortment, including zeroed-in, which was launched this past spring, and has quickly become a guest favorite in a top three performance franchise. Our pacebreaker with the positive response to our shorts and our recently launched pant in jacket is performing very well. Our new ShowZero Polo, which virtually eliminates the appearance of sweat, also launched this spring, and has resonated well with guests, and will benefit from increased inventory commitments this fall and into next year.\nIn our lounge offering, including Soft Jersey, Study State, and Smooth Spacer, continue to perform well, and we will fuel the momentum with additional styles and deeper inventory buys. In women's, I'm excited with our product roadmap for fall, which includes an expansion of our train offering with the introduction of a new performance fabric innovation in a tight. An expansion of our wonder under franchise offering are iconic lagging in different fabrics, seasonal updates within our line franchise, and an updated version of our charge-field footwear style.\nAnd our accessories business also remains positive on top of last year's strong performance, we have diversified into a compelling assortment of bags, including our new crew and double zip backpacks, and additional styles within the everywhere franchise, including a backpack and cross-body bag, which is fueling continued momentum in the category. One of our goals is to solve for the unmet needs of our guests with new and compelling technical innovations, and this will continue to separate us from other brands.\nWith this in mind, I want to touch on breathe through, a new product offering this quarter for guests who participate in hot yoga and other heat-intensive workouts. It was a small buy, reviewed this as a test and learn, and while guests were excited by the fabric, the design didn't meet their expectations. Listening to our guests is central to who we are and how we grow our brand, and we took the right step of pausing on sales and look forward to reintroducing the fabric in the future. This decision had a negligible impact on our performance in this quarter.\nI'd now like to spend a few minutes speaking about our recent brand campaigns and activations. Increasing brand awareness and consideration remains one of our single biggest opportunities in almost every market in which we operate, so let me highlight a few examples now. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to offer many benefits to members of our free essentials program, in early June, we hosted a members-only weekend at Peloton Studios, New York. This exclusive sold-out event featured live classes, a 5K run, sessions with our Peloton ambassadors and a wrap-up party.\nWe also launched partner perks for members. We partnered with 12 brands, including Aura and Berries, that offer our members exclusive perks and benefits, and the early feedback from guests has been very positive. These strategies illustrate just a few of the ways we engage with our guests, beyond a simple purchase transaction, by offering exclusive experiences and benefits and helping them feel the best, all of which drives and deepens loyalty. Our partnership with the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic teams came to life with the games in Paris and continues for the next several days during the Paralympics.\nAs a Canadian, I'm incredibly proud of our athletes, and how our brand showed up during the games. Through our partnership, we outfit athletes for their off-field activities and the Lululemon brand clearly benefit from the podium time the team achieved, and the exposure during the opening and closing ceremonies. We further leveraged our partnership with the pop-up shop in Canada House, and by offering our team Canada collection in our nearby stores in Paris. Across Canada in both stores and e-commerce, and in the US, through our e-commerce channel.\nThis partnership is a great example of how we are elevating the Lululemon brand on the world stage by associating with elite athletes, gaining significant earned media and growing brand awareness globally. Another area focused for us is back to school. Bringing younger guests and particularly men into the brand remains an opportunity as we increase awareness regarding the versatility of our merchandise and the breadth of our offering. Football players, DK Metcalf and Odell Beckham Jr, star in this year's campaign in North America, and it features our loungewear offering for both men and women and our cityverse sneaker.\nBefore I hand it over to Megan to discuss our financials, let me share our high-level thinking on our guidance for the remainder of the year. For quarter three and the full year, excluding the 53rd week, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 7%, relatively in line with quarter two performance. Our full year revenue guidance acknowledges the uncertainty around the shorter holiday shopping season, and the US election in quarter four. Our teams remain focused on the actions I detailed for you.\nWe plan for our penetration of newness to improve in the second half of 2024, and we expect to be back to our historical levels of newness, as we start 2025. While you can see our focus on the US, other aspects of our business remain strong and we are committed to delivering on our power of 3x2 target of doubling revenue from $6.25 billion in '21 to $12.5 billion in '26. Using our revised guidance for this year, our three-year revenue growth CAGR from '21 to '24 is 19% ahead of the 15% CAGR we laid out in our plan.\nI'm excited with our new leadership structure driving product direction for '25, and our future pipeline of innovation. I feel optimistic we can accelerate growth in our US, women's business while continuing to deliver strong performance in men and international, Megan, over to you.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nSVP of Financial Planning & Analysis, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Calvin. While revenue in Q2 remained strong in all of our international reaches in Canada, the US business was softer for the reasons Calvin just detailed. Our names per share exceeded our expectations to [inaudible] predominantly by strong growth margin, our accounts were flat versus the prior year and better than expected. And when looking at expenses, we continue to manage the business prudently, I'll protect and key investments for the long term, let me now share the details of Q2 performance. For Q2, total net revenue rose 7% to $2.4 billion, in constant dollar comparable sales increased 3%, within our regions, results were as follows.\nAmerica's revenue increased 1%, or 2% in constant currency, comparable sales declined 2%. China mainland revenue increased 345 or 37% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing 23%. And in our rest of world segment, revenue grew by 24%, or 27% in constant currency with comparable sales increasing by 20%. In our store channel, total sales increased 11% and we ended the quarter with 721 stores globally, square footage increased 14% versus last year driven by the addition of 49 net new Lululemon stores with Q2 of 2023. During the quarter, we opened 10 net new stores and completed six optimizations.\nIn our digital channel, revenues increased 2% and contributed $900 million of top line, or 38% of total revenue, and by category, men's revenue increased 11% versus last year, and women's increased 6%, while accessories grew 7%. Growth profit for the second quarter was 1.4 billion, or 59.6% of net revenue, compared to 58.8% of net revenue in Q2 2023. The growth profit rate in Q2 increased 80 basis points, significantly better than our guidance, and was driven primarily by the following.\nA 130 basis point increase in product margin, driven primarily by favorable IMU from lower product costs, mark down to a spot year over year and better than expected, 30 basis points of net to leverage on fixed costs and 20 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. I would also note that our pause on the sale of breathe through had a negligible impact on growth margin in the quarter. Relative to our guidance, which was a decline in growth margin of 100 to 110 basis points, the upside was driven predominantly by prudent management of fixed expenses within growth margin, favorable mix and lower than expected mark down.\nMoving to SG&A, our approach continues to be grounded and prudently managing our expenses, while also continuing to strategically invest in our long term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $872 million or 36.8% of net revenue, compared to 37% of net revenue for the same period last year. Foreign exchange contributed 10 basis points of deleverage, overall the 20 basis points of leverage in the quarter was below our guidance to 40 to 60 basis points and resulted from the lower than expected top line. Operating income for the quarter was approximately 540 million or 22.8% of net revenue, compared to 21.7% of net revenue in Q2 2023.\nTax expense for the quarter was 165.3 million or 29.6% of pre-tax earnings, compared to an effective tax rate of 29.8% a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $393 million, or $3.15 for diluted share compared to $2.68 for the second quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures were approximately $145 million for the quarter, compared to approximately $146 million in the second quarter last year. Q2 spent relates primarily to investments that support business growth, including our multi-year distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalent, inventory declined 14% in line with our expectations, with the units declining in the mid-single digit range. We repurchased nearly 1.9 million in shares in Q2, at an average price of $310 dollars, here to date, we repurchased approximately 1.2 billion of stock. Share repurchases remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, and currently we have approximately 1 billion remaining on our repurchased program. Let me now share our detailed guidance outlook for the remainder of the year.\nAt the highest level, we are assuming that revenue trends in the second half of the year remain fairly consistent with Q2, when excluding the 53rd week and the impact of a shorter holiday shopping season in Q4. I would also note that our pause on the sale of breathe through had a negligible impact on our revenue and growth margin guidance for the year. We feel optimistic with the work our teams are doing to improve the newness we offer within our US women's assortment, but we continue to acknowledge the uncertainties in the macro environment and plan the business prudently.\nStarting with a full year of 2024, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $10.375 to $10.475 billion, this range represents growth of 8% to 9% relative to 2023. Excluding the 53rd week that we have in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to grow 6% to 7%. Also, relating to Q4, we are assuming a negative impact of approximately 3 percentage points, resulting from a shorter holiday shopping season relative to last year. We continue to expect to open 35 to 40 net new company operated stores in 2024, and complete approximately 40 co-located optimizations, this will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low double digits.\nOur new store openings in 2024 will include 5 to 10 stores in the Americas, with the rest in our international markets, primarily in China mainland. For the full year, we now expect growth margins to be approximately 20 basis points below our adjusted growth margin in 2023, due predominantly to de-leverage on fixed costs associated with lower forecasted sales and an increase in freight costs relative to our prior estimate. We continue to expect markdowns to be relatively flat with last year. Starting now at SG&A for the full year, we now expect it to be approximately flat versus 2023, we are poorly managing our expenses while continuing to invest strategically into our power of 3x2 roadmap.\nIncluding investments in marketing and brand building, is it increasing our awareness and acquiring new guests, investments to support our international growth and market expansion, and continued investment in technology infrastructure and data analytics capabilities. When looking at operating margin for the full year 2024, we now expect a decrease of 10 to 20 basis points, versus adjusted operating margin in 2023, which expanded 110 basis points versus 2022. For the full year of 2024, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For the fiscal year of 2024, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $13.95 to $14.15, versus adjusted EPS of $12.77 in 2023.\nOur EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases, but does include the impact of our repurchases year to date. Looking at inventory, we expect dollar inventory to increase in the mid teens in Q3, as we begin to anniversary last year's decline. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 to $690 million for 2024, this spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multi-year distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Sifting now to Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $2.34 to $2.365 billion, representing growth of 6% to 7%.\nWe expect to open a 14 net new company operated stores in Q3. We expect growth margin in Q3 to decrease 50 to 60 basis points relative to Q3 2023. The decrease will be driven predominantly by deleverage on fixed costs, and our ongoing investment in our multi-year distribution center project. We expect product margin to be relatively flat with last year, inclusive of approximately 60 basis points of higher freight costs, we expect markdown to be relatively flat with Q3 2023.\nIn Q3, we expect our SG&A rate to leverage by 40 to 50 basis points relative to Q3 2023, this will be driven predominantly by leverage on top line and ongoing prudent expense management. When looking at operating margins for Q3, we expect the leverage of approximately 10 to 20 basis points. Turning to EPS, we expect earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $2.68 to $2.73, versus adjusted EPS of $2.53 a year ago. We expect our expected tax rate in Q3 to be approximately 30%, and with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin McDonald\n\nChief Executive Officer, lululemon athletica, Inc.\n\nThanks, Megan. Lululemon remains a strong and healthy brand, and we have shown our ability to responsibly manage the business, while seizing the many growth opportunities in front of us. We have a strong track record, and we will continue to work to deliver for our shareholders, for our employees, and for our guests.\nChallenges are a natural part of accelerated growth, and I feel confident about emerging stronger from this period, as we innovate for and inspire our guests. In closing, I want to thank our leaders and our people for their passion and dedication to our brand and our business, both during this past quarter and with all that's ahead. Thank you for joining us today. We will now take your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Lululemon Athletica Inc. First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for Lululemon Athletica. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Brett Tubin\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Lululemon's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of Lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.\nActual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nAny forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present GAAP and both non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release.\nIn addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.\nBefore we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the first quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour, so please limit yourself to 1 question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I'm happy to be here to discuss our quarter 1 results. As you've seen from our press release, our revenue growth was modestly ahead of our expectations, while EPS came in even stronger.\nOn today's call, I'll share some highlights regarding our performance in quarter 1 and including my perspective on our U.S. business and what our teams have been working on. Next, I'll speak to the recent departure of our Chief Product Officer and the opportunities our new structure unlocks for us.\nThen I'll provide some details on our product innovations and brand activation. In addition, Megan will review our financials, and we will close out our time today by taking your questions. So let's get started.\nIn the first quarter, total revenue increased 10% or 11% in constant currency. By region, we saw continued strong momentum in our international business, with revenue in China Mainland up 52% and -- and rest of the world up 30%, both in constant currency.\nIn the Americas, revenue increased 4% in constant currency with Canada up 12% and the U.S., up 2%. The -- by merchandise category, women's increased 10%, men's increased 15% and accessories remains positive and up 2%, which is impressive given the exceptionally strong performance last year.\nEarnings per share were $2.54 versus EPS of $2.28 in quarter 1 last year. In addition, we repurchased nearly $300 million of stock in quarter 1 and an additional $230 million in the second quarter thus far, and our Board recently increased our authorization by $1 billion, bringing our capacity to repurchase shares up to approximately $1.7 billion.\nAs you can see, our business remains strong, and our brand continues to resonate with guests around the world. We are engaging with them through our unique and compelling activations and brand campaigns and we continue to drive the business with new product innovations.\nLet me now share some additional quarter 1 details by region. As I mentioned, our business remains strong in every international market in which we operate as our brand is resonating with guests across regions and geographies.\nOur approach to growth follows the model we've implemented so successfully in North America and includes omnichannel distribution via highly productive stores and e-commerce sites a product assortment, which offers technical and versatile styles and is frequently updated with new innovations to enable our guests to sweat in any way they choose and a unique and compelling approach to building brand awareness which includes local activations as well as larger-scale brand campaigns.\nOur international business remains underpenetrated and continues to represent a significant growth opportunity. For the full year 2023, International was only 21% of our business, and over the long run, I see the potential for it to grow to 50% as we continue to expand our presence outside of North America.\nShifting now to the U.S. As we mentioned on our last call, we've seen a slower start to the year due to several internal factors, including missed opportunity in women's and bags which we are actively addressing and some ongoing choppiness in the consumer environment.\nOur men's business has maintained its momentum, driven by strong guest response to our innovations across performance, lounge and our ABC franchise. Our market share gains were strong in men's in quarter 1 and -- and with unaided brand awareness of less than 20% in the U.S., our opportunity to continue to grow this business remains significant.\nWhen looking at women's, we did not maximize the business in the U.S., which was the result of several missed opportunities, including a color palette and our core assortment, particularly in leggings that was too narrow. Where we had color guests responded well, we just needed more as they are looking for additional choices. And we are also out of stock in some of our smaller sizes.\nAnd in addition, we saw a fantastic guest response to our newer styles of bags, such as the 2 tone tote, but did not buy these styles with enough depth to fully capture the demand. Megan will share our guidance with you later in the call, but as you've seen, we are maintaining our revenue guidance for the year.\nIn quarter 2, we expect revenue growth of 9% to 10%, roughly in line with our quarter 1 growth rate. Our guidance for the full year continues to call for revenue growth of 10% to 11%, excluding the 53rd week and includes a modest step-up in the second half.\nIn summary, we are moving in the right direction and understand the root cause of the issues and with the lead times, we expect to be in a more optimal inventory position in the second half of 2024.\nWe -- in addition, our upcoming product launches and innovation flows, which I'll speak to shortly, are skewed toward the back half of the year, which is another reason for our optimism.\nLooking out further, our growth opportunities in the U.S. remain compelling. Our unaided brand awareness is only in the low 30s. Using our unique approach, which combines local engagement, community activations and larger-scale brand campaigns, we continue to have a significant runway to introduce new guests to Lululemon and drive them to our stores and e-commerce sites.\nWe are just beginning to leverage the power of our membership program, which now has approximately 20 million members in North America. By offering benefits like early access to product and invitations to exclusive events we are increasing our member base and powerfully engaging with them, which will ultimately drive both spend and long-term value.\nOur stores remain highly productive with new locations performing well and we continue to be pleased with our store optimization program. As a reminder, in 2024, our plan calls for 5 to 10 new store openings and 15 to 20 optimizations.\nLooking beyond 2024, our real estate opportunities in the U.S. remain significant, and our plans include continuing both of our new store opening program and our optimization strategy, and we continue to gain market share. with outsized strength in men's, where we outpaced the overall market in quarter 1.\nNow let me speak about product innovation and some of the current shifts we recently announced within our organizational structure. As you know, our Chief Product Officer, Sun Choe, recently decided to leave Lululemon to take a job elsewhere in the industry. Sun and I had been in regular conversations, so I understood her personal and career goals.\nWe regularly update our succession plans, which allowed us to seamlessly step into our new planned leadership structure. I'm excited about how the new structure will bring new perspectives, curiosity and leadership across our product teams. This approach will drive several meaningful benefits in the near and long term, including increasing our speed of innovation, stimulating creativity and enhancing team accountability around product flows and assortment.\nWe have a strong and dynamic product team led by Jonathan Cheung, our Global Creative Director, who now reports to me and Liz Bender, our Chief Merchandising Officer, who now reports to Nikki Neuberger, as she steps into her expanded role as Chief Brand and Product Activation Officer.\nJonathan, Liz and the entire product team will continue to drive innovation, design technical product that looks great and solve for the unmet needs of our guests. And under Nikki's proven leadership, the merchant and the brand teams will be more fully integrated, which will streamline decision-making and ensure we show up powerfully and consistently for our guests across all markets.\nAll of this is intended to speed the ideation process with regard to product storytelling and further improve our speed to market. And these shifts will help maintain and enhance our pipeline of innovation.\nI want to now share several recent and upcoming product launches that continue to show our team's ability to create compelling products. In quarter 1, in women's, our guests continue to respond very well to our key second layer franchises, including Define, SCBA and Soft Stream. In addition, we continue to see strength in bottoms led by bike shorts and our away-from-body styles.\nLooking forward, we're on track to bring significant innovation into our assortment beginning the end of quarter 2 and into the second half of the year. Within women's, we have some exciting new launches planned within our leggings assortment. These include a new innovation designed for hot, low-impact workouts and made from a new performance fabric, one of our quickest drying and lightest [ waist ] to date.\nAnd late in the year, we'll launch another new type, our most versatile [ Sense ] line, providing a completely different field state, which will bring newness and innovation into our trade assortment. The upcoming newness in leggings is a perfect example of how we continue to bring innovation into our core categories where we already have significant strength. Our teams continue to expand our product offerings with new technical solutions, and I'm excited for you to see these new styles.\nLet's now take a look at men's. In quarter 1, we continued to see strong response to our lounge offering, including Steady State and Soft Jersey. In addition, we recently launched a Smooth Spacer Hoodie, which provides a cooling sensation and is a great recovery piece to where home after a work out.\nWe are pleased with the variety of and performance of our lounge offerings. We plan to fuel the strength by building our inventory levels and expanding the silhouettes offered in all 3 of these collections for fall.\nOn the technical side of men's, we continue to see great response to our Pace Breaker and Zeroed In franchises, both of which we will expand later this year. Zeroed In is following in the footsteps of our other key technical styles for men and is quickly becoming a top performer in training.\nI also want to mention our new ShowZero technology, which we just launched in men's polo shirts. This fabric uses innovative construction to hide the appearance of sweat on the outside of the shirt. These polos are highly versatile and can be worn on the golf course to the office or many other occasions.\nAnd in footwear, our new Cityverse style has done extremely well, particularly in men's where demand has exceeded our expectations. These are just the latest examples of the disruptive innovations we are known for and will continue to create.\nShifting now to brand awareness. As you know, our unaided brand awareness remains low in every country where we operate, except our home market of Canada. We will continue to activate across our grass roots and global platforms to increase awareness and bring new guests into the Lululemon brand. Let me share just a few examples.\nIn quarter 1, we held several successful earned media activations including launching our new Cityverse and Beyond Fuel footwear styles in New York, hosting our further women's ultramarathon event near Palm Springs, California, and unveiling our kit for the Canadian Olympic and paralympics athletes in Toronto.\nIn quarter 2, we will again host our successful summer sweat games in China while also bringing a version of this event to our Essentials members in North America with our membership Summer series.\nAnd in quarter 3, we'll strategically test TV again with another men's campaign, building on the success of last year's campaign, this year's spot will focus on men and feature some high-profile personalities.\nBefore I hand it over to Megan to discuss our financials and guidance outlook, I'd like to share some additional thoughts about the rest of the year.\nOur pipeline of innovation and our launch cadence for the second half of 2024 and is particularly strong. In the U.S., our teams have been making the appropriate adjustments in closing the inventory gaps in terms of color and sizing, our brand awareness remains low, but is growing and our store productivity remains among the best in the industry.\nWe continue to engage with our guests in unique and compelling ways and inspire them with our differentiated product innovations. I'm optimistic with regards to our performance in the second half of the year and beyond as we continue to execute well against our power of 3x 2 goal of doubling our revenue in 5 years. Megan, over to you.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Calvin. Our Q1 results exceeded our expectations, driven by above planned performance across the key areas of our P&L.\nOur business remains strong in our international regions in Canada and in the U.S., we've seen a slower start to the year in line with our expectations.\nAs you've seen in our press release, we're maintaining our revenue guidance for the year while increasing our EPS guidance. This reflects our optimism in our plans and strategies for 2024, many of which you just heard Calvin speak about.\nIn addition, we continue to plan for multiple scenarios and manage our business to protect against downside. Before sharing the details of our Q1 performance and our guidance outlook, let me provide a quick update on our Mexico operations.\nIn May, we signed an agreement with our franchise partners to acquire their Lululemon Mexico operations. in the 15 retail locations they currently operate. Our partner has built an incredible foundation for our brand in Mexico, and our acquisition will allow us to more efficiently continue to expand, grow our community and enhance the guest experience.\nWe are acquiring the business for approximately $160 million in cash, and the deal is expected to close in the next several weeks, subject to customary closing conditions.\nFrom a P&L standpoint, we expect the transaction to have an immaterial impact on our financial results for the fiscal year 2024.\nLet me now share the details of our Q1 performance. For Q1, total net revenue rose 10% to $2.2 billion and comparable sales increased 7%. Within our regions, the results were as follows: Americas revenue increased 3% on a reported basis or 4% in constant currency with comparable sales flat. China Mainland revenue increased 45% on a reported basis or 52% in constant currency with comparable sales increasing 33%. And -- And in our Rest of World segment, revenue grew by 27% on a reported basis or 30% in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing by 26%.\nIn our store channel, total sales increased 12%. And -- we ended the quarter with 711 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 49 net new Lululemon stores since Q1 of 2023.\nWe -- during the quarter, we completed 3 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenue increased 8% and contributed $906 million of top line or 41% of total revenue. By category, women's revenue increased by 10% versus last year men's increased by 15% and accessories grew 2% on top of a strong 67% last year.\nGross profit for the first quarter was $1.28 billion or 57.7% of net revenue compared to 57.5% of net revenue in Q1 2023. We -- our gross margin increased 20 basis points relative to last year and was driven primarily by the following: a 120 basis point increase in overall product margin driven primarily by lower product costs, lower air freight costs and lower inventory provisions, offset somewhat by a 50 basis point increase in markdowns.\nThe 120 basis point increase in product margin was partially offset by 70 basis points of deleverage on fixed costs. and 30 basis points of deleverage on foreign exchange.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $842 million or 38.1% of net revenue compared to 37.4% of net revenue for the same period last year. The 70 basis points of SG&A deleverage was better than our guidance of 130 to 140 basis points and was driven by timing, slightly better top line and prudent management of expenses.\nForeign exchange was flat in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $433 million or 19.6% of net revenue, compared to operating margin of 20.1% in Q1 2023. Tax expense for the quarter was $134.5 million, or 29.5% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 29.1% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to a decrease in tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and an increase in nondeductible expenses in international jurisdiction.\nNet income for the quarter was $321 million or $2.54 per diluted share compared to earnings per diluted share of $2.28 for the first quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures were approximately $131 million for the quarter versus $137 million in Q1 last year. Q1 spend relates primarily to investments to support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of Q1 was $1.3 billion. We are pleased with our inventory levels, which declined 15% versus last year. Relative to our expectations, higher revenue and foreign exchange contributed to the decrease.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 751,000 shares at an average price of $395. Year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately $530 million of stock. Share repurchases remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, and I'm happy that our Board has recently increased our authorization by $1 billion. With this new authorization, we now have approximately $1.7 billion of capacity to continue to buy back our shares.\nLet me speak now to our guidance outlook. We remain excited with our pipeline of innovation, brand activations and marketing plans for 2024. As it remains early in the year and the consumer environment in the U.S. is dynamic, we continue to be prudent in our planning while also continuing to invest in our strategic road map, which will set us up well for both the medium and long term.\nFor the full year 2024, we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion. This range represents growth of 11% to 12% relative to 2023. We -- excluding the 53rd week that we have in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to grow 10% to 11%. We continue to expect to open 35 to 40 net new company-operated stores in 2024, we -- and complete approximately 40 colocated optimizations.\nThis will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low double digits. Our new store openings of 2024 will include 5 to 10 stores in the Americas, with the rest in our international markets, primarily in China Mainland.\nFor the full year, we continue to forecast gross margin to be approximately flat with adjusted gross margin in 2023. We -- within gross margin, we expect both markdowns and airfreight to be relatively flat with last year.\nTurning now to SG&A for the full year. We continue to forecast leverage of approximately 10 basis points versus 2023. And -- we're prudently managing our expenses while continuing to strategically advance our Power 3x2 road map with investments in marketing and brand building aimed at increasing our awareness and acquiring new guests, international growth and market expansion, and technology infrastructure and data analytics capabilities.\nWhen looking at operating margin for full year 2024, we continue to expect an increase of approximately 10 basis points versus adjusted operating margin in 2023. We which expanded 110 basis points versus 2022. For the full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%, we -- an increase over the 2023 adjusted effective rate of 28.7%.\nThe increase relative to last year relates primarily to lower stock-based compensation deductions and that favorable adjustments we realized when filing our tax returns in 2023. For the fiscal year 2024, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $14.27 to $14.47 and -- versus adjusted EPS of $12.77 in 2023.\nOur EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. It does include the impact of our share repurchases year-to-date and also higher forecasted interest income.\nWhen looking at inventory, we expect dollar inventory to decline in the mid-teens in Q2 and then increase in the second half of the year as we anniversary last year's decline. We continue to expect the capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2024. We -- this spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nShifting now to Q2. We expect revenue in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.42 billion, representing growth of 9% to 10%. We expect to open 14 net new company-operated stores in Q2. We -- we expect gross margin in Q2 to decrease 100 to 110 basis points relative to Q2 2023. The decrease will be driven predominantly by deleverage on fixed costs and our ongoing investment in our multiyear distribution center project.\nWe expect product margin to be relatively flat with last year, inclusive of an increase in markdowns but a smaller increase than we saw in Q1 of this year. In Q2, we expect our SG&A rate to leverage by 40 to 60 basis points relative to Q2 2023. This will be driven predominantly by favorable regional penetration, a shift in timing of spend related to certain brand campaigns from Q2 last year to Q1 this year and leverage on top line and ongoing prudent expense management.\nAnd looking at operating margin for Q2, we expect a decrease of approximately 50 to 60 basis points relative to last year. However, we continue to expect 10 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year.\nTurning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $2.92 to $2.97, versus EPS of $2.68 a year ago. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be approximately 30%.\nAnd with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Megan. In closing, I want to say I am energized by the opportunities in front of us and excited for what the future holds for Lululemon. I was in China last week and when I'm traveling in markets around the world, I see how powerfully our brand resonates across cultures and geographies.\nWhile we make some strategic adjustments in the U.S., our leadership team continues to challenge ourselves and our teams by asking how high is high. It's that mentality and passion for our brands that will enable us to navigate the near term as we build towards the long-term opportunities for Lululemon that we know exist.\nIn closing, I want to thank the senior leaders of Lululemon as well as our teams in every market around the world for your unyielding focus on creating amazing products and experiences for our guests.\nI look forward to taking your questions now.

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. [Operator Instructions]\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I am pleased to be here today to discuss our Q4 and full year 2023 results, which represent another solid finish to another strong year for lululemon. We will also discuss our business in Q1 and our outlook for 2024.\nAs you've heard from others in our industry, there has been a shift in the U.S. consumer behavior of late, and we're navigating what has been a slower start to the year in this market. We view this as an opportunity to keep playing offense as we lean into investments that will continue our growth trajectory.\nOutside the U.S., our business remains strong in all our international markets in Canada. Meghan will take you through our guidance shortly, and I will share with you some of the initiatives that we have planned specifically for the U.S. as well as our overall plans for product and marketing.\nWhat you'll hear from me is a message that remains consistent. We have an impressive pipeline of innovation. Our opportunity to increase our brand awareness remains significant. And we will continue to grow and optimize our store base within the Americas and around the world. And we remain ahead of our Power of Three x2 goals.\nSo let's begin. As you read in our press release, our Q4 results, both top and bottom line, exceeded the updated guidance we provided in January. Our growth remained balanced across channels, regions and product categories. And we continue to see strong increase in traffic at our stores and e-commerce sites.\nIn the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 16%. By region, the Americas increased 9%, China Mainland increased 78%, and the rest of the world increased 36%. By merchandise category, women's increased 13%, men's grew 15% and accessories increased 40%. And earnings per share were $5.29 versus adjusted EPS of $4.40 in Q4 last year.\nWhen looking at our product performance in Q4, the trends we have seen in the business over the last several quarters continued. We saw strength in key franchises, including for women, scuba, define, Softstreme and Wunder Puff. For men, steady state soft jersey and ABC as well as License to Train and Pace Breaker. And in accessories, our overall bag assortment continues to perform well.\nAnd we continue to build our Essentials membership program in North America, which has now grown to more than 17 million members in the first year. This quarter, we offered them exclusive benefits, including early access to our Black Friday styles, member-only shop nights and invitations to participate in experiences such as our Move for You activation with Peloton at the Mall of America.\nWe remain excited with our membership program as it offers us new ways to engage with our guests and increase both spend and LTV. I'm pleased that we're seeing positive results so far on all of these objectives.\nNow turning to our full year 2023 results. Revenue increased 19% versus last year to $9.6 billion with the Americas up 12%, China Mainland up 67% and Rest of World growing 43% versus last year. Adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points, while adjusted earnings per share increased 27% versus 2022.\nAs you know, 2023 was the second full year of our Power of Three x2 growth plan. When looking at these 2 years collectively, I'm pleased that we have grown revenue at a 24% CAGR, fueled by a 44% CAGR in our international regions, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 120 basis points, grown adjusted EPS at a 28% CAGR and continued to gain market share. These results speak to the strength of the lululemon brand in all markets where we operate and illustrate the significant opportunities we have in front of us as we remain in the early innings of our growth story.\nLet me now speak to quarter 1 of 2024 and what we're seeing in the business. We are pleased that our sales remain strong in most regions across the globe. Consistent with what we've seen from others in the market, the consumer environment in the United States has been somewhat challenging.\nHowever, despite the market dynamics, we remain optimistic about our opportunities to grow our business in the U.S. in 2024 and to continue to gain market share. We have robust plans in place to further strengthen our position.\nWe will continue to open and optimize our stores with plans for 5 to 10 new store openings and 15 to 20 optimizations. With U.S. sales per square foot above our overall average of $1,600, our stores remain among the most productive in the industry.\nIn addition, our stores facilitate a direct connection with our guests, help us attract new guests into the brand and act as hubs in our local communities. We will continue to invest into the market to increase our brand awareness as we continue to activate both community-based events and larger brand campaigns.\nWe see other areas within the business to further strengthen our positioning. We are successfully growing our business across all age demographics, including our younger guests. As we have attracted more younger guests into the brand, we have seen strong sell-through of our smaller sizes and our offering of color. We don't yet know how high is high with this demographic, and our teams are chasing into these areas of the assortment so we can better maximize the business.\nAnd our product pipeline is compelling, both within the U.S. and across the globe. In fact, 2024 will be another year of significant product innovation. We started the year strong with the launch of our expanded footwear collection in early February. Building on the initial success of our women's line, we hosted a media event in New York City to unveil new styles of both technical and casual footwear, including our first shoes designed for men.\nOur new styles available for both men and women include the cityverse, designed for all-day comfort and bringing the best of technical performance to a casual sneaker; beyondfeel, a new running shoe that offers superior cushioning, ventilation and support; and beyondfeel trail, our newest road to trail running shoe.\nWe are very pleased with the initial reaction to our new styles. We were seeing a particularly strong response to cityverse from our male guests in North America and in China. And the guest response is exceeding our expectations. Our teams are chasing into this initial strength, and we build upon this momentum with additional footwear innovations planned throughout the year.\nOur strategy with footwear is the same as apparel. We lead with technical innovations that solve for the unmet needs of our guests. We can then leverage our expertise in raw material innovation and technical construction to offer versatile styles designed for everyday use.\nIn addition, within our 2024 product pipeline, we will continue to be a leader in fabric innovation with new fabrics planned within both our yoga and train categories. Also for women, we will continue to maximize our largest franchise, Align, as we explore new silhouettes across both tops and bottoms. And we will continue to expand our popular train franchise, License to Train.\nOn the men's side, this year, we are launching the most innovation I've seen in the last number of years across categories and activities. A few highlights include new fabric innovations within our golf category and continuing to build upon the success of soft jersey with additional styles.\nAlso, we have recently leveraged our iconic Pace Breaker into a complete collection with the launch of a Pace Breaker jacket and [indiscernible] to bring new solves into the men's run category. Our product and our ability to bring new technical solutions into our assortment on a consistent basis is one of our biggest competitive advantages. I'm excited with the innovations we have on top for 2024, which will continue to enable our guests to sweat in any way they choose.\nLet me now shift to our brand and marketing strategies. As you know, our brand awareness remains low across most markets, which represents a significant opportunity for us to attract new guests.\nStarting with our Further event, which began just before International Women's Day and concluded last week. Further was a first of its kind women's ultra marathon in which 10 athletes from our ambassador collective set out to run the furthest distances of their careers. The activation was a huge success as world records were set by athletes wearing our apparel and footwear and is a great example of what makes lululemon unique.\nFor example, how we create authentic community activations like no other brand, which result in increased brand awareness through significant earned and social media attention and also how we continue to innovate with athletes and for athletes and introduce new technical solutions into our assortment. As part of Further, we designed 36 products through a female-first lens, many of which we will introduce into our mainline assortment over the coming seasons.\nLooking forward, next month in advance of the Paris Olympics and Paralympic Games, we'll be revealing our kit for Team Canada. As you know, in 2021, we announced a multiyear partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee and the Canadian Paralympic Committee.\nAfter our inaugural 2022 winter games, we're now set to launch our first Team Canada summer collection, outfitting the athletes and coaches with our product. I've seen what we've created, and it's amazing for both our Olympians and Paralympians.\nIn addition to supporting Canadian athletes, this partnership is another example of lululemon's deep relationships with elite athletes. It showcases our brand on the global stage and is a compelling strategy to grow awareness and bring new guests into the brand.\nI'd like to spend a moment on the success and growth within our international business. We experienced strength across all of our international markets in Q4, and we expect business to remain robust in 2024.\nInternational, which includes our China Mainland and Rest of World segments, continues to be underpenetrated and represents only 21% of our business. We operate a total of 273 stores in all of our international markets combined, which clearly speaks to the opportunity we have ahead of us.\nIn 2024, we'll open approximately 30 stores outside of North America, and we will continue with our strategies to increase our brand awareness. And while not part of the Power of Three x2 growth plan, over the long term, we expect international to represent approximately half of our overall revenue.\nAs you can see, we have many reasons to be optimistic about the future. We entered 2024 from a position of strength. We exceeded our Power of Three x2 revenue target in 2023. And based upon our guidance, we will remain ahead of schedule in 2024.\nWe are excited that our strategies to build brand awareness are working. Over the past year through our strategic investments in brand campaigns and community activations, we have successfully grown our unaided awareness in key markets. The U.S. went from 25% to 31%, and China went from 9% to 14%.\nWe will continue these strategies in 2024. And we will continue to strategically invest across all markets, including the U.S., which will set us up well for this year and beyond.\nGiven we are in the early innings of our growth with low unaided awareness and significant market share potential, all of us on the lululemon leadership team are tremendously excited for what lies ahead for our brand. We are investing for growth with a pipeline of innovation that is full. We are playing offense while many others in our sector are not. And these advantages will further enhance our standing in the marketplace in the U.S. and around the globe.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of our financials and our 2024 guidance.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Calvin. We closed out 2023 on a strong note with our Q4 results exceeding the updated guidance we provided in mid-January. As Calvin mentioned, we've seen a slower start to Q1 in the U.S., while we continue to see strength in all other regions. While we navigate the consumer environment in the U.S., we see several opportunities to maximize our performance.\nOur teams are focused on executing against our strategies and delivering for our guests throughout 2024. As we have always done, we continue to plan for multiple scenarios. We are positioning ourselves to both maximize our performance in the short and long term and manage our business to protect against downside.\nBefore sharing the details of our Q4 performance and our guidance outlook, let me provide an update on our segment reporting. With the evolution of our business, the meaningful opportunity we have in our international regions and our omnichannel operating model, we've changed our reporting segments from channel to geography.\nIn our 2023 10-K, you will see our new segments, which are Americas, China Mainland and Rest of World. In the earnings release and on today's call, we will still provide comparable sales metrics by channel. So you'll have the data to [indiscernible] your models for 2023. However, going forward, we'll be reporting revenue metrics and profit on a regional basis.\nLet me now share the details of our Q4 performance. For Q4, total net revenue rose 16% to $3.2 billion, and comparable sales increased 12%. Within our regions, results were as follows: Americas revenue increased 9% with comparable sales increasing 7%. China Mainland revenue increased 78% with comparable sales increasing 60%. And in our Rest of World segment, revenue grew by 36% with comparable sales increasing by 31%.\nIn our store channel, total sales increased 15% with comparable store sales increasing 6%. We ended the quarter with a total of 711 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 15% versus last year driven by the addition of 56 net new lululemon stores since Q4 of 2022. During the quarter, we opened 25 net new stores and completed 15 optimizations.\nIn our digital channel, revenues increased 17% and contributed $1.7 billion of top line or 52% of total revenue. By category, women's revenue increased by 13% versus last year. Men's increased by 15%, and accessories grew 40%.\nWe also experienced ongoing strength in traffic across channels with stores and e-commerce both increasing by approximately 20%. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion or 59.4% of net revenue compared to the adjusted rate of 57.4% of net revenue in Q4 2022. Our adjusted gross margin increased 200 basis points relative to last year and was driven primarily by the following: a 210 basis point increase in overall product margin driven primarily by lower air and ocean freight costs as well as lower airfreight usage, offset slightly by 10 basis points of deleverage on foreign exchange. Markdowns in Q4 were relatively flat with last year.\nGross margin was favorable to our updated guidance of 120 to 130 basis points driven predominantly by 40 basis points of leverage on fixed costs, 20 basis points of favorability of product margin driven mostly by lower freight costs and 10 basis points of favorability in FX.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $990 million or 30.9% of net revenue compared to 29% of net revenue for the same period last year. The deleverage in SG&A was driven by our continued strategic investments in brand building, technology and foundational infrastructure in addition to increased depreciation and amortization related to investments made in 2022 and 2023. This was partially offset by savings related to the evolution of our lululemon studio business model.\nForeign exchange contributed 40 basis points to the deleverage in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was $914 million or 28.5% of net revenue compared to an adjusted operating margin of 28.3% in Q4 2022.\nTax expense for the quarter was $262 million or 28.1% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.7% a year ago. The decrease relative to last year is due primarily to an increase in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and some favorable adjustments upon the filing of income tax returns. This was partially offset by an increase in accrued withholding tax on earnings in Canada.\nNet income for the quarter was $669 million or $5.29 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.40 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were approximately $207 million for the quarter, flat with Q4 last year. Q4 spend relates primarily to investments that support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $2.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of Q4 was $1.3 billion. We are pleased with our inventory levels, which declined 9% versus last year. Relative to our expectations, higher revenue and foreign exchange contributed to the decrease. On a unit basis, inventory increased approximately 1%.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 120,000 shares at an average price of $450. In the full year 2023, we repurchased approximately $550 million of stock at an average price of approximately $375. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $1.2 billion of capacity remaining on our share repurchase authorization.\nLet me now shift to our guidance outlook. As I said at the start of my remarks, we're being disciplined and agile with our planning for 2024. Our teams are focused on maximizing our performance in the current environment and delivering for our guests this year and beyond.\nWe remain committed to our Power of Three x2 growth plan. Beginning with the full year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion. This range represents growth of 11% to 12% relative to 2023. Excluding the 53rd week that we have in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to grow 10% to 11%.\nWe expect to open 35 to 40 net new company-operated stores in 2024 and complete approximately 40 colocated optimizations. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low double digits. Our new store openings in 2024 will include 5 to 10 stores in the Americas with the rest in our international markets, primarily in China Mainland.\nFor the full year, we forecast gross margin to be approximately flat with adjusted gross margin in 2023. Within gross margin, we expect both markdowns and airfreight to be relatively flat with last year.\nTurning now to SG&A for the full year. We forecast leverage of approximately 10 basis points versus 2023. We are prudently managing our expenses while continuing to invest strategically into our Power of Three x2 road map, including investments in marketing and brand building aimed at increasing our awareness and acquiring new guests, investments to support our international growth and market expansion and continued investment in technology infrastructure and data analytics capabilities.\nWhen looking at operating margin for the full year of 2024, we expect it to increase by approximately 10 basis points versus adjusted operating margin in 2023, which expanded 110 basis points versus 2022. To date, in our Power of Three x2 plan, we are tracking above our operating margin target of modest expansion annually.\nFor the full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%, an increase over the 2023 adjusted effective tax rate of 28.7%. The increase relative to last year relates primarily to lower stock-based compensation deductions and the favorable adjustments we realized when filing our tax returns in 2023. For Q1, we expect our effective tax rate to be 29% to 29.5%.\nFor the fiscal year 2024, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $14 to $14.20 versus adjusted EPS of $12.77 in 2023. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases.\nWhen looking at inventory, we expect dollar inventory to decline in the high single to low double-digit percent in the first half of the year and then increase in the second half of the year as we anniversary last year's declines.\nWe expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2024. This spend relates to investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nShifting now to Q1. We expect revenue in the range of $2.175 billion to $2.2 billion, representing growth of 9% to 10%. We expect to open one net new company operated store in Q1. We expect gross margin in Q1 to be approximately flat with Q1 2023 with markdowns relatively flat with last year.\nIn Q1, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 130 to 140 basis points relative to Q1 2023. This will be driven predominantly by increased investments to grow brand awareness and acquire new guests and higher depreciation resulting from technology investments made in 2022 and 2023.\nLet me share some additional details on our investments to grow brand awareness. Within Q1, we will be activating 3 relatively large brand events: our footwear launch and Further ultra marathon, which already took place and our Team Canada kit launch later in the quarter. These events plus some other strategic investments in brand building are contributing to the deleverage.\nLooking at quarters 2 through 4, we do not anticipate SG&A deleverage. And as I previously stated, we expect 10 basis points of SG&A leverage for the full year.\nWhen looking at operating margin for Q1, we expect it to decline 130 to 140 basis points year-over-year driven by our SG&A investments. I'd also note that operating margin in Q1 2023 expanded by 400 basis points driven predominantly by airfreight savings.\nIn addition, we did not start accelerating our investments into our strategic road map until the second quarter of last year. And as I stated previously, we expect operating margin to expand modestly for the full year on top of the 110 basis points of operating margin expansion in 2023.\nTurning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.40 versus EPS of $2.28 a year ago.\nAnd with that, I will turn it back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan. In summary, I'm proud of how we closed out 2023 and the way in which we have continued to expand around the world, deliver against our Power of Three x2 strategies and create momentum in the business. I'm optimistic that the investments we're making in the business will contribute to another year of growth in 2024.\nIn closing, I want to thank the members of our global collective, particularly our employees in our stores, distribution and guest education centers as well as our store support centers, who engage with our guests every day and bring our brand to life. They are responsible for driving these results, and they will be the engine that will fuel all we will accomplish going forward.\nWe will now take your questions."

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Lululemon Athletica Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Brett Tubin\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nAny forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable source sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.\nBefore we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the third quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour, so please limit yourself to 1 question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I'd like to welcome everyone to the call today, and I'm happy to discuss our quarter 3 results. On today's call, I'll share some highlights regarding our performance over the Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the holiday season. Next, I'll speak to our quarter 3 results, then you'll hear from Meghan with a review of the financials and an update on guidance, and finally, we'll take your questions. So let's get started with Thanksgiving. We are very pleased with our results over the holiday weekend. In fact, this Black Friday was the single biggest day in company history, with strength across our store and e-commerce channels.\nAlong with several members of the leadership team, I visited stores in Houston, Dallas and Los Angeles, and we were thrilled to join our local teams and experience their energy and excitement firsthand. Our stores were very busy, and our overall performance is driven by strength across both full price and markdown merchandise. This year, we extended an additional benefit to our Essentials members who received early access to our Black Friday styles via our Shop app. This strategy drove a significant spike in app downloads with virtually no incremental marketing costs.\nWe also visited several recently remodeled locations that show the benefits of our ongoing co-located optimization strategy, including enhanced merchandising of men's, increased traffic flow and improved throughput due to additional guest services and fitting rooms. Finally, our overall success was enabled by the ongoing foundational investments we've been making to our DC network and IT infrastructure to enhance the guest experience, both in stores and online.\nAnd while there is nearly 2/3 of the quarter still ahead of us, we are encouraged by our trends at the start of the holiday season. Now looking back at quarter 3. As you saw from our press release, our results remain strong and balanced as both our top and bottom line exceeded our expectations. Revenue increased 19% versus last year, comparable sales grew 9% in stores and 19% in our e-commerce business and adjusted EPS increased 27% versus the same period last year, and our Board recently authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which reflects our optimism in the growth trajectory of the business. Meghan will share the detailed financials later in the call, and I think it's clear our performance continues to speak to the strong response to the lululemon brand in our markets across the globe and how we remain in the early innings of our growth story.\nNow let's look at quarter 3 in more detail as I share highlights in 3 areas: product innovation, brand building strategies and regional performance. Let's begin with product. One of our competitive advantages is our ability to consistently bring newness and innovation into our assortment. Our product teams work with our athletes and ambassadors leverage our Science of field innovation platform and solve for the unmet needs of our guests. Quarter 3 was no exception as we introduced several new styles into our assortment. Let me highlight just a few.\nIn quarter 3, our women's business increased 19%, fueled by new product launches, strength in bottoms and ongoing performance in key franchises. As we shared on our last earnings call, we mentioned the launch of a new franchise for women. In quarter 3, we introduced Wundermost, our new collection of bodywear made in our softest fabric ever. By leveraging our expertise in raw materials development, fabric innovation and technical construction, our product teams engineered a brand-new sensation and unique [ sale ] for our guests. I'm pleased to share that Wundermost launch has been met with great initial response from our guests and we're excited to keep bringing innovation into this new franchise.\nOther quarter 3 product highlights on the women's side include bottoms and second layers. Within bottoms, both tights and away from body styles performed well, including Align, Wunder Train and the Dance Studio Jogger. In addition, we continue to see success in our key second layer franchises, including Define, scuba and SoftStream. Looking at quarter 4, you will see fresh seasonal takes on several of our guest favorite franchises, including Scuba, Align and Wunder train. Shifting now to Men's, we saw growth of 15% in quarter 3. Similar to during the COVID-19 period, we see that when there is some uncertainty in the macro environment, men can become a bit more conservative in their apparel purchases. However, growth in our international regions remains very strong.\nAnd in North America, our market share gains continue, and we know our guests respond well to product innovation and compelling marketing campaigns. In quarter 3, we launched 2 new men's franchises, steady State and Soft Jersey. These collections build out our lounge offering and continue to bring versatility across our men's assortment. Guest response has been very strong, and we are chasing into additional inventory for these 2 new hit franchises. Following the holidays, our stores and e-commerce sites will have a back to gym focus, for men will feature items from our Pace Breaker and License to Train franchises to support our guests as they live into their New Year fitness and well-being resolutions.\nWe're also gearing up to launch men's footwear in the first quarter of 2024, which will be an important moment for lululemon. We'll have much more to share as our pipeline of innovation continues to generate newness and versatility for our male guests. When looking at men's brand awareness, it remains low, approximately 13% in the U.S., 12% in Australia and single digits everywhere else outside of North America. Building awareness and consideration remains top of mind for us, and we see ample opportunity to increase the media and brand building commitment to the men's business. An example of this strategy is our recent targeted TV campaign. In quarter 3, we tested TV in the U.S. with a campaign focused on bringing new male guests into the brand and featuring our iconic ABC bottoms. We are encouraged by the early results and the buzz created by this targeted investment, and we plan to continue the campaign next year.\nIn 2024, our marketing calendar has other men's moments planned, such as the footwear launch, and we will continue to leverage ways that paid media can raise our awareness among men who have yet to wear lululemon. I would also like to mention our accessories business, which continues to perform well. In quarter 3, our bag assortment grew in the strong double digits, and the Everywhere Belt Bag posted solid growth on top of last year's standout performance. I remain excited with our pipeline of innovation for the remainder of quarter 4 and into next year.\nOur foundational principle remains, when you feel your best, you perform your best. Our teams continue to live into that principle for our technical gear, and we are also leveraging it as we expand our lounge and on-the-move offerings. I'd now like to spend a few minutes and share some of the ways we connect with our local communities in quarter 3. As we've discussed in the past, we continue to lean into our grassroots approach to building community and engaging with guests on a local and one-on-one basis. In addition, we recognized the opportunity to raise unaided awareness and attract new guests through larger scale activations and brand campaigns, both within North America and across our international markets.\nLet me share a few examples. To bring attention to World Mental Health Day, we released our third annual global well-being report in September. This global survey conducted in 14 markets looks at how people around the world are approaching their physical, mental and social well-being. And while a majority of people say they are making well being a priority, if you feel it is where it should be. To support our guests we created well-being focused experiences in key markets and a highlight was a one-of-a-kind activation in China that encompass 32 cities and 76 stores.\nThe pinnacle expression took place in Shanghai as we took over the West Bund for an entire week with events and experiences over a 3-kilometer stretch of this popular destination on the waterfront. The results of this activation were phenomenal and included more than 1,600 pieces of press coverage with 3 billion impressions, significant engagement on social media and approximately 12,000 guests participating in person. This event was a very unique and compelling way to drive unaided brand awareness in the market.\nAlso in October to support and help launch our new partnership with Peloton, we hosted a 3-day experience at our Lincoln Park store in Chicago. More than 2,000 guests joined us and it was exciting to see our local lululemon community come together with the Peloton community to celebrate our new relationship. The success of this event represents the potential of the partnership to leverage the strength of both our highly engaged communities. As you can see, we are taking multiple paths to building brand awareness and consideration across our global markets.\nQuarter 3 was a terrific example of this strategy, and you can expect more of this type of marketing execution from us going forward. Shifting now to our regional performance. We continue to see solid results across markets with revenue in North America growing 12% and international increasing 49%. We remain pleased with our business in North America, which is in line with our Power of Three x2 targets despite the dynamic operating environment. The quarter began strong as guests responded well to our back-to-school product innovations and our strategies to connect with younger guests through dedicated digital marketing and targeted activations and our market share gains continued.\nIn quarter 3, 2023, the adult active apparel industry decreased its U.S. revenue compared to the same period last year. Over the same time period, lululemon gained 1.5 points of market share in the U.S. with gains in both men's and women's according to Circana's consumer tracking service. North America remains a significant and compelling opportunity for lululemon with unaided awareness of only 25%, we have several ways to bring new guests into the brand, including ongoing innovation within our product assortment, new store openings and optimizations and our unique approach toward connection encompassing both local activation and larger-scale marketing campaigns.\nSwitching now to international. We remain excited and optimistic regarding the potential for the lululemon brand. In quarter 3, all regions grew in strong double digits, including a 53% increase in Greater China. While we are keeping a close eye on the macro environment in China, our business remains strong. We believe several factors benefit us in this important market, including our relatively small size with room to grow beyond our 114 stores in Mainland China at the end of the quarter, the localized nature of our brand as we leverage our relationships with local fitness studios, instructors and influencers and our local and community-based events.\nWe are excited with the brand acceptance we're seeing globally as we continue to execute against our plan to quadruple our international business from 2021 levels by the end of 2026. And with that, I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of our financials and our updated guidance.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Calvin. We continue to be pleased with our performance across channel, geography and merchandise category. Despite an uncertain macro backdrop, our teams are executing at a high level, which contributed to our upside in Q3. As Calvin mentioned, we're happy with our start to the holiday season, but with nearly 2/3 of the quarter still in front of us, we remain prudent in our planning. Let me now share the details of our Q3 performance.\nPlease note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q3 2023 with Q3 2022, adjusted earnings per share for Q3 2023 excludes $72.1 million of after-tax expense related to the impairment and restructuring costs associated with the lululemon Studio business. I'll provide more detail on these charges shortly, and you can refer to our earnings release and Form 10-Q for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics. For Q3, total net revenue rose 19% to $2.2 billion. Comparable sales increased 14% with a 9% increase in stores and a 19% increase in digital. In our store channel, sales increased 19%. We ended the quarter with a total of 686 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 17% versus last year, driven by the addition of 63 net new lululemon stores since Q3 of 2022.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 14 net new stores and completed 8 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues totaled $908.1 million or 41% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 12% versus last year. Within International, we saw a 49% increase versus last year with Greater China increasing 53%. By category, women's revenue increased 19% versus last year, men's increased 15% and accessories grew 29%. It's also great to see ongoing strength in traffic across channels, with stores up nearly 25% and e-commerce increasing 20%. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.\nAdjusted gross profit for the third quarter was $1.28 billion, or 58.1% of net revenue compared to 55.9% of net revenue in Q3 2022. The adjusted gross profit rate in Q3 increased 220 basis points versus last year and was driven primarily by the following: a 250 basis point increase in overall product margin driven primarily by lower freight costs as well as lower air freight usage. Fixed costs deleveraged 20 basis points in the quarter. We also saw 10 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be granted and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $843 million or 38.2% of net revenue compared to 36.8% of net revenue for the same period last year. We achieved better-than-expected deleverage in the quarter, while at the same time continuing to invest behind our strategic initiatives to build brand awareness among additional investments we've accelerated to fuel our Power of Three x2 road map.\nForeign exchange, both translation and revaluation, contributed 30 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $436 million or 19.8% of net revenue, an increase of 80 basis points compared to Q3 2022. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $125.3 million or 28.1% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 27.6% a year ago. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $320.8 million or $2.53 per diluted share compared to $2 for the third quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were approximately $163 million for the quarter compared to approximately $176 million for the third quarter last year. The spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology and supply chain investments.\nBefore turning to our balance sheet highlights, let me spend a moment on the charges we took related to the lululemon Studio business. As you know, in September, we announced a new 5-year partnership with Peloton. Under this arrangement, Peloton has become the exclusive digital fitness content provider for lululemon Studio, and we have become Peloton's primary apparel provider. In addition, while we will still provide service and support to owners of the lululemon Studio Mirror Device, we've recently stopped selling the hardware. As we will no longer be producing content or selling Mirror hardware, we recognized a post-tax asset impairment and other charges related to lululemon Studio, totaling $72.1 million during the third quarter.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory was $1.66 billion at the end of Q3, down 4% versus last year and lower than our guidance. The lower inventory relative to our guidance relates predominantly to higher revenue. The provision we took against our remaining lululemon Studio hardware inventory, timing of certain receipts and foreign exchange. On a unit basis, inventory increased approximately 5%.\nWe remain comfortable with both the quality and quantity of our inventory. At the end of Q4, we expect inventory on a dollar basis to be flat to down slightly versus last year, with units flat to up slightly. We repurchased approximately [ 553,000 ] shares at an average price of [ $381 ]. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $243 million remaining on our prior repurchase program. In addition, as Calvin mentioned, our Board of Directors recently authorized a new $1 billion plan. We remain optimistic in our outlook for the business and continue to use share repurchases as our preferred method to return cash to shareholders.\nOver the last 5 years, we have repurchased approximately $2 billion worth of our shares. Let me shift now to our guidance outlook. As I mentioned, we're pleased with the trends we've seen at the start of the holiday season. That being said, the majority of the quarter remains in front of us. We remain aware of the uncertainties in the macro environment, and we continue to plan the business for multiple scenarios. So let me begin with Q4. We expect revenue in the range of $3.135 billion to $3.170 billion, representing growth of 13% to 14%. We expect to open approximately 25 net new company-operated stores in Q4. We expect gross margin in Q4 to increase 90 to 120 basis points relative to Q4 of 2022. This will be driven by lower freight expense and regional mix, offset somewhat by strategic investments to support future growth, including supply chain distribution centers and product teams as well as modest deleverage on occupancy and depreciation.\nIn Q4, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 160 to 190 basis points relative to Q4 2022. This deleverage continues to reflect our strategic decision to invest in growth initiatives, including those to grow brand awareness globally. When looking at operating margin for Q4, we expect approximately 70 basis points of contraction relative to last year. Turning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $4.85 to $4.93 versus adjusted EPS of $4.40 a year ago. Shifting to full year 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $9.549 billion to $9.584 billion. This range represents growth of 18% relative to 2022 and exceeds the revenue target in our Power of Three x2 growth plan. We expect to open approximately 55 net new company-operated stores in 2023 and complete approximately 25 to 30 co-located remodels.\nThis will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low to mid-teens. Our new store openings in 2023 will include approximately 35 stores in our international markets, with the majority of these planned for China. For the full year, we continue to forecast adjusted gross margin to increase between 190 to 210 basis points versus 2022. The expansion relative to last year is driven predominantly by lower air freight expense. For the full year, we now expect airfreight to be down approximately 220 basis points versus 2022. When looking at markdowns for the full year, we continue to expect them to be relatively in line with last year in 2019.\nTurning to SG&A for the full year. We now forecast deleverage of 120 to 140 basis points versus 2022. While we continue to plan the business prudently, our sales trend has enabled us to invest into our Power of Three x2 growth pillars while also delivering operating margin ahead of our goal for modest expansion annually. When looking at adjusted operating margin for the full year 2023, we now expect it to increase approximately 70 basis points versus last year. For the full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 29.5%.\nFor Q4, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For the fiscal year 2023, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $12.34 to $12.42 versus adjusted EPS of $10.07 in 2022. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2023. The increase versus 2022 reflects investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Our range of $670 million to $690 million is approximately 7% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of [ 7% to 9% ]. With that, I will turn it back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan. As you can see, lululemon had another strong quarter, and we are energized about the many opportunities ahead. We are pleased with the strength and resilience of our brand across markets, channels and categories, and are well positioned to deliver against our Power of Three x2 growth strategy. In addition, we are happy with the start to the holiday season, and our teams are ready to deliver for our guests in quarter 4. And I want to mention that as we have demonstrated over recent years, we are actively planning the business so that we respond to any changes in guest behavior that could occur related to the dynamic macro environment.\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our people across the lululemon who make these consistently strong results possible as we deliver for our guests and build towards the future. With that, we can now take your questions. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for Lululemon Athletica. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Brett Tubin\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Lululemon's second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO. Before we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of Lululemon's future.\nThese statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nAny forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release.\nIn addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.\nBefore we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the second quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions]\nAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I'm pleased to be here with everyone to discuss our quarter 2 results. Today, I'll share the highlights of our recent performance and speak to some of the exciting product launches and activations we have planned for the second half of the year. As you've read in our press release, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as our core product and new launches continue to resonate strongly with guests in markets around the world. On today's call, I will provide details on our quarter 2 performance, I'll then speak to our outlook and the many opportunities we have across the business.\nNext, I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of the financials and the guidance update, and then we'll take your questions. So let's get started. Our business remained strong in quarter 2 with both revenue and EPS exceeding our expectations. Revenue increased 18% versus last year with strength across our portfolio. Comparable sales grew 9% in stores and 17% in our e-commerce business and adjusted EPS increased 22% versus the same period last year.\nThese results demonstrate the strength of the business and how we are well positioned for the second half of 2023. In fact, we are seeing our strong momentum continue into quarter 3 and expect revenue growth in the 17% to 18% range for the quarter. Meghan will share our detailed guidance with you later in the call.\nLet's now look at quarter 2 in more detail as I share some highlights on product innovation, brand building strategies and regional performance. When looking at product, we posted strong double-digit growth across women's, men's and accessories as we bring newness and innovation into our assortment. Specifically in quarter 2, women's increased 16%, men's was up 15% and accessories increased 44%. In women's, guests are responding very well to our core franchises as well as our newer play activities.\nWe continue to see strength in our key franchises, including Scuba, Define and our [ Dense ] Studio jogger. In addition, Softstreme has emerged as another meaningful franchise for us. In quarter 2, we saw strength across the collection with guests responding well to our offering. Turning to play, our tennis and golf collections remain strong performers for us. As we've shared before, our strategy with plays to solve for our guests' unmet needs across their secondary sweat activities. We introduced styles designed specifically for these activities while continuing to leverage the versatility of our core assortment.\nIn men's, I'd like to highlight the ongoing strength we're seeing in our ABC franchise, 1 of our most popular for him. Our teams continue to expand and evolve the assortment, which now includes [ 4 ] styles and [ 4 ] fits and is available in 3 proprietary fabrics, Workstreme, Utilitech and WovenAir with additional fabrics in solves for unmet needs planned for upcoming seasons.\nAs we expand this trusted franchise, we are gaining share of wallet from existing guests, while at the same time, attracting new guests to our brand. In accessories, our entire bag assortment is performing well. Crossbody styles, backpacks and small pouches are helping drive these results and contributed to the 44% growth in accessories in quarter 2. Our teams will continue to create innovative solutions over the coming months and seasons as we realize the meaningful opportunity to expand our bag assortment.\nLooking specifically at the Everywhere Belt Bag, I am pleased we generated strong double-digit growth on top of last year's strength. Consistent with our strategy to develop franchises from our most popular styles, our accessories team expanded our assortment of Everywhere Belt Bags across multiple sizes, color waves, prints and patterns and the guests are responding incredibly well.\nTurning to footwear. We are making steady progress in this category, and I'm excited with how our team continues to evolve the offering. We recently introduced Charge Chargefeel 2, an update to our most versatile run to train style, and we are gearing up for the launch of men's footwear next year. Looking now at the second half of the year, I am pleased with our pipeline of innovation. In women's, we will launch an exciting new collection in the fall, which will show our continued ability to address the unmet needs of our guests. Stay tuned for additional details.\nOn the men's side, recently in quarter 3, we launched 2 new franchises, the steady state and our Soft Jersey collection, both of which are exceeding our expectations. Steady state is constructed from the same fabric used in our Scuba franchise, and is a great example of how we can leverage our technical fabrics across genders. Our soft Jersey collection includes several styles, all in our Jersey fabric, which provides guests with incredible softness in his quick drying, stretchy and sweat wicking.\nThese collections enhance our men's lounge offering and are consistent with how we view our overall on-the-move assortment. These products are designed for lounge but made from technical fabric and offer performance features. Later in quarter 3, we will expand our outerwear offering with new styles of vests, jackets and waterproof down. And in quarter 4, we will launch a new performance fabric design specifically for cold weather runs. These are just a few examples of how we consistently bring innovation into our core while at the same time, expand into new categories. We are still in the early innings of our product journey and have significant opportunity ahead of us as we continue to solve for the unmet needs of our guests.\nWhile product innovation is a key tenet of our Power of Three x2 growth plan, we also have a real opportunity to increase our brand awareness. As we previously discussed, our unaided brand awareness is still only 25% in the United States. And with the exception of the U.K. and Australia, our unaided awareness remains in the single digits in every market in which we operate outside of North America.\nIn 2023, we have accelerated our efforts to increase awareness and consideration for Lululemon, and we are seeing gains in key growth markets across the globe. Last quarter, we spoke about several initiatives, including the initial phases of our Get Intuit campaign, our [ Dupe ] Swap event in Los Angeles and the launch of the further initiative. In quarter 3, we have several activations and campaigns on deck that will support our key product launches, begin to build excitement for the upcoming holiday season and increase overall awareness of the Lululemon brand across the globe.\nLet me share some highlights. Given the positive reception to our Get Intuit campaign, we'll continue to highlight our leadership position in bottoms with another installment in quarter 3. For women, the campaign will focus on our core franchises and feature our global ambassador and professional tennis player, Leylah Fernandez.\nAnd for men, will elevate our ABC franchise with the support from some fun and exciting special guests. The campaign will include digital media assets across our stores and e-commerce sites as well will also test some targeted television in the U.S. In EMEA, we will build on our soft launch with Zalando in June with a larger consumer-facing launch on this popular e-commerce site. Our relationship with Zalando is not wholesale as we fulfill orders ourselves, and it is an excellent way for us to bring new guests into the Lululemon brand across Europe, where Zalando is a strong and leading player.\nAnd finally, we'll release our global well-being index in the coming weeks to raise awareness and celebrate World Mental Health Day in October. We are excited about the ongoing opportunity to grow brand awareness in the U.S. and across all our international markets. Our grassroots approach to building community and engaging with guests remains unchanged, but we are also increasing the number and frequency of larger scale activations and global brand campaigns. And we are doing this within the confines of our P&L and keeping overall marketing spend relatively stable as a percentage to sales on an annual basis.\nIn addition, the continued acceleration in our top line unlocks dollars that we are then able to strategically invest behind our initiatives to drive brand awareness, leveraging both earned and paid media in new and creative ways. Shifting now to our regional growth drivers. We continue to see broad-based strength. Specifically, revenue in North America grew 11% in quarter 2 and international increased 52%.\nWithin International, we delivered strong growth across all markets and continue to see great acceptance of our brand in Greater China, where revenue grew 61%. Within North America, we remain pleased with the underlying strength of the business with double-digit growth in quarter 2, consistent with our Power of Three x2 target, and we continue to gain market share. In quarter 2, the adult active apparel industry decreased its U.S. revenue compared to the same period last year. Over this time period, Lululemon gained 1.3 points of market share in the U.S. with gains in both men's and women's according to Circana's consumer tracking service. In the back half of 2023, as I mentioned, we have a compelling pipeline of innovation planned. We will continue to focus on acquiring new guests as we solve for their unmet needs. And thus far in quarter 3, I can also share that we are seeing our business in North America accelerate relative to quarter 2.\nTurning to international. Our business remains strong and balanced across regions. In quarter 2, total International represented 22% of sales versus 17% in quarter 2 last year. And while expanding nicely, this penetration still remains below our long-term target, which reinforces just how early we are in our growth journey. Let me now share some recent regional highlights.\nIn China, we celebrated the National Fitness Day in August with the third installment of our summer sweat games. Through this activation, our local teams hosted regional competitions across the country which culminated in a national final held this past weekend in Shenzhen. This year, the games included 3,400 participants from more than 100 stores in 36 cities. Our APAC and EMEA region also continued to perform well.\nIn Australia, we are beginning to reap the benefits of our store optimization program as well as the recent rollout of ship from store in this market. This is our most mature market outside of North America, and we still have ample opportunity to drive growth this year and into the foreseeable future.\nWe also opened our first store in Thailand in July, which marked the 100th location in the APAC region. The pent-up demand for the Lululemon brand in this market was clear and the opening of the store in Bangkok was our strongest ever in the APAC region. In addition, we've seen a noticeable uptick in travel and tourism within APAC, which is also having a positive impact on our business.\nAnd in EMEA, in August, we opened our second store in Amsterdam, which reflects our expanding community and our ongoing investment in this key European city to grow the Lululemon brand. It's incredibly exciting for all of us at Lululemon to see the strong acceptance of our brand across all markets within our international business. With each new store opening, we see a groundswell of support that welcomes element into the community. Our runway for growth is substantial, and I am optimistic about the future as we continue to expand our business.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of our financials and our updated guidance.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Kelvin. Our momentum remains strong in Q2, enabling us to exceed both our top and bottom line guidance. In addition, our inventory growth continued to moderate about 14% versus our guidance of approximately 20%, and it remains well positioned from both a level and composition standpoint. I'm also excited to see our sales strength continuing into Q3 as guests are responding well to our back-to-school and early fall product innovations.\nNow let's dive into our Q2 financials. For Q2, total net revenue rose 18% to $2.2 billion, driven by broad-based strength across the business. Comparable sales increased [ 13 ]% with a 9% increase in stores and a 17% increase in e-commerce. In our store channel, total sales increased 21% versus last year. We ended the quarter with a total of 672 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 19% versus last year, driven by the addition of 72 net new Lululemon stores since Q2 of 2022.\nDuring the quarter, we opened 10 net new stores and completed 4 optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues totaled $894 million or 40% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 11% versus last year. Within International, we saw a 52% increase versus last year with Greater China increasing 61%. And by category, women's revenue increased 16% versus last year, men's increased 15% and accessories grew 44%.\nIt's also great to see ongoing strength in traffic across both channels. In both stores and digital channels, traffic increased over 20%. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests and we as most convenient to them. Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.3 billion or 58.8% of net revenue compared to 56.5% of net revenue in Q2 2022.\nThe gross profit rate in Q2 increased 230 basis points versus last year and was driven primarily by the following: a 330 basis point increase in overall product margin resulting from freight favorability, we remain pleased with the product margin strength we continue to realize on top of the strong gains over the last several years. The combination of product and supply chain costs and occupancy deleveraged 70 basis points in the quarter, driven predominantly by ongoing investment in product development and supply chain. We also saw 30 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $817 million or 37% of net revenue compared to 35.4% of net revenue for the same period last year. We achieved better-than-expected deleverage in the quarter, driven predominantly by our top line strength while continuing to invest behind our strategic initiatives to build brand awareness among additional investments we've accelerated to fuel our Power Of Three x2 road map.\nForeign exchange, both translation and revaluation, contributed 60 basis points of leverage in the quarter. Operating income for the quarter was approximately $479 million or 21.7% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 20.9% of net revenue in Q2 2022.\nTax expense for the quarter was $145 million, or 29.8% of pretax earnings compared to an effective tax rate of 28.2% a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $342 million or $2.68 per diluted share compared to adjusted EPS of $2.20 for the second quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were approximately $146 million for the quarter compared to approximately $145 million in the second quarter last year.\nThe spend in Q2 of this year relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, technology and supply chain costs. Turning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory was $1.7 billion at the end of Q2, up 14% versus last year. At the end of Q3, we expect inventory to be up in the high single to low double digits versus last year.\nThe relatively low growth rate is due to the provision for MIRROR hardware we took in Q4 2022 and have not yet anniversaried. In Q4, we continue to expect inventory growth to be relatively in line with sales growth. We repurchased approximately 517,000 shares at an average price of $371. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $454 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase program.\nLet me shift now to our guidance outlook. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of our business as Q2 exceeded our expectations, and Q3 is off to a solid start. The upside we've seen in the first half of the year allows us to invest into our strategic initiatives to set ourselves up for future growth, while at the same time, flowing some of that upside through to the bottom line.\nWith that being said, we remain aware of the uncertainties that exist in the current macro environment and consistent with our approach over the last several years, we continue to be prudent and plan the business for multiple scenarios. Now let me begin with Q3. We expect revenue in the range of $2.165 billion to $2.19 billion, representing growth of 17% to 18%. We expect to open 23 net new company-operated stores in Q3. We expect gross margin in Q3 to increase 160 to 180 basis points relative to Q3 of 2022. This will be driven by lower freight expense, offset somewhat by strategic investments to support future growth, including supply chain, distribution centers and product teams as well as modest deleverage on occupancy and depreciation.\nIn Q3, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 200 to 220 basis points relative to Q3 2022. This deleverage continues to reflect our strategic decision to invest in growth initiatives including those to grow brand awareness globally. When looking at operating margin for Q3, we expect approximately 40 basis points of contraction relative to last year. Turning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $2.23 to $2.28 versus EPS of $2 a year ago.\nShifting to the full year 2023. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $9.51 billion to $9.57 billion. This range represents growth of 17% to 18% relative to 2022 and exceeds the revenue target in our Power Three x2 growth plan. We now expect to open approximately 55 net new company-operated stores in 2023 and complete approximately 25 colocated remodels. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low teens. Our new store openings in 2023 will include approximately 35 stores in our international markets with the majority of these planned for China.\nFor the full year, we now forecast gross margin to increase between 190 and 210 basis points versus 2022. The expansion relative to last year is driven predominantly by lower air freight expense. For the full year, we now expect airfreight to be down approximately 210 basis points versus 2022.\nWhen looking at markdowns for the full year, we continue to expect them to be relatively in line with last year in 2019. Turning to SG&A for the full year. We continue to forecast deleverage of 150 to 170 basis points versus 2022. While we continue to plan the business prudently, our sales trend has been strong. As I mentioned earlier, this gives us the opportunity to invest into our Power of Three x2 growth pillars while also delivering operating margin this year ahead of our goal for modest expansion annually.\nWhen looking at operating margins for the full year 2023, we now expect it to increase 40 to 60 basis points versus last year. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. For Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30.5%. For the fiscal year 2023, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $12.02 to $12.17 versus adjusted EPS of $10.07 in 2022. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases.\nWe now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $670 million to $690 million for 2023. This increase versus 2022 reflects investments to support business growth, including the continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. Our range of $6.70 to $6.90 [indiscernible] is approximately 7% of revenue in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan. As these results demonstrate, we arrive at the midpoint of 2023 in a very strong position for what's ahead. We continue to deliver sustained growth in the business through a steady drumbeat of product category and market expansions that connects us with our guests on a regular basis. We recognize the significant opportunity in front of us and we remain focused on both delivering a successful 2023 and achieving our goals contained within the Power of Three x2 growth plan.\nMy confidence in our leadership and our people remains extremely high as we consistently demonstrate our ability to deliver for our guests and our shareholders. I'm grateful to the many teams across Lululemon, who champion our brand every day and make these results possible. And now we look forward to taking your questions. Operator?"

The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.\nBefore we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions]\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone, to our call today. I'm happy to be here to discuss quarter 1 and share with you our strong start to 2023, which shows the continued momentum in the business. As you've read in our press release, we delivered top and bottom line results that exceeded our guidance. We continue to engage with guests across the globe and drive our business with new and innovative technical products.\nOn today's call, I'll provide updates on our quarter 1 performance, our community-based model, which is powered by our new membership program. I'll also share highlights on our product performance as well as our international business. And then I'll turn it over to Meghan for a review of our financials and a guidance update. Then we'll take your questions. So lots to share, let's get started.\nIn quarter 1, as I mentioned, the business delivered strength across both the top and bottom line. Revenue increased 24% versus last year, balanced across category, channel and region. Women's was up 22%, men's was up 17%, and accessories was up 67%. Comparable sales grew 16% in stores and 18% in our e-commerce business. And by region, North America grew 17% and international increased 60%.\nWithin international, we saw a meaningful acceleration in the Greater China business with revenue increasing 79%. EPS was strong as well, increasing 54% versus last year to $2.28. This strength was driven by revenue, gross margin and SG&A, all coming in better than our guidance. So a great start to the year, fueled by our product and people.\nFor today, I'd like to devote some time to talk about our community-based model. Not only does our approach allow us to connect uniquely and authentically with our guests, it also drives incrementality of spend and increases LTV as guests engage more with our brand. We are celebrating our 25th anniversary this year, and community has been at the core of our brand since day 1.\nWithin North America, 8 months ago, we embarked on an expansion of our model with our Essentials membership program. Through this free-to-join program, we gained deeper knowledge on how our guests like to sweat and what aspects of our brand are most meaningful to them. We can leverage the data and insights to help develop future activations, invite them to the events that are most relevant to them and inform our product pipeline with opportunities around unmet needs.\nOur stores are an integral part of this ecosystem as they provide connection points within local communities across the world and serve many purposes, including allowing our guests to interact with our educators to learn about our product, the technical innovations that can be found within our assortment and the unmet needs they solve.\nSecondly, our stores act as hubs for our local ambassadors and fitness studios. Guests looking for new ways to sweat in their neighborhood need only enter the local lululemon store where our educators will point them to the best studios in town.\nThirdly, our stores are the focal point for local events that range from hosting run clubs and other sweat sessions to parties and community celebrations.\nAnd finally, our stores provide support for some of our larger-scale activations, such as our 10K runs, product launches, including footwear and our lululemon Studio launch last fall.\nIn quarter 1, we saw a meaningful increase in the number of community events compared to the same period last year. And this brings us back to the pre-pandemic levels. Key celebrations in the quarter included our Align Campus Haul Pass event to increase awareness of our new Align styles with our younger guests; and exclusively for Essential members, we ran 6 events across 3 cities in Houston, Chicago and Boston, which were a great success and hugely oversubscribed.\nMost recently, May has been a big month for activations. We went live with our new lululemon Studio digital app earlier this week. The app, which will help us broaden our TAM, offers guests in the U.S. access to our industry-leading content for only $12.99 per month without needing to purchase hardware.\nWe announced our Further initiative. Further will demonstrate how far women can go when they're supported with resources and product innovations typically reserve for men. This initiative will include a scientific research program which takes a holistic approach to addressing the existing sex and gender data gap in endurance performance, new women's first product innovations, community activations and a giveback component to support young women. In addition, the program will culminate in a multi-day, women's-only ultramarathon starting on the International Women's Day 2024. At its core, this initiative supports lululemon's commitment to innovation, solving for unmet needs and driving brand awareness.\nIn addition, we tapped into dupe culture with our Align Legging Dupe Swap event in L.A. Our team set up a 2-day pop-up at the Century City Mall and ask guests to trade in their dupe leggings for a pair of our iconic Align Leggings. For us, the primary purpose of this event was new guest acquisition and increasing brand awareness for being the original in leggings.\nOverall, it was a resounding success. It generated more than 1 billion earned media impressions and was covered by national and international media outlets in addition to creating viral social media buzz. About 50% of the guests who traded in dupes are new to our brand. Approximately half of the guests who attended, some of whom started waiting in lines as early as 3 a.m., were under 30 years old. And while I won't get into specifics, the leggings that guests traded in ran the gamut in terms of brands and price points.\nWe view our community model as one of our biggest competitive advantages. With connection points across both the physical and digital, our ecosystem powered by membership supports our leadership position in developing and cultivating omni guest relationships. We engage with guests in ways that are more than just transactional by creating deeper connections and more holistic relationships. This in turn builds our brand awareness, drives purchases and contributes to our strong financial performance.\nLet's shift now to our product innovation. Guests responded well to our spring merchandise assortment as we continue to bring compelling innovation across our core and play activities in footwear. In women's, we saw continued strength in many of our key franchises, including SCBA, DEFINE and Align.\nWhen looking specifically at women's bottoms, we saw growth of 22%. While women's bottoms is our most mature category, our teams continue to update and enhance existing styles, bring innovation via new fabric technologies and create new styles and silhouettes that solve for unmet needs. In quarter 1, our strength in women's bottoms was driven by our iconic Dance Studio pants, which has always been a guest favorite and is currently experiencing a resurgence in popularity; the newest additions to our Align franchise, including the Mini Flare and Wide Leg; and are incredibly soft and smooth upstream bottoms.\nIn men's, guests continue to respond well to our iconic ABC, Commission and Pacebreaker franchises. In accessories, I'm thrilled with the strength we continue to see across our assortment. While it is the smallest of our 3 major merchandise categories, it is a growing piece of our business that we fuel with innovation, just as we do across women's and men's. In quarter 1, guests responded well to our collection of bags, backpacks and duffles.\nAnd we continue to bring newness and innovation into our footwear assortment. In quarter 1, we launched an updated and enhanced version of the Blissfeel running shoe. And just last week, we launched the Blissfeel Trail. This shoe was our first road-to-trail running shoe designed to offer traction and durability for guests who love to run on the trails and off the road.\nOur Be Planted initiatives are also driving product innovation in support of our 2030 goal to make 100% of our products with sustainable materials and end-of-use solutions. For Earth Day in April, we debuted our first capsule collection made with plant-based nylon in collaboration with Geno, a leader in the sustainable material space. More recently, we announced a new partnership with Australian and viral tech start-up, Samsara Echo, to scale circularity through textile-to-textile recycling, which is a very cool technology. Together with Samsara, we're working towards recycling our apparel back into new products, bringing us one step closer to our end-to-end vision of circularity. This partnership, along with our other Be Planted initiatives, including Like New and our collaboration with Geno, is the latest example of how we are taking a leadership position in our sector and driving toward a circular ecosystem by 2030.\nTurning now to our product pipeline. Let's take a look at quarter 2. We're continuing to build out our golf and tennis collections with versatile styles that can be worn both on and off the course and court. The second installment of our Get Into It campaign launched 2 weeks ago and featured both technical shorts and new on-the-move styles for both him and her. And for men, we'll be expanding our offering of train tops with new styles using our Dry Sense fabric technology. These are just a few examples of how we continue to bring innovation into all areas of our assortment, solve for the unmet needs of our guests, increase wallet share and grow our brand awareness.\nBefore I turn it over to Meghan to discuss our financials, I'll take a moment to share some geographical highlights with you. As you know, 1 of the 3 key pillars of our Power of Three x2 plan is international. We have a target to quadruple our business outside North America between 2021 and 2026. This will be driven predominantly by our existing markets, but we'll be entering some exciting new markets as well.\nIn 2022, international represented only 16% of our revenue, and I remain optimistic about our runway of global growth. As I stated earlier, our business remained strong in North America and across our international regions. In quarter 1, revenue in North America increased 17%, while we saw a 60% growth in international. In Greater China, we experienced a significant sequential acceleration in the business relative to quarter 4 as the effects of COVID-19 subsided. In total, revenue in Greater China increased 79% in quarter 1, ahead of our expectations and just one more sign of the potential within this market.\nI had a chance to visit Shanghai in mid-April for the first time in 3 years, and it was great to see how much our brand has grown in the city. We walked through the neighborhoods we serve, visited our new stores, and I was impressed by the incredible brand experiences we are bringing to the local community. In addition, spending time with our educators as they engage with guests and bring our culture to life is always one of my favorite parts of being in market.\nIn EMEA, we're off to a great start in Spain, a market that we entered last fall. And with the help of a franchise partner, we recently opened our first store in Tel Aviv with Israel becoming the 24th market globally for lululemon. We know that the Israeli guest has been engaging with our brand while traveling to other regions, and now we'll be able to bring our product innovation and community and guest experiences directly to them in their home market.\nIn APAC, business remains robust as well. And in the coming months, I'm pleased that we will enter Thailand with our first store in Bangkok. Our approach to increasing brand awareness and growing revenue internationally is rooted in the same tenets as what has fueled our success in North America. This includes our multichannel direct-to-consumer model, our community-based approach to brand building, our innovative product assortment and the deep and direct connections we have with our guests. I'm excited for what the future holds for our global business as we continue to execute the Power of Three x2 growth plan.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Calvin. I'm happy to be here today to discuss our recent financial performance and provide you with our outlook for Q2 and our updated guidance for the year.\nIn Q1, sales, gross margin, SG&A, EPS and inventory all came in better than our guidance. Guests responded well to our spring merchandise assortment, we saw sales trends accelerate in Greater China, and we connected with our guests via multiple activations throughout the quarter. 2023 is off to a strong start. And based on our guidance, we continue to see solid momentum in Q2.\nLet me now share the details of our Q1 performance. Total net revenue rose 24% to $2 billion driven by continued strong execution across all parts of the business. Comparable sales increased 17%. In our store channel, comparable store sales increased 16%. We ended the quarter with a total of 662 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 22% versus last year driven by the addition of 83 net new lululemon stores since Q1 of 2022. During the quarter, we opened 7 net new stores and completed 3 optimizations.\nIn our digital channel, comps increased 18% and contributed $835 million of top line or nearly 42% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 17% versus last year. And within international, we saw a 60% increase versus last year with Greater China increasing 79%. And by category, women's revenue increased 22% versus last year, men's increased 17%, and accessories grew 67%.\nIt's also great to see ongoing strength in traffic across both channels. In both stores and digital channels, traffic increased approximately 30%. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.\nGross profit for the first quarter was $1.15 billion or 57.5% of net revenue compared to 53.9% of net revenue in Q1 2022. The gross profit rate in Q1 increased 360 basis points versus last year and was driven primarily by the following: a 430 basis point increase in product margin, resulting predominantly from lower airfreight as well as regional mix. Markdowns were in line with last year. Occupancy and depreciation leveraged 10 basis points in the quarter. These improvements were partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in product and supply chain costs driven by ongoing investment in product development and supply chain. In addition, FX deleveraged by 50 basis points, which was predominantly offset by a 40 basis point FX benefit within SG&A.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $748 million or 37.4% of net revenue compared to 37.7% of net revenue for the same period last year. SG&A came in better than expected due to leverage on higher-than-planned sales and, to a lesser extent, a shift in timing of certain investments.\nOperating income for the quarter was $401 million or 20.1% of net revenue compared to 16.1% of net revenue in Q1 2022. Tax expense for the quarter was $119 million or 29.1% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 27% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to accruing for withholding tax on our unremitted earnings in Canada and a decrease in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation.\nNet income for the quarter increased 54% to $290 million or $2.28 per diluted share compared to $1.48 for the first quarter of 2022. Capital expenditures were $137 million for the quarter compared to $111 million in the first quarter last year. The increase relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and also technology and supply chain investments.\nTurning now to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $951 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 24%, in line with sales growth and was $1.58 billion at the end of Q1.\nWe remain comfortable with our inventories, and we're well positioned to continue to fulfill guest demand. At the end of Q2, we expect inventory growth of approximately 20%. And we continue to expect inventory growth to be relatively in line with sales growth in the second half of 2023.\nWe repurchased approximately 300,000 shares at an average price of $336. At the end of Q1, we had $646 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase program.\nLet me shift now to our guidance outlook. We continue to be mindful of the uncertainties in the macro environment, and as a result, we remain prudent as it relates to planning the business. That being said, we're pleased with the strength we experienced across the business in Q1 and also the start we've seen to Q2. The strength affords us the opportunity to invest in our strategic growth pillars while also delivering on our financial commitments we've laid out in our Power of Three x2 growth plan.\nLet me begin with Q2. We expect revenue in the range of $2.14 billion to $2.17 billion, representing growth of 15% to 16%. We expect to open 9 net new company-operated stores in Q2. We expect gross margin in Q2 to increase 200 to 220 basis points relative to Q2 of 2022. This will be driven by lower airfreight expense, offset somewhat by strategic investments to support future growth, including supply chain, distribution centers and product teams as well as modest deleverage on occupancy and depreciation.\nIn Q2, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 190 to 210 basis points relative to Q2 of 2022. While a portion of this deleverage relates to the timing shift of certain investments, it also reflects our strategic decision to invest more in initiatives to grow brand awareness relative to our initial expectations. These initiatives include top-of-funnel brand building and community activations.\nWhen looking at operating margin for Q2, we expect approximately 10 basis points of expansion, inclusive of our decision to increase investment into certain of our strategic initiatives.\nTurning to EPS. We expect earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.52 versus adjusted EPS of $2.20 a year ago.\nShifting now to the full year 2023. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $9.44 billion to $9.51 billion. This range represents growth of 16% to 17% relative to 2022 and is better than our Power of Three x2 growth plan. We expect to open approximately 50 net new company-operated stores in 2023 and complete approximately 25 co-located remodels. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low teens. Our new store openings in 2023 will include 30 to 35 stores in our international markets with the majority of these being planned for China.\nFor the full year, we now forecast gross margin to increase between 180 to 200 basis points versus 2022. The expansion relative to last year is driven predominantly by lower airfreight expense. For the full year, we now expect airfreight to be down approximately 190 basis points versus 2022.\nWhen looking at markdowns for the full year, we continue to expect them to be relatively in line with last year in 2019.\nTurning to SG&A for the full year. We now forecast deleverage of 150 to 170 basis points versus 2022. While we continue to plan the business prudently, our sales trend has been strong. As I mentioned earlier, this gives us the opportunity to invest behind our Power of Three x2 growth pillars while also delivering operating margin this year ahead of our goal for modest expansion annually.\nWhen looking at operating margin for the full year of 2023, we now expect it to increase by 30 to 50 basis points versus last year. For the full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%, an increase over the 2022 adjusted effective tax rate of 28.1%. This is in line with our longer-term tax rate expectations we provided as part of our Power of Three x2 plan and reflects the increase we expect as a result of accruing for Canadian withholding taxes. For Q2, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%.\nFor the fiscal year 2023, we now expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.74 to $11.94 versus adjusted EPS of $10.07 in 2022. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases.\nWe continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $660 million to $680 million for 2023. The increase versus 2022 reflects investments to support business growth, including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments. A range of $660 million to $680 million is approximately 7% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan. Across lululemon, we are excited about the opportunity ahead of us. We continue to monitor the environment around us, but 2023 is off to a strong start, and we're pleased with our trends as we've entered quarter 2. Given the strength of our product pipeline, our unique approach to building communities, our international growth prospects and our initiatives to grow brand awareness, I'm optimistic that we will continue to deliver on the goal set forth in our Power of Three x2 growth plan.\nAnd in closing, I want to express my deep gratitude to the leaders and teams across lululemon who continue to deliver these results and bring our culture to life. I look forward to taking your questions now. Operator?"

These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour [Operator Instructions]\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I am pleased to be here today to discuss our strong finish to another strong year for lululemon. As you've seen from our press release, our adjusted quarter 4 results came in ahead of our January guidance update, and our adjusted full year results represent a very solid start to our Power of Three x2 growth plan. I'm also excited that we continue to see strength and momentum across the business so far in quarter 1. None of this would have been possible without our lululemon collective, our employees, our vendor partners, our ambassadors and our guests, all of whom are integral to our continued success. I want to express my gratitude on behalf of all of the senior leaders to our incredible teams around the world. Thank you for your ongoing commitment to lululemon. We are ready for all the future holds for our brand in 2023 and beyond.\nOn today's call, I plan to cover several topics: our quarter 4 and full year results; our product pipeline for 2023; an update our membership program; our recent market share gains; and finally, insights across our international business. So let's get started.\nOur momentum continued in quarter 4, with revenue increasing 30% versus last year and 26% on a 3-year CAGR basis. We managed the business very well through an environment that was highly promotional, and our markdowns were only up a modest 40 basis points versus 2019. I am pleased that as we progressed out of the holidays and began to transition to new spring merchandise, regular price sales returned to our normal levels. This speaks to the power of our brand, the appeal of our merchandise assortment and the strength of our operating model. And as you can see from our guidance, business remains good in quarter 1, and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2023.\nOur business continues to be well balanced across product category, channel and region. Revenue increased in quarter 4 on a 3-year CAGR basis as follows. Women's was up 23%. Our men's business was up 26%, and accessories was up 44%. We saw a 10% increase in company-operated stores and our e-commerce grew 46%. And by region, North America grew 24%, and international increased 39%. When looking at adjusted earnings per share, we continue to deliver strong gains as well, with quarter 4 EPS increasing 31% versus last year and 25% on a 3-year CAGR basis.\nI would also like to spend a moment on our full year 2022 results. As you know, we launched our new 5-year Power of Three x2 growth plan last spring. At the highest level, this plan assumes 15% CAGR revenue growth and modest operating margin expansion annually.\nIn 2022, our revenue increased 30% compared to 2021 and 27% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points, while adjusted EPS increased 29% and 27% on a 1- and 3-year CAGR basis, respectively. It is a testament to the strength of our brand that for the full year 2022, we were able to significantly exceed our annual revenue goal and deliver adjusted operating margin in line with our target. And we achieved these results despite the challenging macro backdrop, supply chain issues and the pressure of COVID-19 in China.\nNow let's shift to product innovation. 2022 was a strong year for product newness and innovation. We continue to expand our core categories with the launch of SenseKnit fabric technology and cold weather run styles. We grew our play categories with our golf, tennis and hike capsules, and we entered a new category with the launch of footwear. Looking forward into 2023, I continue to be incredibly excited by the pipeline of innovation developed by our product teams. Several of our ideas this year include franchise growth, category expansions and building upon the success of some recently launched collections.\nFirst, in the coming weeks, we will launch our Get Into It campaign featuring our popular and versatile Align franchise. As you know, Align began with a single style, a legging, which we grew to be our #1 performing bottom. We then expanded the collection to include shorts, tanks and bras. More recently, we added away from body styles, including wide leg and mini flare. We will support this product story with an integrated global marketing campaign.\nWe will also be expanding our Men's franchise, License to Train, into women's later this year, which will complement our accessible Wunder Train franchise. In men's, we continue to innovate within our core activities with new versions of the Metal Vent tee and the Pace Breaker short. Updates to fit, function and aesthetic have modernized these guest favorites.\nAnd in footwear, we recently introduced an updated version of Blissfeel, which incorporates learnings from the initial launch, and it's already receiving the same kind of positive media reviews that we have seen throughout our footwear rollout. In May, we will launch Blissfeel Trail, our first road-to-trail shoe, and this summer, we'll introduce an updated version of Chargefeel. Related to footwear, we are pleased with our performance and guest response. Looking forward, we're excited to continue expanding our offerings for her and also launch our men's lineup in 2024.\nThese are just a few examples of how we solve for the unmet needs of our guests. The versatility of our merchandise assortment is one of the key competitive advantages for lululemon. One thing to add is that we do not drive our top line growth through discounts or promotions, and we have no intentions to do so. We run a full-price business with markdowns strategically used to clear seasonal and other select product, and this will remain our approach in the future.\nNow I would like to update you on membership. We launched our new 2-tier membership program in North America this past October, and throughout the holiday season, we gained many learnings and insights regarding how our guests engage with our brand.\nLet me start with our Essentials program, which is offered to guess at no cost. While we do not intend to release this metric regularly. I wanted to share that the number of sign-ups is significantly exceeding our expectations. In the first 5 months, we have already enrolled more than 9 million members. This demonstrates the significant potential behind this program. While the Essentials tier offers several compelling benefits and access to content, no discounts are involved. The rapid rate of sign-up speaks to the incredible loyalty of our guests, and the early results show our membership program increases the frequency of guests engaging with us. For example, more than 30% of members have already participated in at least one of the benefits of the program, and we expect this engagement to drive retention and incremental purchasing behavior going forward.\nRelated to the lululemon Studio tier of our membership program, we have also gained valuable insights that are informing our next steps. As we mentioned in our press release, we are taking an impairment charge related to assets and goodwill associated with MIRROR. Meghan will share more details with you in a moment.\nAs you know, we tested a paid city-based membership program in North America prior to our acquisition of MIRROR. Through that experience, we saw how guests were eager to engage with us through some of the sweat options we provided to participants. Not only did members enjoy these benefits, but we also saw increased member engagement, new guest acquisition and an increase in member spend. These learnings were the basis for our acquisition in 2020.\nThe recent launch of lululemon Studio has provided a new way to scale a paid membership program. Our best-in-class content helps build on our community of engaged guests, deepens our connection with them and drives incremental purchases of lululemon product. In fact, after studying the behavior of members, our initial analysis suggests that their spend on lululemon product increases approximately 9%, and this 9% is incremental. However, as you know, since our acquisition, the at-home fitness space has been challenging. While members love our content, hardware sales did not match our expectations, and even though our CAC has continued to improve, it has not improved enough to maintain the current level of investment.\nAs we continue to invest prudently in this business, we are evolving the model from being focused on hardware only to offering content through a digital and app-based solution as well. The new more efficient app-based model will launch this summer at a lower monthly subscription rate and when combined with our 9 million and growing Essentials members will allow us to expand our total addressable market for potential members. We view lululemon Studio in the same way we view any innovation. We test. We learn, and we evolve as necessary. Although the acquisition has not fully materialized as originally intended, we're in a much better position in our understanding of the community and our new membership program as a result.\nShifting gears, I want to speak to the strength of the lululemon brand and the gains we are seeing in market share. Let me share a few metrics with you. When looking at transactions, our growth continues to be well balanced across new and existing guests. In quarter 4, we delivered a nearly 30% increase in transactions by new guests and more than 35% increase in transactions by existing guests. For the full year, these results contributed to a mid- to high 20% increase for both metrics.\nNext, I will touch on our recent and continued gain in market share. In fiscal quarter 4, 2022, the adult active apparel industry decreased its U.S. revenue by 5% compared to the same period last year. And over this time period, lululemon gained 2.3 points of market share in the U.S., the most of any brand in this market according to NPD Group's consumer tracking service. This is the highest quarterly market share gain we've achieved since we began tracking these numbers in 2020, and it caps a year in which we grew our market share every quarter. This speaks to our growth in the U.S., a key market within North America. And as we detailed at Analyst Day, we have significant opportunity to grow our brand awareness in North America and markets around the world.\nJust since last April, we have seen increases in awareness in some of our key growth regions. We added 5 points to our unaided awareness in Australia from 19% to 24%, 2 points in China from 7% to 9% and 2 points in the U.K., taking us to 16% in the market. As you can see from these numbers, significantly more consumers in these regions are currently unaware of our brand compared to those who are, which highlights this meaningful opportunity.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our business remained strong in both our North America and international markets. In quarter 4 and full year 2022, revenue in North America increased 29%, while our international business generated 35% growth in quarter 4 and for the full year as well.\nI would like to turn to our results in China where our potential continues to be significant. We have been investing in foundational infrastructure, people in stores that have fueled considerable growth in the market. As the impacts of COVID-19 normalize, we are seeing our momentum accelerate, and we are excited for the opportunities in the region in 2023 and beyond.\nIn quarter 4, revenue in China increased more than 30% versus last year and over 50% on a 3-year CAGR basis. While COVID-19 impacted revenue in December, we had a strong finish to the quarter and have seen momentum accelerate in quarter 1. We have a solid foundation in the region across our brick-and-mortar and digital channels and is supported by exceptional talent on which we continue to build. We recently opened our largest store in Asia Pacific, Kerry Center in Shanghai. It's an incredible expression of our brand, reflecting our commitment to the market, and it now brings our store count in China to nearly 100 locations. It's clear our growth strategies are on track, and we remain early in our journey across our international markets.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Calvin. I'm excited to be here today to discuss our Q4 results. We finished 2022 on a strong note with our adjusted results exceeding the updated guidance we provided in mid-January. This was enabled by an acceleration in our sales trend, along with the normalization of purchasing behavior relative to full price and markdown product.\nLooking at Q1, our business continues to be robust. Our inventory growth will continue to moderate, and we expect to realize significant gross margin expansion driven by lower air freight.\nLet me now share the details of our Q4 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q4 2022 with Q4 2021, adjusted earnings per share for Q4 2022 exclude $3.46 of expense related to impairment charges associated with the MIRROR business. Adjusted earnings per share for Q4 2021 exclude $0.01 of expense related to the acquisition of MIRROR. I will provide more detail on the Q4 2022 impairment charge shortly. And you can refer to our earnings release and Form 10-K for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics.\nFor Q4, total net revenue rose 30% to $2.8 billion. Comparable sales increased 30% with a 17% increase in stores and a 39% increase in digital. On a 3-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 26%. In our store channel, sales increased 26% on a 1-year basis and 10% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Productivity remains above 2019 levels. We ended the quarter with a total of 655 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 21% versus last year, driven by the addition of 81 net new lululemon stores since Q4 of 2021. During the quarter, we opened 32 net new stores and completed 13 optimizations.\nIn our digital channel, revenues increased 46% on a 3-year CAGR basis and contributed $1.4 billion of top line or 52% of total revenue. Within North America, revenues increased 29% versus last year and 24% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Within international, we saw a 35% increase versus last year and 39% on a 3-year CAGR basis.\nAnd by category, men's revenue increased 22% versus last year and 26% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Women's increased 30% versus last year and 23% on a 3-year CAGR basis. And accessories grew 69% and 44% on the same basis.\nIt's also great to see ongoing strength in traffic across both channels. In stores, traffic increased over 30%; and in our digital business, traffic to our e-commerce sites and apps globally increased over 45%. On a 3-year CAGR basis, traffic is up 7% in stores and 40% in e-commerce. This speaks to the strength of our omni-operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.\nAdjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.59 billion or 57.4% of net revenue compared to 58.1% of net revenue in Q4 2021. Adjusted gross margin decreased 70 basis points relative to last year. This was driven primarily by the following factors: 50 basis points of deleverage from foreign exchange within gross margin, which was offset by a 50 basis point FX benefit within SG&A and 50 basis points of deleverage on fixed costs. This was driven primarily by investments in our product teams and DC, offset somewhat by leverage on occupancy and depreciation. These were partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in product margin. This increase was driven primarily by lower air freight expense, partially offset by higher markdowns and merchandise mix.\nWhen looking at markdowns relative to 2019, for Q4, they were up 40 basis points, contributing to markdowns being relatively flat for the full year versus 2019. Adjusted gross margin was favorable to our updated guidance, which was a decline of 90 to 110 basis points due predominantly to favorability and markdowns in air freight in addition to leverage from higher-than-planned sales.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were approximately $803 million or 29% of net revenue compared to 30.2% of net revenue for the same period last year. The leverage in the quarter versus Q4 2021 resulted from leverage in our operating channels and a benefit from FX I mentioned earlier. This was offset somewhat by increased corporate SG&A and a modest increase in depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted operating income for the quarter was approximately $785 million or 28.3% of net revenue compared to 27.8% of net revenue in Q4 2021. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $226.5 million or 28.7% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.4% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to accruing for Canadian withholding taxes on a portion of fiscal 2022 Canadian earnings and some benefit we had last year upon the filing of income tax returns. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $562.5 million or $4.40 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.37 for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nCapital expenditures were approximately $207 million for the quarter compared to approximately $128 million in Q4 of last year. Q4 spend relates primarily to investments that support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nBefore turning to our balance sheet highlights, let me spend a moment on the charges we took related to the MIRROR business. As you know, the overall at-home fitness space remains challenged. MIRROR hardware sales during the holiday season came in below our expectations, therefore, we ran an impairment test at the end of Q4. Based upon this test, we took charges related to the impairment of goodwill and certain long-lived assets and a provision for MIRROR hardware. These charges totaled approximately $443 million, net of tax, or $3.46 per share. The valuations used in the impairment calculation are based on an evaluation of MIRROR on a stand-alone basis.\nWe are pivoting away from the hardware-centric business that we acquired to also focus on a more efficient app-based model. While we see Studio as a key component of our membership strategy, which will help drive incremental revenue, the stand-alone valuation of MIRROR doesn't fully reflect the incremental revenue. Looking forward, we remain excited about our membership program. As Calvin shared, we already have over 9 million members in our Essentials program, and we continue to see opportunity to build our community, increase engagement and drive incremental spend.\nTurning now to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of Q4 was $1.4 billion, modestly under our expectations for 60% growth. This reflects 1 year dollar growth of 50% or 57%, excluding the provision for MIRROR hardware.\nI would also like to note that core seasonless product continues to make up approximately 45% of our inventory. We remain pleased with our inventory levels. In 2023, our inventory growth will continue to moderate, while we maintain our full price selling model, and we remain well positioned to fulfill guest demand. At the end of Q1, on a 1-year dollar basis, we expect inventory to increase approximately 30% to 35% relative to last year. Looking further out, we expect inventory growth to be relatively in line with sales growth in the second half of 2023.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 213,000 shares at an average price of $323. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $744 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase program.\nLet me shift now to our guidance outlook. While we are mindful of the ongoing macro uncertainties and we continue to plan the business prudently, we're excited with our sales trends in Q1 and also the benefits we expect to realize in 2023 from lower air freight and our new lululemon Studio model. We have the opportunity to invest into our Power of Three x2 growth pillars while also delivering operating margin in 2023, slightly ahead of our goal for modest expansion annually.\nIn 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.41 billion. This range represents growth of 15% to 16% relative to 2022 and is in line to slightly better than our Power of Three x2 growth plan. We expect to open 45 to 50 net new company-operated stores in 2023 and complete approximately 25 co-located remodels. This will contribute to overall square footage growth in the low double digits. Our new store openings in 2023 will include 30 to 35 stores in our international markets with the majority of these planned for China.\nFor the full year, we forecast gross margin to increase between 140 to 160 basis points versus 2022. The expansion relative to last year was driven predominantly by lower air freight expense. For the full year, we expect air freight to be down approximately 150 basis points versus 2022. When looking at markdowns for the full year, we expect them to be in line with last year in 2019.\nLet me also share some additional detail on our multiyear distribution center project. We began this project in 2022 with the opening of our new Tilbury DC near Vancouver. For the year overall, this project had a negative 30 basis point impact on gross margin. In 2023, we will continue investing in our distribution network to support future growth. Projects include building a new DC in the Greater Los Angeles area and also expanding 2 of our existing DCs in Columbus and Toronto. Included in our gross margin guidance for the year is 20 basis points of deleverage associated with these initiatives.\nTurning now to SG&A for the full year. We forecast deleverage of 120 to 140 basis points versus 2022, driven predominantly by increased investments to support market expansion, improve our guest experience by enhancing our omni capabilities and continuing to make foundational investments to support future growth. In addition, we expect higher depreciation due to current and prior year investments.\nWhen looking at operating margin for the full year 2023, we expect it to increase by 20 to 40 basis points versus last year. This would be slightly ahead of our Power of Three x2 long-term target of a modest expansion annually.\nFor the full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%, an increase over the 2022 adjusted effective tax rate of 28.1%. This is in line with our longer-term tax rate expectations we provided as part of our Power of Three x2 plan and reflects the increase we expect as a result of accruing for Canadian withholding taxes. For Q1, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%.\nFor the fiscal year 2023, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $11.50 to $11.72 versus adjusted EPS of $10.07 in 2022. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $660 million to $680 million for 2023. The increase versus 2022 reflects investments to support business growth including a continuation of our multiyear distribution center expansion, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, and technology investments. Our range of $660 million to $680 million is approximately 7% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%.\nShifting now to Q1. We expect revenue in the range of $1.89 billion to $1.93 billion, representing 1 year growth of 17% to 20%. We expect to open 5 to 10 net new company-operated stores in Q1. We expect gross margin in Q1 to increase 290 to 320 basis points relative to Q1 of 2022. This will be driven by lower air freight expense offset somewhat by strategic investments in supply chain and distribution centers as well as foreign exchange. In Q1, we expect our SG&A rate to deleverage by 60 to 80 basis points relative to Q1 2022, related to the investments I just described.\nWhen looking at operating margin for Q1, we expect expansion of approximately 200 basis points. We expect earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $1.93 to $2 versus adjusted EPS of $1.48 a year ago.\nWith that, I will wrap up my remarks and turn it back over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan. In 2022, we passed $8 billion in revenue for the first time driven by balanced growth across categories, channels and markets. Our product pipeline driven by innovation is very strong. More than 9 million guests signed up for our Essentials membership program in the first 5 months, which further strengthens the opportunity to keep building our community, strengthen our guest relationship and drive long-term value. Our market share gains show our brand is able to expand and attract new guests, and yet our unaided awareness remains low, which demonstrates the runway in front of us. And we're seeing strong momentum in every market where we operate, and we continue to successfully expand into new geographies. These are just some of the reasons I'm excited about all that's in front of us, both in 2023 and over the coming years.\nI look forward to taking your questions now. Operator?"

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Lululemon Athletica Inc. Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for Lululemon. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Brett Tubin\n\nVP of IR, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to Lululemon's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of Lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.\nActual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nAny forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis.\nThe press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website, www.lululemon.com. Before we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the third quarter as well as our quarterly infographic.\nToday's call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I'm happy to be here today to discuss our third quarter results, which, as you've seen from our press release, continue to be strong and resilient while we navigate an external environment that remains challenging. At Lululemon, innovation is at our core. We create apparel, footwear and gear that offers technical solutions to our guests as well as versatility and comfort with a variety of end uses, but that's just the starting point for us.\nLululemon is a brand that stands for community with connection firmly at our core. We connect with guests through our educators and ambassadors through our well-being offerings and local events and now through our new membership program in Lululemon Studio. It is this combination of innovation and connection that differentiates Lululemon from our peers and contribute meaningfully to the continued and sustained momentum we see across the business.\nOver the next few minutes, I'll highlight for you the trends we've experienced over the recent Thanksgiving weekend on what we're seeing in our business at the start of the holiday season. Then I'll discuss quarter 3 and speak to the balanced strength we continue to see across our business in terms of geography, channel and merchandise categories.\nNext, I'll update you on the supply chain environment and our inventories, and then I'll speak to our product pipeline. And finally, I'll speak to the benefits of our direct-to-consumer model and several of the unique ways we enabled connection with our community. So let's jump in. I will start with our performance over Thanksgiving as I'm sure it's top of mind for all of you.\nI'm pleased with our results and performance over the extended Thanksgiving weekend and as we start the holiday season. Over the past 2 weeks, I have traveled with several senior leaders across North America to cities, including Phoenix, Tampa, Orlando, New York and Toronto. We visited several stores in each market and saw a tremendous level of engagement from our team members, our guests in every store.\nIn fact, Black Friday was the biggest day ever in our history in terms of revenue and traffic driven by our results in both North America and around the world, with guests responding well to the innovation we offer across our product assortment.\nOur performance across markets and geographies shows that consumers are seeking brands like Lululemon that offer innovative, versatile product and a strong community connection that they can't find anywhere else. We also recognize that the external environment remains challenging with several high-volume weeks still in front of us. That being said, I'm encouraged with the beginning of our holiday season and I am confident in how our brand is positioned in the near and long term.\nNow I will speak to our performance in quarter 3. Meghan will go through the details in a few moments, but I'll share with you some of the financial highlights. Our revenue growth remains strong and balanced across several drivers as follows: all on a 3-year CAGR basis. Stores increased 16%, while e-commerce grew 46%, by region, North America grew 24% and international increased 42%. Revenue in Mainland China grew nearly 70% and we experienced strength across merchandise categories with men's up 28%, women's up 23% and accessories growing at 52%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 23% versus last year and 28% on a 3-year CAGR basis. And our market share gains continue. While the adult active apparel industry decreased its U.S. revenue by 4% in fiscal quarter 3 '22 compared to the same period last year, Lululemon gained 1.5 points of market share in the U.S. over this time, the most of any brand in this market according to the NPD Group's consumer tracking service.\nThese results are only possible due to the strength and dedication of our people around the world. To our teams in our stores, in our distribution centers and call centers and in our store support centers, I'd like to express my gratitude on behalf of the entire leadership team. You connect with our guests every day, execute against our growth plan and continue to support one another, all of which enable the financial results we deliver quarter after quarter.\nTurning now to supply chain and our inventories. We continue to see improvements across our supply chain. Our factories have now returned to pre-pandemic levels of production efficiency. In addition, ocean delivery times are continuing to improve from the 70 days we experienced last quarter. I'm also excited to share that we recently opened our Tilbury distribution center located near Vancouver to support demand in Western Canada. This DC is a great example of our ongoing investment in strategic foundational infrastructure projects that will help fuel our \"Power of Three x2\" growth plan.\nIn terms of inventory, we ended quarter 3 with dollar inventory up 85% on a 1-year basis and units up 38% on a 3-year CAGR basis, both metrics in line with our expectations. As we discussed, our inventory levels were too lean last year, and we made the strategic decision to build inventories this year, which enabled the strong top line growth we have delivered.\nMeghan will share additional details, and we remain comfortable with both the quality and quantity of our inventory. We continue to leverage our core styles, which account for approximately 45% of our total inventory and carry limited seasonal markdown risk. I'd also note that quarter 3 will represent the high point for our inventory on a 1-year dollar basis. And as we enter quarter 4, we are well positioned to be in stock throughout the holiday season.\nI will now spend a few minutes speaking about product. As you know, innovation at Lululemon is fueled by our science of field development platform. Our team's focus first on identifying the unmet needs of our guests and then we view them through the lens of activities to develop new franchises and other hero items that are versatile and innovative.\nQuarter 3 had some great examples of how we bring this strategy to life. In footwear, we launched our fourth style, Strongfeel. Like the other technical styles rolled out this year, Strongfeel was designed for women first, which differentiates us from many of our peers who create shoes for men and then adapt them for women. Strongfeel is a technical training shoe designed to keep the foot anchored and secured during workouts and we're encouraged by the initial guest response.\nAs I've mentioned before, footwear is a test-and-learn category for us, and it represents a small portion of the growth we anticipate over the next 5 years. This allows us to build into the potential at an appropriate pace as we learn and make adjustments. That being said, we're excited about the potential opportunity in this category, and we were pleased to be recognized by Footwear News with the Launch of the Year Award presented during their 36th Annual Achievement Awards last week in New York.\nTurning now to franchises. It's great to see how our teams continue to build out our range of Wunder Puff offerings. We started with a single women's jacket and have expanded into 11 styles within this outerwear franchise across women's, men's and accessories. Our results show that our guests respond extremely well to the breadth of options. While last year, we were constrained in terms of inventory, particularly in outerwear, we are well positioned with Wunder Puffs for the holiday season and expect to meet guest demand.\nAs we look forward, franchise development represents a unique and distinctive opportunity for Lululemon with Align, Scuba and Define as a few examples, all of them beginning with a singular style and then expanding into popular multiple style offerings. And this is just the beginning. We will continue to introduce, expand and grow our franchise business into the future.\nLet me now shift gears and speak to another one of Lululemon's key competitive advantages, our D2C model. Our ability to connect directly with guests in real time and across both our physical and digital channels gives us a number of ways to engage beyond a purchase transaction. In quarter 3, we launched our new membership program, began to hold local 10-K races for the first time since the pandemic began, and we brought focus to World Mental Health Day around the world with a notable activation in China.\nSome highlights are, in early October, we successfully launched our new 2-tier membership program in North America. The essential tier is free to everyone and offers unique benefits to members, including early access to product drops, exchange or credit on sale items and invitations to virtual community events.\nThe premium tier of the program, Lululemon Studio represents the evolution of Mirror into a much more engaging hybrid fitness offering. We've extended our collective by partnering with some of the best fitness studios and instructors to bring even more classes to our members, both digitally and in real life.\nTo join, members purchased a Lululemon Studio Mirror, agreed to a $39 monthly subscription and received many exciting new benefits.\nAnother way we engage with guests is through our 10-K runs. We sponsored 2 races in Atlanta and in Houston and we're excited by the response. We paused these experiences during the pandemic. So I'm thrilled that we have been able to hold these large-scale community activations once again, bringing together our guests, local teams and ambassadors to extend our community connection.\nAnd in China, we brought attention to World Mental Health Day in October with a month-long campaign aimed at inspiring people to take positive actions towards improving their physical, mental and social well-being. This included in real life events focused on wellness, media partnerships and the launch of a digital well-being hub on WeChat. These examples bring to life the unique ways we connect with our guests and our communities across the globe.\nThis enduring strength of Lululemon demonstrates our ability to be globally strong and regionally relevant as we foster a deeper relationship with Lululemon for existing and importantly, new guests. All of this increases brand awareness, drives traffic to our stores and websites and ultimately results in higher purchase consideration engagement with Lululemon.\nBefore handing it over to Meghan, I wanted to speak further about our international business. As you know, our plans call for a quadrupling of international revenue over 5 years from 2021 to 2026, and I'm very pleased with how our leaders and local teams are executing against that goal. This was reinforced for me during my recent visits to the United Kingdom and Australia. I toured both markets with our local leaders and team members and got to experience firsthand the energy and excitement of our stores and our recently optimized locations in Australia.\nIt's also exciting to see how we are elevating the guest experience in these markets with the recent rollout of ship from store and enhanced endless aisle capabilities in both regions. With strong leaders in each of these markets and across our international business, I'm energized by our ability to continue to strategically expand Lululemon across geographies. The potential is considerable.\nAnd building upon the momentum from our recent market entry into Spain, we opened another iconic location in Europe just last week with a store on the Champs-Elysees in Paris. In the heart of one of the city's main shopping districts, this store will enable us to grow brand awareness, both in France and across Europe, given this is such a popular tourist destination.\nWhile our growth prospects are balanced across geographies, international represents a key piece of our \"Power of Three x2\" growth plan. We're off to a great start, and I look forward to sharing more with you on future earnings calls. With that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nCFO, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Calvin. I'm pleased that our momentum continued in Q3, and we were able to deliver both top and bottom line results, which exceeded our guidance.\nThe holiday season is also off to a good start with strong traffic over the extended Thanksgiving weekend, and a positive guest response to our holiday merchandise assortment. In addition, we're in a much better inventory position this year to meet guest demand. However, I also want to acknowledge that we have several large volume weeks ahead of us, and our teams remain focused on connecting and engaging with our guests.\nLet me now share the details of our Q3 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q3 2022 with Q3 2021, the adjusted operating results for Q3 2021 exclude $0.18 of expense related to the acquisition of Mirror. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics.\nFor Q3, total net revenue increased 28% to $1.86 billion, ahead of our guidance. Comparable sales increased 25% with a 17% increase in stores and a 34% increase in digital. On a 3-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 27%. In our store channel, sales increased 28% on a 1-year basis and 16% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Productivity continues to trend above 2019 levels. And although we had 22 stores closed in Mainland China in the last week of November, we currently have 99% of our fleet open globally.\nWe ended the quarter with a total of 623 stores across the globe. Square footage increased 19% versus last year, driven by the addition of 71 net new stores since Q3 of 2021. During the quarter, we opened 23 net new stores and completed 7 co-located optimizations.\nIn our digital channel, revenues increased 46% on a 3-year CAGR basis and contributed $767 million of top line or 41% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 24% and within international, we saw a 42% increase, both on a 3-year CAGR basis. And by category, men's revenue increased 28% on a 3-year CAGR basis, women's increased 23% and accessories grew 52% on the same basis.\nI'm also excited that we continue to see strength in traffic across both channels. In stores, traffic increased nearly 25%. And in our digital business, traffic to our e-commerce sites and apps globally increased nearly 50%. On a 3-year CAGR basis, traffic is up 9% in stores and over 41% in e-commerce. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.\nGross profit for the third quarter was $1.04 billion or 55.9% of net revenue compared to 57.2% of net revenue in Q3 2021. Our gross margin decrease of 130 basis points relative to last year was driven primarily by 60 basis points of deleverage from foreign exchange within gross margin, which was somewhat offset by a 20 basis point FX benefit within SG&A. A 40 basis point decrease in product margin, driven primarily by higher markdowns and inventory provisions relative to low levels last year, partially offset by lower air freight expense. And 30 basis points of deleverage on fixed costs, driven primarily by investments in our product teams and distribution centers, offset somewhat by leverage on occupancy and depreciation.\nWhen looking at markdowns versus 2019, they were relatively flat and in line with our expectations. The decline in gross margin was larger than our guidance of 50 to 70 basis points, driven predominantly by FX and regional revenue mix. From a regional standpoint, while revenue growth in China was strong for the quarter, it was below our expectations due to COVID-19 impacts.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $684 million or 36.8% of net revenue compared to 37.6% of net revenue in Q3 2021. The leverage in the quarter versus Q3 2021 resulted from leverage in our stores and other channels on corporate SG&A and on foreign exchange. This was offset somewhat by an increase in depreciation and amortization.\nOperating income for the quarter was $352 million or 19% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 19.4% last year. Tax expense for the quarter was $97 million or 27.6% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.1% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to an accrual for withholding taxes on a portion of fiscal 2022's Canadian earnings and a decrease in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation.\nNet income for the quarter was $255 million or $2 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.62 in Q3 of 2021. Capital expenditures were $176 million for the quarter compared to $123 million in the third quarter last year. Q3 spend relates primarily to investments to support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $353 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory at the end of Q3 was $1.7 billion, in line with our expectations. This reflects 1-year dollar growth of 85% and a 3-year unit CAGR of 38%.\nIn-transit inventory is up relative to 2019 and is contributing approximately 3 percentage points to the 3-year unit growth rate. I'd also note that core seasonless product continues to make up approximately 45% of our inventory. We remain pleased with our inventory levels, which position us well to fulfill guest demand in Q4.\nLooking forward, on a 1-year dollar basis, we expect the inventory growth rate at the end of Q4 to begin to moderate and increase approximately 60% relative to last year. On a 3-year CAGR basis, we expect unit growth to be approximately 39% at the end of Q4.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 55,000 shares at an average price of approximately $311. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $812 million remaining on our recently authorized $1 billion repurchase program.\nLet me now shift to our guidance outlook. We're pleased with the start of the holiday season. However, the environment remains dynamic, and we still have approximately 2/3 of the quarter ahead of us. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $2.605 billion to $2.655 billion, representing 1 year growth of 22% to 25% and a 3-year CAGR of 23% to 24%. We expect to open approximately 30 net new company-operated stores in Q4. We expect gross margin in Q4 to increase 10 to 20 basis points relative to Q4 of 2021. We expect to see an improvement year-over-year in product margin, driven by lower airfreight expense, which will be partially offset by continued FX pressure and the timing of expenses related to our supply chain investments. We expect markdowns to be in line with 2019 levels.\nIn Q4, we expect our SG&A rate to leverage 30 to 50 basis points relative to Q4 2021. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.30 versus adjusted EPS of $3.37 a year ago. For the full year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $7.944 billion to $7.994 billion. This range assumes our e-commerce business continues to grow approximately 30% relative to 2021.\nWhen looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a 3-year CAGR of 26%, which continues to be higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020 and higher than the target of approximately 15% growth we set forth in our new \"Power of Three x2\" growth plan.\nWe now expect to open 79 net new company-operated stores in 2022, up modestly from our prior guidance of 75. Our new store openings in 2022 will include 45 to 50 stores in our international markets and represent a square footage increase in the low 20% range in total.\nFor the full year, we forecast gross margin to decrease between 100 and 140 basis points versus 2021. The reduction relative to last year is driven predominantly by foreign exchange. A more normalized level of markdowns relative to the low levels we experienced last year and increased investment in our DC network. Turning to SG&A for the full year. We forecast leverage of 100 to 140 basis points versus 2021 driven predominantly by increased sales. And when looking at adjusted operating margin for the full year 2022, we expect it to be approximately flat versus last year.\nFor the full year 2022, we expect our effective tax rate to be 28% to 28.5%. For Q4, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%. For the fiscal year 2022, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.87 to $9.97 versus adjusted EPS of $7.79 in 2021. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases and the gain on the real estate sale we realized in Q2.\nWe now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $630 million to $655 million for 2022. The increase versus 2021 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects, including our multiyear project to increase our distribution capabilities to support our future volume and growth. And we are also ramping up our square footage growth relative to last year and now intend to open 79 stores versus our prior expectation of 75. Our range of $630 million to $655 million is approximately 8% of revenue, in line with our current \"Power of Three x2\" (inaudible). Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Calvin for some closing remarks.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan. In closing, I just want to reiterate how pleased we are to see the continued momentum in the business and our strong start to our \"Power of Three x2\" growth strategy. As we look to quarter 4 and into 2023, I am confident in both our near- and long-term plans that will enable us to deliver on our goals while continuing to successfully navigate whatever comes our way. I look forward to taking your questions now. Operator?"

After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Brett Tubin\n\nVP of IR, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's second quarter earnings conference call.

Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I am excited to be here today to highlight our second quarter results and the continued momentum we're experiencing at lululemon. While the external environment around us has been challenging, we are seeing our guests respond strongly to our product innovations, our community activations and our omni operating model, which allows us to meet and exceed their expectations. During the next few minutes, I will discuss the factors that are driving our broad-based strength. Next, I'll discuss the current supply chain environment, then our pipeline of product innovation, and I'll conclude with an update on our growth within the international business.\nAs you've seen from our press release, the momentum in our business remained strong in the second quarter. Revenue increased 29% versus last year and 28% on a 3-year CAGR basis representing an acceleration from quarter 1. Adjusted earnings per share increased 33% and 32% on the same basis. And based on our guidance, we anticipate a high level of performance to continue in quarter 3.\nThese results are even more compelling considering the difficult macroeconomic environment in which we are operating. Our performance was only possible because of our teams across the globe. Their dedication, their agility and their enthusiasm for our brand, which enable us to consistently deliver for our guests and report these above-plan financial results. Meghan will share the detailed performance metrics with you shortly, but I'd like to give you my perspective on what's driving the strength and specifically speak to guest engagement.\nGiven the current macro backdrop, we have been looking closely at our guest data and metrics to identify any shifts in spending patterns, behaviors or habits. And to date, I'm pleased to show that we are not seeing any meaningful variation in cohort behavior or the metrics we track in this area of the business. New guest acquisition remains strong with transactions by first-time guests increasing over 20% in quarter 2. Transactions by existing guests increased in the high teens.\nTraffic across channels remains robust with store traffic up over 30% and e-commerce traffic increasing over 40%. And importantly, we are not creating this traffic through markdowns or price promotions. lululemon remains predominantly a full-price business, and we have not changed our promotional cadence or markdown strategy and we have no plans to do so. While we haven't seen anything on our internal dashboards to suggest any changes, we continue to monitor our guest behavior closely, and we remain agile in how we plan the business.\nShifting topics, like others in the industry, we continue to navigate challenges throughout the supply chain. That said, we are pleased to see some promising signs of improvement yet recognize further normalization within the supply chain will take some time. We currently have no closures across our vendor base. And in China, vendors who had to close their slow production in quarter 1 due to COVID-19 are beginning to catch up.\nOcean delivery times are improving, although they remain significantly elevated compared to the pre-COVID period. And while we continue to strategically leverage airfreight to help ensure timely delivery of product into our distribution centers, we are seeing these rates begin to come down.\nIn terms of inventory, we remain comfortable with both our quality and quantity, and we are well positioned for the fall season. As you recall, for much of last year, we were under-inventoried and not able to fully maximize our business. This year, we are in a much better position to deliver product innovation to our guests wherever and however they shop with us.\nWe remain in the early innings of our growth and we have multiple levers that we can pull to continue our momentum, particularly when looking at product. In quarter 2, we drove expansion across our core play and new categories. Let me now share some highlights of our recent and upcoming product innovations.\nIn our core product categories, we launched SenseKnit, our new proprietary fabric technology offering zone compression for runners and we saw great success in our core scuba and define franchises for women and in our ABC and commission franchises for men.\nSwitching now to our play categories. Our strategy is to solve for our guests' unmet needs across their secondary sweat activities such as golf, tennis and hike. We roll out targeted innovations while also leveraging the versatility of our core assortment. This not only builds our credibility within the activity, but it also allows us to drive overall sales while effectively managing SKUs.\nOur hike collection, which we launched in quarter 2, is another example of how we are executing our play strategy well. Hike is an activity that grew in popularity with guests during the pandemic, and we are excited to now be able to serve our guests as they hit the trails. We are thrilled by the early reaction to our hike collection with strong response from both guests and the media.\nAnd finally, let me update you on footwear. Blissfeel, the first style we launched in March, continues to perform well. We improved our inventory position after the strong guest response at launch, and we're seeing continued excitement around this technical running shoe. In quarter 2, we launched our next 2 footwear styles: Restfeel, our dual gender slide; and Chargefeel, our hybrid training shoe for women.\nSimilar to Blissfeel, Chargefeel was designed specifically for women. Our teams developed a dynamic workout shoe to be used across a wide range of training activities, and we're excited about the initial response from both the media and our guests.\nLooking forward, our pipeline of innovation remains robust, and I'm excited with what the teams have developed for the second half of the year, including a further expansion of apparel for run with new styles offering heat retention and reflective detailing to enable outdoor runs in cooler and low light conditions as the season shift. With the exception of a few outerwear styles and accessories, we've never had a [solve] for cold weather runs. The upcoming expansion of our assortment is a great example of the ongoing opportunity to build out our core categories and provide new solutions for our guests.\nNext, we will continue to expand our new hike category to include heavier styles to protect against the elements during cold weather outings. We will also continue our throwback strategy with the relaunch of our popular unicorn tears print in select styles. This print has not been available since 2012 and has been one of the most requested by our guests, and we're thrilled to be bringing it back for a limited time.\nAnd finally, we'll launch our fourth footwear style, Strongfeel, a technical training shoe designed to keep the foot anchored and secured during multidirectional training workouts. While our product is clearly a key point of differentiation, our direct-to-consumer model also provides us with a compelling competitive advantage. Our own channels, both brick-and-mortar and digital, allow us to connect directly with our guests, foster deeper relationships and engage with them in many ways beyond just a purchase transaction.\nDuring the pandemic, we evolved our approach and developed new ways to connect digitally with our guests and communities. Now as we're moving into post-COVID world, we're once again connecting with our guests in person while also continuing to leverage new ways to engage digitally.\nOur new 2-tier membership program, which we'll be launching shortly, is a perfect example of our ability to connect with guests in new ways. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, we will be rolling out a free program that will offer members benefits across the lululemon ecosystem, and we will be evolving MIRROR into lululemon studio, which will represent the paid tier of the program.\nCommunity connection is at the core of lululemon. Our ongoing outreach and engagement with our guests not only deepen our relationship, but also drive purchases. I'm particularly excited with the opportunity we have in front of us with our new membership program in lululemon studio to activate our community and enhance the connection to our guests across both our physical and digital platforms.\nBefore turning it over to Meghan to discuss our quarter 2 financials and guidance outlook, let me share some insights into our international business. Overall momentum in our international business remains strong, with revenue increasing 35% versus last year and 40% on a 3-year CAGR basis. In China, after a slower start to the year given COVID-19-related closures and capacity constraints, we have seen a rebound in the region. Revenue grew over 30% versus last year, and we saw a nearly 70% increase on a 3-year CAGR basis. We remain in the early innings of growth in China and consistent with our approach in all other markets, we are leveraging our D2C model to grow our brand and attract new guests.\nIn quarter 2, in our brick-and-mortar channel, we opened 8 stores in China Mainland. We now operate 40 stores in Tier 1 cities, 25 stores in Tier 2 cities and 14 stores in Tier 3 cities and continue to see strength across this entire portfolio.\nIn our e-commerce channel, we recently launched a digital flagship store on JD.com, a leading online retailer in China. JD's customer base skews more heavily towards men and represents a compelling new guest acquisition tool for us as we continue to grow our brand in the region.\nI'm also thrilled with how our local teams continue to build community, increase our brand awareness and deepen the relationship we have with our guests. A great illustration of this is our summer sweat games 2022. This event saw more than 2,000 guests participate in over 60 events in 20 cities across the China Mainland. Activities included outdoor yoga, dancing and surfing experiences. In addition, more than 100,000 guests participated in sweat sessions offered by our ambassadors on Keep, a leading fitness app in China.\nShifting now to Europe, where our momentum is also strong, revenue increased 20% and 22% on a 1- and 3-year CAGR basis, respectively. We are all excited that lululemon is entering Spain, our first new market in the region in 3 years. Our local e-commerce site is up and running, and our first 2 stores in Barcelona and Madrid are gearing up to open shortly, and we expect Spain to be a strong market for us going forward.\nIn total, we are now operating 40 stores and 5 websites in Europe. International expansion is one of the key pillars of our Power of Three x2 growth plan, which calls for a quadrupling of our business from 2021 levels by the end of 2026, and we are off to a great start.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nCFO, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Calvin. I'm pleased that we continue to see broad-based strength across our business. Traffic to both our stores and digital channels is strong and guests are responding well to our product innovations. We're in a better inventory position relative to last year, which is also helping to drive our top line strength. And looking at Q3, we're happy with the start to the fall season, which is reflected in the updated guidance I'll take you through shortly.\nLet me now share with you the details of our Q2 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q2 2022 and Q2 2021, the adjusted operating results for Q2 2022 exclude a $0.06 gain related to the disposition of an office building, while the adjusted operating results for Q2 2021 excludes $0.06 of expense related to the acquisition of MIRROR. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics.\nFor Q2, total net revenue increased 29% to $1.87 billion, ahead of our guidance. Comparable sales increased 25% with an 18% increase in stores and a 32% increase in digital. On a 3-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 28%, an acceleration from our 27% 3-year CAGR in Q1. In our store channel, sales increased 30% on a 1-year basis and 16% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Productivity continues to trend above 2019 levels. On average, we had 98% of our stores opened throughout Q2, and we currently have 99% open. We ended the quarter with a total of 600 stores across the globe, a milestone we are all extremely proud of.\nSquare footage increased 19% versus last year, driven by the addition of 66 net new stores since Q2 of 2021. During the quarter, we opened 21 net new stores and completed 6 co-located optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues increased 53% on a 3-year CAGR basis. We contributed $775 million of top line or 42% of total revenue.\nWithin North America, revenue increased 26%. And within international, we saw a 40% increase, both on a 3-year CAGR basis. And by category, men's revenue increased 30% on a 3-year CAGR basis, women's increased 25% and accessories grew 50% on the same basis. I'm also excited that we continue to see strength in traffic across both channels. And stores traffic increased over 30% on top of the 150% increase in traffic we experienced last year. And in our digital business, traffic to our e-commerce sites and apps globally increased over 40%. On a 3-year CAGR basis, traffic is up 8% in stores and over 40% in e-commerce. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.\nGross profit for the second quarter was $1.06 billion or 56.5% of net revenue compared to 58.1% of net revenue in Q2 2021. Our gross margin decrease of 160 basis points relative to last year was driven primarily by a 150 basis point decrease in product margin. Q2 product margin included an increase of approximately 130 basis points in airfreight related to macro supply chain challenges, which was slightly better than our guidance of 150 basis points. Markdowns were 30 basis points higher than Q2 2021, given low inventory levels and out of stocks last year. Relative to 2019, markdowns are flat. We also experienced 40 basis points of deleverage from foreign exchange. This was partially offset by 30 basis points of leverage on fixed costs, driven primarily by occupancy and depreciation.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded in prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $662 million or 35.4% of net revenue compared to 37.3% of net revenue in Q2 2021. Leverage in the quarter versus Q2 2021 resulted from leverage in our store and digital channels and modest leverage on foreign exchange, somewhat offset by increased investments in corporate SG&A and depreciation.\nAdjusted operating income for the quarter was $391 million or 20.9% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 20.6% in Q2 2021 and inclusive of approximately 130 basis points of additional airfreight expense. Adjusted tax expense for the quarter was $110 million or 28.2% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 27.9% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to a decrease in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation and an accrual for withholding taxes on a portion of our fiscal 2022 Canadian earnings.\nAdjusted net income for the quarter was $281 million or $2.20 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.65 in Q2 of 2021. Capital expenditures were $145 million for the quarter compared to $80 million in the second quarter last year. Q2 spend relates primarily to investments to support business growth, including our multiyear distribution center project, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations and technology investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $499 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 85% versus last year and was $1.46 billion at the end of Q2. We continue to strategically use airfreight to help mitigate industry-wide supply chain issues and support our top line momentum, with these higher costs having an impact on inventory when looked at on a dollar basis. We also believe that 2019 is the most relevant comparison point given supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic.\nOn a 3-year CAGR basis, unit inventory increased 38% relative to 2019 at the end of Q2. In-transit inventory is up relative to 2019 and is contributing approximately 2 percentage points to the 3-year unit CAGR of 38%. I'd also point out that we likely left guest demand on the table last year as we were under inventory due to supply chain issues, and we continue to leverage our core assortment, which comprises approximately 45% of our inventory. Looking forward, on a 1-year dollar basis, we expect the inventory growth rate at the end of Q3 to be slightly higher than the levels we saw at the end of Q2 before the growth rate moderates to 50% to 60% at the end of Q4.\nOur expectation of Q3 ending inventory now being the high-water line, when looked at on a 1-year basis, is being driven by better on-time performance at our vendors, which is allowing us to receive products sooner than we initially expected. This is also allowing us to use less airfreight as we now expect airfreight for the full year 2022 to be 10 basis points under last year versus our prior expectation of 30 basis points above last year.\nOn a 3-year CAGR basis, we expect unit growth to remain consistent with Q2 levels in Q3 and moderate somewhat in Q4. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 420,000 shares at an average price of $298. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $830 million remaining on our recently authorized $1 billion repurchase program.\nI'm excited with our continued strong performance despite the challenges presented by the current macro environment. Our teams across the business are executing at a high level. However, as we did throughout the pandemic, we continue to plan the business for multiple scenarios, so we are ready should we see any change in guest behavior. We have multiple levers to pull when it comes to discretionary expenses and capital expenditures. And as Calvin said, we are monitoring our guest metrics very closely to determine if we need to make any adjustments.\nLet me shift now to our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2022. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.81 billion, representing 1 year growth of 23% to 24% and a 3-year CAGR of approximately 25. We expect to open 25 net new company-operated stores in Q3. We expect gross margin in Q3 to be down 50 to 70 basis points relative to Q3 of 2021. While we expect to see leverage on airfreight expense relative to last year, this will be offset by the timing of expenses related to our supply chain initiatives as well as a more normalized level of markdowns relative to the low levels we experienced last year.\nIn Q3, we expect our SG&A rate to be relatively flat with Q3 2021. Based on the timing of our investments, we would expect SG&A to be relatively flat with last year in Q4 as well. Turning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 versus adjusted EPS of $1.62 a year ago. For the full year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $7.87 billion to $7.94 billion. This range assumes our e-commerce business grows in the low- to mid-20s relative to 2021.\nWhen looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a 3-year CAGR of approximately 26%, which continues to be higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19% leading up to 2020 and higher than the target of approximately 15% growth we set forth in our new Power of Three x2 growth plan. We now expect to open approximately 75 net new company-operated stores in 2022, up modestly from our prior guidance of approximately 70. Our new store openings in 2022 will include approximately 45 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low 20% range in total.\nFor the full year, we are forecasting gross margin to decrease between 100 to 130 basis points versus 2021. The reduction relative to last year is driven predominantly by increased investment in our DC network, and a more normalized level of markdowns relative to the low levels we experienced last year while still below 2019 levels.\nTurning to SG&A for the full year. We are now forecasting leverage of 100 to 130 basis points versus 2021, driven predominantly by increased sales. And when looking at adjusted operating margin for the full year 2022, we expect it to be approximately flat to up slightly versus last year. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be 28% to 28.5%. For Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28%. For the fiscal year 2022, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.75 to $9.90 versus adjusted EPS of $7.79 in 2021. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases and the gain on the real estate sale we realized in Q2.\nWe now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $610 million to $635 million for 2022. The increase versus 2021 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. Notably, this includes our new multiyear project to increase our distribution capabilities to support our future volume and growth and increased square footage growth relative to last year. A range of $610 million to $635 million is approximately 8% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%.\nThank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Calvin for some closing remarks.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Meghan. As you can see from our results, lululemon continues to perform at a high level, and I am consistently impressed by the ability of our teams to anticipate, meet and exceed the needs of our guests. And across the business, we're seeing that our guests are eager to welcome us into new categories, styles and markets, which speaks to the significant growth potential for lululemon going forward. We are off to a very good start as we embark upon our Power of Three x2 growth plan, and there's a clarity and focus on the work underway across the company.\nAnd in closing, I want to express my gratitude to everyone at lululemon for your hard work and the passion that continues to show all of us the power of our people and company.

This is the conference operator. Welcome to the lululemon athletica inc. First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) The conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Tubin, Vice President, Investor Relations for lululemon athletica. Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Brett Tubin\n\nVP of IR, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any of these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and in today's earnings press release. In addition, the comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying quarterly report on Form 10-Q are available under the Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.\nBefore we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial and operating statistics for the first quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. I am pleased to be here today and share with you the highlights of our quarter 1 performance. It's been just over a month since I saw many of you in person at our recent Analyst Day presentation in New York. These are exciting times for lululemon as we embark upon our next 5-year growth plan, the Power of Three x2. Our teams are energized and deep in the work of the plan we shared. I look forward to providing you with updates on future earnings calls as we make progress on the key initiatives we laid out.\nHowever, I'd like to spend our time today discussing the macro environment and the unique aspects of lululemon, which continue to contribute to our strong performance. As you saw in our press release, the momentum in our business continues and 2022 is off to an impressive start. Revenue in the first quarter increased 32% versus last year and 27% on a 3-year CAGR basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 28% and 26% on the same basis.\nThere are several notable metrics that underscore our performance this quarter. Starting with product, the guest response to our core and new merchandise remains very strong. Our product continues to drive demand, and we experienced robust traffic growth in both channels with stores and e-commerce up approximately 40%. And finally, we're in a strong inventory position relative to last year. While our levels are higher than our historical norms, we are comfortable with the quality and composition of our inventory. This allows us to balance the momentum we're seeing in the business with the challenges that remain within the global supply chain.\nWith that in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes on China, given the current conditions related to COVID-19 and its impact on both our operations and supply chain. Consistent with many retailers in the region, we are seeing modest impacts of the COVID-19-related lockdowns on our stores and with some of our vendors. Throughout the first quarter and into the second quarter, we have seen up to 1/3 of our 71 stores closed for a period of time. As I'm sure you've seen, this week, stores are reopening in Beijing, and we are starting to see restrictions ease in Shanghai.\nEven with the closures, our business remained solid in the first quarter, with revenue growing double digits versus last year and growing over 60% on a 3-year CAGR basis. In addition, our growth plans remain on track as the majority of our 40 international new store openings this year are planned for Mainland China.\nFrom a sourcing perspective, when looking at finished goods for the upcoming fall season, Mainland China represents only 4% to 6% of our total unit volume. When we include trims and other components, the volume increases. Although the majority of our vendors are now up and running, we have experienced delays and expect some level of impact on future receipts. Our teams are closely monitoring the situation, staying in regular contact with our vendors and working to mitigate the current risks.\nHaving said all of this, we remain excited about our business in China, and we view the current situation as short term in nature. Our brand momentum remains strong, and we will continue to invest in the region, and we're excited about what the future holds for lululemon in this important market.\nWhen looking at the global supply chain, overall, the environment remains challenging. Ocean lead times are not improving and air freight costs remain high. To address these issues, our team is carefully balancing our business momentum with time line uncertainties to help ensure we meet guest demand. This comes with a commensurate investment in air freight, which is important given we see satisfying guest demand as a priority. Our time lines allow us to pivot when we see trends change from air to ocean and all costs are included in our guidance. We will continue to carefully assess and manage.\nSwitching now to inflation. As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing increased input costs on raw materials, labor and as I just spoke about, air freight. We continue to monitor the situation closely and are taking actions to mitigate the impact on our P&L. These include ongoing cost management, working with our vendor partners to identify additional efficiencies and pricing opportunities.\nAs I've shared previously, we are implementing some select price increases and have not seen any negative impact to our sales volume as a result. However, unlike many in the industry, we do not use promotional pricing as a lever to drive top line sales. Therefore, we are very intentional with our pricing strategies, and we monitor guest response accordingly. That said, I remain cautious around increasing prices in this period of uncertainty, and we will continue to monitor and maintain a measured approach toward this strategy.\nGiven the times in which we are operating, I wanted to highlight for you the unique strengths of lululemon, which drive our performance quarter after quarter. We have many attributes that make our brand unique, create competitive advantages and lead to the ongoing momentum in our business. As I've shared before, the pandemic has contributed to a fundamental change in guest behaviors that provide us with compelling opportunities to grow. These include our guests wanting to live an active and healthy lifestyle and looking for additional support related to well-being and recovery, and as normalcy returns, their desire for versatile apparel has increased.\nPlus, our D2C model provides a strong and direct connection to our guests with incredible insights across every touch point. And we have a very balanced approach to growth across channels, geographies, merchandise categories, gender and activities. And finally, our primary focus on technical athletic apparel creates demand for our product across seasons and mitigates the need for markdowns. All of this positions us for continued growth and we will continue to take a balanced and holistic view of our business. In fact, our business is in the early innings and all levers are contributing to our performance. This is unique, speaks to the strength of our brand and our opportunity to innovate, all while maintaining our momentum.\nFinally, let's look further at our product innovation. We continue to leverage our Science of Feel development platform to solve for the unmet needs of athletes and to bring new technical features into our merchandise assortment. Our foundational principle is when you feel your best, you perform your best. We utilized the Science of Feel to bring a consistent flow of innovation to our assortment across a variety of activities. Our product pipeline remains very strong, and it's the bedrock of the business.\nIn quarter 1, we launched footwear, golf and tennis, all meeting with great guest response. With footwear, we leveraged 20-plus years of experience designing and developing technical apparel to bring a unique solve to the women's footwear space. Many in the industry design footwear for men and then adopt for women. We designed our shoe for women first.\nWe introduced our first shoe, Blissfeel, in March, and we were proud that it was named the best women's specific shoe in 2022 by Runner's World. The response has been enthusiastic. And since we were prudent with our inventory buys, we have seen out of stocks. Although we expect to be in a better inventory position in the coming weeks, demand has far exceeded our sales forecast. As a result, we do anticipate that we will be chasing into additional inventory for the remainder of the year.\nTurning to our play activities. Golf and tennis both performed well this quarter. These collections are comprised of pieces from our core assortment as well as styles designed specifically for these activities. This strategy allows us to manage our assortment, grow share of wallet while also leveraging our core and driving sales. We are pleased with these results and will continue to lean into these strategies.\nLooking ahead into quarter 2, we have several exciting product stories to tell. First is SenseKnit. To continue expanding our run apparel assortment, this week, we launched our newest fabric innovation. After 4 years of research and development, we have brought to market SenseKnit, a proprietary fabric that seamlessly engineers zones of support, breathability and mobility directly into the fabric. Based upon collaborative work with our ambassadors and athletes, we determined the sensation runners are looking with unrestricted lightweight support while also delivering the technical performance and endurance they expect from lululemon. And our SenseKnit collection provides this sensation in 9 styles for men and women.\nSecond is hike. To leverage the versatility of our core as we've done with golf and tennis, we're on track to launch hike in the coming weeks. This assortment will combine elements of our core assortment with new styles designed specifically for hiking. This is an unmet need we heard from our guests specifically as hiking has gained popularity during the pandemic.\nNext is throwbacks. Our product team has been spending time in our archives to find the best of the best and re-release limited additions of some of our guests' favorite styles, including revamped versions of our Astro Pants, Shape Jacket and Inspire Crop.\nAnd finally, footwear, as I mentioned, we are excited with the initial response. We just launched our second style, the Restfeel slide this week, and we remain on track to roll out our next 2 styles later this year, Chargefeel and Strongfeel. This is just the beginning for us within this category, which has considerable opportunity.\nSo in summary, our results and our guidance demonstrate the strength of our business and the momentum of our brand. This is enabled by our omni operating model, our product innovation and our balanced approach to growth. We have shown our ability to successfully manage through what's happening around us, and I am continually inspired by how our teams around the globe consistently deliver for our guests, for each other and for our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Meghan.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nCFO, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Calvin. I'll begin by saying how excited I was to host our recent Analyst Day and get to meet and speak with many of you in person. As we delivered early on our total 2023 revenue goals, we used Analyst Day to launch our growth plan for the next 5 years. Our new plan builds upon our proven Power of Three formula and calls for a doubling of total revenue from $6.25 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion in 2026. Hence, we've appropriately named the new plan, Power of Three x2. Our teams are already executing against our new plan, and we're off to a solid start despite the ongoing headwinds in the macro environment.\nSo let me now share with you the details on our Q1 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that when comparing the financial metrics for Q1 2022 with Q1 2021, the adjusted operating results for Q1 2021 exclude approximately $8 million of MIRROR acquisition-related costs and our associated tax effect. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics.\nFor Q1, total net revenue increased 32% to $1.613 billion, ahead of our guidance, driven by outperformance in North America. Comparable sales increased 29% with a 24% increase in stores and a 33% increase in digital. On a 3-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 27%, an acceleration from Q4. In our store channel, sales increased 36% on a 1-year basis and 13% on a 3-year CAGR basis. Productivity was above 2019 levels and continues to trend that way to date in Q2. On average, we had 98% of our stores open throughout Q1. We currently have 97% open with current closures related predominantly to the impact of COVID-19 in China.\nSquare footage increased 16% versus last year driven by the addition of 56 net new stores since Q1 of 2021. During the quarter, we opened 5 net new stores and completed 4 co-located optimizations. In our digital channel, revenues increased 51% on a 3-year CAGR basis and contributed $721 million of top line or 45% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 26% and within international, we saw a 37% increase, both on a 3-year CAGR basis. And by category, men's revenue increased 30% on a 3-year CAGR basis, women's increased 24% and accessories grew 43% on the same basis.\nI'm also excited with what we're seeing in traffic across both channels. In stores, traffic increased over 40%, while at the same time, traffic to our e-commerce sites and apps globally increased nearly 40%. On a 3-year CAGR basis, traffic is up over 10% in stores and nearly 40% in e-commerce. This speaks to the strength of our omni operating model as we engage with our guests in ways most convenient to them.\nGross profit for the first quarter was $870 million or 53.9% of net revenue compared to 57.1% of net revenue in Q1 2021. Our gross margin decrease of 320 basis points relative to last year was driven by a 370 basis point decrease in product margin. Q1 product margin included an increase of approximately 340 basis points in air freight related to macro supply chain challenges, which was higher than our guidance of 300 basis points due to increased usage relative to our initial plans.\nMarkdowns were approximately flat with last year. Relative to 2019, markdowns decreased by 40 basis points. We also experienced 10 basis points of deleverage from foreign exchange. This was partially offset by 60 basis points of leverage on fixed costs, driven by occupancy and depreciation.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $608 million or 37.7% of net revenue compared to 40.5% of net revenue in Q1 2021. Leverage in the quarter versus Q1 2021 resulted from leverage in our store and digital channels, somewhat offset by increased investments in the corporate SG&A and depreciation. Operating income for the quarter was $260 million or 16.1% of net revenue compared to adjusted operating margin of 16.4% in Q1 2021 and inclusive of approximately 340 basis points of additional air freight expense.\nTax expense for the quarter was $70 million or 27% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 24.5% a year ago. The increase relative to last year is due primarily to a decrease in tax deductions related to stock-based compensation, and an accrual for withholding taxes on a portion of our fiscal 2022 Canadian earnings.\nNet income for the quarter was $190 million or $1.48 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.16 in Q1 of 2021. Capital expenditures were $111 million for the quarter compared to $64 million in the first quarter last year. Q1 spend relates primarily to investments to support business growth, store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, and technology investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with $649 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 74% versus last year and was $1.3 billion at the end of Q1. We continue to strategically use air freight to help mitigate industry-wide supply chain issues and support our top line momentum, with these higher costs having an impact on inventory when looked at on a dollar basis. We also believe that 2019 is the most relevant comparison point given supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic.\nOn a 3-year CAGR basis, unit inventory increased 36% relative to 2019 at the end of Q1 and is well positioned relative to our Q2 2022 top line guidance of a 26% increase on a 3-year CAGR basis, again, comparing to 2019. It's important to mention that due to ocean transit times, our in-transit inventory is up relative to 2019 and is contributing approximately 5 percentage points to the 3-year unit CAGR of 36%.\nI'd also mention that we likely have less guest demand on the table last year as we were under inventory due to supply chain issues. Hence, our product teams have taken this into account as they plan receipts for this year. We also continue to leverage our core assortment, which comprises approximately 45% of our inventory.\nLooking forward, we expect to see the highest 1 year inventory growth rate of the year in Q2 on both a dollar and unit basis before levels begin to moderate in Q3. In Q2, inventory dollar growth relative to last year will be modestly above levels at the end of Q1. On a 3-year CAGR basis, unit growth will remain up approximately 36%.\nIn Q1, we repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at an average price of approximately $328. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $955 million remaining on our recently authorized $1 billion repurchase program.\nLet me shift now to our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2022. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.775 billion, representing 1 year growth of 21% to 22% and a 3-year CAGR of approximately 26%. We expect to open 20 net new company-operated stores in Q2. We expect gross margin in Q2 to be down approximately 200 basis points relative to Q2 of 2021. Our Q2 guidance includes an impact of approximately 150 basis points of pressure from air freight costs due to port congestion and capacity constraints. In Q2, we expect our SG&A rate to be relatively flat with Q2 2021.\nTurning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $1.82 to $1.87 versus adjusted EPS of $1.65 a year ago. Our range of $1.82 to $1.87 excludes the $0.07 gain on a real estate sale we expect to realize in Q2. For the full year 2022, we now expect revenues to be in the range of $7.61 billion to $7.71 billion. This range assumes our e-commerce business grows in the high teens to low 20s relative to 2021. When looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a 3-year CAGR of 24% to 25%, which continues to be higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020 and higher than the target of approximately 15% growth we set forth in our new Power of Three x2 growth plan.\nWe continue to expect to open approximately 70 net new company-operated stores in 2022. Our new store openings in 2022 will include approximately 40 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low 20% range in total. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin to decrease between 100 to 150 basis points versus 2021. The reduction relative to last year is driven by increased investment in our DC network and a strategic increase in content development costs for lululemon studio, MIRROR. The increased costs and gross margin will be offset by a reduction in digital marketing, which flows through SG&A. In addition, we now expect air freight to have a modest negative impact of approximately 30 basis points versus our prior expectation of flat.\nTurning to SG&A for the full year. We are forecasting leverage of 50 to 100 basis points versus 2021, driven by increased sales and the shift in lululemon studio, MIRROR, investments I just mentioned. And when looking at operating margin for the full year 2022, we now expect it to be approximately flat with last year, inclusive of the 30 basis points of incremental air freight expense I just mentioned. For the full year 2022, we now expect our effective tax rate to be 28% to 28.5%. For Q2, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%.\nFor the fiscal year 2022, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.35 to $9.50 versus adjusted EPS of $7.79 in 2021. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases and the gain on a real estate sale we expect to realize in Q2. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million to $625 million for 2022. The increase versus 2021 reflects the increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovations as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. Our range of $600 million to $625 million is approximately 8% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three x2 target of 7% to 9%.\nThank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Calvin for some closing remarks.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan. As you can see from our results, lululemon continues to deliver the kind of performance that sets us apart within the retail industry. Two weeks ago, we held our Annual Leadership Summit and brought together virtually about 2,000 of our leaders from around the globe. We detailed our Power of Three x2 growth plans and spoke to our culture at lululemon and to our purpose, which is to elevate human potential by helping people feel their best.\nAnd the passion from every participant, the enthusiasm during every breakout was simply incredible. It reinforces my confidence in all that lies ahead for lululemon as we both navigate what uncertainty emerges and work toward delivering on our goals to double our business within the next 5 years. It's an honor to lead this incredible organization.\nAnd now we'll take your questions. Operator?"

Please go ahead.\n\nHoward Brett Tubin\n\nVP of IR, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to lululemon's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to talk about our results are Calvin McDonald, CEO; and Meghan Frank, CFO.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of lululemon's future. These statements are based on current information, which we have assessed, but by which its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including those we have disclosed in our most recent filings with the SEC including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

In addition, comparable sales metrics given on today's call are on a constant dollar basis. The press release and accompanying annual report on Form 10-K are available under our Investors section of our website at www.lululemon.com.\nBefore we begin the call, I'd like to remind our investors to visit our investor site where you'll find a summary of our key financial operating statistics for the fourth quarter as well as our quarterly infographic. Today's call is scheduled for 1 hour, so please limit yourself to 1 question at a time to give others the opportunity to have their questions addressed. And now I would like to turn the call over to Calvin.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Howard. It's my pleasure to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call.\nThe fourth quarter was a strong finish to a strong year. Once again, we delivered revenue growth in excess of our Power of Three targets, and we grew adjusted earnings per share of 31% compared to last year and 22% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Looking at our full year results, I'm particularly proud that we crossed the $6 billion in annual revenue milestone, and we accomplished this despite the ongoing challenges in the macro environment. And we have seen our momentum continue and accelerate as we enter the first quarter.\nOur guidance calls for 24% to 26% top line growth and 19% to 23% adjusted EPS growth in quarter 1. For 2022 overall, we are also guiding to another strong year for the company, and I'm optimistic about our performance and opportunities going forward as we continue to build upon our unique strengths and bring technical innovation to our guests. I'm pleased to walk you through the key highlights of our fourth quarter and annual performance on today's call. And I look forward to speaking with you again in a few weeks when we host our Analyst Day, where we will share our vision and outlook for the next 5 years.\nBut before I begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the horrific situation in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding. While we do not operate in Ukraine, we have made a donation to the relief efforts and are also supporting our employees who have family and friends in the region. In addition, as we look around the world, we continue to closely monitor our markets that are experiencing the surging impacts of COVID-19. As we have done throughout the pandemic, we will prioritize the health and safety of our people and the communities we serve and the decisions that we make.\nNow turning to our results. The fourth quarter capped off another impressive year of growth for us, demonstrating the sustained momentum in the business. I want to thank our teams across the entire organization who navigated the Omicron variant, successfully executed against our Power of Three growth plan and continue to deliver for our guests and all of our stakeholders. In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 23% versus last year and 23% on a 2-year CAGR basis. And for the full year, revenue grew 42% versus 2020 and 25% on a 2-year CAGR basis, an impressive performance by any benchmark with strength across our products, channels and geographies.\nBefore discussing our results in more detail, I will touch on several topics, including the macro trends that continue to provide a tailwind for our business, the ongoing issues within the global supply chain and their impact on our inventory levels and pricing. lululemon continues to benefit from several consumer trends that uniquely position us in the marketplace. First, category strength as athletic apparel continues to outpace growth in overall apparel. Second, the growing significance of versatility, both while guests are engaging in their fitness routines and in their everyday lives. Third, the importance of both physical retail and the convenience of digital engagement, these speak particularly well to our operating model. And finally, the increasing focus on physical, mental and social well-being given everything that people are navigating across the globe. These trends have accelerated during the COVID-19 period, and we are well positioned to continue to grow our business in 2022 and beyond.\nShifting to the supply chain. We continue to experience delays across our global network, particularly related to transporting our products via ocean freight. As a result, we continue to lean more heavily into air freight. However, I am pleased with how our teams have become increasingly at navigating these challenges. We have implemented several strategies to ensure we have the proper levels of inventory to fuel our top line growth. And as I've stated on prior calls, our core seasonless product makes up a meaningful percentage of our inventory, approximately 45%, which carries minimal markdown risk and positions us well to fulfill ongoing and future guest demand. Meghan will discuss our inventory levels in more detail shortly.\nWhen looking at pricing, we continue to be strategic. We plan to take some selective price increases over the course of the year on a small portion of our styles. Our pricing also factors in the value of our innovation, and we will continue to monitor the competitive environment to ensure we maintain our price position relative to our key peers.\nLet me share further highlights from quarter 4 and our overall results for 2021, starting with the fourth quarter. First, we generated total revenue of $2.1 billion. Despite the onset of the Omicron variant during the peak weeks of the holiday season, we delivered growth in excess of our Power of Three plan. Second, our e-commerce business remained strong, with comps up 16% on top of a strong 92% last year. This translates on a 2-year CAGR basis to an increase in e-commerce of 50%. Third, our adjusted earnings per share were $3.37, which is better than the guidance we provided in January. And as I mentioned, we are pleased with how our momentum accelerated into the first quarter, as indicated by our strong guidance range.\nFor the full year 2021, we delivered on our financial commitments and also made notable headway on our impact agenda goals. Some key milestones include generating total revenue of $6.26 billion, delivering adjusted earnings per share of $7.79 and achieving our Power of Three targets early including exceeding our total revenue target, doubling our e-commerce business, doubling our men's business, and we are on track to quadruple our international business by the end of 2022.\nI'm pleased in our ability to deliver every 2023 goal ahead of schedule, which is particularly noteworthy given the effects of the global pandemic. This level of performance is only possible because of the agility and nimbleness of our teams who successfully navigated the macro environment, supported each other and found new ways to engage with our guests. I'm also proud of how we advanced our impact agenda in 2021 to drive meaningful positive change in the world. A few examples include launching our first re-commerce program, lululemon Like New and 2 test markets and introducing our limited edition Earth Tie Collection; partnering with and investing in Genomatica to create the first ever plant-based alternative to nylon, which will help us achieve our goals to make 100% of our products with sustainable materials and have end-of-life solutions by 2030; and establishing our lululemon Center for Social Impact to help break the barriers to well-being in local and global communities with a commitment to contribute $75 million by 2025. These are important milestones and represent only the beginning of what we will accomplish related to sustainability and well-being.\nNext, I will provide some additional details on our quarter 4 results and the foundational strengths that drive our business, fuel our success and give us a distinct competitive advantage. I will begin with product innovation. Our momentum remains on the upswing across all major categories, with women's revenue increasing 20%, men's growing 28% and accessories up 33%, all on a 2-year CAGR basis. In quarter 4, we continued to leverage the Science of Feel to fuel product newness and innovation, our guests responded well to our holiday merchandise assortment, and we saw a positive response to outerwear, second layers and technical shorts for both women and men.\nLooking forward, our product pipeline remains robust, and I'm excited for the innovations we are bringing to market in 2022. Some highlights include our multiyear partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee. I'm excited by the reaction to our product in the buzz this partnership created for our brand, notably both inside and outside of Canada.\nPartnering with Team Canada is a unique opportunity for us to build awareness for lululemon on the global stage and to support some of the world's most elite athletes. We are off to a great start. And I'm thrilled that this month, we launched our footwear collection, and we have received a very broad-based positive reaction to our unique women's first positioning. In development for more than 4 years and leveraging our 20-plus years of designing and creating performance gear for women, we revealed our first 3 styles of technical athletic shoes and 1 performance slide to the market.\nThe first of our 4 styles, Blissfeel, began selling on March 22 in North America and Mainland China and the U.K. will launch shortly. The initial guest response to Blissfeel has dramatically exceeded our expectations, not to mention incredible reviews from a number of publications and guests, and we'll have more to share about our footwear at Analyst Day.\nBefore moving on to our omni guest experience pillar, I want to highlight several additional innovations we have teed up in 2022. First, we will continue to lean into our franchise strategy, and you'll see us introduce new silhouettes into our popular defined collections. Next, as guests begin to return to the office into more normalcy in their lives, we will continue to expand our on-the-move collection with new styles of tops and bottoms for men and women planned throughout the year. And finally, I'm very excited that we are advancing our play strategy as well with the launch of our first-ever design for tennis collection available in stores and online beginning this week and our first-ever design for golf collection, which will roll out next week. As you can see, we have ample opportunity to bring new technical solutions to our guests and I'm pleased with how our product pipeline looks going forward.\nSwitching now to our store channel. Total revenue in quarter 4 increased 47% versus last year and 3% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Traffic increased 50% and operating profit expanded significantly versus last year. We were pleased to get off to a promising start during the recent holiday season and then like others, we experienced several consequences of the Omicron variants such as capacity constraints, limits on staff availability and reduced operating hours in some locations. Towards the middle of January, we began to see store traffic improve, and this trend has continued into the first quarter. This acceleration underpins our guidance, which is detailed in our press release, and Meghan will discuss shortly.\nI'm excited by the energy I'm seeing in our stores. In fact, I was able to spend some time with our teams in New York earlier this month, and it was incredible to see our guests once again looking to connect with lululemon in real life and the excitement among our educators to welcome them back into our stores.\nTurning to our e-commerce business. We continue to successfully leverage our investments in our sites and apps over the last 2 years which enhanced the user experience and allowed us to serve even more guests where, when and how they want to shop. Looking forward, we will fuel ongoing growth in both traffic and conversion by continuing to make foundational investments across our digital platform. These will include enhancing our storytelling by adding more content and product comparison, improving inventory accuracy and continuing to make the guest checkout experience more seamless.\nOur omni operating model has served us well through the COVID-19 environment. We were an omni business long before the pandemic hit, and this enables us to continue raising our capabilities across channels to engage with our guests on their terms in new and compelling ways.\nTurning now to MIRROR. In quarter 4, MIRROR performed in line with our revised expectations and for the year, both revenue and dilution were consistent with the guidance we provided. We remain enthusiastic about MIRROR, the opportunities within hybrid fitness and our plans for the platform in 2022 and beyond. We will hold further discussion about MIRROR for our Analyst Day in a few weeks, and I'm excited to share more with you about the evolution of our business and how it will further help build loyalty and community at lululemon.\nBefore handing it over to Meghan, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our international business. While we saw similar impacts from COVID-19 across many of our international markets, our performance remained strong in quarter 4. It's also important to note that we remain in early days of our growth trajectory outside of North America. For the full year 2021, international revenue grew by more than 50% and still represents just 15% of the business, and our EMEA business turned profitable for the first time.\nWe continue to see how well the lululemon brand translates across borders and our plans in the coming year call for approximately 40 new stores opening across our international markets. In quarter 4, we saw a strong performance from every major region with each generating robust double-digit sales growth on a 2-year CAGR basis. In Mainland China, revenue increased more than 60% on a 2-year CAGR basis. After experiencing a slowdown in stores in December related to the COVID-19 variant, we saw an acceleration in January, fueled by our Lunar New Year activation. The Olympics also generated considerable excitement in the region, and we saw a significant lift in traffic that coincided with the games.\nAnd one other data point among many, in Australia, we have begun a store optimization program modeled after our successful approach in North America. Initial guest response to our remodeled stores has been strong, and the program is also helping drive new guest acquisition to our most mature international market. This shows the growth potential for lululemon in both our more mature and relatively new international markets.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Meghan.\n\nMeghan Frank\n\nCFO, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThanks, Calvin.\nWe delivered solid performance in Q4 while navigating supply chain challenges and the impacts of COVID-19. And I'm encouraged that we've seen trends accelerate in Q1. We are positioned well for spring despite the challenges that continue to exist in the macro environment, and I'm excited about what's in store for lululemon in 2022. I'm also thrilled that I'll get the chance to see many of you in person at our Analyst Day next month. We have a new 5-year plan, and I'm looking forward to sharing our updated long-term financial targets with you at that time.\nLet me now share with you the details of our Q4 performance. I will also discuss specifics on our balance sheet, including our inventory and cash position. Please note that the adjusted financial metrics I will share include the operating results of MIRROR that exclude approximately $1.5 million of acquisition-related costs and their associated tax effect in Q4 2021 and $7.8 million of acquisition-related costs and their associated tax effect in Q4 2020. You can refer to our earnings release for more information and reconciliations to our GAAP metrics.\nFor Q4, total net revenue increased 23% to $2.1 billion, in line with our guidance. Comparable sales increased 22% with a 32% increase in stores and a 16% increase in digital. On a 2-year CAGR basis, total revenue increased 23%. In our store channel, sales increased 47% on a 1-year basis and 3% on a 2-year CAGR basis. Productivity was slightly below 2019 levels due to impacts from the Omicron variant, including increased capacity constraints, more limited staff availability and reduced operating hours in certain locations. On average, we had 99% of our stores opened throughout Q4. We currently have 97% open with current closures related to the impact of COVID-19 in China.\nSquare footage increased 14% versus last year, driven by the addition of 53 net new stores since Q4 of 2020. During the quarter, we opened 22 net new stores. In our digital channel, revenues increased 50% on a 2-year CAGR basis and contributed $1 billion of top line or 49% of total revenue. Within North America, revenue increased 21% and within international, we saw a 41% increase, both on a 2-year CAGR basis.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion or 58.1% of net revenue compared to 58.6% of net revenue in Q4 2020 and 58% of net revenue in Q4 2019. The deleverage relative to 2020 was driven by increased air freight expense. Our gross margin increase of 10 basis points relative to 2019 was driven by 120 basis points of leverage on occupancy, depreciation, product team and DC costs and 20 basis points of favorability in foreign exchange, which was partially offset by a 130 basis point decrease in product margin. Q4 product margin included an increase of approximately 530 basis points in air freight related to macro supply chain challenges, without which product margin would have increased versus 2019. I would also note that markdowns declined 110 basis points relative to 2019.\nMoving to SG&A. Our approach continues to be grounded and prudently managing our expenses while also continuing to strategically invest in our long-term growth opportunities. SG&A expenses were $642 million or 30.2% of net revenue compared to 31.5% of net revenue in Q4 2020 and 28.2% of net revenue in Q4 2019. The leverage in the quarter versus Q4 2020 resulted from leverage in our store channel, somewhat offset by increased investments in corporate SG&A. The deleverage relative to Q4 2019 is primarily related to the consolidation of MIRROR's results this year but not in 2019.\nAdjusted operating income for the quarter was $592 million or 27.8% of net revenue compared to 26.9% of net revenue in Q4 2020 and 29.8% of net revenue in Q4 2019. Excluding MIRROR, lululemon-only operating margin increased modestly versus 2019, inclusive of the 530 basis point increase in air freight. Tax expense for the quarter was $156 million or 26.4% of pretax earnings compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 27.4% a year ago. The reduction relative to last year is primarily due to increased deductions for stock-based compensation and a reduction in adjustments upon the filing of certain tax returns.\nAdjusted net income for the quarter was $436 million or $3.37 per diluted share compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.58 in Q4 of 2020 and $2.28 in Q4 of 2019. Capital expenditures were $128 million for the quarter compared to $58 million in the fourth quarter last year. Q4 spend relates primarily to store capital for new locations, relocations and renovations, supply chain investment and technology spend to support our business growth.\nTurning to our balance sheet highlights. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $400 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. Inventory grew 49% versus last year and was $966 million at the end of Q4. Our product teams continue to strategically use air freight to help mitigate industry-wide supply chain issues, with these higher costs having an impact on inventory when looked at on a dollar basis. We also believe that 2019 is the most relevant comparison point given supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic.\nOn a 2-year CAGR basis, unit inventory increased 29% relative to 2019 at the end of Q4 and is well positioned relative to our Q1 2022 top line guidance of a 25% to 26% increase on a 3-year CAGR basis. Again, comparing to 2019. Due to the supply chain issues that existed throughout 2021, we were in an under-inventory position for most of the year and likely could not fulfill all guest demand, which our product teams have taken into account as they have planned merchandise receipts for 2022. In addition, we continue to leverage our core assortment, which makes up approximately 45% of our total inventory.\nLooking forward and grounded in my prior comments, we expect inventory dollars to grow in excess of the 49% 1-year growth rate we experienced at the end of Q4 2021 until the end of the year when the growth rate will begin to moderate. However, when looking at units, we'd expect growth in line with the 29% CAGR at the end of Q4 versus our 3-year CAGR revenue guidance of 23% to 24%.\nIn Q4, we repurchased approximately 844,000 shares at an average price of approximately $381. For the full year, we repurchased 2.2 million shares, returning $813 million to shareholders. By mid-March, we have completed our current authorization, and I'm pleased that our Board has authorized a new $1 billion program. This program is our largest individual authorization ever and speaks to the optimistic view of our future shared by our management team and our Board of Directors.\nBefore discussing our guidance, I'd like to provide an update on MIRROR. As Calvin said, MIRROR performed in line with our expectations in Q4. For the year, revenue and dilution were also in line with our expectations. Looking at 2022, we expect MIRROR will generate revenue in excess of 2021 and dilution will improve. Beyond that, we'll have more to say regarding MIRROR at our Analyst Day, when we're excited to share with you our updated vision for the business.\nLet me shift now to our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2022. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.525 billion to $1.55 billion, representing a 1-year growth rate of 24% to 26% and a 3-year CAGR of 25% to 26%. We expect to open 5 to 10 net new company-operated stores in Q1. I'd also note that store productivity has trended modestly above 2019 levels to date in Q1. We expect gross margin in Q1 to be down 200 to 250 basis points relative to Q1 of 2021. Our Q1 guidance includes an impact of approximately 300 basis points of pressure from air freight costs due to port congestion and capacity constraints.\nIn Q1, we expect SG&A leverage of approximately 200 to 250 basis points relative to 2021. Drivers of the leverage include reduced digital marketing costs at MIRROR and cost efficiencies in both our store and e-commerce channels.\nTurning to EPS. We expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.43 versus adjusted EPS of $1.16 a year ago. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $7.49 billion to $7.615 billion. This range assumes our e-commerce business grows in the mid-teens relative to 2021. When looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a 3-year CAGR of 23% to 24%, which continues to be higher than our 3-year revenue CAGR of 19%, leading up to 2020.\nWe expect to open approximately 70 net new company-operated stores in 2022. This is an increase relative to our recent annual opening cadence and reflects both the benefits and learnings from our pop-up strategy, which enables us to test and identify new markets where strong demand exists for our brand and informs our permanent store opening strategy and guests and insights derived from our digital business. Our new store openings in 2022 will include approximately 40 stores in our international markets and represents a square footage increase in the low 20% range.\nFor the full year, we are forecasting gross margin to decrease between 50 to 100 basis points versus 2021. The reduction relative to last year is driven by increased investment in our DC network and a strategic increase in product development cost for MIRROR. The increased MIRROR cost and gross margin will be offset by a reduction in digital marketing, which flows through SG&A.\nTurning to SG&A for the full year. We are forecasting leverage of 50 to 100 basis points versus 2021 driven by the increased sales and the shift in MIRROR investments I just mentioned. And when looking at operating margin for the full year 2022, we continue to expect modest expansion.\nI also wanted to provide some additional color for the quarters beyond Q1. When looking at revenue, we expect growth in the low 20s on a 3-year CAGR basis in quarters 2 through 4. In terms of gross margin, we are taking into account the dynamic nature of the global supply chain environment, our current thinking regarding air freight usage and the ramp in air freight usage we experienced last year. We currently expect gross margin to decline approximately 200 to 250 basis points versus last year in Q2, declined approximately 100 to 150 basis points versus last year in Q3 and then expand versus last year in Q4.\nIn terms of SG&A, we'd expect it to be relatively flat with 2021 in quarters 2 and 3 and then leverage in Q4. For the full year 2022, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 29%. We expect our tax rate for 2022 to be higher than 2021 as we benefited from some higher tax deductions related to stock-based compensation in 2021. And in 2022, we are expecting to begin accruing for Canadian withholding taxes on earnings, which we aren't able to repatriate on a tax-free basis. For Q1, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 27.5%.\nFor the fiscal year 2022, we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $9.15 to $9.35 versus adjusted EPS of $7.79 in 2021. Our EPS guidance excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million to $625 million for 2022. The increase versus 2021 reflects increased investment in our supply chain, digital capabilities, new store openings and renovation as well as other technology and general corporate infrastructure projects. Notably, we are beginning a new multiyear project to increase our distribution capabilities to support our future volume and growth. And we are also ramping up our square footage growth relative to last year. A range of $600 million to $625 million is approximately 8% of revenue, in line with our current Power of Three target of 68%.\nThank you. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Calvin for some closing remarks.\n\nCalvin R. McDonald\n\nCEO & Director, Lululemon Athletica Inc.\n\nThank you, Meghan.\nAs you can see from these results in the early start to 2022, this is an exciting time for lululemon as we build upon the momentum in the business and the across-the-board performance of our products, channels and markets. We look forward to sharing more with you during our Analyst Day, which will be held in person in New York and available through a live stream. We will go into more details on the strength of the brand and speak to our next 5-year growth plan. And the fact that we have achieved our current growth targets ahead of schedule bodes well for the opportunities ahead.\nIn closing, I want to thank everyone across lululemon for continuing to consistently deliver at such a high level. I'm honored to work alongside each of you as we continue to deliver for our guests, shareholders and one another.\nAnd with that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

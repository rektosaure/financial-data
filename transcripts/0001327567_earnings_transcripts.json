We also note that management is scheduled to participate in the Citi Global TMT Conference this quarter.\nI will now turn the call over to Nikesh.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Hamza. Good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our earnings call. As you can see, we had a strong finish to the fiscal year. We've just closed the landmark quarter, capping a year of disciplined execution and strategic acceleration. Our results this quarter are a direct reflection of a strategy we have been architecting for years. anticipating where the market is going and building the future of cybersecurity before it arrives. This is a moment of conviction, both for us and for our customers. We're to be the first dedicated cybersecurity company to surplus a $10 billion revenue run rate. While this milestone is significant, it is not the ultimate goal. Our focus has already shifted to sorry, excuse me.\nYes, our focus has already shifted to leveraging the scale to define the next decade of cybersecurity. The very fabric of technology is being reowned by AI, creating a vast new and complex attack surface. In this new era, security is no longer a bolt-on. It is a foundational enabler of transformational success. The record-breaking number of platformization deals this quarter demonstrates that customers are not just buying products, they are buying into a strategic partnership. We believe that integrated best-of-breed platforms deliver superior security outcomes and our customers are validating this conviction by making larger, more strategic commitment to us than ever before.\nDue to Q4, many of the deals our teams had been working on during our fiscal year came to fruition. He saw robust activity across the board. In Q4, our bookings growth turned a corner and was the highest we've seen in 2.5 years. This growth is driven by deals across our platforms and also as a result of strong renewals and upsells across our existing portfolio. The robust booking growth was coupled with strong next-generation security IRR and revenue performance. This, coupled with prudent financial management, allowed us to exceed our full year guidance metrics across the board. RPO grew 24% year-over-year in Q4, an acceleration versus the prior year. It is early days, but we see the quality of revenue, ARR and retention is consistently higher across our platform customers. This bodes well for our long-term targets of [ Palo Alto ] Networks platform business. Next-Generation Security ARR grew 32% and net new ARR for the quarter was also up double digits year-on-year. We had strong contributions across our portfolio particularly SASE XSIAM [indiscernible] firewalls. Our investment in software firewalls and SASE are bearing fruit. As our customers end up in a hybrid compute environment across multiple clouds, we expect to continue to see strength in our software firewall business. These offerings each with very large TAMs, continue to gain momentum and reinforce our conviction in achieving $1 billion in next-generation security IRR by FY '30 on a stand-alone basis. This top line growth, coupled with scale effects and our prudent financial management has allowed us once again to expand our operating margin. Additionally, continued debt management of our deferred payments plan portfolio has allowed us to deliver 38% plus free cash flow margins for the third consecutive year. Not just that, we now believe that structurally, we have visibility to go even higher on our free cash flow margins, more from Dipak on this later.\nDemand for cybersecurity remains strong. Our customers are looking to us to help them secure their cloud and AI transformation journeys. We continue to see Gen AI conversations as it becomes imperative for our customers to deploy productivity tools coding tools or revamp their customer systems to enable natural language conversations. All these use cases for AI need to be protected, no pun intended. Our timely acquisition of [indiscernible] AI, which we completed this quarter coupled with our native abilities around our AI firewalls are driving conversations across many platform customers and prospects around securing the AI infrastructure. Adoption of Gen AI is happening faster than any previous technology trend. Recent internal study amongst our customers showed Gen AI are traffic is up over 890% in 2024. Following this, data security incidents related to Gen AI more than doubled since last year.\nWith this rapid adoption of AI comes a new and complex attack surface. That's why in early Q4, we introduced Prisma Airs, industry's most comprehensive AI security platform. [indiscernible] is a unified platform that empowers organizations to deploy AI bravely, by providing end-to-end security across every app, agent model and data set. It closes critical blind spots and secures AI deployments everywhere, ensuring confidence and compliance, but securing the AI you build is only half of the equation. Equally critical side is securing how employees use third-party AI. Our access solutions provides the deep visibility in granular control needed to a safe adoption of those services. We are unique in providing a strategy for both sides of the landscape, each with integrated DLP controls to protect our customers' bill sensitive data. This complete vision is resonating, and we have a strong combined pipeline for AI security offerings. The chart you see here tells a powerful story. It's not just a graph of numbers going up. It's a visual representation of our customers' growing conviction in our strategy. The question is why is this happening because we made a promise to our customers that when they partner with us, they are investing in platforms that are constantly evolving, and we are going to stay ahead of the threat landscape. Time and again, you've seen the future first. We saw it with the technology shift to the next-generation firewall, would you pioneered 17 years ago. You saw it with the move to the cloud and with the rise of SASE, where we're now the clear leader. We saw the inevitable shift from reactive SIM to proactive powered [indiscernible] as well as in XSIAM platform that is now our fastest-growing offering ever. We saw the market's ultimate shift towards the world we define platformization. Integrated platforms that deliver superior security outcomes framework our peers once again on our rushing to imitate. We continue to evolve our platforms and this quarter was no exception. In our network security platform, we announced PANOS 12.1 Orion, which includes new appliances designed to provide an easy path to quantum readiness and multicloud security. We are anticipating it sets of tomorrow, so our customers don't have to. This commitment to future-proofing their investments while we're seeing robust interest in integrated subscriptions like CASB and DLP, building on the launch of Cortex Cloud in Q3, we delivered powerful new capabilities like Application Security Posture Management, or ESPM helping to redefine application security, the demands of AI Air. [indiscernible] into our Cortex Cloud platform, [indiscernible] provides a single source of tooth correlating data from our native scanners and third-party tools to secure the entire AI developer life cycle. This allows our customers to break down the silos between their teams and focus on remediating the critical vulnerabilities that truly matter. And our XM platform continues to expand [indiscernible] mission with new piece time modules like exposure management that proactively identify and fix security caps before attack can never happen. That confidence in translating directly to the optimization traction you see here. These platformization are driving superior financial outcomes for us and better security outcomes to our customers. In Q4, our net retention rate amongst platform customers was an impressive 120% to nearly 0 churn.\nThis is the ultimate proof of the value we deliver and the deep strategic partnerships we are building. As we aim to more than double the number of platformization in the next 5 years, we believe our foundation for sustainable growth becomes stronger. This underpins our confidence in achieving $15 billion of NGSRR on a stand-alone basis by FY 30. The clear validation of our strategy is in the landmark deals we're signing. These are not product sales. These are deep partnerships from -- with the world's leading organizations to transform the security posture. We had 1 of our strongest large deals quarters ever. customers who were $5 million and $10 million in ARR were up approximately 50% year-over-year and $20 million plus our customers are up nearly 80% year-over-year. These types of large multi-platform deals hardly existed a few years ago and showcase our customers' growing commitment to us.\nLet's look at a few examples. A leading global consulting firm signed a deal for $100 million in Q4 and cloud security and SASE, including a purchase of our new AI access security product. The customer lacked identity entitlement controls over AI and cloud environments and also required a comprehensive secure access offerings that could scale globally across its employees, contractors and clients. Our deep relationship with the company C-suite, we're also critical to landing a deal of this size. With this deal, this customer is now fully plateromized and provides us an ARR of $50 million. Next, a leading European bank signed a $60-plus million deal. This customer is going through a significant digital transformation and adopted XSIAM with multiple goals in mind to address an expanding attack surface while simplifying their security stack and keeping costs under control. Platformization was a competitive edge as part of this deal, and we have become a true security partner as now they have 3 platforms with us. Finally, a leading U.S. insurance company purchased $33 million across [indiscernible] and Cloud Security. This customer needed to improve their securities posture, level up their [indiscernible] analysts and drive further automation to reach their goals of 15-minute mean time to contain. This involves using AI, machine learning to assisted analyst teams while also reducing their false positives. In addition to their existing power network spend, this customer is now platformized on network security, cloud and security operations.\nThere's a common theme development across these platform deals. While customers are consolidating and simplifying their security stack in part to optimize costs, the larger benefit comes from the improved security outcomes. This includes faster incident response times, a better user experience and removing the operational burden of stitching together point products. As our customers recognize the value proptomization, they're increasing their commitment to us reaffirming our strategy and vision. Now shifting to network security, which had a strong Q4. Network security continues to account for over 75% of our bookings. Although over the last 5 years, we have transformed the nature of this business. And now over 60% of our network security bookings are driven by software form factors across [indiscernible] virtual firewalls.\nIn addition to having an integrated platform that allows for a consistent pane of glass policy and more than 10 software subscriptions, we also continue to lead the market and gain share across the capabilities as a singular best-of-breed solution of our customer -- if our customers desire. As enterprises look to secure increasingly hybrid workforces and IT environments and AI, we believe our platform is well positioned to allow our customers of any of our products to consolidate on our platform. Our growing mix towards software form factors once again drove better-than-expected growth this quarter. Our software power business had another strong quarter in Q4, with ARR up nearly 20% year-on-year and almost double the total contract value. As a result of the strong showing of our software firewalls and with our steady growth in hardware, slightly ahead of industry growth, we saw product revenue growth of 19% year-over-year, which is market leading in its category at scale.\nOur software for market share is nearly 50%, and our product is native in all major public clouds. This quarter, we signed a $60 million deal, significantly expanded our partnership with a leading U.S.-based cloud provider. All in, we generated 9 figures and deals across the major cloud service providers in Q4. As I shared earlier, we're also building momentum in AI runtime security with Prisma [indiscernible] as customers look to secure the growing AI attack surface in Q4. This included an 8-figure deal with a global professional services company with a strong pipeline, we see an opportunity for Air to become a growing contributor in the next 5 years. We also continue to gain share in hardware firewalls. As mentioned earlier, this past week, we launched PAN OS 12.1 Orion and newer appliances designed to provide an easy part to quantum safe and multicloud security. We saw modest improvements in hardware demand in Q4, but expect this will continue to be a mid-single-digit grower in FY '26. All in, our next-generation network security business, which includes software form factors like SASE and [indiscernible] firewalls, reached $3.9 billion in ARR, up approximately 35% year-on-year. We believe this makes us the largest and fastest-growing next-generation network security player at scale. Speaking of SASE, this continues to be our fastest-growing product in network security. As customers transform the networks to keep pace with delivering first-class security capabilities for remote users and branch offices, we continue to see strong growth for SASE.\nMany SASE projects are large and transformational, which is well suited for our comprehensive enterprise-focused expertise. This quarter, we won our largest SaaS delever, a $60 million contract with a global professional services firm covering nearly 200,000 seats. This was in addition to a record number of 8-figure SASS deals. We're gaining share. For the last year, we displaced incumbent SASE vendors in over 70 accounts exceeding $200 million in TCV. Our SaaS ARR grew 35% year-over-year more than twice as fast as the overall market. We now have over 6,300 SASE customers and account for 1/3 of the Fortune 500. Meanwhile, the drivers of our SASE growth are broadening. This quarter, we, once again, saw a particular strength in Prisma Access Browser. The browser is becoming the new operating system for the enterprise. The primary interface for AI and cloud applications. Securing it is not optional. We sold over 3 million licenses in Q4 alone, resulting in our cumulative seat count more than doubling on a sequential basis to over $6 million. Notable deals include an over $3 million transaction, the leading U.S. pharmaceutical company who purchased [indiscernible] browser for over 80,000 seats. We are beginning to see browser wars as we see the adoption of AI. Understandably, this is a requirement as we march towards agent. Interestingly, it will become impossible to allow employees access to nonsecure browsers in the future. And as more and more critical applications and data side within the browser, it naturally becomes a target for cyber attacks. Prisma Access browsers built in controls and real-time visibility are designed to help ensure that sensitive data remains safeguarded during browsing sessions regardless of the user's location or the application they're accessing. And we believe it is strategically positioned to be the future of [indiscernible] enabling secure and productive work in an AI-driven world. We expect to see browsers become an integral part of the SSI stack for all of our customers.\nMoving on to Cortex & Cloud, we saw broad-based strength in Cortex & Cloud as well with combined ARR up nearly 25% year-over-year in Q4. For years, the industry has been stuck in an old SIM paradigm, collecting logs, writing rules and overwhelming analysts alerts. We saw the writing on the wall, this model is not sustainable in the HAI power attacks. It's a battle that humans alone cannot win, and our customers are seeing it too. IM -- our autonomous SOC platform and our fastest-growing product ever, is modernizing and disrupting the SOC market AI, and we continue to see amazing milestones. This includes reducing customers' meantime to respond from weeks to minutes.\nToday, over 60% of deployed customers site meantime respond in under 10 minutes. We ended Q4 with approximately 400 customers on IM and the average ARR per customer continues to be over $1 million. Nearly 1/4 of XSIAM customers are represented in the Global 2000, creating a marquee list of referenceable customers across a number of major industries. [indiscernible] saw deals over $1 million growth 30% year-on-year. As we continue to build on our industry recognition, we are seeing opportunities in larger accounts. I also want to highlight the growing significance of Cortex Cloud.\nAs the market shifts from static posture management, the urgent needs for real-time runtime security, our thesis on the convergence of cloud, security and security operations is proving correct once again. This is when where we are fundamentally different from the competition. While others may offer a strong cloud posture tool or a separate SIM, we're the only ones to natively unify a best-in-class SNAP with our AI-powered SOC platform. This allows our customers to move beyond simply reporting on misconfiguration instead actively stopping cloud attacks in real time. Cortex Cloud allows our customers to not only shift left to secure applications during development, but also shield right, protect them in production. The platform is already gaining significant validation. It was recently praised for its ability to fully secure the entire life cycle of cloud-native applications and has achieved [indiscernible] authorization, a critical guidential for our public sector customers. This product set is designating with the market. And early interest has driven a strong pipeline, spending hundreds of customers who understand they need just top cloud attacks in real time. Our platforms are powerful data-centric engine for organic innovation. Our core thesis is that the integrated data we capture from across network, cloud and security operations is the ground truth needed for a whole variety of security use cases. For AI to be effective, it needs this complete contextual data. a capability unique to our platform approach. This massive data stream is what makes our exon platform so effective in its primary wartime mission of stopping active threats. But as the slide illustrates, we are now leveraging the same powerful data to expand into new peacetime missions. By applying our AI to this rich data set, we are organically creating new modules and expanding into new TAMs like exposure management and e-mail security. This represents an $18 billion opportunity for us in fiscal year 2026 and beyond. We see significant upsell opportunities from these modules as they attach to larger EXIM deals. We're encouraged by the early customer feedback on these new capabilities. This is our data to market engine in action, allowing us to explore new frontiers and security and deliver continuous value to our platform customers. To close, exiting FY '25, as strong organic momentum as we march along our path to that $15 billion target. Our bookings and ARPU accelerated this quarter, driven by large deal traction and a sharp focus on excellence and execution. The results of our customer-centric strategy are clear. We're seeing more customers platformize with us than ever before, not just to save money, but achieve a level of security that a fragmented approach simply cannot provide in any high driven world. This realization, that platformization is the way forward is also the engine behind our strong Q4 results and our confident outlook. We see broad-based strength across our network security, cloud and SecOps segment and a strong pipeline as a majority of core sellers are now equipped to sell across multiple platforms.\nThe strong early traction with Prisma AIRS and with our relentless focus on innovation, we believe, Palo Alto Networks can be the ideal partner to help organizations achieve and secure the real transformation goals. However, before I hand over to Dipak, let me also talk about what we see for FY '26.\nLooking ahead, we have multiple tailwinds driving our business in FY '26 and beyond. In network security, -- they have growing demand for software files and SASE, which continue to grow well above the market. The higher mix of software gives us confidence in sustainability of double-digit product revenue growth in FY '26. We have multiple newer products contributing to our growth. including Prisma airs, secure browsers, each with large pipelines. In Cortex, Exim continues to deliver rapid growth at Scale. AI is transforming the SOC, and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on when. Our migration to Cortex Cloud continues to progress. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize as the market evolves from posture management to real-time security for AI. Of course, we've heard the market, and it's clear our customers are asking for a comprehensive security platforms.\nOver the last 7 years, I have been asked often, why are we not a player in identity. And for the longest of time, I believe that I was not at an inflection point. But as we saw the emergence of Agentic-AI, as we saw AI getting mass adoption, we're beginning to reach conviction that the identity market will inflect in the next 12 to 24 months. If you believe that we have been able to identify inflections in a good way at pilot networks, it is important for you to believe that we have this one right as well. Similar to our roots and network, identity is a key enforcement point for enterprise security. Unlike most of the forms of security, like network firewalls, identity is also a real-time product. And because of this, we believe that the future for Identity will actually be owned by somebody who is well prepared to take on the challenges of identity going forward as opposed to a new player.\nHence, we have diverged from our original approach of going and buying first-in-market best-of-breed products to go and own market or our categories. Instead, we believe the future in this category is going to belong to somebody who's already established a strong reputation and is a leader in identity security. As the [indiscernible] for deployment agents makes previous access more important, we believe security, not [indiscernible] focused at vendors are best positioned to address emerging needs and that growth in [indiscernible] and sensors will further solidify category leaders like CyberArk Second, with 90% of our breaches involving stolen or mismanaged credentials, every user machine, an AI agent should be considered a privileged user rather than just a small set of IT administrators. CyberArk's reach extends to over 8 million privileged end users and over 50% of the 4,500, the right product strategy and go-to-market acceleration from Palo Alto Networks.\nWe believe CyberArk will be able to both deepen their penetration in PAM and target a significantly larger base of global IAM users and machine identities. Thirdly, the identity industry is lacking a broader platform. Today, over 100 vendors are in to capture the customers' attention across multiple functional domains. These domains are converging as the complexity of stitching together disparate solutions and the rise in identity-related breaches push enterprises to favor better integration. We believe but all took an accelerated CyberArk platform vision as they look to expand across multiple identity domains by combining their leadership in identity security with our industry-leading AI-powered security platforms and our platformization approach coupled with our go-to-market we will be able to offer the most complete integrated security solution in the market. We're building an evergreen security company that will define the industry for decades to come. After many detailed conversations, we have strategic alignment with the CyberArk team and a common culture of innovation. Following the close of transaction, we will optimize our combined go-to-market resources and continue to lead innovation.\nTo provide some context, we have nearly 10x the number of core sellers, and they see an opportunity to expand CyberArk's presence into our much larger 75,000 customer base. Overall, we believe this accelerates our mission to double the value of our joint businesses over the next 5 years. We are strategically entering this category now to define the next chapter of cybersecurity for the AI era. We look forward to providing more details on our strategy once we close to transaction.\nBefore I hand over to Dipak, I want to take a moment to speak from the heart on the important leadership announcement we made today. Our founder, our first innovator and a true titan of this industry in [indiscernible] has decided to retire off for more than 20 years. When you think about all the networks, it think of near, it is impossible to overstate [indiscernible] impact. He didn't just start a company. He started revolution with the next-generation firewall forever changing the security landscape. Personally, it has been a privilege to call him a partner in the front. The relentless competitive fire that defines our culture, that is his legacy. It is in our DNA. His legacy isn't just in our products, it isn't on people. So [indiscernible] on behalf of every single 1 of us, thank you. This marks a seamless and natural transition as he passed [indiscernible], who will now serve as both Chief Product and Technology Officer and as a member of our board. For years, almost as many as [indiscernible], Lee has been the chief architecture of our product strategy, masterfully turning our vision into the industry-leading platforms we have today. appointing to him as both CP and CTO and to our Board of Directors is a reflection of the profound trust we have in his leadership. This ensures the soul of our innovation not only continues but accelerates into the future. With that, let me pass on to Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide you with financial highlights of Q4. You can review the detailed results in our press release and in the supplemental financial information on our website. In Q4 '25, total revenue was $2.54 billion and grew 16% and above the high end of our guided range. Within total revenue, product revenue grew 19%, driven by growth in software form factors, while total services revenue grew 15%. Within total services, subscription revenue grew 17% and support revenue rose 11%. In the fourth quarter, 56% of product revenue was from software form factors a significant driver of product revenue growth year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, the proportion of our product revenue from software surpassed 40%, driven by growth in our software firewall form factors and Panos SD-WAN.\nWe continue to see firewall appliance growth in line with the ranges that we have described in past periods, namely 0% to 5%. Moving on to geographies. We saw double-digit growth across all theaters with the Americas growing 15%, EMEA up 19% and [indiscernible] growing 13%. We saw strength across our major verticals and saw a year-over-year bookings growth improvement in our Public Sector business. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, grew 24% to $15.8 billion. This was our highest RPO growth in 7 quarters at a significantly larger scale. Our current RPO was $7.0 billion, growing 17% year-over-year.\nAs Nikesh noted, we saw customers making significant commitments to our platforms in Q4 as reflected by a large deal volume, net new platformization and RPO growth. Contract duration in the quarter increased slightly on both the year-over-year and the quarter-over-quarter basis but remains within our historical range at approximately 3 years. Turning to next-generation security ARR, where we continue to see very healthy growth. We ended the quarter at $5.58 billion in NGS ARR, which grew 32%. Q4 NGS ARR included approximately $17.5 million in support where customers also purchased Strada cloud manager. For context, this AI-powered unified management platform, which utilizes rich telemetry to deliver deeper insights into threats, a significantly improved user experience and much faster mean time to resolve issues for our customers. We expect this to be a growing contributor going forward but remain immaterial to total NGS ARR. We added approximately $490 million in net new NGS ARR in Q4, up 12% from a year ago.\nOur momentum was broad-based this quarter. Notable growth drivers included software firewalls, SASE and XSIAM. AI ARR is now approximately $545 million in Q4, up over 2.5x year-over-year. Moving down the income statement. Total gross margin was 75.8%. Product gross margin was 76.8%, and as we close fiscal '25, we undertook a comprehensive review of our inventory, leading to Palo Alto Networks taking a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and spares. This was a deliberate and prudent step taking a disciplined and conservative view of our product life cycle. This action solidifies our balance sheet and ensures we're well positioned into fiscal '26 and beyond. That being said, we expect product gross margins of fiscal year '26 to increase relative to '25 and be in the high 70s or low 80s. As I have mentioned in prior quarters, we've been transitioning our primary manufacturing and fulfillment center to a contract manufacturing facility in Texas to provide us with the benefit from scale and innovation as well as to take advantage of a foreign trade zone that can help us mitigate the impact of any potential tariffs on products we ship to international customers and destinations. We continue to believe that we differentiate ourselves in the industry by being the only pure-play cybersecurity firm to assemble all of our hardware in the U.S.A. at scale. As a result, the impact to tariffs of our business have been immaterial. Total services gross margin was 75.5%, a slight sequential increase in Q3 and we are pleased by the sustained growth in our SaaS offerings and are executing on cloud cost efficiencies, including engaging with our cloud service providers to negotiate favorable procurement arrangements as the scale of our cloud host products continues to grow.\nWe continue to deliver profitable growth through the expansion of operating margins, which encompasses the gross margins that I just discussed. In Q4, we expanded operating margins by 340 basis points and delivered operating margins above 30% for the first time in the company's history. On an annual basis, operating margins of 28.8% and came in above the high end of our guided range as we drove scale and efficiencies across sales and marketing, R&D and G&A. Diluted non-GAAP EPS was $0.95 and also came in ahead of the high end of our guided range. Turning to the balance sheet. You will see that our debt balance came down by $383 million as our 2025 convertible notes reached maturity in June of this year. These notes were settled in cash and equity in Q4. We did not repurchase any shares in Q4, and our buyback strategy remains opportunistic. We have $1 billion in authorization remaining through December 2025.\nAs many of you have heard from me in the past, we are focused on delivering profitable growth. And every decision we make is made within the context of maximizing long-term total shareholder return. For that reason, I'm extremely proud that Palo Alto Networks has delivered results that were above the rule of 50 for the last 5 years. We are unique in our ability to deliver top line growth with leading free cash flow margins at a level that is best-in-class among scaled enterprise software companies. As you will see shortly, we expect to once again be above the Rule of 50 in fiscal year '26.\nAs Nikesh discussed, our ability to deliver sustained growth can be attributed to both our continued focus on innovation, and our platformization strategy, which is driving bigger deals for us and better outcomes for our customers. On the free cash flow side of the equation, we've been able to expand our operating margins, providing a higher floor for our free cash flow, while improving our visibility to set cash flows. Critical to our ability to be a continued Rule of 50 company has been the scalability of our business across every line item of the P&L. Since fiscal '22, we've expanded our operating margins by almost 1,000 basis points, and we expect to continue to deliver expanded operating efficiencies in fiscal year '26 and beyond. Our ability to expand operating margins have enabled us to deliver sustained high free cash flow margins while steadily managing an increase in demand for deferred payments. We've been moving through this transition since fiscal '21. And as we lap deals with deferred payments from prior period, we have an increased visibility into our future free cash flows. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered $3.5 billion of free cash flow at 38% margin in fiscal year '25. We had visibility to approximately 40% of that free cash flow from deferred payments on deals signed prior to the fiscal year. We continued through this transition to deferred payments in [indiscernible] and we expect about half of our fiscal '26 free cash flow to come from deferred payment deals signed in [indiscernible] or earlier. Looking forward, we continue to see future free cash flow supported by ongoing operating margin expansion and a continued smooth transition to deferred payments. Specific to that topic, we continue to see increasing demand for annual payments, particularly on larger deals, we're absorbing this transition whilst maintaining our best-in-class adjusted free cash flow margins and guiding 26% adjusted free cash flow margin of 38% to 39%.\nWith that, let me turn to guidance. The Q1 '26 and fiscal year '26 guidance I will provide is for Palo Alto on a stand-alone basis and does not include any anticipated impact on the proposed acquisition of CyberArk announced on July 30, 2025. For the fiscal year 2026, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $7.0 billion to $7.10 billion, an increase of 26% to 27%. And remaining performance obligation of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion, an increase of 17% to 18%. And revenue to be in the range of $10.47 billion to $1.525 billion, an increase of 14%; operating margins to be in the range of 2.2% to 2.7%, and diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.85, an increase of 12% to 15% and adjusted free cash flow margin in the range of 38% to 39%. For the first fiscal quarter of 2026, we expect NGS to be in the range of $5.82 billion to $5.84 billion, an increase of 29% and remaining performance obligation of $15.4 billion to $15.5 billion, an increase of 23%, revenue to be in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.47 billion, an increase of 15% and and diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.90, an increase of 13% to 15%. We've included our modeling points in the presentation for your review, but I would like to highlight 2 areas: Firstly, we expect Q1 '26 product revenue growth to be approximately 20% and and we expect fiscal year 2016 product revenue growth to be in the low teens. This is largely driven by strength in our software form factors within product revenue. Furthermore, we expect our top line seasonality to continue to be second half and Q4 weighted as we continue to platformize with our customers. Finally, I'd like to give an update around our financial expectations for the combined Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk. As you can see, we are pursuing this acquisition from a position of strength and are excited about our integration efforts post close. Based on our continued operating margin expansion and visibility of free cash flow and our continued smooth transition to deferred payments, we're targeting adjusted free cash flow of 40% plus for the combined company in fiscal '28, the first full year post integration. This target assumes the impact of M&A-related synergies we intend to provide more details on the full scope of synergies post the closing of the transaction, which we continue to expect will happen in the second half of fiscal year '26.\nWe're excited about the outcomes of the combined Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk businesses will deliver from a security perspective as well as from a TSR perspective for the shareholders of both companies. With that, I will turn over to [indiscernible] for Q&A.",

We also note that management is scheduled to participate in the Bank of America Technology Conference this quarter.\nI will now turn the call over to Nikesh.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Hamza. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our earnings call. I'm delighted with our Q3 results. We continue to make progress on our platformization strategy while releasing a number of unique innovations in Q3 that set the pace for our industry. It is becoming increasingly clear that as organizations aspire to simplify and modernize their security architectures in the age of AI with data at the center our strategy is resonating, resulting in larger deals. Most notably, we crossed an important milestone of $5 billion in next-generation security ARR up 34% year-over-year, delivering industry-leading growth at scale. Our net new ARR growth also showed positive momentum in the third quarter. .\nWe believe we've reached an inflection point in our next-generation security story. As a growing majority of our incremental growth this year is derived from our AI-powered XSIAM, Sassy and software firewalls. These offerings with large TAMs should help underpin your confidence in the sustainability of our NGS AR growth as we march towards our $15 billion ARR target for FY '30.\nOn profitability front, Q3 continues to show the leverage in our business model. As we drive efficiencies from our scale and benefit from the economies of larger, multiproduct deals in addition to continuing to drive AI efficiency benefits slowly and steadily. We also generated healthy free cash flow while continuing to manage our transition from a billing focus to RPO. As such, we remain confident in achieving our adjusted free cash flow margin targets over the next few years.\nLet's be clear, you can't walk around a street corner or conference without hearing the words AI. The urgency adopt AI is omnipresent in all of our customers. It no longer seems to be a choice. It is becoming a strategic imperative for every customer as the risk of an action is too high. During every conference, every customer conversation, the topic of AI transformation is more and more frequent. And now the conversation is shifting to Agentic AI. What's fascinating is this is actually creating a higher sense of urgency amongst our customers to undertake their technology transformation, transformations that require a fundamental change in the infrastructure.\nTraditional IT architectures won't build scale, speed or complexity of AI to truly capitalize on the AI's potential, enterprises need modern cloud-delivered platforms that can ingest vast amounts of data and operate in real time at scale. We've seen customers who are previously delaying their cloud migrations are now reaccelerating their investment. This is good news for cybersecurity. And as the AI becomes more deeply integrated into our customers' businesses, the need to protect the underlying data models and infrastructure will become parallel.\nOver the next year, an estimated more than $300 billion will be spent on AI infrastructure alone. That kind of spend on just power models. You saw the video of we opened with Glen and we're hard at work enabling secure adoption of this next wave AI-powered applications. This is precisely why industry must change the paradigm, shifting away from today's fragmented security landscape and to consolidation. The cost of fragmentation is friction. Friction causes latency. Latency is the enemy of real-time cybersecurity. Now more than ever, bringing data together into a unified platform is critical. At its core, security is a data problem.\nWe believe our depth and breadth of data is amongst the largest in the industry and is something that point solutions simply cannot access. This leads to superior threat detection efficacy, reduce false positives and faster incident response times. All critical metrics for our customers and key drivers of our market leadership.\nThe volume and complexity of threats are not slowing down either. Bad actors using AI to move faster than ever. Recently, our Unit 42 team was able to simulate an entire ransomware attack in under 25 minutes using AI at every stage of the attack chain. That's a staggering increase in speed, powered entirely by AI.\nOver a year ago, we doubled down on our platformization strategy. We're pleased with the large deal momentum we've had since and the endorsement of our strategy broadly across the industry. Our platform approach is working well with customers slowly and steadily. Our approach, which favors better and speedier security outcomes and lower cost of emership is being adopted by more and more of our customers. In Q3, we delivered over 19 net new platformization deals and now have a total of approximately 1,250 platformization within our top 5,000 customers. Digging deeper, the number of customers of multiple platformization grew nearly 70% earner in Q3. In particular, the number of customers platformize on Cortex was up nearly 3x, reflecting strong momentum with XSIAM.\nTeal-roll growth and largest customers also reinforces our success. We had 130 customers with over $5 million in NGS ARR in Q3, up over 40% year-over-year and 44 customers is over $10 million in NGS ARR, up over 60%. To give more color on what these platformization look like, I want to take a look at a few examples from Q3. Of particular note, beyond the size and scope of our deals is the customer's ability to consolidate a significant number of products with Palo Alto Networks, a leading global consulting firm signed a transaction worth over $90 million in Q3. This customer platformized on Cortex for XSIAM, replacing a legacy incumbent SIM provider. Our differentiated value was centered in our ability to materially reduce mean time to respond.\nWe also reduced costs by consolidating a total of 4 products in this deal. As a result, our NCR as customer nearly doubled year-over-year. A leading financial services company signed a $46 million transaction with us. The customer recognized the value of XSIAM and consolidated 4 products with us, including the displacement of their well-established EDR and SIM vendors. Beyond XSIAM, the customer also expanded and extended their platformization on our network security program in the quarter.\nOur U.S. financial services firm signed a $32 million transaction with us. This customer platformize our network security and consolidated cloud security vendors, driven by a company mandate to consolidate their security tools and reduce complexity in their cybersecurity stack. In this deal, they consolidated 4 products.\nNow moving on -- so an update on Cortex. As you can tell from earlier comments, I'm particularly about the momentum we're seeing with XSIAM, which saw accelerating growth in Q3. XSIAM is not only our fastest-growing product ever, it is now more impactful to our overall growth rate. I believe that from a strategic perspective, XSIAM has the potential of being the game changer for both the industry and Palo Alto Networks. In the first innings, of baseball, not Cricket of transforming the cybersecurity industry with XSIAM. By consolidating security data into a single AI-driven SOC platform, XSIAM is modernizing and disrupting the traditional SIEM market, we're continuing to see amazing milestones including customers mean time to respond from weeks to minutes. As security teams face growing complexity and talent shortages, we believe XSIAM is well positioned to be operating system for modern SecOps.\nThe numbers speak for themselves. We now have approximately 270 customers in XSIAM and the average ARR per customer is over $1 million. This already makes it one of the most successful products in the history of cybersecurity. What's even more remarkable is that we've generated -- reached this level of adoption and impact just 30 months after XSIAM was made available to customers. XSIAM ARR grew over 200% year-over-year in Q3, nearly twice as fast as our closest next-generation SIEM competitor. On a trailing 12-month basis, XSIAM bookings are now approaching $1 billion.\nAbout 3 years into our XSIAM journey, our sustained strong momentum bolsters our confidence in a long growth runway as we increasingly tap into this estimated $40 billion SecOp STAM. Last quarter, we unveiled Cortex Cloud, our breakthrough in unifying cloud posture and stock operations. Over the last 3 months, we have seen strong early customer interest in Cortex Cloud, the 9-figure pipeline, spanning hundreds of customers.\nThis quarter, we also announced 2 products that will enhance our ability to further expand XSIAM and it's capability. XSIAM once deployed, has become the foundational security data platform for customers. We now understand the data we're capturing in this -- is the data you actually need for a whole variety of use cases. In April, we launched advanced e-mail security to help stop threats before the resin box and our exposure management capability was launched as well designed to cut through the noise and focus security teams on the risks that truly matter.\nThat's not all. Think of XSIAM is our data to market engine. Every bit on nearly 12 petabytes of telemetry in just daily around cloud identity endpoints in e-mail and more act as high octane fuel. This massive data stream isn't just powering XSIAM, it's igniting our ability to identify and accelerate our entry into entirely new markets, unlocking additional TAM in the tens of billions, we're now uniquely positioned to address. Through our comprehensive understanding of data sources and broad data ingestion capabilities, or beginning to deliver solutions using multiple content capabilities of XSIAM.\nEvery piece of telemetry we ingest makes our platform smarter. The more data we put in, the further our engine can go. And the smarter it gets. The faster we can build an trillion capabilities on top of it. We're encouraged by the early customer feedback and look forward to continuing to discuss this more in the future.\nNow shifting our focus to network security. We continue to lead the market in security and in share across all 3 best-to-breed form factors. As enterprises into securely increasingly secure hybrid workforces and IT environments spanning headquarters, branch offices, data center on the cloud, we're uniquely positioned with a consistent security architecture. In Q3, our product revenue grew 16% year-over-year. This growth was broad-based, with software continuing to increase in the overall mix. We also saw stable demand in the appliance market.\n-- ARR grew approximately 20% year-over-year in Q3 with public cloud deployments continuing to be the primary driver. AI is accelerating cloud adoption, and we believe this trend will expand the long-term need for software firewalls that scaled modern workloads.\nShifting to SASE, which continues to be our fastest-growing forte in network security and a strong contributor to our overall growth. As customers transform their network to keep pace with delivering first-class security capabilities for remote users and branch offices, we continue to see robust growth for SASE. Many SASE projects are large and comprehensive, which is well suited to our rich offering and enterprise In Q3, our SASE ARR grew 36% year-over-year, more than twice as fast as the overall market and ahead of our key SASE competitors. Furthermore, 40% of new SASE customers were net new to Palo Alto Networks in Q3. We now have approximately 6,000 SASE customers, up 22% year-over-year.\nMeanwhile, the drive momentum are broadening. This quarter, we saw particularly -- particular strength in Prisma Access browser, which again accounted for 1/3 of our Prisma Access seats sold in the quarter. In just 18 months since our talent acquisition, we have now sold approximately 3 million license seats on Prisma Access Browser, up more than [ 10x ] from a year ago and we have a healthy 9-figure pipeline.\nAs AI drives more data and applications to the cloud, the browser is becoming the primary interface to accessing these resources, acting as the application runtime environment. The operating system in this scenario becomes less about local resources and more about securely connecting to and managing cloud-based services. And as more and more critical applications, data reside within the browser environment, it naturally becomes the target of cyber attacks. Prisma Access Browser's native controls and real-time visibility are designed to help ensure that sensitive data remains safeguarded during browsing sessions regardless of the user location or the application they're accessing. And we believe Prisma Access Browser is strategically positioned to be the future and enabling secure and productive work in an evolving AI-driven world.\nNow shifting to our newly launched Prisma AIRS or AI On Time Security. As I mentioned earlier, it's more important than ever to bring data together in order to leverage AI and enable customers to stay ahead of the attackers. We're also seeing customers demand for us to help them secure their AI transformation journey. In this mad rush for AI in the industry, many of our customers are experimenting with the AI. At Palo Alto Networks itself, our teams are leveraging over 35 models across multiple products, each of which and the artifacts need to be discovered, scanned, constantly tested and protected against. Prisma AIRS allows for just that. It helps enterprises discover, scan and test all the artifacts to ensure they're safe. It allows for a world-class data security posture deployment and once in production, it ensures that applications using AI are constantly monitored and any security flows are both protected against as well as remediated across the enterprise. Prisma AIRS extends our existing capability in posture management and runtime security and will add security for AI agents in the future. And we announced the intent to acquire Protect AI, an early innovative leader in security for AI providing AI model scanning in the red teaming to further bolster our capabilities.\nCustomer interest has been strong. We currently are in conversation with hundreds of prospects and already have an 8-figure pipeline since making the announcement last month.\nIn summary, we see strong momentum heading into our fiscal year-end, driven by continued transformation, and we look for our first north of $4 billion quarter. We see strong desire for consolidation and the desire to implement AI securely, including a robust Q4 pipeline. We continue to take share across multiple security categories driving strong growth in NGS ARR at an industry-leading scale. Our strategy translates into tangible business benefit for customers, including a strong security posture and improved operational efficiency throughout -- through vendor consolidation.\nAs our relentless focus on innovation, we believe Palo Alto Networks is the ideal partner to help organizations achieve and secure their AI transformation goals. I'm particularly proud for our teams for driving phenomenal success in the Q3, which was fraught with geopolitical discussion state discussions yet our teams kept our heads down and continue setting up for what we hope will be a great Q4.\nLet me hand it over to Dipak to review the quarterly results in detail.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide you with highlights of Q3. You can review the details within our press release and the supplemental financial information on our website.\nIn Q3, total revenue was $2.29 billion and grew 15% at the high end of our guided range. Within total revenue, product revenue grew 16%, while total services revenue grew 15%. Within total services, subscription revenue grew 18% and support revenue rose 10%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the proportion of our product revenue from software is approaching 40%, driven by our growth in our virtual form factors and SD-WAN. We continue to see stable demand for firewall appliances with market growth in the 0% to 5% range as we have discussed previously.\nMoving on to geographies. We saw double-digit growth across all theaters with the Americas growing 12%, EMEA up 20% and JPAC growing 23%. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, grew 19% to $13.5 billion. Our current RPO was $6.2 growing 16% year-on-year. The average duration of new contracts remained at approximately 3 years, contract duration decrease on both the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Customers continue to make significant commitments to Palo Alto Networks through our platformization deals, particularly when XSIAM to transform their security operations center.\nWe continue to see increasing demand for annual payments, particularly deals over $1 million, but we are absorbing this transition while maintaining the high end of our fiscal year '25 annual adjusted free cash flow margin guidance, as well as reiterating confidence in our adjusted free cash flow margin targets of 37% plus in fiscal year '26 and '27. In line with what we talked about earlier in the year, we saw a year-over-year increase in bookings went into annual billings in Q3 and a decrease in deals leveraging with a neutral impact on cash flow.\nTurning to next-generation security ARR. As Nikesh highlighted, we surpassed the $5 billion mark in Q3 and ended the quarter at $5.09 billion in NGS ARR, a growth of 34%. Within NGS ARR, we continue to see significant momentum around our Cortex platform and our AI ARR is now approximately $400 million in Q3, up over 2.5x year-over-year.\nI'm particularly excited about trends driving the NGS ARR, and I wanted to provide some additional insights around the evolution of our net new NGS ARR. We've made a number of significant investments over the last several years to both continue to lead the network security market as well as build leadership positions in new markets. You've seen the results of this effort in our NGS ARR. Over the last several years, in network security, we invested in advanced cloud-delivered versions of our subscriptions that attach to our appliances. We saw strong adoption of these advanced subscriptions as customers saw the value of adding these to their existing network security deployments, and this is meaningful -- and this has driven meaningful NGS ARR growth.\nIn addition, we have NGS product offerings beyond those advanced subscriptions in new markets across network security, cloud security and security operations. We refer to those as our new market offerings as they are also fueled our NGS ARR growth.\nWe continue to see momentum from our advanced subscriptions of fiscal year '25, driving a healthy and relatively consistent level of net new ARR compared to prior years. At the same time, we've seen our net new NGS ARR from new market offerings grow significantly and becoming a larger proportion of our total net new NGS ARR dollars. This is a result of our strengthened position in these markets. Our La Dale's team becoming more adept at selling these offerings and platformization taking hold with our customers and in the industry. As we look forward, we expect to see the new market business to be the stronger driver of net new ARR dollars. It is this dynamic that gives us confidence in our long-term targets.\nMoving down the income statement. Total gross margin was 76%. Product gross margin was 78.4% in the quarter. As a reminder, we have been transitioning to a contract manufacturing facility in Texas as our primary manufacturing and performance center to benefit from scale and innovation as well as to take advantage of a foreign trade zone that can help us mitigate tariffs in products that we ship to international destinations. As we said on our previous call, we continue to believe that we differentiate ourselves by being the only pure-play cybersecurity firm at scale to assemble all of our hardware in the U.S.A. As a result, tariff impact has been immaterial. We expect product gross margins to remain in the high 70% or low 80% margins in Q4.\nOur total services gross margin was 75.4%. We are excited to see continued strong adoption of our SaaS offerings. We continue to execute on cloud cost efficiencies, including engaging with our key cloud service providers to negotiate favorable procurement arrangements as the scale of our cloud-hosted products continues to increase. Encompassing those gross margin dynamics, we continue to focus on executing our operating margin targets, which delivered year-over-year improvements in operating margin. As I have often said, our business scales well across every single line item of the P&L. On an operating expense as a percentage of revenue basis, we saw 340 basis points of year-over-year leverage this quarter as we drove scale and efficiencies across sales and marketing, R&D and G&A.\nWe delivered $0.80 of diluted non-GAAP EPS and diluted GAAP EPS of $0.37, our 12th consecutive quarter of positive GAAP EPS. We generated $578 million in adjusted free cash flow in Q3.\nTurning to the balance sheet. You will see that our debt balance came down by $151 million as we continue to see early conversion of our convertible debt, which occurred at the discretion of the debt holders and were settled by us in cash and equity. As a reminder, our convertible notes reached final maturity in June and our convertible notes can no longer be early converted. We will settle the remaining convertible debt in cash and equity in Q4.\nAs Nikesh mentioned, we announced our intention to acquire PROTECT AI for a total consideration of $700 million in cash and replacement equity awards. We expect the transaction to close by our first quarter of fiscal year 2026. We did not repurchase any shares in Q3 and our buyback strategy remains opportunistic. We have $1 billion in authorization remaining through December 2025.\nWith that, let me turn to guidance. For the fiscal year 2025, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $5.52 billion to $5.57 billion, an increase of 31% to 32%. Remaining performance obligation of $15.2 billion to $15.3 billion, an increase of 19% to 20%. Revenue to be in the range of $9.17 billion to $9.19 billion, an increase of 14%, operating margins to be in the range of 28.2% to 28.5%, our diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.26 to $3.28 per share, an increase of 15%. Adjusted free cash flow margin in the range of 37.5% to 38%. As we noted last quarter, we do expect a higher Q4 contribution to our annual free cash flow. And for Q4, specifically, 80% of the collections are from deals that have already been booked.\nOur annual cash flow seasonality is more second half and Q4 weighted this year influenced by the timing of deferred payments from customers that signed deals in prior periods and the timing of bookings within the year. For the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $5.52 to $5.57, an increase of 31% to 32%. Remaining performance obligation of 15.2% to 15.3%, an increase of 19% to 20%. Revenue to be in the range of $2.49 billion, $2.51 billion, an increase of 14% to 15%. And diluted non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.89, an increase of 16% to 19%. We've included our typical modeling points in the presentation for your review.\nWith that, I will turn it back to Hamza for the Q&A portion.",

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call.\nAs most of you are aware, the intensity around technology reliance, connectedness and as a consequence, cybersecurity continues to accelerate. Supply chains and interconnected systems have become the norm for better [ access ] to target. By most metrics, cyber incidents and their impact continue to be on the rise. And we saw it in spades in Q4, notably the large-scale breaches.\nA growing number of technology and business trends are further complicating the situation, creating additional challenges. The combination of these is getting further C-suite attention and focusing it on the cybersecurity Organizations increasingly rely on their IT system and nothing makes this more evident in a significant outage or security breach. Over the last 6 months, financial damages from an individual breach topped to $1 billion. In other case, the impact on business was existential and required significant work dedicated to system recovery and rebuilding.\nOur Unit 42 group is being called into customer crisis situations. We see a wide variation in breach situations, but ransomware remains a significant threat tying many together. A relatively new phenomenon of public ransomware extortion is raising the profile's challenge as organizations need to deal with the pressures of public disclosure before they have had time to do an early assessment. In addition, the time customers have to address an issue before damages escalate is shrinking. In fact, our research has found that in nearly half of cases attackers can exfiltrate customer data less than a single day of compromise.\nGeopolitical tensions remain at high levels as evidenced by multiple regional conflicts in the news. Cybersecurity activity is often elevated in these environments and we see multiple nongovernment agencies impacted by this nation state activity. We have seen this trend building for a number of years. Customer environments have been more complex with the adoption of capabilities such as work from anywhere, public cloud and more recently, AI. This complexity is additive with old technologies that have not been retired. Meanwhile, a multitude of uncoordinated security defenses are simply layered on. The sprawling interconnectedness of business through their IT systems is multiplying the impact of a breach.\nInstead of breach impacts being isolated to a single company, we're seeing customers, suppliers, partners and others in the ecosystem because they're really impacted. This has been most prevalent in the health care and retail industries, but this could happen anywhere.\nA recent high-profile outage involving security tools has elevated the cybersecurity conversation further. In addition to wanting to better understand the security risks, the C-suite boards are also now digging deeper into the technologies being deployed to mitigate these risks. Meanwhile, AI continues to generate significant excitement in the market, and many organizations are starting to scale transformative use cases that can enable new sources of revenue and/or drive substantial efficiencies.\nAI adoption is proceeding at a rapid pace, faster than honestly, I have seen any other new technology. However, it is following a typical pattern. Innovation is driving the speed of adoption, while security might be an after thought. At the same time, adversaries are leveraging AI capabilities to broaden attacks, better target organizations and scale their malicious activity beyond the capabilities of defenses that relies solely in humans. This environment, paired with an ever more challenging threat landscape and a complex set of point products, that are not well integrated, or even coordinated, is driving a growing need for platformization. We saw this translate into an acceleration in our bookings in the second half of the year following the rollout of our profit [indiscernible] strategy in fiscal year 2024.\nWe're delighted with our Q4 results. We drove the top line ahead of the overall cybersecurity market and delivered improved profitability and strong cash generation. We exceeded our guidance range for quarterly revenue and EPS, while exceeding our original annual guidance ranges for operating margin and free cash flow. We also grew ARPU 20%. We saw strong growth in our next-generation security offerings, and we exceeded our next-generation security [ hour ] guidance significantly surpassing the $4 billion milestone in Q4.\nWe grew NGS ARR 43% with strong contributions across the portfolio. In yet another milestone with $4.2 billion of NGS ARR to close out there, it's more than half our fiscal year 2024 revenue. Remember, 6 years ago when I started, this was 0.\nWe completed the year by expanding operating margins by 220 basis points and achieving nearly 39% free cash flow margin, generating well over $3 billion of free cash flow. We also continue to deliver healthy GAAP profitability.\nI know there was significant consternation around our platformization strategy 6 months ago. All I want to say is, I wish we had started down that path sooner. The amount of interest and activity around it has certainly been heartening and shows promise. After a strong addition of approximately 65 new platformizations in Q3, we added over 90 new platformizations in Q4, now have well over 1,000 total platformizations amongst our 5,000 largest customers as we exit FY '24.\nBeyond the number of platformization, we saw something interesting. We saw a sequential increase in average ARR per platformized customer in Q4. For perspective, our average ARR per placimization is up over 10% since Q1. This effectively means as we convert our customers to platform customers, and single platform customers to multi-platform customers, we see an uplift in ARR. This is an exciting development. Revisiting the rise in interest around platomization, senior-level customer meetings increased 70% year-over-year in the second half of the year and grew even faster in Q4. This engagement is key to aligning the customers senior team with our platermization strategy and its benefits. We have a growing team of our executives and sales leaders focused on these engagements worldwide.\nWe expect platformization to be a key driver towards achieving our goal of $15 billion in NGS ARR in fiscal year 2030 and our Q4 performance bolsters our confidence in our ability to reach this goal.\nYou heard from a customer in the intro video, and I want to give you some more stories, to dimensionalize our success of platformization in Q4. As you saw in the video, we signed a high 8-figure deal. In fact, a very high 8-figure deal [indiscernible] that started with executive engagement in our briefing center earlier in the year. They are an existing firewalls and [ Exor ] customer. As part of the platformization, we expanded our firewall footprint, added Prisma Access and moving them closer to a Zero Trust network security implementation. Additionally, we added Prisma Cloud for cloud security, placing an incumbent cloud security competitor. We also agreed to transfer their SIM, replacing 2 distinct SIM offerings with the AI-powered next-generation SIM, XSIAM. They are now one of our marquee customers platformized across all 3.\nWe had a mid-8-figure platformization deal, a global semiconductor manufacturer, building on a 5-year relationship. We worked with the customer on a project to reduce their costs and achieved a more consistent security outcome. This led to a discussion on transforming the network security to Zero Trust. Additionally, the customer agreed to deploy our Cortex platform. This approach was deemed more comprehensive and superior to a solution that was proposed, which comprised various point products from competitors, which would have to be stitched together.\nThird, the platformized a global media company across all 3 of our network security form factors. The customer prioritized and focused on driving Zero Trust network transformation for an increasingly mobile workforce while under significant cost pressures and dealing with the complexities of M&A integration. The customer is also leveraging [ Exon expanse ] to improve automation and better understand their attack surface. Our team ultimately converted this lengthy sale cycle into a 9-figure deal.\nLastly, the U.S. financial services firm is moving 90% of the applications to the public cloud, significantly reducing its data center footprint in that process. They're looking to consolidate point solutions and simplify the management of their security environment. This customer expanded from its existing Cortex XDR and XSOAR footprint to add XSIAM replacing, again, to incumbent SIMs. Additionally, the customer added firewall capacity and Prisma Cloud for cloud-native applications to deploy a comprehensive cloud security solution to secure their move to the cloud.\nNow I'll highlight the drivers of our momentum and key innovations across our 3 product platforms as we look towards fiscal 2025 and beyond. Over the last 5 years, we have driven a significant transition as an industry around more software-driven network security. Our strategy to deliver a comprehensive approach towards network security with hardware software form factors for both [indiscernible] and an industry-leading SAS solution is working. Not just that, our comprehensive set of software subscriptions work consistently across all these swing factors.\nWe continue to see our firewall platform billings growth growing in a healthy manner, up 17% in fiscal year 2024. While there is slower appliance growth around the industry, our net [ set ] growth has been driven by SaaS and the software firewall business. Our [indiscernible] platform billings are now 2/3 of the total, up from just over 40% 2 years ago. This year, our VM and SASE business grew propelling this mix shift.\nOur software-based virtual firewall business continues to show strong results with bookings accelerating in the second half. Helping to drive this to double our cloud next-generation power business, which runs natively on top of our -- of the 4 hyperscalers. Along with cloud next-generation firewall, we're seeing an inflection on software [indiscernible] business, as about 70% of the business this quarter. as being used to protect the public cloud. These customers choose the Palo Alto firewall instead of the firewall from the cloud service provider.\nOur customer momentum and SASE remained strong, with customers growing by over 20%. Once again, in FY '24, more than 1/3 of our new SASE customers continue to be new to Palo Alto Networks. This is encouraging. We're effectively landing in network security with all 3 of our product families allowing us to eventually drive platformization and move these customers to a Zero Trust platform. Our natively integrated enterprise browser has attracted more attention to our SASE offering since the [ Talon ] acquisition. Not only is it now an integral part of SASE, we're also able to provide the customers an ability to protect the [ AIU ] such as employees, both in our SASE and browser product.\nBeyond our software and SASE form factors, our cloud-based subscriptions are driving steady network security co. A significant driver is the advanced versions of 4 of our core subscriptions, modernized to be fully cloud delivered like neuro subscriptions such as IoT and DLP. We have seen strong adoption of our first [indiscernible] advanced subscriptions, which carry a higher price point than our original subscriptions. Advanced [indiscernible] filtering or first has been adopted by over half of our customers after 3 years on the market. We just launched Advanced DNS in Q4 and are excited to see it ramp as well. More broadly, we have seen the overall subscription attach rate per customer increased from 2.6 at the end of fiscal year 2022 to 3.5% today.\nWe have 10 subscriptions that run across all of our network security offerings. Customers can buy these on our firewalls one by one in bundles, packaged for a specific network security use case or as an enterprise license agreement to cover the entire state.\nBeyond the strong network security momentum, we are innovating to ensure we can continue to lead the network security market as software and SASE further drives growth. Some of the most important highlights are, Prisma Access browser. Following the position of [ Talon ] in Q2, we launched the industry's first and only enterprise browser newly integrated with SASE this month. Leading up to the launch, we saw strong interest in this technology with over 100 customers adopting our talent-powered Prisma Access. The browser is available to our existing and new SASE customers.\nWe have seen success with our autonomous digital experience management capability integrated with SASE, which helps customers proactively identify sources of downtime and ensure network availability for the hybrid worker and branch office. We followed that up by adding this capability to our firewall and have seen strong initial interest.\nWe launched our AI access offering, enabling our organization's workforce to use AI tools with confidence while giving security teams full visibility, robust controls, data protection and proactive threat prevention measures. AI Acess can easily be turned on for our over 5,000 Prisma Access customers. Following our early Access program in July, we have now seen interest from over 1,000 customers to deploy AI Access.\nFinally, leveraging our industry-leading virtual firewall capability, our AI run time offering is experiencing strong interest from Prisma Cloud and network security customers looking to protect their AI applications, models and data from threats.\nAs we look forward, the direction of the network security market is as clear to us as it's ever been. We are focused on driving the benefits of platformization through our 3 network security form factors and getting our customers to a true Zero Trust architecture delivers the best security with the lowest cost to operate.\nTurning to Prisma Cloud. The enterprise adoption of a public cloud is a generational change in IT that has been underway for at least half a decade. More recently, this has been fueled by the adoption of AI services in the public cloud. The public cloud must be secured differently than on-premise environments, and we recognized this more than 5 years ago.\nIn this highly competitive market, we have not only established ourselves our largest pure-play cybersecurity cloud security business being the first 7 -- to $700 million in ARR. We also have the broadest footprint of cloud security capabilities in the market. As a great confirmation of our leadership and innovation capability, leading [indiscernible] SaaS players have chosen Prisma Cloud to secure their production environments. We have CRM, HR and collaboration leaders who all signed significant deals with us in fiscal year 2024. These players are amongst the most sophisticated users of public cloud technology and hundreds of thousands of organizations trust them to operate a secure, enterprise-grade SaaS offering, we are proud to be able to showcase them as customers.\nHighlighting the comprehensiveness of our platform, we had a number of key innovations in Q4 that show our ability to stay in the lead in this competitive market. For example, we released our 13th Prisma Cloud module, data security posture management based on the acquisition of Big Security. The Big team has moved quickly, not only releasing this module, but also helping to integrate data security comprehensively within Prisma Cloud.\nAn important use case for securing data in the cloud is securing cloud native LLM based applications. To address this need, we released AI security posture management, our 14th module.\nLastly, we released cloud detection and response capabilities, leveraging the best of Prisma Cloud in Cortex. CDR gives us a full visibility into security events in the cloud as well as real-time tread detection and remediation. With an increasing frequency and scale of breaches targeting cloud environments, CDR capability is becoming a critical differentiator and a comprehensive cloud security platform.\nAs we close out there, along with the overall acceleration we saw in our second half business, our large deal business in Prisma Cloud was up with strong growth in new and expand business in Q4. As we look forward, we will ensure Prisma Cloud stays ahead of the [ CNP ] market new capabilities. We will bring new real-time capabilities to the cloud and enable full cloud security integration to the [indiscernible]. These will be essential for our customers as public cloud and AI adoption broaden.\nLast but not the least, Cortex. Fiscal year 2024 was a watershed year for Cortex. We firmly established XSIAM as the transformation platform for security operations and continue to innovate across the broader Cortex portfolio. We also expanded the Cortex customer base bringing us future opportunities for XSIAM and maintain ARR growth on a significantly increased scale.\nXSIAM achieved approximately $500 million in bookings in FY [ '24 ] alone, up more than 2x versus our fiscal year 2023. Our active customers are up 4x over the same time period. We finished the year with over 30 customers north of $1 million in XSIAM ARR. Customers are seeing the security outcomes at XSIAM can deliver, namely, a dramatic reduction in the time to discover immediate security events. This is important in identifying signs of breach and stopping the activity before significant business interruption offers.\nOur ability to deliver the substantial outcomes unlike any product we have sold since the introduction of our original next-generation firewall more than 15 years ago. And the group of XSIAM is following a similar path. Beyond XSIAM, our momentum in Cortex continues with the business passing $900 million in ARR this year.\nThe focus of our platformization efforts for Cortex is with XSIAM. Having closed out fiscal year 2024 with well north of 100 XSIAM customers, we have seen some amazing outcomes of deployed customers. More than 50% have achieved a median time to resolution for security incidents of under 10 minutes coming from days. After the first quarter deployment, these customers have then seen an additional 2x improvement in their median time to mediate.\nLooking forward, we have increased conviction that we can lead the transformation of any organization security operations center with XSIAM. We see a growing list of customers is an appetite for the outcome we can deliver, and we believe the market is at a point that is ripe for disruption. We have a strategy of delivering additional value to our Cortex XDR [indiscernible] customers by enabling them to platformize XSIAM. We also see a significant opportunity to provide real-time capabilities in cloud security, where cloud detection and response capabilities can help drive this opportunity.\nLastly, we expect to close the IBM created our SaaS assets acquisition by the end of September. We're excited to work with our colleagues at IBM to bring XSIAM to their customers. It doesn't stop with XSIAM platformization. We are also equally excited about our newest launch, XSIAM for cloud. This allows organizations to comprehensively address cloud security issues as part of the security operations.\nAdditionally, we are partnering with many service providers and system integrators to build capability together to continue accelerating our XSIAM opportunity.\nAnd finally, a quick note on the recent widespread outages in the industry. I want to reiterate our product uses an approach that deploys a 1% to 3% wide sample test cohort to ensure no issues and then we released content updates in a phased manner. We have additionally enabled controls so customers can manage the update process and control it. The recent outage has caused a number of customers to reevaluate their options. They have initiated conversations with us around XDR and XSIAM. This, plus our industry-leading Cortex technology is appealing as we've talked to -- everyone we have talked to so far, and we think it has potential to further drive our Cortex momentum.\nWhen I came to Palo Alto Networks, we articulated a clear strategy that for our continued success, we needed to ensure our products were constantly improving. They are solving problems for our customers the best way possible. And also, we are solving new problems. In other words, our success would depend on our product portfolio and product quality. I continue to be excited about continued growing leadership position in the cybersecurity categories with our products, customers adopt the best-of-breed offering and eventually evolve to a platform approach.\nThe results of our innovation are evident in the broad analyst recognition of our leadership position across 24 categories. This quarter, we added a new recognition of incident response services, a testament to our industry-leading capabilities in [indiscernible] response and recovery. We also added a leadership recognition data security posture management, our eighth for Prisma Cloud.\nOne last area to highlight, we continue to believe in the opportunity around AI. We think we are in the very early innings, and AI will be both a threat and opportunity. I'm particularly proud of our team who stepped up and deliver this comprehensive suite of AI Security solutions for our customers. We also continue to infuse AI into our platforms allowing us to bring leading solutions to our customers. These AI solutions are off to a good start. We surpassed $200 million in ARR to close out the year, underscoring the traction, the AI-first products we have had in the market such as XSIAM and [indiscernible].\nIn May, we announced our suite of AI security offerings of [ long star ] precision AI campaign featuring the TV ad with Keanu Reeves. Over the last several weeks, we have released the announced product, namely AI access, AI Firewall or runtime security and AI security posture management. We believe this makes us the first to market with a comprehensive portfolio for secure AI [indiscernible] design.\nBefore I hand over the call to Dipak, I want to reflect on our journey and set some context as we discuss fiscally in 2025. Throughout fiscal year 2024, you saw a backdrop helping create interest and demand for enhanced cybersecurity. This helped to accelerate our bookings in the second half of the year. It is also reflected in our new platformization as we closed the year with strong momentum and our strong NGS ARR.\nFY '24 marked a seminal moment in our history. I feel our innovation engine is now leading the market by showing enhancements to our SASE portfolio, our cloud security efforts or in the [indiscernible]. We have new integrated solutions for our customers. Take AI. We believe we are the only scale cybersecurity player to lead the market in a comprehensive suite of AI solutions. We feel comfortable that we are on track towards our target of making Palo Alto Networks, the first $15 billion ARR security business. We have made decisions on how we run our business to maximize long-term ARR [indiscernible] well with growing shareholder value.\nThe select club of enterprise companies has scaled [ near our ] business in front of us, and we intend to join the [ cloud ]. Dipak will cover in detail how we will evolve our external metrics in line with this. We closed the year with strong top line growth, expanded our operating margins and drove best-in-class cash conversion, and we are confident that we can continue this in fiscal year 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, I will hand it over to Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide you with highlights of Q4. You can review the results in our press release and the supplemental financial information on our website.\nIn Q4, total revenue was $2.19 billion and grew 12%, above the high end of our guidance. Within revenue, product revenue declined 5%, while total services revenue grew 18%. Drilling into services revenue, subscription revenue grew 23% and support revenue grew 10%. It is worth noting that product revenue grew 24% a year ago as the supply chain normalized, resulting in growth above our underlying demand in that period.\nDespite the tough Q4 comparison due to supply chain constraint reversals in the second half, fiscal '24 the second half of '23 -- fiscal '24 product revenue grew in the low single-digit range, which is in line with our expectations. The firewall appliance market demand was stable in Q4, and we continue to expect growth of 0% to 5% as we have previously discussed.\nMoving on to geographies. We saw revenue growth across all theaters with the Americas growing 11%, EMEA up 14% and JPAC growing 15%. We saw strength across all of our geographic theaters.\nTotal RPO, a metric that better represents our top line growth and billings grew 20% to $12.7 billion. Our current RPO grew 17% to $5.9 billion. The average duration of our new contracts remained at approximately 3 years, in line with our third quarter.\nAs Nikesh mentioned, our NGS ARR grew well past the $4 billion, ending the year at $4.22 billion and growing 43%. Strength in NGS ARR was broad-based across our 3 security platforms. We reported Q4 billings above the high end of our guidance, driven primarily by double-digit booking growth and higher volumes transacted on [indiscernible]. On our balance sheet, you will see that our debt balance came down by $199 million and is now under $1 billion. Like in Q3, this reduction was driven by the early conversion of our convertible debt which occurred at the option of the debt holders and were settled for us in cash and equity. Our remaining debt matures in June 2025 although we may continue to see early conversions. We did not repurchase any shares in Q4, and our buyback strategy remains opportunistic.\nOur Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million buyback authorization such that we now have $1 billion in authorization remaining through December 2025.\nI wanted to give you some context around our NGS ARR RPO billings and total services revenue metrics. You can see the relatively steady trends in RPO and NGS ARR, which closely matched the trends in total services revenue, while we have seen more volatility in billings. We've talked through a year now about the factors that impact our billings. Over a year ago, we began to see the impact of rising interest rates, on how customers perceive the cost of money and procurement situations. This was causing many to ask for payments to be spread over multiple years instead of an upfront payment.\nIn response, we leverage programs such as annual billings and our PANFS financing capability. The impact on billings varied based, based upon which program the customer chose and how the deal was structured. Also, during this fiscal year, we rolled out our platformization strategy, and we offered customers more flexibility in payment terms when making large strategic commitments. This has had a further impact on our billings. In both of these situations, we found ourselves facing the choice of maximizing billings or focusing on NGS ARR, and we want all to have all of the incentives aligned to [indiscernible].\nRPO and revenue are both important to understanding our business momentum. Revenue gives you the near-term view of our growth. Our RPO helps you understand the longer-term trend and the scale of our book of business that will drive revenue. This aggregate measure is driven by contracts we signed each quarter and the long-term growth in RPO influences our revenue growth over time and gives you visibility into the future trend. As a reminder, the contracts included in our RPO are all noncancelable and nonrefundable in nature. We aspire to continue to grow RPO ahead of our target forward revenue growth rate as that helps us build confidence in these growth rates.\nNow focusing further on NGS ARR. As a reminder, NGS ARR is an important metric for us as it shows the return on the significant investments we've been making in the next-generation areas of our cybersecurity market that are also growing the fastest. We expect these offerings will disproportionately drive our growth as we transform our revenue.\nOur recent rollout of platformization has sharpened our focus on maximizing ARR. For example, we started the account review process early in fiscal year 2024 to identify white space amongst the largest organizations globally and maximize ARR. As we followed up with the rollout of our platformization strategy, we focus not only on the total deal value, or the cash collected upfront, but also on an exit ARR and profitability of the recurring revenue stream. We can accommodate customer points of friction while maximizing this recurring revenue as we structure deals with customers to encourage their strategic adoption.\nThese friction points include the challenge of replacing multiple products simultaneously and the issues around double paying while working through complex contract terms. In making these short-term concessions to billings, we ensure a valuable long-term relationship with a deal that meets our and the customers' needs.\nI've talked to you about how NGS ARR and RPO are becoming more prominent in our focus as we drive our platformization strategy. The shortcomings related to billings have become significant over the last 12 to 18 months and further increasing as we drive our optimization strategy.\nIn evolving our metrics, we solicited the input of some of our largest shareholders and looked at how our peer companies are giving guidance. Investor feedback was that quarter-to-quarter billing, volatility is merely a distraction, and it does not impact our assessment of the shareholder value we can create over the medium and long term. We've seen a number of companies disclose ARR and adopt an RPO-related metric to help investors better understand the business trajectory. Some of those companies include Adobe, Salesforce, ServiceNow and Workday.\nAs a result, beginning this quarter, we will focus on NGS ARR as our key top line guidance metric in addition to revenue. We will provide NGS ARR guidance both quarterly and annually. We will also provide total RPO guidance quarterly and annually this year to help investors understand the size of our book of committed contracts compared to their future expectations for our revenue.\nSince we know this is a change for you after many years of guiding billings, I wanted to help provide a onetime bridge back to what we would expect our billings to look like if we were not to change any of the practices in our business that impacts billings. If we were to keep the mix between our PANFS and billing programs in fiscal year 2025, in line with what we had in fiscal year 2024, we would expect this to drive 12% growth in our billings in fiscal year 2025.\nBefore I get to detailed guidance, I want to give investors some additional color on the drivers of our cash flow as that is an area that we continue to receive questions on. First and foremost, our improving operating margins have been the most important driver of our free cash flow margin. We have seen our operating margins improved by over 800 basis points since fiscal year '21, when we began a more intensive focus on profitable growth. This higher operating margin has helped us put a higher floor under our free cash flow margins. We continue to see ample opportunity to expand our operating margins supporting our free cash flow.\nBeyond improvements in our operating profitability, the timing of customer cash payments can impact our free cash flow. Over the last 4 years, we have gradually absorbed an increase in customer preference for payments over time, increasing this proportion of our bookings from 6% in fiscal year 2020 to 30% as of the most recent quarter, while maintaining or even increasing our free cash flow margins.\nI'm happy that we've been able to do this, and we have confidence we can continue this gradual transition within the business and sustain our free cash flow margins at 37 plus -- 37% plus through fiscal year 2026.\nI also wanted to update you on the pending transaction with IBM. We continue to expect the deal to close by the end of September, depending on the timing of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. At this point, we have included several tens of millions in acquired revenue from legacy [ QRadar ] SaaS products and our fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance with this number decreasing over time based on the speed at which we migrate -- curate our customers to XSIAM. We have also embedded the ongoing expenses in our operating margin, cash flow margin and EPS guidance.\nNow moving on to guidance. For the fiscal year 2025, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $5.42 billion to $5.47 billion, an increase of 28% to 30%. Remaining performance obligation of $15.2 billion to $15.3 billion represents an increase of 19% to 20%. Revenue to be in the range of $9.10 billion to $9.15 billion, an increase of 13% to 14%, operating margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. Non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $6.18 to $6.31, an increase of 9% to 11% and adjusted free cash flow margin to be 37% to 38%.\nFor the first fiscal quarter of 2025, we expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $4.33 billion to $4.38 billion, an increase of 34% to 36%. Remaining performance obligation of $12.4 billion to $12.5 billion, an increase of 19% to 20%, revenue to be in the range of $2.10 billion to $2.13 billion, an increase of 12% to 13% and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.47 to $1.49, an increase of 7% to 8%.\nSince we know this is a change for you all after many years of guiding billings, I wanted to remind you of the onetime bridge back, which I talked about before.\nFinally, we included our typical modeling points in the presentation for you to review. With that, we're going to play one more customer video, and then we will move to the Q&A portion of the call.\n[Presentation]",

Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. I hope everybody enjoyed our new marketing campaign teaser featuring Keanu Reeves that went live on national media. Let's start at the beginning.\n\nI'll update you on what we experienced in Q3. First and foremost, cyberattacks continue unabated. We're seeing a consistent stream of nation-state activity that is systematically looking for software supply chain and hardware zero-day vulnerabilities and attempting to exploit them at scale. Additionally, there continues to be a robust stream of attack activity targeted at large enterprises and pieces of critical infrastructure. We continue to see high-profile breaches, some of which were widely reported in the press again this quarter. Most organizations face the challenge of an ever-shrinking time window for a bad actor to enter the environment. Find valuable data and exfiltrate it. The window is now measured in hours.\n\nIn comparison, the time it takes for an organization to discover a breach and stop the malicious activity continues to be measured in days. While not a new phenomenon, with new disclosure mandates, this challenge is now clearly out in the open. With AI, we expect the attacks to come at an even faster pace. I don't need to elaborate on the current enthusiasm around AI.\n\nAlmost every one of our customers is either experimenting with AI or plans to deploy some use cases in the near future. And, as usual, their employees are way ahead. Almost 50% of the employees of most companies are using some sort of AI application, LLM, or co-pilot to explore, learn, and make themselves more productive.\n\nWhile this is great for the evolution and adoption of AI, it is introducing a whole new set of threats. As some of you are aware, we have recently announced a suite of products which are aimed at securing this AI usage by design. More about this later, but I expect this to continue to provide a tailwind to the cybersecurity industry. On spending for cybersecurity, we see no change in space or trajectory. Most customers have a series of projects they want to get done, and the only limiting factor seems to be execution.\n\nCustomers continue to focus on zero trust transformations, coupled with the need for new network architectures to adapt to more hybrid cloud. The resurgence of cloud migrations is being driven by the need to get their data in the cloud to be AI-ready, causing discussions around the cloud security platform. As you may all have noticed with all the M&A activity, the security operations space is getting rejuvenated. This is something we've been preparing for with DECSAI.\n\nAt the accelerated pace of change in cyber, even with healthy increases in cyber security funding, many organizations aim to simply keep pace with the volume of threat activity they see. Most cannot do this and are increasingly receptive to a better way of tracking their security challenges, and tackling their security challenges. Windows for All and Architectural Complexity.\n\nWe firmly believe that the answer is platformization of cybersecurity over time. I'm delighted to report that, despite the concerns around our platformization approach after our last quarter, the customer feedback has been nothing but encouraging. We have initiated way more conversations than we expected. If meetings were a measure of outcome, they have gone up 30%, and a majority of them have been centered on platform opportunities. In short, demand is robust, and my expectation is that we will continue to see it that way for the next few years.\n\nWith this backdrop, we are pleased with our strong Q3 results. As you can see, we deliver top-line growth ahead of the market and continue to drive growth while improving profitability. Our performance was highlighted by 47% growth in our next-generation security ERR as we continue to transform our business into a security software business, and we saw 23% growth in RPO, an uptick from last quarter. This translated into 15% revenue growth and 3% growth in our billing. As we have articulated earlier, we don't see the billing metric as a true indicator of business trends.\n\nIt continues to be impacted by payment terms, where more and more customers prefer annual billing plans. However, if you look at implied bookings, you will note that we saw an uptick in that over the last two quarters. We actually ended up billing backlog this quarter.\n\nWe continue to operate our business efficiently. Our operating margin expanded by 200 basis points year-over-year, driving 25% growth in operating income and 20% in our EPS to $1.32. Our cash generation was strong, and again, our gap net income grew substantially year over year.\n\nBefore I continue... With highlights from Q3, I'm aware that our accelerated consolidation and platformization strategy created significant conversation last quarter. We have also had questions from analysts and investors on this topic since we reported our Q2 results in February. I thought I'd share more background on how we got here to provide context and also offer a platformization framework for you to help understand why we're convinced that we can build a much larger business over the next several years, and platformization is key to achieving that.\n\nWhen we embarked on our journey to transform our company, we were keen to create interest and convince our customers that we could solve their problems, not just with our next-generation firewalls and the associated subscriptions but also with a set of best-of-breed products across 20-plus categories organized across three platforms. That strategy was hugely successful and saw us achieve nearly $4 billion in NGS ARR.\n\nThe majority of the focus of our teams was landing multiple products across all the platforms that are. Whether we were able to land at a brand new customer for Palo Alto Networks, or we added products from new platforms to our existing customers, we were happy. These landings could range from a single product used in a part of the organization to broader users across the internet. From that lens, if you look at our top 5,000 customers, we have landed two or more of our platforms at about half these customers, and these customers contribute just over 80% of NGS ARR.\n\nIf you look at it by platform, you have landed 97% of these top 5000 network security customers or 20% of them in Prisma Cloud and over 40% with Cortana. By all means, our land-to-platform strategy was extremely successful.\n\nIn landing on multiple platforms, many of our customers have leveraged our capabilities across key cybersecurity buying centers such as network security, cloud security, and security operations. Most of this cross-platform adoption has happened more organically, with customers adopting incremental products from Palo Alto Networks at their own pace. Given the complexity of the environment and the friction of dealing with contracts from multiple vendors, not many of our landed customers are fully platform-ready, and the ones that are fully platformized, we saw encouraging results.\n\nWe realized that for fully-platformized customers, while they saw better security outcomes, our ARR profile was also varied. While our average next-generation security ARR for our landed customers ranges from $200,000 to $11,000, for our land strategy, we discovered that our ARR for fully-platformized customers ranges from $2 million to $14 million, depending on how many platforms the customers are standardizing.\n\nThis drove us to accelerate the rollout of our platformization strategy at the end of the last quarter, following successful pilots earlier in the year. We've created interest in the market, started a conversation with customers looking to begin their platformization journey, and spurred existing sales cycles to a more strategic outcome. Having personally reviewed over 500 of our top customers in detail this past quarter, having had a few hundred conversations with CISOs, CIOs, and CEOs, I continue to be convinced of our opportunity to deliver full platformization to our top customers. However, we're still early in the results from full platformization.\n\nAcross these top 5,000 customers, we have completed about 900 through Q3 2024. Our Q3 efforts resulted in approximately 65 incremental platformization sales in Q3, which is up 40% since Q2. It was this framework that was the foundation for our goal of $15 billion in next-generation security ARR by fiscal year 2030, which we first discussed last quarter.\n\nWith our incremental momentum in platformization, we see a runway to delivering approximately 2,500-plus platformization sales, up from the current 900, while continuing to land our multiple platforms in our customer base and adding new customers. I showed you the benefits we see in our ARR from our success driving platformization. Our customers also see significant benefits as they adopt our full platform. We have talked to you in the past about reduction in median times resolution with XIM, which takes less than one-tenth of the time it took before XIM was deployed, as customers platformize on court.\n\nIDC recently validated the benefits platform customers see in a study published earlier this year, independently proving much of what we've talked about. Customers saw productivity benefits, as much as 30 to 40% efficiency improvements, and significant improvements in security. I could talk further about the benefits, but what really brings us to the forefront are some examples of our significant transactions in Q3. The U.S. County Agency signed a seven-figure transaction planning our firewall subscriptions as well as Cortex XTR and became a Palo Alto customer for the first time.\n\nWe displaced a competitor that sold both of these capabilities to the customer and competed against us with an appliance vendor that could not offer best-of-breed capabilities across these two categories. A large U.S. financial services company that was an existing platform customer faced significant challenges in their solution. Despite a staff of 40 in the SOC, they were not achieving their goals and sought a transformation. We signed an eight-figure deal including SIAM, our ITDR, or Identity Threat Detention and Response Offering, and our Managed Ejection and Response Service.\n\nA global data services provider was unhappy with his incumbent SaaSy provider facing outages that created a loss of productivity, and was also never able to integrate its VPN and URL filtering capabilities fully. The customer selected our SASE capability for approximately 65,000 mobile and branch office users, including CASB, DLP, Enterprise Browser, and ADEM capabilities for many. This was a highly competitive situation, but our ability to deliver consolidated capabilities through a platform across a half a dozen areas, as well as our superior security versus incumbents won us the business. Finally, a large healthcare company experienced a breach and engaged our Unit 42 Incident Response Service.\n\nAfter we help the customer remediate and get back online, you're able to educate the customer on the benefits of platformization. The customer fully platformized with us, standardizing our network security Prisma Cloud and Cortex. This transaction was the largest in the history of Palo Alto Networks at nearly $150 million.\n\nBeyond these showcase deals, our overall large deal activity was healthy in Q3, as shown by significant increases in our accounts with transactions over $1, $5, and $10 million in the quarter. We also recently announced our partnership with IBM. IBM and Palo Alto Networks have done what, in my mind, is a one-of-a-kind partnership. This partnership involves migrating the QDR customers of IBM to XIM, where IBM will be able to deliver industry-specific capabilities on XIM using Watson X.\n\nGiven the leadership position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant, now we can collectively deliver an even better solution to both their existing and new customers. Enabling over 1000 IBM security consultants on the entire Palo Alto Networks portfolio will allow us to drive platformization in an accelerated fashion. We will be IBM's first cybersecurity partner across network, cloud, and SOC, while driving a significant book of business for IBM. Additionally, IBM will platformize on Palo Alto products.\n\nWe will extensively leverage Watson X across both our operations and products. And lastly, but not least, we will work on co-developing solutions for the cloud. Last quarter, when we rolled out our accelerated consolidation and platformization strategy, we also activated our AI leadership strategy. Leading up to this, over the last year, we've oriented an increasing portion of our R&D investments toward AI. We have seen growth in customer interest in and adoption of AI to drive business value, and bad actors using AI, as I discussed earlier.\n\nIn early May, we announced our comprehensive suite of AI security offerings and believe we will be the first to market the capabilities to protect the range of our customers' AI security. We rolled out three products to safely enable the use of AI, from employees using AI to enterprises building AI into their applications. AI Access Security, AI SPM, and AI Runtime Security put us at the forefront of securing AI adoption. We also believe our co-pilots across our three platforms, which are context-aware, can perform and automate user actions, surface alerts, and best practices, and provide in-product support, all with near-perfect accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, we announced our Precision AI Security Bundle to leverage inline AI to counter AI attacks with AI defense. We have had strong early customer engagement with these offerings, which we expect to be made generally available beginning of July. As you heard from our teaser trailer with Keanu, this isn't sci-fi; this is precision AI.\n\nMore broadly than AI, it has been a busy last three months from an innovation perspective on SAS. Our SAS Utility Launch, which we rolled out early this month, debuted with several unique industry-defining capabilities. He announced the industry's only secure enterprise browser integrated into SASE, and as end-user engagement with AI applications grows, the browser becomes an important defense layer against AI threats. Additionally, it is becoming clear that the browser offers a better way to secure contractors' mobile devices and managed devices, with SASE integration providing a simpler and more secure approach to adoption. We launched AI-powered data security integrated into SASE, leveraging the industry's first LLM-powered data classification. This new classification engine combines the strength of a context-aware machine learning model with the power of LLM. Understanding how to increase classification\n\nLastly, as part of our SaaS E3.0, we launched Application Acceleration, which understands each user's journey within enterprise SaaS and cloud applications and optimizes performance for these applications; customers see performance up to five times faster than the user experience on the general internet. This rapid cadence of innovation in SASE has enabled us to maintain SASE ARR growth of about 50% for the sixth quarter in a row. In Prisma Cloud, we have completed the first phase rollout of data security posture management, which came from the DIG security acquisition.\n\nWe also added support for more than 100 new APIs across the major hyperscalers to stay ahead of our customers by securing the cloud services they will need. Based on our Cortex Expanse technology, we launched cloud discovery and exposure management, leveraging our Expanse data natively in Prisma Cloud. Over 100 customers now use this capability to evaluate Internet exposure risks and discover unknown Internet-exposed cloud ads.\n\nAlso, during Q3, we launched CDR, Cloud Detection and Response, which extends our XDR capability into the cloud and gives customers a unified view of their entire environment from cloud to endpoint. CDEM and CDR show the power of having both Cortex and Prisma Cloud platforms as we can leverage these sophisticated capabilities to benefit cloud customers. Last but not least, on Cortex, we launched XRM about 18 months ago, and this offering has already elevated Cortex in the market.\n\nWe see steady demand for XDR as the foundation of Cortex, where we are landing many new customers, and now we have north of 5,800 customers on XDR. $400 million in cumulative ex-fine bookings coming out of Q3.\n\nThis offering is really going mainstream, with customers understanding the value proposition versus the traditional SIEM. XIME has accelerated our Cortex ARR growth, and we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunity. We are converting our innovation into recognized leadership, adding two new positions this quarter, one in Managed Detection and Response and the other in Data Security Posture Management, leveraging our DIG acquisition and demonstrating our ability to acquire technology and rapidly integrate it into our platform.\n\nAs many of you have undoubtedly seen, our rollout of platformization has stoked a long-standing debate within the cybersecurity industry about whether customers desire a platform or best-of-breed cybersecurity. From Palo Alto Networks' perspective, we've proven it is possible to deliver best-of-platform. This is why we have invested in building leading products, and we now have recognition for product leadership in 23 categories, while also delivering on the benefits of integration across all three platforms.\n\nTo summarize, before I pass off to Deepak, please take away a few conclusions from my prepared remarks. One, we put out strong cues for results in a positive spending environment where cybersecurity priorities are well-funded. Beyond the continuation of a challenging threat environment, new threat vectors from AI are starting to surface as the use of AI grows. We've been pleased with the initial traction of our accelerated consolidation platform strategy. This drove an increase in bookings with deferred payments and impacted our billings, something we expect will continue.\n\nWe are a big core of innovation, especially as it relates to AI, where we strive to lead the industry in securing this powerful productivity medium while also doing so comprehensively. As we look forward, we have a significant pipeline heading into our largest quarter of the year. We're just beginning to see the benefits of platformization accrue to our business. We will continue to make further investments here while balancing delivering profitable growth, and we have charted a path with conviction towards being a 15 billion dollar NGSIR company. With that, let me pass you on to Dipak.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. To maximize our time spent on Q&A, I will provide highlights, and you can review the results available in our press release and the supplemental financial information on our website. Within our revenue of $1.98 billion, product revenue grew 1% while total service revenue grew 20%. Within Services Revenue, Subscription Revenue grew 25%, and Support Revenue grew 11%. Moving on to geographies, we saw revenue growth across all theaters, with the Americas growing 15%, EMEA up 20%, and JPAC growing 8%.\n\nThis quarter, our lower JPAC revenue growth was driven by lower product bookings in the region, offset by higher subscription bookings, which benefit revenue over time. We reported Q3 billings within the range we guided, although, as Nikesh and I have noted several times in the past few quarters, we continue to focus less on this metric. We saw an increase quarter over quarter in business transacted with deferred billings, which is also higher than we forecast.\n\nThe impact on our financials from platformization this quarter was in line with what we expected 90 days ago, and our expectations around the impact in Q4 and beyond are unchanged from what we talked about in February. First, we saw a greater volume of large deals with some of these customers opting for deferred payments over the term of their purchase instead of paying up front as they grapple with the higher cost of money. This drove the quarter to quarter increase in periodic bill billing plans that I noted. Also, this level of periodic fillings was higher than we forecasted 90 days ago.\n\nWe also saw an uptake in the array of our platformization programs we launched early in the quarter. These programs continue to ramp up as we roll them out broadly. Within our RPO of $11.3 billion, our current RPO is $5.4 billion. Our average duration of new contracts increased slightly year over year, but remained at approximately three years. On our balance sheet, you will see that our debt balance came down by $659 million.\n\nThe driver for this was early conversion, which occurred at the option of the debt holders and was settled by us in cash. Our remaining debt matures in June 2025, although we may continue to see early conversions. During Q3, we spent $500 million to repurchase 1.7 million shares of our common stock.\n\nOur buyback strategy remains opportunistic. I know that Billings has been a significant focus for investors. As you're all aware, remaining performance obligation, or RPO, captures the full value of our contracts, independent of customer billing. As we've explained to you over the last year, with an increase in factors impacting payment terms on a quarterly basis, there's been significant volatility in our billing. With this volatility in mind, we've been increasingly focused on driving high-quality bookings, which add to RPO and maximize our NGS ARR. Focusing on these metrics provides a more relevant view of the business.\n\nIf we look at the history of these metrics for our company, you see that NGS ARR has consistently grown ahead of our other metrics, and as it continues to contribute a higher proportion of our revenue. You also see that the correlation between RPO and total services revenue growth is high. Our RPO is mainly comprised of contracts for offerings that carry ratable revenue, which is recognized through our total services revenue. Billings, on the other hand, are significantly influenced by the invoicing terms on contract signs, which adds significant volatility.\n\nIn Q3, we saw RPO growth tick up, along with strength in NGS ARR, including us raising our guidance here. This is in contrast to billing trends, which went the other way, thereby showing the divergent trends and actions in action through Q3 results. Nikesh talked briefly about our first of a kind IBM partnership that has multiple facets that touch each of our platforms and include a significant devotion of resources from both companies.\n\nI'd like to provide more details on the financial impacts we expect to see. As part of the partnership, we've agreed to acquire IBM's QRadar SaaS assets, certain QRadar intellectual property, and IBM's on-premise QRadar customer list. The total consideration is $500 million plus earn-out consideration based on successfully migrating QRadar on-premise customers to our XAM offering over the next several years. We anticipate closing the transaction by the end of September 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. For the calendar year 2023, QRadar SAS revenue was on the order of $100 million.\n\nHowever, as we work through details of the customer contracts we are acquiring and the deferred revenue associated with this business, we expect our recognized revenue could be much lower than this in our fiscal year 2025. We will provide more information on the financial impact closer to the close of the transaction. We will invest to fuel this partnership and ensure a seamless experience for customers purchasing and migrating to XIM. As part of the partnership, we have entered into an agreement with IBM whereby they will operate parts of the business on our behalf on a medium-term basis.\n\nWe expect we can make these investments within the profitability framework we spoke of previously. Specifically, we continue to expect 28% to 29% long-gap operating margin in fiscal year 2026 and 37% or greater pre-cash flow margin through fiscal year 2021. Before I provide Q4 guidance, I wanted to remind you of what we talked about last quarter when we introduced platformization and discussed the top top line headwinds we expected it would have. We continue to expect platformization-related drivers, both larger deals with associated cost of money impacts and acceleration and platformization programs will impact our billings over a total of a 12 to 18 month period. Consistent with what we noted in February, we expect that this will persist through fiscal year 25 as we anniversary the rollout of these programs, resulting in lower billings and, to a lesser degree, revenue.\n\nBeyond this period, we expect to grow faster than we discussed in August and sustain this growth for longer. Now, moving on to our guidance for Q4 of the year. For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $3.43 to $3.48 billion, an increase of 9 to 10%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.17 billion, an increase of 10 to 11%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.42 a share, a decrease of 1% to 3%.\n\nFor the fiscal year 24, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.13 to $10.18 billion, an increase of 10 to 11%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.10 billion, an increase of 37 to 39%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.99 to $8.01 billion and increase to 16%, fiscal 24 we expect operating margins be in the range of 26.8 to 27.0 percent an increase of 270 to 290 basis points year-over-year, We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.56 to $5.58 per share, an increase of 25% to 26%, and we expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 38.5 to 39%.\n\nIn the interest of time and to get as many of your questions as possible, we've included the modeling points in the appendix of our earnings presentation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion.\n\nThank you, Dipak. To allow for broad participation, I'd ask that each person only ask one question. The first question will be from Brian Essex at J.P. Morgan, followed by Brad Zelnick at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, Brian. Brian, Brian, you're muted.",

I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nRepresentative Director, President and Chief Operating Officer, SoftBank Group Corp.\n\nThank you, Walter. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. I am pleased to report another quarter in which we successfully executed our profitable growth strategy, driving a combination of top line growth, significant expansion in non-GAAP operating margin and strong free cash flow generation.\nRevenues grew 19% year-over-year and RPO grew 22%, capturing the full value of our future revenue. Billings grew 16% year-over-year. Just as important as we focus on profitable growth, we again delivered substantial operating margin leverage and strong growth in free cash flow. Non-GAAP operating margins of 28.6% expanded nearly 600 basis points year-over-year and we generated $2.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.\nOur strong profitability drove non-GAAP EPS of $1.46, up 39% year-over-year and our GAAP net income continues to grow meaningfully, even without onetime items. Beyond our financial results, we achieved a number of notable milestones in Q2 worthy of spotlighting. We continue to drive larger deals, including a steady stream of $1 million-plus deals and success in our largest deals with 10 transactions over $20 million in the quarter. Our 10 highest spending customers in Q2 increased their spend with us by 36% in the period.\nI also wanted to update you on key achievements across our 3 platforms. In our Network Security business, we continue to see progress driving ARR growth in our SASE business. Q2 was our fifth consecutive quarter of 50% ARR growth. Additionally, more than 30% of our new SASE customers we signed in the second quarter were new to Palo Alto Networks, showing that we can win head-to-head in the market when leading with SASE. We continue to drive innovation in network security, refreshing our high-end 7500 cities platform and investing new OT security capabilities, which garnered a net new leadership position for us.\nIn Prisma Cloud, we have made significant investments in the first half of the year to drive new customers and saw this pay off in Q2 with our highest new ACV growth in 5 quarters. We continue to see strong trends in multi-module adoption with approximately 30% growth in customers with 2 or more modules and approximately 60% growth in customers with 3 or more modules. Additionally, about 1/4 of our customers are using 5 or more modules. Our external recognition in this market continued with Forrester Research, positioning us as a leader in its Cloud Workload Security Wave report.\nIn Cortex, XSIAM continues to be a significant catalyst for large transactions and growth across the business. It is evidenced by ARR for XSIAM customers being more than 5x higher than that of Cortex customers who have not yet adopted XSIAM. We've seen significant progress in the milestone with XSIAM in Q2 including the most number of deals signed in a single quarter and bookings of over $90 million again this quarter.\nWe've already displaced 19 different SIM vendors to date and the confidence under our belt, we're now looking systematically on how we can accelerate this legacy SIM displacement.\nFrom a regional perspective, demand overall is healthy. We did see softness in the U.S. Federal Government market. We are positioned well for several large projects where we had requisite certifications and 1 technical selection, but these deals did not close. The situation started off towards the end of Q1 were worsened in Q2. And as a result, we had a significant shortfall in our U.S. federal government business. We expect this trend will continue into our Q3 and Q4. Offsetting the billing weakness in Fed was some non-product backlog that we shipped this quarter.\nWith several leadership positions awarded in second quarter, including our addition as a leader of the Gartner Endpoint Protection Magic Quadrant, we're now a recognized leader in 21 different categories across our 3 platforms. Five years ago when we began our strategy, the industry believed building leadership across multiple categories wasn't possible. No one was talking about security platform. Instead, the world was best of breed. Our success over the last 5 years has been driven by the shift to platformization. We're committed to investing in innovation to extend our industry leadership position and platform.\nThis unique leadership across our 3 markets is driving strong adoption of our platforms in our target Global 2000 markets. As of Q2, 79% of Global 2000 have transacted with us on at least 2 of our platforms and 57% in all 3. This is up from 73% and 47% 2 years ago. In most of these accounts, while they have adopted products from multiple platforms, we are early in driving each of our platforms wall to wall. This is a major area of focus for us as we move forward, driving consolidation within our 3 platforms. We know this is the right strategy and see compelling economics of multi-platform wins. Our 2 platform customers have an average customer lifetime value that is more than 5 times that of our single platform customer. For our 3 platform customers, that is more than 40x larger.\nWhile we are driving platformization, I personally think we should be doing this faster. Not only is this showing up in our deal statistics, but as we have established the portion of our platforms -- position of our platform, we're now seeing significant progress in consolidating vendors in our customer environments. We've built our Zero Trust platform through a consistent architecture across our appliance, software and SASE form factors. Customers can now consistently manage security policy across these form factors and then leverage a consistent set of security subscriptions to consolidate network security capabilities. These capabilities provided by point vendors can include intrusion prevention, web proxies, URL filtering, SD-WAN and DLP just to name a few.\nIn Q2, we saw Zero Trust consolidation wins that included a large U.S. manufacturing company standardizing on our network security platform in a $40 million transaction, replacing end of life competitive hardware, leveraging our security subscription that are moving a point competitor in SSE. We were the only company with the right certifications across all these offerings that could support their broad geographic footprint.\nThis deal was part of a consolidation and modernization effort across IT with positive ROI for the customer. We also had a 7-figure deal with a large law firm, expanding our firewall footprint in the new data center and expanding their hybrid workforce initiatives with Prisma Access. As part of this, we won versus other firewall and SSE competitors and also consolidate their URL filtering and VPN capabilities.\nIn Prisma Cloud, we have built a go-to cloud platform combining key best-of-breed capabilities that we have acquired or developed organically. Our common architecture and user experience spreads across 12 modules. As our customers adopt multiple modules, they can consolidate a wide variety of vendors, including those in cloud security posture management, cloud workload protection, API security, SCA or software composition analysis and infrastructure as code security amongst others.\nIn Q2, we closed a 7-figure Prisma Cloud new logo deal with a financial services company, displacing multiple incumbent vendors. The customer was looking for CNAPP solution to support their multi-cloud journey. The Prisma Cloud CNAPP streamlined several previously deployed point solutions and tools.\nWe also closed a 7-figure renew and expand deal with the leading North American technology company, where the customer intends to expand the use of Prisma Cloud to 7 modules and also value the consolidation and standardization delivered through Prisma Cloud.\nFinally, in our Cortex platform with our autonomous security operations platform, XSIAM, we were able to establish our offering, which has enabled us to accelerate platform value proposition with Cortex. A platform approach in the SOC is becoming a customer imperative as point products each of their own data stores cannot have full context, nor drive appropriate action without overly complex integration and high people cost.\nIn Q2, we saw consolidation wins that include a large insurance company that renew the subscription and support of firewalls at the same time added XSIAM and expanse capability for a $25 million transaction. The XSIAM choice displays the 2 leading EDR and SIM competitors in the market, enable the customer to avoid the cost of adding other point products in their stock.\nAdditionally, in Q2, we saw follow-on consolidation success with the Japanese manufacturing company. They had previously consolidated their network security across our SASE capabilities, leveraging Prisma Access in our DLP and CASB capabilities. The customer then added XSOAR into their SOC and expressed an interest in consolidating further. In Q2, they added XSIAM in a mid-7-figure deal.\nI know if you've had a chance to look at our guidance. Our guidance is not a consequence of a change in the demand outlook out there. Our guidance is a consequence of us driving a shift in our strategy in wanting to accelerate both our platformization and consolidation and activating our AI leadership. We believe this is the time for us to invest, given our leadership position in the market and our leadership position across platformization and consolidation.\nBut before I talk about that more as to how we intend to accelerate our growth prospects in the future, and drive towards a much higher aspiration of $15 billion in ARR by 2030, I want to give you a candid view of where we see the cybersecurity market and the demand function out there.\nThe demand story is no different from prior quarters and the margin continues to get stronger. There are multiple drivers fueling this. The threat landscape continues to challenge our customers with increasing scale and sophistication of attacks. I'm personally getting calls from CEOs and members of Boards that have had bad incidents as well as those that have seen their peers adversely impacted. We're increasingly focusing on working with companies impacted by breaches, an important commitment as we continue to be the leader in this space.\nLast quarter, we offered 1,500 of our top customers an opportunity to get our pre-support during a breach. Surprisingly, 400 customers have signed up in the last 90 days out of 1,500 to get our help on this topic. Clearly, there is awareness and concern around cybersecurity as has never been before. Heightened geopolitical tensions are driving significant nation state activity with national infrastructure being targeted. Successful breaches and ransomware attacks are being perpetrated across many industries and we see a few repercussions of those attacks. Although we did see various law enforcement agencies this morning or over the weekend shut down lock pit, which is a promising sign.\nThe new SEC mandate requires prompt disclosure material incidents, which often result in companies reporting those incidents before a full assessment can be done or incidents remediated .We see some companies making several disclosures in succession as they grapple with understanding the full extent of what they are facing. We see the results of these disclosure mandates recognizing the need for expedited action and security visibility and remediation in [indiscernible].\nThe part that is new, despite the many demand drivers we're seeing, we're beginning to notice customers are facing spending fatigue in cybersecurity. This is new. As adding incremental point products is not necessarily driving a better security outcome for them. This is driving a greater focus on ROI and total cost of ownership amongst most customers.\nThere are also some key trends within the industry that I think are worth highlighting. Palo Alto Networks is unique in seeing gains in market share in hardware firewalls or in the product space. This market is changing rapidly with us seeing some of our competitors who had introduced price increases begin to roll them back. From our advantage point, we see the share shift happening in our favor because we see customers consolidating into our Zero Trust platform. Customers, as I mentioned, 30% net new network security customers for SASE or new to Palo Alto. Those are the customers who over time go ahead and consolidate their footprint and require our firewalls to be deployed to give them a consistent zero-trust architecture.\nWe see this as a promising trend. We intend to accelerate that opportunity. Along with the incremental focus on ROI and TCO, the single product vendor is having challenges in articulating compelling value. They're also forced to have platformization narrative. When they're not able to convince the customers that their strategy is competitive, they are many times resorting to uneconomic pricing and putting pressure on transactions in this manner. We're beginning to see rogue behavior by some vendors in the space who are keen to retain their customers, primarily in the legacy vendor space and the startup space. We intend to combat that with investing in this space and trying to accelerate platformization and consolidation for our customers.\nWe're also seeing increased demand for AI along with deploying AI in our products or big DCR customers asking us to help them protect for a successful and responsible deployment of AI in their infrastructure. Putting this all together, these trends of the market bolster our conviction that adopting platforms is the only viable strategy for customers and leveraging AI is imperative. We want to match faster to our aspiration to become the Salesforce, to become the ServiceNow or the Workday of cybersecurity. Customers have adopted platforms in other markets across technology, and this will inevitably happen in cybersecurity. These industry trends set up conditions that favor leaders that can drive consolidation. We intend to answer this challenge.\nWith all the promise that platformization holds, adoption is not always easy for many of our customers. Until now, we have primarily assumed that our customers adopt our platforms in their own pace. The crux of challenge is around execution. Customers face risk in executing or making significant changes to their environments as well economic exposure from these changes. Key friction points we've noticed include the challenge of replacing multiple products simultaneously as well as the issues around double playing while working through complex contract terms.\nOver the last 6 months, we have been quietly working to develop programs that enable us to help minimize and even share in the risk of our customer space. You will see us tomorrow launching a significant number of platform offers to our customers to help drive this consolidation and platformization strategy. We believe we can build customer confidence in our platforms by approaching them well before their point product contracts expire. After we gain their contractual commitment, we have offered an extended rollout period where we can demonstrate our ability to deliver these platform benefits. Customers can then start paying us after the obligation of legacy vendors ends.\nWith the experience we have gained over the last 6 months, we believe now is the right time to accelerate programs across our portfolio to drive this platformization. All these programs will have mechanisms to reduce customer friction, accelerate product deployment, help customers realize the value of our platforms and consume new innovation sooner. While this is not an exhaustive list, I wanted to give you some examples.\nWe have begun to launch programs already that include legacy trade-ins, no cost introductory offers and product add-ons and incentives to accelerate estate standardization. Each of these programs is elements of reducing execution risk and dealing with economic exposure that concern our customers. In that sense, we must bear the cost of the transition through lower upfront financial outcomes, but we are convinced these will yield amazing outcomes for us in the mid- to long term.\nWe have developed these programs across all 3 platforms. And as I mentioned, we intend -- we have announced a few and we intend to announce more starting tomorrow in addition to expanding some of the programs that we already have.\nGiven this is an investor call, and you're all focused on these numbers, I want to provide you a high-level understanding of the aggregate impact we expect this will have in the medium term and long term. I will then have Dipak talk more about this in his section and explain this much more eloquently and elaborately.\nWe expect a typical customer entering into a platformization transaction will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth over the next 12 to 18 months. As customers move into the period where contracts of full billing and revenue contribution, we expect to see an acceleration in our top line metrics. Beyond this dip and acceleration in our top line metrics, we believe we can sustain higher growth rates for longer, driven by sticky and broad platform relationships with incremental customers, allowing us to aspire to goal of $15 billion in next-generation security in 2030.\nWe also expect to achieve our transformation to a business with greater than 90% recurring revenue and industry-leading non-GAAP operating margins in the low to mid-30s. As Dipak will explain, we believe we can do this in a financially prudent and strong manner.\nTalking about bigger platforms and ARR aspirations cannot be done today without talking about AI. We have been working on AI for a long time as a company. However, we did accelerate our efforts with the arrival of Generative AI. I personally believe AI is going to be one of the biggest inflection points in technology in over a decade and likely, more importantly, to significantly increase the total addressable market in cybersecurity.\nGartner predicts by 2027, $300 billion will be spent on the AI software. This AI juggernaut continues to bring several challenges along with it from a security perspective, multiple vectors of attacks, ranging from fishing to malware to nation state activity had inflected negatively due to AI. Furthermore, customers are evaluating dozens of co-pilots type offerings for their end users, where security is not necessarily front and center.\nWe see 3 discrete opportunities to drive additional growth in cybersecurity through AI and we have internally put pen to paper to understand this opportunity and we're in alpha or beta stages of many of these across our product capabilities.\nFirst, organizations are concerned about their employees access to AI in an insecure manner. Where as a consequence of unintended leakage of open source, other data models tampering or AI-driven fishing, we see an opportunity to add value across the growing volume of users we secure. We currently secured north of 100 million users and their access to applications both in the public cloud and in the data center. We expect each of these users is an opportunity for us to deliver an AI security sub for them. We believe it's a $3 billion to $5 billion opportunity over the next 5 years.\nSecondly, organizations are increasingly deploying AI-related workloads in the cloud, just like they need to understand the overall security posture of their cloud estates and expeditiously identify immediate issues. They must do this for AI-related workloads. We believe this in itself is a $5 billion to $6 billion opportunity in the next 5 years. Lastly, network traffic will increasingly have an AI context with interactions and transactions between applications and AI models.\nOur more than 0.5 million installed firewalls is the perfect place to inspect this traffic. We believe this is a $5 billion to $6 billion opportunity in the next 5 years. Overall, this combined $13 million to $17 million opportunity drives our conviction that investing in AI and maintaining our leadership can help us accelerate our growth towards $15 billion by 2030.\nBeyond the large opportunity, we also believe we are uniquely positioned to garner our fair share of the TAM. Our proprietary data and large technology footprint is a significant advantage in driving AI outcomes.\nWe've already seen the early benefits of this AI in our newly developed product offerings. In Q2, our AI offerings, which include XSIAM, Autonomous Digital Experience Management, or ADEM and AI ops crossed $100 million in ARR milestone. We are possibly the first security companies to cross $100 million ARR in AI security. This is above and beyond the AI capabilities we have embedded across all of our platforms, including our advanced subscriptions and our Code-to-Cloud platforms.\nOur co-pilots are an alpha and are in the hands of leading customers who are giving us feedback before we move to general availability. Looking forward, we have aggressive plans to roll out additional AI-based offerings by the end of this fiscal year. We have plans to offer 3 new product offerings, 1 to address each of the stance I talked about.\nBefore I wrap up and pass it on to Dipak, I'd like to summarize. We have established our platformization notion, our clear industry leadership position with our best-of-breed platforms and the industry trends convince us, we're in the best position to capitalize on this early trend and now focus on the next phase of cybersecurity, which is going to be all about consolidation.\nOne of the hardest things to do is to change the strategy that is working. We have spent time understanding how to accelerate our strategy further. We firmly believe as a management team that the changes we are making today are going to give us better prospects in the mid- to long term and allow us to drive this consolidation much faster whilst giving our customers better ROI and total cost of ownership. AI is an opportunity early stages. However, we are seeing the signs that there is significant demand there. It will prove to be an inflection point for cybersecurity and today will be marked as a day where we will see that inflection begin to take hold as we start to deliver more AI security products over the course of the rest of the year.\nWe have confidence we can drive our top line growth trajectory higher for longer ahead of the growth trajectory we talked about back in August despite absorbing some short-term impacts. We have shown we run the business in a financial prudent manner, which we will continue to do as we drive this acceleration, hitting our original operating profitability and cash flow margin targets.\nWith that, I will pass on to Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nCFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Given all that we have to talk about this quarter, I will do an abbreviated review of our Q2 results. You can refer to the press release and supplemental financial information on our website for our key numbers.\nFor Q2, revenue of $1.98 billion grew 19%. Product revenue grew 11% while total service revenue grew 22% with subscription revenue growing 26% and support revenue growing 14%.\nMoving on to geographies. We saw consistent revenue growth across all of our theaters with the Americas growing 19%, EMEA up 19%, and APAC also growing 19%. We had some puts and takes during the quarter related to billings. As Nikesh mentioned, we saw weakness in the U.S. federal vertical related to some specific programs. This U.S. federal weakness was a meaningful headwind to our billings in Q2 after we saw a slow start in the year to Fed. The impact of the federal deals on our revenue is significant as they are relatively shorter than our average contract term. At the same time, we saw a decrease in our non-backlog, which offset the Fed weakness in our billings. We continue to see customers closely watching cash outlays around deals, which we discussed last quarter, although this trend played out largely as we expected 90 days ago.\nRemaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $10.8 billion, and current RPO was $5.2 billion. You likely notice that our GAAP EPS was $4.89 and GAAP net income was $1.75 billion. These benefited from a $1.5 billion release of a tax-related valuation allowance. This was a onetime item in fiscal year '24, which has been adjusted out of our non-GAAP results. This amount also does not impact our cash taxes. Our average duration on new contracts was relatively flat year-over-year with average duration for new contracts remaining at approximately 3 years, while total contract duration was down slightly year-over-year.\nI did want to spend more time talking about our accelerated platformization and consolidation strategy and give you more of my perspective with some additional framing and detail with the financial lens. Nikesh talked about our programs to alleviate friction with customers. We believe that by moving from a deal-by-deal approach to a program-based and systematic approach, we can accelerate platformization with our customer base and drive then the consolidation faster by mitigating platformization friction. This results in a number of business benefits for us ranging from a faster capture of the customer estate and larger platform commitment to higher renewal and expansion rates and faster adoption of our new innovations.\nFor the customer, they are able to execute on the platform deployment with lower risk and consolidate vendors while benefiting from a lower cost -- total cost of ownership and the better security posture. As Nikesh gave you the high-level trajectory in our pipeline, I want to help you understand how we think about the medium term. Our platformization offers to drive consolidation effectively provide customers a period of the contract for free as part of their commitment. We expect we may see a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top line growth rate, notably billings. Some of our platformization programs embed deferred payments into deal structures, which we have spoken about in the past. We expect this will persist through fiscal year '25 as we anniversary the rollout of these programs and result in billings below the target we provided in August of 2023.\nBeyond this period, we expect we can sustain higher growth than we provided in these targets in August.\nFrom an NGS ARR perspective, we expect less impact on our year-end metrics, and we expect we can continue to meet or exceed our target, which calls for 30% growth rate through fiscal year '26. As Nikesh noted, we are establishing a long-term target of $15 billion of NGS ARR in fiscal year '30. Underlying this trend, we expect customers deploying our full set of platforms to have a higher makeup of NGS products. These offerings tend to be deeply installed in our customers' infrastructure and once a customer deploys the platform, it's easier to continue to consolidate vendors and adopt new innovations. We expect this to drive a significant increase in our overall revenue mix that is recurring.\nFrom a revenue perspective, we expect to see less pressure on revenue as compared to billings. Generally, we see a lag in changes in our revenue growth versus our billings growth, and we expect that this will happen here as well. As Nikesh mentioned, part of what gives us confidence to execute on the strategy and especially to do so now, is our success in driving profitable growth. As we embark on a strategy that we expect will negatively impact the top line in the short term, we have significant confidence that our business scales well and we can continue to see operating leverage from a number of drivers.\nAs I have mentioned multiple times before, we scale well across every line item of our P&L, ranging from customer support, the cloud hosting, the sales and marketing to G&A. And we've seen significant payoff from focusing on internal efficiency across all areas of the business. Let me give you some specific examples for Q2. First, in cloud hosting, we signed a significant extension with our primary cloud provider. This contract is constructed to enable us to drive further margin benefits as we scale. Second, within G&A, we're progressing well on a significant employee experience program. This started by analyzing all of our service desk tickets across all channels and identifying all the manual responses needed to address requests. The combination of process reengineering, automation and AI is still in progress, but we have already seen positive savings and have a target of automating 90% of the more than 300,000 manual interventions.\nBy the end of Q2, we roughly halved the cost of our T&E servicing. We are now leveraging this program as a template across other business areas. In short, whilst we made a lot of progress, we still have significant opportunities on the profitability front. That gives us confidence that we can maintain our medium-term operating margin and free cash margin targets beyond this year. Specifically, we believe that we can expand our operating margins by 100 basis points beyond this year in line with the operating margin guidance we gave in August of 28% to 29%. And this can continue to support our medium-term free cash flow margin target of 37% plus. We expect that this will come despite us absorbing some billings impact as we have both the benefit of some prior arrangements with deferred payments contributing as well as efforts we have placed on optimizing the cash dynamics of our vendor spending.\nIn short, I wanted to reiterate what Nikesh said that it is important for us to be able to manage through this platformization acceleration in a financially prudent manner, and we have set ourselves up well to do this over the next 12 to 18 months.\nNow moving on to the guidance for Q3 and the year. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.30 billion to $2.35 billion, an increase of 2% to 4%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.95 billion to $1.98 billion, an increase of 13% to 15%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.26, an increase of 13% to 15%.\nFor the fiscal year, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.10 billion to $10.20 billion, an increase of 10% to 11%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4 billion, an increase of 34% to 35%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.95 billion to $8 billion, an increase of 15% to 16%. We expect operating margins to be in the range 26.5% to 27%, an increase of 240 to 290 basis points year-over-year. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.55, an increase of 23% to 25%. We expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 38% to 39%.\nIn the interest of time and to get as many of your questions as possible, we've included the modeling points in the appendix of our earnings presentation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion of the call.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call. Q1 was the first quarter of our 3-year plan we presented in August. If I were to summarize the quarter, I would say the following.\nWe continue to execute amazingly well in what is a volatile environment. On the geopolitical front, we've been contending with what's happening in Israel and Ukraine. On the hardware or product front, as you see, there has been normalization in the industry. It's something we've been indicating for a while. Backlog is being shipped, supply chain issues are behind us, and product growth is normalizing in the industry. We continue to see normal strength as we indicated in prior quarters in that category.\nOn the macroeconomic front, business practices continue to adapt and adjust to new normal with higher interest rates for longer. Internally, on the product side, we've had one of the strongest starts to our fiscal year. In addition to various recognitions, we have delivered strong innovation across all 3 platforms. We launched an AI-enabled cloud manager in network security to continue our consolidation and platformization efforts towards Zero Trust.\nIn SASE, we announced our intent to deliver enterprise browsers, the Talon acquisition, which will solve one of the critical issues in remote access, which is not addressed today by any SASE vendor. We released the industry's first integrated UI for code to cloud in Prisma Cloud and announced the acquisition of Dig Security to double down on data security for generative AI in Prisma Cloud. Last but not the least, in Cortex, we launched XSIAM 2.0 with Bring Your Own AI.\nOn the go-to-market side, Q1 is seasonally a slower start as we kick off the new year. But the team delivered superior revenue and profitability, and we had our highest cash collection quarter in our history. We continue to see steady execution in our firewall, cloud and endpoint businesses. In SASE, we continue to position ourselves in larger and more strategic deals. And XSIAM, while in its early days, continues to garner tremendous interest, giving us more comfort around our long-term intentions. So in summary, a strong start in Q1 towards our 3-year journey. Early days, but confidence is inspiring.\nLet's dig into details. Our Q1 revenue grew 20%, and our billings grew 16%, while our RPO growth of 26% exceeded both of these and was driven by our next-generation security capabilities. I would like you to pay particular attention to RPO versus billings. Dipak will talk about the difference at length and explain why the Street might be confused with our future billings guidance.\nOur Q1 non-GAAP operating margins expanded by 760 basis points, driving $1.38 in non-GAAP earnings per share, and we generated record $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow in Q1. If you look at what's going on from an overall cybersecurity perspective, we have never seen as much adversarial and consistent activity at scale as we have seen in the first quarter.\nUnfortunately, we don't expect this to abate anytime soon. As a consequence of this increased activity and in recognition of our customers' commitment to us, this week, we announced the Unit 42 rapid incident response retainer at no cost to all of our strategic customers, aimed at providing additional support during this escalating threat landscape.\nRansomware attacks are increasing in frequency and severity. The ransom amounts being paid are also increasing. Bad actors are doing damage in a much shorter amount of time. As an example, in a recent engagement of our Unit 42 team, we saw an instance where bad actors extracted 2.4 terabytes of data in just 14 hours. There's also some evidence that the adversaries are beginning to leverage generative AI as a tool to make attacks more sophisticated.\nNot just that. Based on what we are seeing in Unit 42, most attacks are now happening on the back of vulnerabilities in widely used software and APIs, such as the widely exploited MOVEit file transfer software.\nUnfortunately, these bad actors remain elusive with no apparent significant increase in convictions in high-profile attacks and, therefore, not surprisingly, this malicious activity continues. At the same time, U.S. publicly listed companies and their Boards are confronted with new SEC disclosure requirements around prompt public reporting and material cybersecurity incidents and the enhanced oversight responsibility that comes with them. This result is a continued focus across organizations on understanding security posture, cybersecurity risk and how to mitigate this risk effectively.\nThis increasingly involves not only the CISO but the entire IT organization, legal, finance and the CEO and the full Board of Directors. This pace of malicious activity and the Board-level focus on cybersecurity risk is fueling a strong demand environment. Customers have often have multiple strategic priorities in cybersecurity, and our broad portfolio enable us to align with these priorities.\nIn Q1, the cost of money remained a constant discussion and customers' significant focus on this topic is becoming the new normal. The way it manifests itself in our business is that there's always a payment and duration discussion in final renegotiations. Given our strong balance sheet, we can use a mix of strategies to navigate the environment. This includes annual billing plans, financing through PANFS and partner financing. Whilst this does not impact our business demand or impact to annual revenue or annual metrics, it does create variability on total billings more than before, depending on financing use or the duration of contracts.\nI am not concerned about the demand for cybersecurity for this quarter and upcoming quarters nor am I concerned about our ability to execute. The billings variability is a pure consequence of the payment conversations that we're having with our customers, and this is validated by the fact that we continue to see strong RPO and low churn, suggesting this is a cosmetic impact to our business.\nWe continue to see strong interest across our next-generation security portfolio, and we're making progress on our platformization journey. I'll highlight a few deals to talk about the diversity of opportunity, cross-platform buys as well as the geographical distribution of our deals.\nFor example, a federal government agency signed a $25 million expansion transaction, including adding Cortex XDR and Prisma Access in highly competitive situations, expanding their network security footprint. This customer has now spent over $100 million over its lifetime across our [ chief ] platform. A large global SaaS provider signed an $18 million Prisma Cloud transaction to consume modules across the portfolio. The customer is already a customer for our network security and Cortex platforms. A large educational organization expanded its relationship with us in the first quarter in a $15 million transaction, adding XSIAM, Prisma Cloud and an expansion of its network security footprint. And lastly, a nation state signed a $28 million deal. That is a first of its kind, standardizing on both SASE and XSIAM. This is a long sales cycle and represents our systematic approach to platformization.\nThe story in these deals has been playing out across our large customers. As of Q1, 56% of the Global 2000s has transacted with us across Strata, Prisma and Cortex. This continued focus on customer cyber transformation has fueled a 53% growth in NGS ARR we report this quarter, as we broke through the $3 billion milestone. Another exciting news as of Q1, recurring revenue across Palo Alto is 83% of our total revenue from 77% a year ago.\nLet's turn on to updates from our 3 platforms that are the engine driving our success. First, in network security. We continue to drive innovation across our portfolio and see momentum as customers drive towards Zero Trust architecture. This month, we unveiled PAN-OS 11.1 or Cosmos and Strata Cloud Manager, unifying the management of all of our 3 form factors and all security services in a single pane of glass and also leveraging AI to analyze security policies, reduce risk configurations and predict and prevent disruptions.\nCustomers who invest in our platform by deploying all 3 form factors continue to grow rapidly, up 34%. Of our top 100 network security customers, 60% have purchased all 3 form factors, up from 53% a year ago. On average, these platform customers spend more than 15x of the rest of our network security customer spend.\nThe story is similar in SASE. Having just seen our innovations gain multiple industry recognitions in SASE in the second half of our fiscal year, we've continued to invest to build on our leadership position. We're seeing strong momentum in SASE, with ARR growth of approximately 60% in Q1. We also saw 35% of our $5 million or greater network security transaction include SASE, up from less than 10% a year ago.\nToday was the first day of our event called SASE Converge, where we unveiled several enhancements. We have enabled SASE to access applications with performance faster than the Internet. We added visibility and control over interconnected SaaS applications and enabled safe access to gen AI tools to ensure data isn't inadvertently leaked. Lastly, we added remote browser isolation technology for an extra layer of security.\nM&A has always been an important part of our strategy. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Talon Cyber Security. We see an opportunity to expand the addressable market for SASE and solve an important customer problem. As many as 36% of workers classify themselves as independent workers, who often use unmanaged devices for work. In addition, employees increasingly use personal devices for accessing business applications. To enable access on these devices, security teams have an impossible trade-off. They're forced to either ignore security entirely in favor of flexibility and user experience or to adopt cumbersome technologies like VDI. Talon is a pioneer in the emerging enterprise browser category and when combined with Prisma SASE after closing, we will enable users to securely access business applications from any device, including mobile devices and noncorporate devices, with a seamless user experience. We intend to include this capability with Prisma Access after closing, and customers will be able to extend the same best-in-class security to unmanaged devices.\nMoving on to Prisma Cloud. We continue to see a strong endorsement of our integrated platform strategy. This traction is evident in the strong growth of our multi-module customers. We have seen particular success here with modules released over the last 2.5 years. There has been a consistent pattern of seeing 100-plus customers for new modules in the first full quarter of launch and rapid growth after that as the benefits of these new modules are broadly understood. This enthusiastic adoption has driven our strong conviction in adding key new modules, including some through acquisitions.\nOur IaC scanning capability, which came through the Bridgecrew acquisitions, and CI/CD security, which came through Cider, are 2 such examples. This new module traction is helping to accelerate Prisma Cloud new business ACV in the last quarters.\nIn Q1, we also unveiled a major new Prisma Cloud release, Darwin. Darwin further differentiates our unique position across code, cloud infrastructure and cloud run time. Darwin enables a view across all elements of cloud applications, including cloud services, infrastructure assets, compute workloads, API endpoints, data and code. Darwin can also help customers understand risks with deep context and overlay active attack attempts in near real-time. Our full coverage from code to cloud enables fixes to be applied immediately versus the months most vulnerabilities take to be patched.\nAbout 2 weeks ago, we announced our intention to acquire Dig Security, which will bring an award-winning data security posture management capability with Prisma Cloud. With almost 70% of organizations having data stored in a public cloud, this sprawl of new cloud data services and the adoption of generative AI, we see an increased need to identify sensitive data, effectively manage user access and implement robust security measures to prevent unauthorized internal and external access to this data stored in the cloud. After the close of proposed acquisition, Dig's capabilities will be integrated in the Prisma Cloud platform to provide near real-time data protection from code to cloud.\nMoving on to Cortex. We continue to invest across our product portfolio, expand our customer count as we see continued adoption of XDR, XSOAR, Xpanse and XSIAM. In Q1, we had several industry recognitions of our innovation. Cortex XDR was the only product in the industry to achieve 100% protection and detection in the Round 5 MITRE evaluation.\nAdditionally, XSOAR, Xpanse and XSIAM were all named leaders by third parties this quarter. We grew our Cortex active customer count by 25% to over 5,300 customers. Our traction overall in Cortex is essential as it allows us to sell our transformational offering, XSIAM. XSIAM has had a very fast start since we released the product just over a year ago. After a strong FY '23, XSIAM's first year of release which included over $200 million in bookings, we followed up with a strong Q1. We saw our first expansion purchase of XSIAM, an 8-figure deal.\nAnd in Q1, our largest XSIAM customer to date was deployed with over 300,000 endpoints. We're seeing XSIAM transform customer security operations and significantly improve their security outcomes. This includes significant reductions in the mean time to detect and resolve security incidents. On the back of potential customers hearing about early XSIAM success, our pipeline for XSIAM is over $1 billion, of which $500 million was created just in this past quarter.\nAs I began my remarks, Q1 was the first quarter of us delivering on the 3-year plan we presented in August. We're driving profitable growth, investing in innovation, next-generation security and the industry's largest dedicated security go-to-market organization, at the same time, leveraging the scale of Palo Alto Networks. Demand for cybersecurity is strong. Given the backdrop of attacks and the ever-increasing focus and scrutiny around cyber risk, execution continues to be paramount given the macro conditions. And we will continue to be adept and respond with the changes in the environment.\nWe will manage for long-term growth, operating margin and free cash flow and ensure we continue to transform the business and build revenue predictably. You will soon see this through RPO and most importantly, our current RPO. Our long-term forecast thesis remains intact. Whilst we expect short-term variability in billings, we don't expect this to have a meaningful impact on our ability to deliver our 3-year targets.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nCFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll cover the specifics of our Q1 results, additional details on drivers behind the results and our Q2 and fiscal year 2024 guidance. For Q1, revenue was $1.88 billion and grew 20%. Product revenue grew 3%. Total service revenue grew 25% with subscription revenue of $988 million, growing 29%, and support revenue of $549 million, growing 17%.\nWe saw consistent revenue contribution across all theaters. Americas grew 20%, EMEA was up 19%, and JAPAC grew 23%. The strength of our next-generation capabilities continues to drive our results, with NGS ARR exceeding $3 billion for the first time and growing 53%. We saw strong contributions across this portfolio in Q1. We delivered total billings of $2.02 billion, up 16%. Total deferred revenue in Q1 was $9.4 billion, an increase of 32%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $10.4 billion, increasing 26% with current RPO just under half of our RPO.\nAs Nikesh mentioned, we saw the rising cost of money have an important and incremental impact on customer behavior in Q1. We are responding to this in the ways we have discussed previously, including using annual billing plans, financing through PANFS and partner financing. In Q1, this had a negative impact on our billings. Although as you can see, we saw strength in NGS ARR and revenue. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was significantly ahead of our guidance, growing 66%. This was driven primarily by the significant increase in our non-GAAP operating margins, which expanded 760 basis points year-over-year.\nWe continue to benefit from the scale inherent in our business especially in some of our next-generation security offerings at scale. We again delivered strong cash flow in Q1 with trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow of $3 billion, achieving trailing 12-month free cash flow margins of 41%.\nMoving beyond the top line. Gross margin for Q1 at 78% increased 370 basis points year-over-year. We again saw year-over-year improvements in product margins with the normalization of the supply chain environment. Service gross margin improved to 78% as our newer offerings continued to gain scale. Our operating margin expanded by 760 basis points in Q1 as we saw higher gross margins and efficiencies across our 3 operating expense lines. We are pleased with our operating efficiency progress against our medium-term targets. We continue to make significant investments to support our top line growth expectations, including investments in product and engineering, building sales capability and supporting our ecosystems and our go-to-market organization.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended Q1 with cash equivalents and investments of $6.9 billion. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.526 billion with total adjusted free cash flow of $1.489 billion this quarter. As is typical for our Q1, this cash flow performance was primarily driven by strong collections in the prior quarter based on the strength of our Q4 bookings -- sorry, collections in the quarter, but based on the strength of our Q4 bookings.\nOver the last several weeks, we announced that we have entered into definitive agreements to acquire 2 companies. On October 31, we announced our intent to acquire Dig Security Solutions for approximately $232 million in cash, excluding the value of replacement equity awards. On November 6, we announced our intent to acquire Talon Cyber Security for approximately $435 million, excluding the value of replacement equity awards and inclusive of cash on Talon's balance sheet at closing. We expect both transactions will close in our second quarter of fiscal year '24.\nDuring Q1, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares on the open market at an average price of approximately $227 per share for a total consideration of $67 million. As a reminder, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, and we're committed to returning cash to shareholders over the medium term. Stock-based compensation expense declined by 250 basis points as a percent of revenue year-over-year. As expected, stock-based compensation ticked up slightly as a percent of revenue quarter-over-quarter with the issuance of a portion of our fiscal year '24 grants. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to manage our SBC down as a percent of revenue, in line with our long-term plans.\nBefore turning to guidance, I want to frame some of the impacts that we're seeing on our billings. As Nikesh noted, we see strong demand in the market and continue to see customers make a technical selection of offerings across our portfolio. From here, we see more customers asking for deferred payment terms either with annual billings, financing through PANFS or pursuing external financing. Some customers are looking for additional discounts for upfront payments as they grapple with the cost of money. Our strong financial position, which includes $7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, combined with our many options in dealing with this dynamic, gives us significant flexibility. This can impact our billings trends quarter-to-quarter, and we're reducing our billings guidance to account for this through the fiscal year 2024.\nRPO and cRPO have more of a direct impact on future revenue. This quarter, with duration towards the low end of the range we've seen over the last several quarters, we saw strong trends in cRPO. As we see low customer churn, we're confident that independent of specific billing terms and contract lengths, we can continue to grow RPO at levels that support our forward revenue growth ambitions.\nNow moving on to our guidance for Q2 and the year. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.335 billion to $2.385 billion, an increase of 15% to 18%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.955 billion to $1.985 billion, an increase of 18% to 20%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.31 a share, an increase of 23% to 25%. For the fiscal year 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion, an increase of 16% to 17%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4 billion, an increase of 34% to 35%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $8.15 billion to $8.2 billion, an increase of 18% to 19%. We expect our fiscal year '24 operating margins to be in the range 26% to 26.5%, up 190 to 240 basis points versus fiscal year '23. We expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.53, an increase of 22% to 25%. And we expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 37% to 38%.\nAdditionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. We also expect cash taxes in the range of $230 million to $280 million. For the second quarter, we expect net interest and other income of $55 million to $60 million. We expect second quarter diluted shares outstanding of 339 million to 342 million shares. We expect fiscal year 2024 diluted shares outstanding of 338 million to 343 million shares. We expect fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures of $175 million to $185 million and $40 million to $45 million in Q2.\nWith that, I'll pass it back to Walter for the Q&A portion of the call.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nikesh.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nRepresentative Director, President and Chief Operating Officer, SoftBank Group Corp.\n\nThank you, Walter, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for spending your Friday afternoon or perhaps some part of your Friday evening with us. Our choice of Friday has definitely made us the topic du jure these past 2 weeks and has made for some very interesting reading of all the analyst notes.\nWe apologize to people who are inconvenienced. But as we had mentioned in our press release, we wanted to give ample time to analysts to have one-on-one calls with us over the weekend, and we have a sales conference that kicks off on Sunday. We want to make sure all of our information was disclosed out there. So again, we apologize for the unique Friday afternoon earnings call.\nBut clearly, we have enjoyed the attention. Well, let me go and just straightaway dive into our Q4 results. We started off the year focusing on excellence in execution. We stayed true to that and delivered strong results in Q4, capping off a strong fiscal year 2023, where we met or exceeded our original top line guidance and significantly exceeded our profitability and cash flow guidance.\nThis year indeed required clear focus across our company, and we're all proud that our team delivered throughout the year and especially in Q4. Our Q4 revenue grew 26% making our -- marking our 12th consecutive quarter of revenue growth north of 20%. Our billings grew 18% of a very strong 44% growth in Q4 a year ago, and RPO grew 30% ahead of our revenue growth.\nOur Q4 operating margins expanded by 760 basis points, driving $1.44 in non-GAAP earnings per share, and we achieved 39% adjusted free cash flow margins for the year. Our performance in Q4 did not come as a surprise to us. We've been investing in our next-generation security portfolio for sometime now to position ourselves in the leadership position for the future of the cybersecurity market.\nIt is this next-gen portfolio driving -- that is our growth transformation and enabling our leverage. Lee and his team will expand on this in the forward-looking part of our program. We achieved several important milestones in this quarter, especially in our software and cloud-based businesses this year. Our combined SASE, Cortex and cloud bookings were north of $1 billion in Q4.\nOur Cortex platform surpassed $1 billion in annual bookings last quarter, and we achieved the same milestone with SASE this quarter. We also exceeded $500 million in Prisma Cloud ARR. These product performances are all contributed to the strong growth we continue to enjoy in NGS ARR. Remember, that our NGS business is largely a capability new to us in the last 5 years and is primarily cloud delivered.\nThis quarter, we added more new ARR than any other pure-play cybersecurity company. Our platformization is continuing to drive large deal momentum. One way to illustrate the traction of our next-generation security capability across network security, cloud security and SOC automation, so look at the makeup of some of our largest deals.\nWhen we deliver best-of-breed products that are also integrated into platforms, we help customers simplify their architectures, lower their cost of ownership and benefit from differentiated cross-platform capabilities. This is a win-win scenario. 8 out of our top 10 deals saw a significant contribution from our next-generation security capabilities, 5 were essentially next-generation security deals.\nHere are some examples: one, a large industrial manufacturer signed a transaction with a total value of $45 million. Our Prisma Access expansion led the transaction, but also included significant commitments to Prisma Cloud, XDR and our IoT security offerings. The customer success with Prisma Access and our executive level engagement were keys to winning this additional opportunity.\nA large professional services firm, standardized on Prisma Access and a transaction exceeding $40 million, securing their hundreds of thousands of users. The completeness of our offering, particularly our strong capabilities and private access, differentiates us from the competition by standardizing on Prisma Access to customer consolidated legacy security offerings from many competitors to a single solution.\nA large retailer also signed a landmark transaction for more than $40 million, led by XSIAM. In this deal, we displaced the incumbent SIEM offering and also added our threat intelligence and attack surface management capabilities. Rounding out the examples, a large technology service provider chose our XDR and XSIAM capabilities in a transaction worth over $30 million. This deal started as an independent evaluation of replacement for both endpoint security in their SIEM.\nThis is the second quarter in a row where we have signed an 8-figure deal that was driven by a unique capability to provide both XDR and XSIAM, competing against separate competitors in each of these categories. This sample represents the success we see across industries and regions. As I mentioned, a critical part of our profitable growth formula is selling more to our largest customers.\nIn Q4, we saw our larger deals grow faster than our overall business. Notably, we saw the number of deals greater than $20 million grow faster than our deals over $10 million as our go-to-market motion becomes more and more increasingly successful in selling the platform and building the sort of trusted relationships required to close this quarter of our business.\nNow for the surprise of this quarter, starting with Cortex. There are a number of things I'm excited about in this business as we ended this year. We launched XSIAM to general availability last October and set an aggressive goal of booking north of $100 million in our first year. The year is not over yet. We have closed out the year achieving $200 million in XSIAM.\nThis is strong validation that our outcome-based value proposition on XSIAM is resonating well with security organizations and also a sign that interest in applying AI to transform security operations is very high. Lee will talk extensively about this in our forward-looking section. Our customers have told us loud and clear that the legacy products powering their SOCs are no longer working and they need to reduce their mean time remediation by an order of magnitude.\nThis becomes increasingly important with the new SEC rules detailing that all public companies will be required to report material breaches within 4 business days. XSIAM is shaping up to be our fastest-growing offering outside our original next-generation firewall releases. XSIAM transactions are large and long term, which helped to further our goal of evolving our customer relationships from vendor to partner.\nAs excited as we are about the early success of XSIAM, we are also seeing strong growth across the entire family of Cortex products, namely XDR, XSOAR and Expanse. We crossed the 5,000 customer milestone in Cortex as we continue to gain share in the market and see the opportunities for upsell to the platform. Our average Cortex deal size grew over 50% year-over-year, reflecting our success in cross Cortex adoption.\nMoving on to the next star of the quarter, SASE. SASE continues to become our standout offering. We're seeing strong customer awareness and momentum following our new leadership position in the Gartner SSE Magic Quadrant last quarter. We were recognized this quarter with a leadership position of the Forrester Zero Trust edge wave that was published earlier in the week, establishing Palo Alto Networks as a clear industry leader in SASE.\nWe also have some breaking news on industry recognition, very excited that Palo Alto Networks has been recognized as the only, I repeat, the only leader in Gartner's first single vendor SASE Magic Quadrant just published on Wednesday. Our recent acceleration and external industry recognition has contributed to customer momentum, and we saw many new customers and large expansion transactions in Q4.\nThis included 4 transactions over $10 million and many 7-figure deals that span numerous industries and regions. Not to be left behind, Prisma Cloud went past $5 million in ARR. Our cloud security platform, where we believe all companies will eventually to manage security across multiple cloud applications and providers through a single platform, continues to show strength, ensuring customers consume our capabilities after committing to the platform is vital.\nIn Q4, we saw steady consumption growth with credits consumed up by 45%. We're also seeing strong growth in customer adoption of multiple modules this quarter. We are showing our growth in customers with 5 modules more as it is starting to become a meaningful trend with customers up 179% year-over-year.\nWe continue to make significant organic investments in Prisma Cloud and grow the platform through acquisitions. We launched the CICD security module last week based on technology from the cybersecurity acquisition. This is our 11th module, and we continue to have the broadest cloud native application protection platform in the industry with capabilities spanning our customers' entire code to cloud needs.\nLater in our call, you will get a chance to see our exciting developments and glimpse into our plans for the future. Finishing where I started, I couldn't be more proud of our performance in Q4 and the year. Our teams helped drive steady performance, enabling us to maintain a strong outlook through macro challenges by focusing on crisply executing our differentiated strategy.\nWe continue to drive platformization and capitalize on the opportunity the changing landscape presents for products like XSIAM. We continued with our go-to-market transformation. For example, we consolidated our SASE sales team into our core a year ago, and we had a strong outcome, as you saw, with some large transactions and opportunities across the pipeline.\nWe have continued to not hold back on investing in innovation to ensure we can capture share in a market that constantly presents new opportunities. Lastly, we successfully accelerated some of our efficiency initiatives in fiscal year as we saw the environment change. I'll now pass the floor to Dipak to cover the detailed financial results and our 2024 guidance.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nCFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Beyond providing the detailed results this quarter, I also wanted to highlight some additional business insights through the Q4 numbers to help you understand our results and provide context for our go-forward plans.\nAs Nikesh mentioned, we saw strength across our various metrics, starting with the top line. This was especially true in our NGS ARR and RPO. NGS ARR grew 56%, driven by strength across our portfolio. RPO grew 30%, well ahead of our revenue growth. Broadly, the industry has experienced an increase in deal scrutiny as well as deal pushouts.\nThe environment has become more challenging this year, and we started telling you about that at the beginning of our fiscal year. We got ahead of this changing environment by front-loading our sales hiring for the year, training our teams to address the tougher procurement processes and by having our sales management teams apply additional scrutiny to the pipeline earlier in the quarter.\nAs a result of these efforts, we did not see a significant impact in Q4 from unexpected deal delays. We did see, however, see 2 impacts on the top line from the changing environment: first, the rising cost of money has caused customers to hold on to their cash and more frequently seek deferred payment terms. These deferred payment terms are delivered in the form of annual billing plans and through our PANFS financing capability.\nThe percent of bookings that included deferred payments increased approximately 45% year-over-year. Additionally, the proportion of our bookings have included billing plans more than doubled from Q3 to Q4. This quarter-to-quarter increase negatively impacted our billings as compared to what we forecasted 90 days ago in our guidance.\nAs we see this shift in billing terms, RPO is becoming a more important leading indicator for our business as it's not impacted by billing terms. As a reminder, RPO represents the booked business we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods. Also, all customers' purchases, including an RPO, are noncancelable.\nSecond, we have seen the market return to a more normalized growth rate in hardware-based firewalls, and I wanted to help further the collective understanding of this. As many of you are aware, there have been several factors that have impacted industry hardware revenue. These include the COVID pandemic, the reopening-related hardware demand catch-up, post-COVID supply chain challenges, price changes and backlog release following supply chain easing.\nDespite these positive and negative fluctuation, there's a relatively consistent level of underlying hardware growth that is in the low to mid-single digits. And we see the industry returning to those levels. This return to normalized appliance growth is also happening on the backdrop of a broader transition from hardware to software in network security and growth in new security markets.\nWe are unique in being recognized as a leader across different network security form factors, including our software-based VMs and our cloud-delivered SASE. Our firewalls or platform billings growth captures our business across these form factors and grew north of 20% in the last 3 years. Within this business, we have seen the mix of software increase substantially.\nOver the medium term, this mix transition to software and cloud and network security as well as the growth we are seeing in the rest of our next-generation security portfolio and driving an increase in our occurring revenue mix. Our platform business model and our focus on efficiency drove significant improvements in operating margin in fiscal year '23, including 760 basis points of margin expansion in Q4.\nThis higher operating profitability, strong bookings growth and interest income performed a baseline for our free cash flow at higher levels as we achieve 39% adjusted free cash flow margins in fiscal year '23. The same dynamic of higher deferred payment plans not only had an impact on our top line, but also on our free cash flow.\nAs I mentioned in my discussion of RPO, it is noteworthy that we absorbed the impact of the higher mix of bookings with deferred payment terms in Q4 and fiscal year '23. And we were still able to exceed our cash flow margin target for the year. If you look on a multiyear basis, we've seen the proportion of our bookings that occur with deferred payment plans increase over 4x in the last 3 years, while we grew our free cash flow margins over the same period.\nAs I will talk about when I come back in the second half of the program, this gives us confidence we can maintain our free cash flow margins at a high baseline. Moving on to the rest of the results. Product revenue grew 24% in Q4, driven by the impacts we noted last quarter from new go-to-market motions and SKUs that contributed more renewable software revenue to product than in the past.\nTotal subscription and support revenue grew 27% with subscription revenue of $918 million, growing 31% and support revenue of $528 million, growing 20%. We saw consistent revenue growth across all our theaters with the Americas growing 26%, EMEA was also up 26% and JPAC growing 24%.\nGross margin for Q4 of 77.3% increased over 400 basis points year-over-year. This caps off a year where gross margins expanded by 230 basis points as we saw a benefit from higher software mix and some scale synergies on our customer support spending. Our operating margin expanded well over 700 basis points in Q4 and over 500 basis points for the year.\nWe saw the higher gross margins and efficiency across our 3 operating expense lines as we accelerated some of our efficiency initiatives. As happy as we are about the outcomes here, we're only part of the way through executing on these multiyear efforts. The result of all of this is that we continue to see strong non-GAAP EPS growth due to substantial operating leverage, which also translated to strength in GAAP EPS, which more than doubled quarter-to-quarter.\nWe are now firmly GAAP profitable with GAAP net income of over $200 million in the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q4 with cash equivalents and investments of $5.4 billion. We had our 2023 convertible notes mature on July 1, 2023, and we settled the principal obligation with cash of $1.7 billion. We settled the access in shares and had previously accounted for these in our non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding.\nQ4 cash flow from operations was $414 million with total adjusted free cash flow of $388 million this quarter. Stock-based compensation expense declined by 310 basis points as a percent of revenue sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, stock-based compensation expense was down 220 basis points as a percent of revenue.\nI'd like to provide the details of our fiscal year 2024 guidance as well as guidance for Q1 before we move on to the broader forward-looking section of the presentation, where we will provide context for this guidance and talk about our medium-term targets. Overall, we are pleased we capped a strong year of growth and margins and look forward for more to come.\nFor the fiscal year 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $10.9 billion to $11 billion, an increase of 19% to 20%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4 billion, an increase of 34% to 36%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $8.15 billion to $8.2 billion, an increase of 18% to 19%. For fiscal '24, we expect operating margins to be in the range of 25% to 25.5%.\nWe expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $527 million to $540 million, an increase of 19% to 22%, and we expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 37% to 38%. For the first fiscal quarter of 2024, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.08 billion, an increase of 17% to 19%.\nWe expect revenue to be in the range of $1.82 billion to $1.85 billion, an increase of 16% to 18%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.17, an increase of 39% to 41%. Additionally, please consider the following modeling points: first, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for the first quarter in fiscal year 2024, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation.\nWe also expect cash taxes in the range of $230 million to $280 million. This is an increase as compared to the $150 million in cash taxes in fiscal year 2023. For the first quarter, we expect net interest and other income of $50 million to $55 million. We expect first quarter diluted shares outstanding of 336 million to 339 million shares. We expect fiscal year 2024 diluted shares outstanding of 338 million to 343 million shares.\nAnd we expect fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures of $160 million to $170 million. With that, I'd pass it back to Walter to start the short Q&A covering what we had discussed up to this point. Walter?\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nRepresentative Director, President and Chief Operating Officer, SoftBank Group Corp.",
    "content2": "Well, that's a wrap on our Q4 results. The reason we wanted to make sure you had the opportunity to enjoy our Friday evening celebrations in the context of a long-term or midterm outlook from us was we wanted to make sure that you see our FY '24 guidance in the context of where we believe we are in the next 3- to 5-year journey.\nI think what's important to understand is that over the last 5 years, the cybersecurity TAM has continued to rise. It has grown at approximately 14%, and it has grown twice the pace at which the IT market has grown. Now the reasons for that are, as we get down these transformations that are going on in the world, we get more and more reliant on e-commerce, as we get more and more reliant on digital transformation movement is about and possibly now with the sort of arrival of AI as a mainstream opportunity, every one of us is trying to make sure we grab that with both hands.\nSo we will continue to see the pace of technology spend go sort of up or forward. Similarly, we're going to see that cybersecurity is going to get more than its fair share of growth. So from an opportunity perspective from what's going on in the market, we believe the cybersecurity market is robust and will continue to be so in the next 3 to 5 years.\nHaving said that, if you look deeper, there are actually 3 things going on in that market: one, there are new markets being created. If you look at the last 5 years, we saw a sort of a surge in this concept called SASE. We saw SASE come on mainstream. Everybody is out there trying to build a SASE business. That's kind of been a big thing.\nAs we had anticipated and talked about 5 years ago, cloud continues to become bigger and bigger. As companies go sign up with cloud service providers, they are beginning to go move their applications from on-prem or their hybrid cloud to the public cloud. Now it's important to understand is that approximately 80% of the applications in the world are actually homegrown applications, which are working on on-prem data centers.\nAs we go forward, we're seeing enterprises take those applications, reimagine them, rewrite them, rearchitect them and move them to the public cloud. Now that work has to be done by 33 million developers around the world, which work for these companies. As they write new code, as they put together a code by looking at open source and having stuff from here and there, there is this real opportunity to make sure that, that code that is written is written in such a way that is secure, is secured by design.\nSo you will continue to see that cloud security part of that market grow, but that's a market that's effectively been created in the last 5 years. Couple that with the arrival of IoT and OT as mainstream opportunities, we've seen even that market has been sort of a new market. Approximately it's a $30 billion market between those categories, which has been built over the last 5 years, driving some of the cybersecurity opportunity.\nOutside of that, in the underlying cybersecurity market, we've also noticed that some markets have undergone to transformation. We're seeing a large transformation in network security as people try and figure out how much to go in the public cloud, how much to leave in the data center, how much hardware to deploy, how much software to deploy.\nWe're seeing that network security is beginning to evolve from a hardware-only market to effectively a faster-growing software part of the network security market. Not just that, what we're also seeing is things like SD-WAN, which are part of the networking TAM are now moving into cybersecurity because people want an integrated solution as a SASE solution between SD-WAN and your security protocol. So it's interesting.\nThere are markets going -- undergoing inflection like network security. The market of endpoint has gone through a huge inflection in the last 5 years. We've seen people go from endpoint protection to EDR and XDR. We've seen an explosion, there are about 14 vendors at last count in the EDR XDR space, but you can see clear leaders emerging, which are down to 2 or 3 players in that space.\nAnd there's a huge inflection going on there. We think not just there. You're going to see a large inflection in effectively what is a 15-year-old market called SIEM and SOC. That market has been -- a technology that has not been evolved for the last 15 years. It's primarily been a reactive technology where if I am breached, I need to figure out what to do, and we collect a lot of data and analyze it.\nThat's no longer going to work, the arrival of AI, the need for automation, the need for normalized data, actually going to force that market to inflect. And that's something we'll talk about more. And you saw already in our Q4 results at something like XSIAM, which is targeted to that market, is where the real opportunity is for that inflection to continue, for that market to go through its own transformation.\nOutside of that, there are still about $30-plus billion in sort of steady cybersecurity segments as well as about $80 million of services, which we think will also continue to evolve in the next 3 to 5 years. So with that in mind, I think it's important to think about where we were when we thought about the transformation of Palo Alto Networks 5 years ago, where we said, cloud is going to be big, AI is going to be big, and the networks are going to have to start getting reimagined as we go towards the cloud.\nSo effectively, cloud was going to drive the cloud security market and the network transformation and AI and machine learning would have to start helping us do this transformation in the SIEM and SOC market. Now what we saw over the last 3 to 5 years is, we at Palo Alto Networks as well as, to some degree, different plays in the industry, started to look at the various parts of these markets and say, like, these things need to start getting integrated because you can't deliver great security outcomes without these things getting integrated.\nSo this is the thing. We talked about this. We were told that market does not need platforms. We were told that integration is not key. Customers can deal with the integration. What we want is best-of-breed products. So we decided we're going to do both. We're going to have phenomenal success in best-of-breed categories.\nIn addition, we're going to make sure our best-of-breed products were integrated. So in these 3 TAMs, in these 3 markets of network, cloud and SOC operation, what happened is we saw these point products, we started to get integrated into the larger platform vision we had, and we saw the TAM continue to grow because these are all markets which are undergoing transformation or rapid growth.\nNow where we are today, we believe this is about a $100 billion opportunity across these 3 platforms. So for us, the opportunity has grown. It's almost gone up 2x from 5 years ago where we believe it's a $100 billion market today, which allows us to deliver the superior growth you've seen and the continued consolidation in the market that we've had at Palo Alto Networks. What's even more exciting within these markets will continue to drive future growth.\nAnd you will see that because of the arrival of AI, the need for more real-time autonomous security, these markets will continue to drive opportunity. In the same period over the last 5 years, as I said, we have been able to transform Palo Alto Networks to get it to where it is today. A, we actually proved that platforms are relevant and important in the space of cybersecurity.\nJust imagine, it seems obvious now, possibly to many of us, but 5 years ago, we had customers who had more cybersecurity vendors than they had IT vendors. And it was a customer's responsibility to take these vendors, deploy them across their infrastructure, make them work together to deliver security outcomes. You're expecting 2,000 customers out there in the Global 2000 or possibly tens of thousands of customers having security experts trying to stitch together products made by fast growth cybersecurity companies, which are deeply technical and trying to figure out how to correlate what one vendor saw or one set of vendors is telling you versus another.\nIt just seemed like a problem that could not be solved. But over the last 5 years, you've seen that starting to stitch these together, starting to take this disparate solutions for security, trying to provide them in a common fabric has actually allowed us to deliver better security outcomes. And we've proven that by doing that in a way, they are -- each of those pieces work in a best-of-breed fashion are leading in their own category.\nHowever, they're kind of better together in the platform. So the last 3 years -- the last 5 years, as we just shared in our Q4 results, we have been able to build a $1 billion business in security operations under Cortex, which was 0. We have been able to build a $1 billion SASE business in the last 12 months to be able to show that integration across this remote and hybrid network space is actually working.\nNot only that, we actually built a $500 million ARR cloud security business, proving that, again, the ability to stitch across the entire cloud development life cycle is useful for our customers. So we think that we've established that these platforms are going to be around are important and necessary, and that is the way of doing security in the future.\nNot only that, we've also proven that in the last 5 years that you can teach an old dog new tricks. Palo Alto Networks, which was a single product in one lane, we had the best firewall technology in the world as well as had amazing services that worked in the firewall, we have been able to take that and build multiple products across multiple security swim lanes and make them work better together.\nAnd the only way you can do that in security is you have to keep driving innovation. You have to stay at the bleeding edge because you don't need your customers to be at the bleeding edge. It is our responsibility as a security company to make sure we take all the innovation, we distill it, we make it work in an integrated fashion and deliver it to our customers at the fastest pace possible because the bad actors are not waiting, they're constantly looking for ways to get to our customers, to get to penetrate their infrastructure and try and figure out how to go extract data from our customers or possibly hold them with ransomware.\nSo we have taken what was an amazing company in one category and actually built what we'd like to say is an innovation engine that allows us to stay at the bleeding edge. We've also done that, to be honest, not just by doing it ourselves because the fact that the cybersecurity industry has 3,000 startups out there, which are constantly funded because they're all working in a specialist way to solve more problems, which they believe is important for the end customer, we have to be vigilant and make sure that we don't have any issues in either building it for our customers or partnering or acquiring something that's out there that is important as part of the security fabric that we need to deliver to our customers.\nSo as a team, we're really excited that where we are in our sort of juncture today allows us to go forward and build an even better, larger and a more compelling business for our shareholders. Not only that, to deliver phenomenal security outcomes for our customers across all these categories that we see inflecting as well as categories that we believe will be created in the next 3 to 5 years.\nSo with that in mind, if you think about what's our view going forward for the next 3 to 5 years or possibly the next decade, I said in the last 5 years, we saw that huge sort of technology trends, underlying it of cloud and AI allowed us to create the stitching to build what I would say, the building blocks of building the world's largest cybersecurity company actually prepares us phenomenally well for what we think lies ahead.\nWhat we think lies ahead is the need for security to stop bad actors mid-flight, real-time, as it's happening. If you think about security today, the industry is only 30% or 40% real time. You know a bad URL, you know a bad DNS. You know how to stop your customers from something that is bad that we know. What we still aren't good at as an industry is being able to figure out unknowns and stop them before they happen.\nTo do that, it requires a fundamentally different way of thinking about security. Something we have been sort of leading having a point of view on. And that is the idea of having stitched products that work from end-to-end. The idea that as something is happening, you're able to analyze it real time, on the fly and understand it's good or bad.\nIt is reducing the noise of security in the industry by eliminating all these super close alerts or the bad signal to noise ratio. So to get that right or to get security right, we will have to be more and more real time as an industry. Now we sit at a point where everybody is talking about AI. And actually, that is the solution.\nThe solution is to make sure you ingest large amounts of data, you analyze them on the fly, and you're able to deliver superior security. Something we talked about just in our Q4 earnings call, right before this, you saw that everything we're doing in XSIAM is driving us to that vision. But that's not enough.\nWe have to make sure every platform that we have continues to grow and continues to get more and more ubiquitous with our customers, at the same time, also stitches these things together. So we believe in the next 5 to 10 years, we're going to see this shift, which is going to be palpable. It is going to be big.\nIt's going to be understandable where we have to become more and more real time. It will no longer be about putting a bunch of sensors and thinking about hygiene and security policies. It will be about how do you stop a bad act. And we'll talk more about this because today, the mean time to fix a bad act as we've talked to you about in our earnings is 4 to 6 days.\nThat's not acceptable. This thing will have to go down to minutes and near real time. So that's a big shift we see that's going to drive a lot of the innovation in our industry. That's going to drive a lot of our strategy and our vision because we think we're on our way to be able to deliver that future to our customers as the world's largest cybersecurity company.\nIn that context, we talked about those 3 categories. We think those 3 categories are going to continue to become bigger. And if you look at it, the biggest opportunity is that big green circle of security operations and automation because we think the current paradigm is broken. The current paradigm is a reactive security paradigm. It's the paradigm we say, let's hire 3 more million people to solve security problems.\nNo, I don't think that's going to solve the problem. What's going to solve the problem is, let's collect good data, let's analyze good data. Let's find out the anomalous behavior. Let's block it while it's happening, so our customers have a better security outcome. I think that's where we're going to be going.\nAnd we're going to have a phenomenal opportunity at Palo Alto Networks to go ahead and address a $200 billion market, which is primarily going to be a software-based market, which has its own benefits across the board because it's a lower cost of ownership for our customers, lower cost of integration for our customers. It's easy for us to go deploy and keep our customers all at -- what is the best and current best in -- sort of best-in-class capability.\nSo a future that is driven by software capability, a future that's driven by software solutions with security and a future which has integration as part of so -- as part of it as a key tenet with the objective of delivering a real-time autonomous security outcome. So that's where we think the world is going, that's where we'd like to be, and we think we're best positioned in the industry to be able to deliver that future.\nNot only that, to deliver great security outcomes to our customers. So with that in mind, how are we going to do this? What are we doing in the next 3 years, how is that going to translate into numbers that are loved by our shareholders? So it's really the 5 things, part of it is something which we've been doing and some things we're going to have to keep pivoting harder.\nFor example, one, we want to maintain this notion of being an evergreen innovation company. Our biggest insight is that if you want to lead in cybersecurity, you always have to be on the bleeding edge because the bad actors are. You always have to be scanning the market understanding, where the world is going, where technology is going to see what potential security risks are going to get created in the adoption of that technology, in the deployment of that technology to make sure we're ahead of the curve, and we start delivering security by design.\nAs in we're not going to come in and try and bolt it on afterwards as our customers have been through the transformation, it's to work with them, embed our architectures with customers as they go through their innovation journey, we're in lockstep with them delivering security innovation.\nI think the second part, which we talked about is we want to make sure that our platforms, which are now deployed in sort of different stages or different amount of sort of capacity with our customers, they become ubiquitous. We want to make sure that our customers have wall-to-wall platforms that allow them to look at it as a data problem, as an AI problem, not have to stitch our platform with 5 other security solutions out there and trying to build their own outcomes because it's impossible for every customer to go to a secure integration by themselves.\nI think the way -- the best analogy I can come up with, I think in the next decade, we will see sort of a standard platform for security out there, just the way we've seen platforms in CRM or we've seen platforms in HR, as you've seen platforms and financial sort of software. We think it's time that in the next decade, we will see a security platform in our future, which just works for our customers, and the customers are not spending time integrating multiple vendors trying to stitch their own.\nI just think that's the only way we're going to get to the future that we need for real-time and AI-based security. Third, the topic du jour, everybody is talking about AI. We're talking about AI. We are not only talking about it, we will demonstrate that we can deliver security outcomes and the vision and the future that security needs using AI across Palo Alto Networks, and we'll talk more about that.\nWell, that's great. We can build amazing products, but also as a company, for our shareholders, we have to make sure that we can deliver all this innovation to our customers, both effectively; and two, we have to make sure that it's easy to consume and deploy for our customers. And we're going to have to make changes as we go forward on how we actually go deliver all the wonderful capability to all of our customers, not just by ourselves, but actually working together with some of the bleeding edge partners in the world who are in this journey.\nOur partners are delivering these great security outcomes for our customers. And last but not the least, and one of the key things is we cannot do this unless and until our employees are fully bought into our strategy, our vision, feel excited every day to come to work and deliver a better security outcome to our customers to make them secure and be their cybersecurity partner choice.\nSo with that, let's take a quick look into each of these categories to see how we're going to get there. And it sort of boils down to these 5 key strategic sort of requirements and directions from our perspective, innovation, continued platformization, leveraging AI, continue to transform our go-to-market capabilities. And last but not the least, again, is to make sure our team is along with us every step of the way.\nSo getting into the topic of innovation. I think I'm very proud of the track record we have so far. We've gone from 13 products/acquisitions that we've integrated in 2019, to delivering 74 in 2023. It sounds like a lot, but actually, these 74 are delivered in an integrated fashion. So it actually improves the efficiency of security for our customer. It actually makes usability better. It actually makes it much easier for us to deliver security outcomes.\nSo really excited about that. I think this whole AI revolution that we're undergoing or we're looking at, witnessing, it's going to require us to keep investing, looking once again as to what capability AI is going to deliver across all of our products because we do collect the world's most amount of security data.\nSo we will keep driving innovation by underpinning more and more machine learning and AI under our platforms. We'll keep looking at how to deliver more capability with the sensors that we have out there with our customers from an innovation perspective. We've talked about this. We are happy to make sure that we deliver innovation and security outcomes to our customers.\nIt does not all have to be invented in Palo Alto. We will constantly keep scanning the market to make sure that there's something out there that our customers need to get and somebody else is doing really well. It's our job to make sure we partner, collaborate, integrate or acquire to deliver the outcome that the customer needs from an innovation perspective. And last but not the least, being at the bleeding edge of security.\nBeing one of the largest players, it is our responsibility to make sure we're looking at all new technologies to see how they're going to impact our customers and their states, whether it's quantum, whether it's AI because there is a dark side to AI. It's our job working with our partners and the industry to make sure we deliver innovation in how to protect against AI getting abused or misused in the market.\nSo I strongly believe for us to deliver on the next 3- to 5-year vision of Palo Alto Networks, we are going to have to continue to be an evergreen innovation company, which I think will give this company longevity and sustainability forever in the future and being the leader in cybersecurity.\nWe talked about platformization or you've heard that word, you will keep hearing it to the next sort of 45 minutes from our team because we believe that's the way to deliver security, is resonating with our customers. Our customers are seeing it. My team is going to show you some amazing UI.\nI think you're going to start seeing not only just we're talking about this sort of the next level of platformization. You will start seeing, right after me, how we actually bring it to life. So I cannot be more excited about some of the work we're doing on the product side, stuff that we haven't shown anybody yet. You are going to see it today because it's important for us not just to talk about it, be able to show you how we're going to deliver.\nSo you will see a next level of integration and how we can deliver security outcomes. You'll see sneak peeks into how we're going to leverage AI copilots in each of our products to create the simplicity and usability that security has not had, to be honest, so far. So I couldn't be more excited about how our teams are going to keep driving more and more platformization, more and more integration, where things of integrating best-of-breed vendors as sort of DIY or do it yourself or do it home is going to be a thing of the past.\nSo moving on to leveraging AI, I talked about this. But again, clearly, there's no Analyst Day out there today that you cannot -- you must talk about AI. So I think the reason is different for us. As a security company, we are always focused on figuring out how to leverage data. We have north of 100 machine learning models that run today at Palo Alto Networks across our products. So this is not new news. But the way I think about it is, let's call all of that precision AI.\nThat's AI where I cannot afford for it to be wrong. If it's wrong, lives matter. If it's wrong, ransomware happens, if it's wrong, bad actors get in. So we have to be right 100% of the time. And to me, that's the definition of precision AI. And to deliver that future, we have to build a lot of our own models. We have to train them.\nWe have to collect first-party data. We have to understand the data. Today, we collect approximately 5 petabytes of data. Yes, 5 petabytes of data on behalf of our customers and analyze it for them to make sure we can separate signal from noise and take that signal and go create security outcomes for our customers. We still have 1.5 million net new attacks every day across our 60,000 customers.\nSo we know how to use AI, and we believe we are uniquely positioned in the industry given our presence in end points, our presence in firewalls, our presence in the cloud, our presence across the entire network security stack to be able to deliver those AI-based outcomes to our customers. And we're doubling down, we're quadrupling down to make sure that Precision AI is deployed across every product in Palo Alto, and we open up the floodgates of collecting good data with our customers for them to give them better security because we think that is the way we're going to solve this problem, to get to real-time security.\nBut let's not underestimate the opportunity generative AI puts in front of us. On a very personal basis, I believe generative AI is amazing for data summarization, for natural language interaction, for doing all the things where there was an information decay between our products and our customers.\nWe build great products. By the time they get to our customers, there's a lot of translation that happens between our product developers and the customer and sometimes the breaches happen because the customers don't fully understand our product because they cannot configure them right. All those things can be eliminated if we can implement generative AI effectively through our products.\nSo our customers can interact with our products in natural language. They don't have to have complex security understanding to operate our products. They don't have to have complex security understanding to fix a problem. We can fix all of that if we, in our company, learn how to deliver generative AI-based interfaces, generative AI-based outcomes through our products.\nAnd you know what, our teams are going to show you a glimpse of that. We have been working diligently over the last 5 months across the board at Palo Alto Networks. And I couldn't be more excited about some of the stuff that you're going to see just after this from our product teams to give you a sneak peek. At the same time, we're going to do it in a deliberate fashion. We're going to crawl, walk, run.\nWe think we are on the right path. We're going to work in lockstep with the industry. We have people analyzing and working with almost everybody out there. We understand where the best-in-class LLM activity is. We understand where technology is. We also understand what might be going in the next 3 to 6 months.\nSo all I can say is that I think the combination of precision AI and generative AI is going to fundamentally change the way security outcomes are delivered to our customers because it will take away the complexity. It will take away the confusion, the sort of usability problems that you have with security, and it will start helping deliver great outcomes to our customers. I think it's just going to make our platforms amazing as we go forward.\nOn the go-to-market side. In the last 5 years, we have done a phenomenal job, I think, of building the products that our customers need. Yet, we have to make sure that every customer understands our capability. Every customer has a road map with us where we can take them to deliver real-time security outcomes.\nFor that, we need to skill -- upskill our team in some areas, which we have been doing very effectively. As you saw, our team was able to deliver some amazing results for Q4, and I think we're going to keep doing that. We are going to go from being just a security vendor to being a solution partner. For that, we have to work harder with many players out there, which is something we've geared up to do, and we're having some amazing early success.\nWe've got to figure out how to institutionalize that capability at Palo Alto Networks. And that's one thing BJ and his team are going to focus very effectively on in the next 3 to 5 years. Not just that, as I said, we need to figure out how to deliver architectural outcomes to our customers. Our customers are tired of spending too much money in cybersecurity and ending up with the same mess and saying, wait, my security outcomes aren't getting much better, but I seem to be spending more money.\nIt's important for us to work with every one of them to deliver those capabilities in a architectural way so they understand the long-term road map because I think it's fair to say that where we are today is not where we were 5 years ago. I think we have enough confidence in our customers to partner with us for the long term because they believe we're going to be around or we're going to be an evergreen cybersecurity company.\nAnd last but not the least, I think it's very important as part of our go-to-market efforts, we have a large team that delivers customer delight. Well, I just think we're about to see a step change in customer delight with the application of generative AI. Again, we've been working really hard. You'll see a bit of a glimpse of that in some of the things that teams are going to show you.\nAnd over the next possibly 3, 6, 9 months, you will see more and more capability delivered to our customers using that generative AI framework or predictive AI or precision AI framework. I think in the next 3 to 5 years, that is going to fundamentally change what Palo Alto is able to do out there in the market. And as I said, we cannot do this without the best people.\nOur employer brand has become phenomenal in the last 5 years. As we continue to deliver great innovation, great outcomes, people want to come work at Palo Alto Networks. People want to be part of the success of being the cybersecurity partner of choice for our customers. So we can only do this, we can only deliver our strategy if we have the best team.\nWe continue to track the best, we continue to empower them. We continue to make sure that they can deliver great outcomes for our customers. We plan to keep doing that over the next 3 to 5 years because we believe this is a mission-driven opportunity. It's an opportunity that allows us to make the world a better place by making sure that our customers can be secure.\nSo as I said, you will notice in the next 3 to 5 years, we will continue to transform Palo Alto Networks from where we are to where we would like to be. We will continue to focus on the demand function at the top. We believe the market is continuing to inflect, as I said, in the area of security operations. It's highly likely that some of the other steady areas are going to see some inflection as well. We're going to continue to relentlessly innovate and keep making our platforms more ubiquitous.\nWe're going to make sure that we can deliver the amplification from our go-to-market teams. And also, we're going to make sure that we have the best team in the industry to deliver solutions to our customers. I couldn't be more excited about the prospects of Palo Alto Network. I couldn't be more excited that we are seeing tremendous success in our software-driven capabilities.\nI think we are going to continue to be able to transform this company from where we started as a hardware vendor to a software-delivered security with real-time security outcomes. I believe we will continue to be the best cybersecurity partner of choice for our customers. With that, I'm going to hand over to Lee because he's going to show you some really cool stuff, which is hopefully going to excite you about our ability to deliver the future we've talked about.\n\nLee Klarich\n\nThank you, Nikesh. Now in a second, we're going to go into more detail on our 3 leading platforms. But first, I want to share some context. After all, we're a cybersecurity company, what's happening in the threat landscape. And I'll just give you the really obvious answer, it's bad. The threat landscape is intensifying. $8 trillion of cost due to cyber crime.\nAttackers are becoming very sophisticated with the tools they use, whether that's automation, attacking the supply chain, et cetera. And just the sheer volume is off the charts, growing about 20x since 2011 to over 1 billion new malicious programs. This is incredible. So clearly, that is a challenge, but it's even more challenging than that.\nIt wasn't that long ago when it took an attacker on average about 44 days from initial compromise to exfiltration. Now 44 days is basically the time period that an organization would have to detect, disrupt and potentially prevent the breach from happening. So in 44 days goes down to hours, which is what we're now starting to see. That is a huge problem.\nThat requires a very different approach. But on average, the industry is able to respond and remediate attacks in about 6 days. That doesn't work. And even more challenging now with the SEC new rules of being able to disclose within 4 days, none of the math adds up. Now before we get comfortable in just solving these problems, there's one more challenge coming.\nAttackers have recognized the power of AI, just as much as everyone else has recognized the power of AI to do good things. Whether it's fraud GPT or worm GPT or other use of AI, it is clear this is going to become the next major tool used by attackers to launch more attacks, more sophisticated attacks and faster attacks.\nSo we have to innovate. And we recognize that, Palo Alto Networks was built for innovation from day 1. And today, we have over 4,400 product, engineering and other experts that are building and driving innovation. And you see just how fast we've ramped that over the last several years in part, by being able to scale our organization across 3 main R&D centers in the world.\nIn addition to this organic innovation engine we've built, we look at about 250 private companies every year to identify the absolute best teams, the absolute best technology that could become part of Palo Alto Networks in order to further drive our innovation engine. And we combine these 2 together, and we will continue to combine them together to have the best innovation capability.\nAnd then we combine that with AI. We recognized early how important AI would be to our innovation. And over the last several years, we have been infusing AI into our products in very unique ways to solve very challenging problems that only AI can. And from this foundation, we're only going to do more and better.\nWe are going to accelerate our pace of innovation even further. We are going to leverage our proven playbook around M&A to be able to augment what we do organically. And we are going to take our capabilities in AI and turn that into an AI-first company. And why I'm so confident in our ability to leverage AI is we've built the right data foundation, we've combined that with the right architecture, and we've leveraged an amazing set of expertise across all of that.\nWe collect more data per customer than anyone else, security data, relevant data for AI. We combine that with an architecture that over the last several years, we've been migrating every product into a cloud-based architecture because we know that, that sets us up to use AI in everything we do.\nAnd today, I have a team of over 150 AI experts that I can leverage across all 3 of our platforms to identify and drive even more AI capabilities and innovation. That's how we do innovation. How the industry does innovation is very different. The industry tends to look at this in the context of point products. Every time there's a new need, there is a new point product.\nThis leads to incredible complexity for end customers. Think about having to stitch all of this together. Now it does create a large security market of about $210 billion, but it means that there is an incredible opportunity for disruption. And for a disruptive and innovative approach, which is why we've taken our platform-oriented approach because we recognize that the only way to achieve the real-time security outcomes that our customers need is by integrating natively all of those capabilities into a set of very focused platforms, around Zero Trust, code to cloud and security operations.\nIn a moment, we'll go into detail on that. But last and certainly not least point, not all platforms are created equally. I shared with you how we think about innovation because that is so fundamental to the outcomes of our platforms. In addition to that, our platforms are designed to be as comprehensive as possible. It doesn't mean we do everything, but it means that we do all of the core set of capabilities necessary such that we can then selectively integrate and enable third-party technology to complement the platforms.\nEverything we do is integrated. It's designed to solve hard problems through integration that cannot otherwise be solved with point products. And that combination enables our platforms to be real time and enable real-time security outcomes for our customers.\nSo with that, let's start our first deep dive with our Zero Trust platform. It's very clear in the network security market what's happening. The point product approach that we've been fighting for so long as a company is getting harder and harder to sustain. There's more technologies, more capabilities needed. Those capabilities are needed across a broader attack surface with the advent of hybrid cloud and hybrid work.\nThe only way to solve this is with a platform. we're going to share that in a second. In addition, the next set of trends is going to further propel the need for platformization as passwordless becomes common, as quantum becomes common, as BYOD becomes enabled across enterprises.\nAll of these, there's going to be a decision. Do you want to try to enable them across 25 and 30 different stand-alone point products? Or do you want to enable them in a single platform? The answer is obvious and clear. And that is why we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity in front of us across all of network security with our Zero Trust platform. And to go into more detail is Anand Oswal, leader of our network security Zero Trust platform team. Anand?\n\nAnand Oswal\n\nThank you, Lee. Before I talk about network security, let me first talk about the evolution of network security. Today, network security has become increasingly complex. In the past, when users were predominantly in the office and applications in the data center, network security was delivered by a centralized firewall.\nData center virtualization and migration to the cloud required inspection of traffic moving to the cloud. And many organizations had software firewalls. And with the hybrid workforce and protecting remote branches, many enterprises deployed a cloud-delivered stack, SASE. As you can see, many organizations today have 3 distinct and disparate stacks.\nThis leads to complexity of architecture, poor operational experience, inconsistent security and poor user experience. What if you could take a radically different and new approach, ensuring that any user across any location, accessing any application and data is secured by unified security stack, which means we have one platform with a set of security services that ensure that users across all locations have consistent user experience.\nAnd administrators can now author policies in a centralized manner. This is enterprise-wide Zero Trust. Over the last 5 years, we've developed a Zero Trust platform with best-in-class products, and it has 3 key components: first, network secure enforcing points, hardware firewalls, software firewalls and cloud-delivered SASE; second, cloud-delivered security services that run consistently across all form factors of network security and management that provides configuration, writing of policies, monitoring and analytics.\nAnd each of these 3 components ensure that we can provide our customers near real-time security, better operational outcomes and a simplified and consistent user experience. Let's now talk about the components of the platform. First, the network security enforcement points. The foundations, hardware firewalls, software firewalls and SASE. We're the leader in next-generation firewall now for over a decade, a Gartner Magic Quadrant leader 11 times.\nAnd we're the only vendor that's a leader in both SSE and SD-WAN that make up the SASE market. We're also a leader in Zero Trust. Next, let's talk about cloud-delivered security services. Over the years, as Lee mentioned, the attackers have become more and more sophisticated. The old approach of signature and databases is not working. We've been working on using AI and the power of machine learning to ensure that we can provide our customers with protection against attacks that they have never seen before and ensuring that we can provide near real-time security.\nWe also expanded from 3 services 5 years ago to 7, ensuring our customers can consolidate point products onto the platform. In addition, we've developed new services like ADEM and AIOps. ADEM, our autonomous digital experience management, provides customers segment by segment visibility from user to application, helping them understand exactly what's going on at every segment along the way.\nAnd with AI operations, we can automate many of the complex tasks for customers, ensure that they're using security with best practices, configuration with best practices and ensuring that we are able to predict things that may not -- they have seen before. Now as you can see, we've had some great success with different capabilities of our platform.\nHowever, if you think about the market, hardware firewalls to secure data centers and campuses, software firewalls to secure cloud networks and SASE to secure hybrid works and remote branches. These, for the most part, have acted as 3 distinct markets. And customers for the most part have made independent decisions.\nI believe we're now at an inflection point. With unified management across the entire network security estate, we will change the way how customers buy, how customers deploy and how customers operate network security. Let me now show you a glimpse of our unified management, which I'm very excited about.\nAs you can see, we have unprecedented visibility here. Users can be anywhere, in campuses, in branches, remote workers, on the go. And applications that are sitting everywhere, data centers, public cloud SaaS. And traffic flowing through all the enforcement points, hardware firewalls, software firewalls and SASE. And we have a complete comprehensive view of all the threats in the entire network security estate, the data risks, the posture and the experience.\nNow the threat landscape is constantly changing. And we always have new vulnerabilities that show up and are published often. And many times, network administrators want to know exactly if what happens for a particular vulnerability, is the enterprise affected by it or not? Now with this unified management, we can easily search for a given vulnerability.\nAnd once we understand, like in this case, that we have compromised by this vulnerability, with a single click, we can get remediations of best actives and make sure that we can apply these best practices across the entire network security estate, which means our hardware firewalls, our software firewalls and Prisma SASE. That's the power of having complete end-to-end visibility of the entire estate.\nNow let me talk to you about our network security copilot. With the power of generative AI, we're ensuring that customers can use our platform to the best of its capabilities, optimizing security, optimizing configuration and optimizing their operations. This is what you'll see when you come to the co-pilot.\nAs you can see, they tell you all the activity that happened in the last 24 hours. And now as you can see, we have 140,000 users that have a good experience, but over 10,000 users have a degraded experience. Now rather than point and click to understand what's going on, we can engage with the copilot with natural language and ask the co-pilot exactly what's happening for those 10,000 users.\nAnd behind the scenes, the power of AI and ML and getting data for all sources, endpoint, cloud identity engine, applications, network enforcement points, we can tell the customer that the users are having degraded experience accessing a geo application. Not only that, we can also give root cause, which is because they're authorization failures, open an ITSM ticket on their behalf with all the relevant information.\nLet's take an example next about a network administrator wanting to know exactly what are the risky applications being accessed in the organization. Again, you're going through all the enforcement points, hardware firewalls, software firewalls and SASE. We can give a summarized view of all the 6 risky applications in this case.\nNow once you know risky applications, the next step would be, what is the policy I need to apply to block access to risky application. And using best practices we're able to give them the right policy configuration, ask the customer to review the policy changes or apply them. And once they apply them, it's applied across all the enforcement points, making sure the customer is now protected.\nAs you can see, with the power of the unified management, with the power of the copilot, we're changing the way network security is deployed, operated on a managed -- on an ongoing basis. Super excited. To wrap things up, we have over 1,700 customers today using our platform. And over the next few years, we expect many more customers to use the platform to get the power of Zero Trust, to get the power of ensuring that they have consistency across the entire security estate to get unprecedented visibility.\nAt the same time, we've seen customers use and adopt more of our security services. In the last 2 years, that number has increased, and we continue to see a trend, customers consolidating their point products onto the platform to make sure that they get the network effective data and simplify their operations.\nIn summary, Zero Trust can only be delivered through a platform-centric approach. It's very hard to do it with point products and disparate solutions. Customers will continue to integrate more and more of the services onto the platform, and we'll continue to give a delightful experience to our customers the power of AI. With that, back over to you, Lee.\n\nLee Klarich\n\nThank you, Anand. so clearly, huge opportunity in network security Zero Trust platform. Now turning your attention to the cloud. Cloud had just absolutely gone through an incredible transformation. Today, there's over 500 million cloud native applications deployed. There's 33 million developers that are constantly pushing new capabilities and new applications.\nNearly all enterprises are multi-cloud. That is just an amazing starting point when you think about what is going on. And at the same time, there is a tremendous amount of innovation happening because of the cloud. And a lot of it is being driven through the ability to leverage open source that's being combined with custom code, that's being combined with infrastructures code.\nAll of that just enables the speed, this dynamic nature of the cloud, and it all needs to be secured. And very much like the rest of enterprise cybersecurity, the industry approach has been a whole bunch of point products that customers are somehow expected to stitch together.\nWe have a different approach. We believe that all of these capabilities should be modules natively integrated and delivered in the platform. And when we get this right, we cannot only secure in real time, but we can then fix at source so the issue doesn't happen again. And to go into more details on how we're able to achieve that is Ankur Shah, leader of our Prisma Cloud code-to-cloud platform. Ankur?\n\nAnkur Shah",
    "content3": "Thanks, Lee. Like Lee mentioned, we live in an app economy. The average enterprise today uses over 100 applications, some for commercial and some for internal use. With AI-led code development, I expect this trend to continue. Before we talk about securing the apps, first, let's talk about how these applications are assembled. In the code phase, some custom code, a whole bunch of open source code gets deployed using infrastructure as code.\nAnd ultimately, it moves through the pipeline, goes into the run time and construct what we call the application. The key thing to note here is that everything that happens in code phase gets multiplied in cloud, a single infrastructure as code or open source component can get deployed across hundreds of thousands of workloads and application component.\nWhat is true for infrastructure and the application layer is also true for the security risk. A risk, like an open source vulnerability, secret, pipeline risk introduced in the code phase, gets multiplied in the run time where now you have hundreds of thousands of containers and application components running that risk.\nThe attackers has more ways than ever before to exploit this risk and cause a data breach. Now there are 2 approaches to solving this problem. One approach is what the industry has always done, which is to have a point product per problem. In the code phase, there are about half a dozen different tools to scan security posture.\nIn the infrastructure layer, you have yet another set of tools. And finally, in the run time, you have tools for cloud worker protection, network security and application security. Now this is not the right approach to solving this problem for 2 reasons: number one, each of those tools lack the context. So the customers have to stitch all of that together.\nAnd the second thing is, like Lee described, there are 33 million developers and a really few security professionals who understand code and cloud. This is a battle that the security team simply can't win with this specific approach. We believe there is a better approach. And that's the approach that we have been steadfast in executing over the last 4 years, and that is an integrated code-to-cloud platform approach that can help customers prevent risks and breaches in near real time.\nPrisma Cloud does that today by scanning security vulnerabilities at each phase of the application life cycle and also have runtime protection to prevent breaches in runtime. Our strategy is resonating well with the customers and analyst community across different component parts as well as the entirety of the platform.\nTypical customers start their journey in the infrastructure layer, where we have now [ 68 ]% of the customers where we're securing over 4 billion cloud assets. Then they shift left, where they want to prevent the risk from happening to begin with, where we have today 20% of our customers, and we are today scanning millions of code assets.\nAnd finally, customers want defense in depth and they want active prevention and protection technology in the cloud runtime should a bad actor cause a data breach, where today, we have 54% of the customers where we're scanning 13 million-plus containers. Let's see the entirety of the Prisma Cloud platform with a quick demo.\nWhat you see here is a code to cloud dashboard that gives the security practitioners visibility across the entire application pipeline. What you see here is as the code assets and the cloud assets are growing, so are the security risk. For example, in the code phase, you're seeing a whole bunch of security risk that Prisma Cloud has already scanned. The typical enterprise uses multiple tools just to do the security of the code.\nAnd on the cloud phase, you're seeing a whole bunch of security scans that Prisma Cloud has done should things fall through the crack and go into production. The key thing to remember here is that risk introduced in the code phase gets multiplied in the cloud, 20 risk in the code got to be 2,000 in cloud.\nNow typically, the security practitioner, it takes months and months to resolve these 2,000 issues because they don't have the context, don't have the traceability to fix the root cause of the problem. Let me show you how Prisma Cloud does that. So I clicked on the 2,000 security risk. What you see here is a code-to-cloud security graph, where we're tracing the 2,000 security risk back to the 2 problems in the code phase.\nMore specifically, these are the 2 Log4j components that the developers introduced that has the security risk that led to those 2,000 problems. You can see that those 2,000 risks belong to a single application. And like I described, a customer is using multiple applications. So now the customer has tens of thousands of different risks. With a single click of a button, Prisma Cloud is able to fix the root cause of the issue as you will see that momentarily.\nWe're able to upgrade the latest version of the Log4j, invoke the pipeline, reduce the risk at each stage of the application life cycle. And now you see that the 2,000 risks are reduced to 0 with a single click option. So that was the first demo. The key thing to remember here is anytime there is a risk in the cloud, you have to trace it back to the cloud, and we're the only platform that can do that today.\nThe second demo I want to show, and that's something we've been working on, which was with the AI co-pilot. So let me show you how our AI copilot experience is going to look like is going to show you all the things that it has done for you since you last logged in. The user, this time, I was going to ask the question around how many Log4 shell vulnerabilities do I have in my environment?\nThrough a simple natural language processing, it was able to understand the question, was able to render a similar graph. As you can see, there are 1,000 cloud risks per Log4 shell, trace it back to the one source problem. The user is able to interact with the copilot, get a little bit more definition of these problems. And finally, just like you saw in the first demo, ask the copilot to go ahead and fix all this problem with a single click.\nThe key thing I want you to remember about the security copilot is that it's a resource multiplier for you. There are not enough security professionals and the copilot is going to help you burn down the risk and prevent breaches in cloud. As I wrap this, let me tell you the opportunity ahead of us.\nThe average customer today doubles their credit consumption within a year and quadruples in 2 years by growing from 2 to 5 to 8 modules. We have a natural land-and-expand motion with our existing customers. When you add that with the new customers that we're going to be adding and enough headroom that we have with the installed base, the opportunity in front of us is massive. The last thing I'll leave you with is the market in front of us is huge. Prisma Cloud is the clear leader in this space, and we have the right strategy and the vision to win this market. Thank you all.\n\nLee Klarich\n\nAll right. Thank you, Ankur. Again, clearly, huge opportunity in cloud security with our unique approach in what we're driving, really excited with where we are and what we're working on. And now for our third platform, our AI-driven SecOps platform. This is a market that I believe is ready for a fundamental transformation.\nMost of the technologies that companies use are -- or were developed 15, in some cases, 20 years ago. That clearly does not work. They were not designed for an attacker sophistication that we see today. They were not designed for real-time detection and automation remediation. These tools were not designed for supply chain attacks.\nThese tools were not designed for the advent of attack AI being used by our adversaries. We have to reimagine security operations from the ground up. And in doing this, leveraging data, leveraging AI, leveraging automation as core tightly integrated foundational aspects to how an entire SecOps platform functions within the SOC.\nAnd this is the journey that we've been on for the last several years. building this platform, refining it, developing the capabilities necessary and then refining it again until we reach the point where we are today where we have a set of leading products and an incredible platform, delivering incredible outcomes to take advantage of this entire security operations market in front of us. And to share more details I'm joined from our Tel Aviv R&D center by Gonen Fink, who leads our entire Cortex product organization. Gonen?\n\nGonen Fink\n\nThank you, Lee. Let's take a deeper look at why existing SOC architecture doesn't work. With the growth of sophisticated alerts, multiple tools were created, each one designed to solve a specific problem. This leads to an extremely fragmented SOC, very hard to manage. It is the customer responsibility to integrate those tools into a human-driven workflow.\nThe result of that is bad security outcome, low-confidence alert, energy shortage, unable to resolve those incidents in real time. So what is required to deliver real-time security operation? We need to replace this fragmented architecture with a unified single floor architecture.\nWe need to replace multiple products that collect data with a single data platform and silo detection tools with an AI engine that is trained on a full data center. And then automation should be natively integrated into the flow rather than being placed as an afterthought. Five years ago, we recognized the criticality of data, AI and automation for the future of cybersecurity.\nWe built 3 amazing products. Each of them became a leader in its respective category, and we continue to innovate in each of those categories to maintain our leadership. This drove Cortex to become a $1 billion business for us, and it also brought us into thousands of customers' security operation centers.\nCortex XDR extended the EDR market, and it is the best AI tool for endpoint prevention and real-time detection of all security threats. Cortex XSOAR is the best-in-class security tool for automated threat response and Cortex Expanse proactively manage your attack surface and reduce threat. But to harness the full potential of AI and automation in order to build a real-time SOC requires more than that.\nWe need an integrated AI-driven architecture that reimagine the legacy 20 years old SOC architecture from the ground up. And this is what we brought to the market with XSIAM last year. So what happens is legacy SOC and how it has changed with XSIAM. Let's look at that. In order to detect attacks, silent tools just get alerts. But we are living in a dynamic world. Unfortunately, looking at anomalies or alert in isolation might be suspicious, but there are many of them.\nEach of them look at the world from a very narrow standpoint. And the result is that high volume of alerts that overwhelm the SOC. This means that SOC gives up on reviewing all of those alerts. And eventually, the SOC is missing the important ones. With XSIAM, customer no longer needs to reveal low confidence in that and try to connect the dots themselves.\nXSIAM collect a large amount of data and uses AI to analyze low confidence signals, stitch them together with raw data and get enough context to resolve most of them automatically, presenting the user only with all of an incident and with a full context for each of those incidents.\nBy grouping this into incidents, prioritize them, restoring them, XSIAM provides a full picture view to the analysts, and allow the analysts to respond very quickly to the events. How do we do this management? Let me use our new product UI to explain the key elements that differentiate XSIAM on the rest of the products in the market. It starts with the data. We just normalized, stitch together petabytes of data from dozens and hundreds of data sources to recreate the full story of each and every event in your environment.\nThis stitched rich data set and sophisticated AI engine with over 3,000 models that produce high confidence alerts, that groups those alerts into incidents, assigns a risk score to each incident and then integrate natively built automation to resolve most of the incidents, leaving only a small number of incidents for human review and resolution.\nLike the copilots, you saw for both network security and cloud security, our new Cortex UI, we incorporate a copilot with an early alpha testing starting next month. We started working with Palo Alto Network SOC as our first partner as we design and build Cortex and XSIAM. Palo Alto is the largest security vendor. And as such, we have a lot of assets that we need to protect.\nAnd in order to do a proper job, we collect a lot of data. Over 1 trillion events are collected every month or 75 terabytes every day. With Cortex, Palo Alto Network's SOC can protect its network with a small team working on startup ships, resulting with less than 1 minute incident resolution. This is not heroic. This is relying on technology and AI and automation to achieve the right security outcomes.\nSo when we launched XSIAM, we wanted to see how this plays with customers. And the early indications are remarkable. Our customers are able to ingest a lot more data than before, which provides them with broader coverage for their attack service. Even though they ingest a lot more data, product generates a lot less false positive. And those true positive alerts are being grouped together, prioritized by AI, delivering much, much superior security outcomes, their coverage shifting the median time to response from day to hours.\nAs we look forward and we see tremendous opportunity in growing Cortex and XSIAM. We continue to win and gain market shares with our best-of-breed products, XDR, XSOAR, and XPANSE, as there a basis to upsell our customers to the full XSIAM solution. Each of those customers is a candidate is becoming prospect to move to the full platform, XSIAM. And we demonstrate this over the past 12 months in being able to convert a lot of the customers that use part of the platform to become a full platform user.\nBut the most exciting part is when we look at where we can expand XSIAM. We believe the era of AI and automation is just beginning. And XSIAM is quickly becoming the largest security data platforms. And the technology we built with AI information could be the basis to expand what we can deliver with XSIAM to new modules within the SOC and across the entire security landscape.\nThank you all, and back to you, Lee.\n\nLee Klarich\n\nAwesome. Thank you, Gonen. Clearly, an incredible opportunity in Cortex and specifically with XSIAM as we think about the journey ahead where we are going to transform security operations in just absolutely incredible amazing ways. And with that context across our 3 platforms, let me now turn it over to BJ to share with you how we take all of this wonderful stuff to market. BJ?\n\nWilliam Jenkins\n\nThanks, Lee. And it's great to be here with all of you. I couldn't be more excited to talk about our go-to-market transformation that will allow us to take full advantage of the product innovation you heard about. I just had my 2-year anniversary at Palo Alto Networks, and the evolution of this go-to-market organization in step with our customer needs and product innovation has been incredible. To understand how we can best serve our customers, we need to understand how organizations are tackling cybersecurity challenges today. On average, large companies have 75-plus security solutions. This leads to fragmentation and growing complexity as customers try to stitch together all these individual products and data. To add to this, they are dealing with overlapping vendor solutions that don't talk to each other. Many customers are buying cybersecurity in this way. They recognize how unwieldly and ineffective it is, and they need our help. This is a call to action for our industry to do a better job at helping our customers. And at Palo Alto Networks, we will do this through 3 key go-to-market transformations.\nFirst, we are transitioning from a transactional vendor to a true strategic partner, guiding customers on their transformation journey. Customers are looking to us for direction on how to secure their enterprises and keep their employees and end user customers safe. Second, we are transforming from selling point products to architecting outcomes in partnership with our customers' most trusted ecosystem solution providers. Our customers' ecosystem partners will become even more important as we work with them to create more value through new services and joint offerings. Third, we are moving from a reactive help model where customers only call us when they need us to a more collaborative model, where we are proactively driving success for every customer with an in-it-together mentality. Palo Alto Networks is well positioned to help our customers through these 3 key shifts, and we have made significant headway on each of these fronts.\nIn the past, our go-to-market motion focused on technical domain experts solving very specific product requirements. These conversations often revolved around price, and they were transactional in nature. Today, C-suite executives are engaging us more and more. They are looking to transform their entire business, understand security strategy and deliver better security outcomes. We now have a seat at the table for key architectural decisions and ongoing multiyear road map engagement. Our 3,000 integrated sellers are set up to scale and have these strategic conversations with our customers.\nOur ecosystem is also playing a critical role as we move from selling products to architecting outcomes. 5 years ago, we sold a single product, primarily hardware firewalls as part of a larger partner-delivered motion. Most of our partners were focused on transactional fulfillment of customer orders. Today, we are deeply embedded with strategic partners across all routes to market and are co-leading the sales motions with our partners to deliver joint solutions. We have 150 $10 million plus strategic partners today in our ecosystem. In the future, we're going to continue to strengthen our sell together motion by building integrated offerings with a shared focus on improving client outcomes. Our top 30 partners will become even more important, and we're looking to drive $10 billion plus of business with them.\nDelivering the best security outcomes means that our customers post sales' experience must also undergo a shift. As I said, to an in-it-together model, allowing them to be successful faster and get the most value from our solutions. Although we have consistently achieved a 90-plus percent CSAT score, we aren't stopping there. Continuous improvement is the goal. As part of our strategic focus on AI, we will leverage AI to resolve customer issues more quickly with AI-enabled in-product support, we plan to reduce our mean time to resolve for calls by over 65%. We also plan to scale our global network of 300-plus fully certified professional service partners in order to further expand our ability to deploy our products with speed and agility. And last but not least, we will increase adoption by staying with our customers throughout their entire journey. We have a 600-plus person customer success team with deep expertise, helping to build customers for life.\nYou've heard this from others today, but it bears repeating. We see massive opportunity add for Palo Alto Networks, and our go-to-market model is transforming to meet that head on. As you can see in the chart, we're already well on our way with our Global 2000 customers with 54% of our customers on the journey across all 3 platforms. And we have great potential to extend our breadth by selling the full portfolio across our installed base and our platform depth by covering our customers' full estate.\nI'll end where I started with a reflection on the opportunity and unprecedented ability to help our customers secure and transform their business. Palo Alto Network platforms are the best in the industry, and we have a world-class go-to-market organization, uniquely positioned to bring them to our customers and partners. Our go-to-market model is ready to scale and deliver real-time security outcomes for every customer through the power of our platforms.\nThank you, everyone, and back over to you, Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nCFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nAs you heard from Nikesh about our strategy, Lee and his team on products and BJ around go-to-market, we have the entire company pointed in the same direction. I now wanted to bring this all together to help you understand why we are confident that we can capitalize on our opportunity and translate it into financial results that will drive superior total shareholder return. I will go through all 4 of the primary drivers of TSR, including revenue growth, profitability, cash conversion and capital structure.\nFirst, on the top line. You heard about our TAM from Nikesh. We have proven over the last 5 years that we target the largest and most attractive parts of the market. We've been able to capitalize on an expanding opportunity, taking share from within existing markets and positioning ourselves in new markets to drive further growth potential. Our share today stands at just 7% of our addressable market, which is lower than the share of leaders in many other markets outside of the cybersecurity industry. As we plot the course to the larger town that Nikesh outlined over the next 5 years, we continue to see the opportunity to gain share in our existing markets and continue to fuel above-market growth for Palo Alto Networks.\nLooking at this through the product lens, Lee and his team outlined our platform leadership in our 3 areas and showed you the innovation plans their teams have to continue to lead our markets. From my seat at the company, innovation is our lifeblood, and we will continue to spend aggressively on R&D. We do not focus on driving leverage to the bottom line, but rather we redeploy any savings we identify to invest in additional innovation. Our customers expect us to continue innovating, and we have consistently shown a strong return from these innovation investments. This includes recognition of our innovations such as the Gartner single vendor SASE leadership position that we mentioned today. We expect our innovation to show through in financial outcomes in each platform and the company overall.\nIn network security, our investments across form factors, especially software-based and cloud delivered, enable us to further our market position and sustain our growth in FWaaP billings. Our market share in our software base of the M business is approximately 2x what it is in hardware. In SASE, we believe that we are the #2 player in this fast-growing market.\nIn cloud security, the growth algorithm is leveraging product and go-to-market capabilities to drive credit consumption ahead of the growth rate customers are deploying public cloud. Along the way, we are confident we can increase multi-module consumption to solidify our position as the definitive code to cloud leader.\nIn Cortex, we have a solid business with XDR, XSOAR and XPANSE, competing in attractive individual product markets. We've seen a shrinking number of players in the XDR market and have steadily added several hundred customers per quarter. Adding customers across Cortex is important to allow us to drive larger, more strategic deals in the future where we can further cross-sell our products, including XSIAM. XSIAM is truly game-changing innovation where we are selling outcomes, and I'm confident the momentum will beget momentum here after a very strong launch of the product in the first year.\nIt should be clear from BJ's presentation that we've invested in building a large dedicated go-to-market organization and are transforming how we engage with the market. Transformation here has been a nonstop effort and has driven growth in our -- in the number of large deals each quarter. On the back of the core tenets BJ covered, we see the opportunity to continue to drive more strategic relationships with customers that can result in 8- and even 9-figure relationships. At the same time that we have seen these large deal outcomes, we've consistently improved the productivity of our core apps as they collectively become better at selling the broader portfolio.\nAs Nikesh mentioned, SASE has been a big success here. Additionally, we have seen standout growth from new ecosystem partners, including the cloud service providers and global system integrators. Not only has our business transacted through these channels increased, but more importantly, so has our success leveraging these partners as influencers. We have the product portfolio that makes us an attractive partner to these players, along with the scale to make the investments to support the success of these partners.\nBringing this together on the top line. As Nikesh noted, we're targeting growth of 17% to 19% in revenue and billings over the next 3 years, which is ahead of the cybersecurity market growth rate. We see hardware as a percentage of our total revenue decreasing to approximately 10%, with NGS ARR exiting fiscal year '26, above 55% of our fiscal year '26 revenue. RPO remains an important metric as it captures the full value of our customer contracts independent of payment terms, and we expect growth of 25% annually through fiscal year '26. Additionally, we see about 2/3 of our revenue in fiscal year '26 driven by current RPO entering the year, highlighting the increase in predictability of our revenue profile.\nNow moving to the cost side and first with gross margin. As I hope Lee and BJ have impressed upon you, we have significant advantages inherent in building and delivering platforms. There are characteristics of our platform business model that benefit gross margins. A higher software mix in our network security business helps contribute to a higher gross margin, something we saw in fiscal year '23. On the cloud-delivered side, most notably in SASE and Cortex, we've aligned with public service providers to enable us to instantly leverage their scale and delivery capability as well as take advantage of their ongoing innovations and efficiencies. As we grow, we see improvement in our unit economics. Lastly, in customer support with multiple scale products in each of our platforms and common customer support needs, we see leverage within our platforms and across the company.\nAbove and beyond these platform benefits, as we talked about earlier in fiscal year '23, we accelerated some efficiency initiatives that contributed to higher gross margins. We also saw a normalization of the supply chain during fiscal year '23. Starting in '23, we have increased our investments around generative AI to leverage this technology in customer support for efficiency and better medium-term customer outcomes. While we see these platform leverage and efficiency opportunities and gross margins, we also leave room to invest in new cloud-based offerings, which generally have subscale gross margins in their initial phases. For this reason, we expect a relatively steady gross margin in fiscal year '26 as compared to fiscal year '23.\nMoving on to operating expenses. We see similar benefits from being a platform company across our major functional areas. At the top of this list is the sales productivity improvements already discussed. It's important to reinforce my point around the platform benefits in R&D. We choose to redeploy those resources to ensure we are leaning into innovation instead of driving overall financial leverage in R&D. Our fiscal year '23 focus on accelerated efficiency did yield benefits in terms of leverage and OpEx, and we expect to continue many of these initiatives. One to highlight is the consolidation of sales specialists, similar to customer support, we also have generative AI initiatives to both improve outcomes across sales and marketing and our G&A functions that we expect will contribute to efficiency in fiscal year '24 and beyond.\nTranslating this to operating margins. While some may see a 500 basis point improvement in 1 year as a milestone achievement from our 2021 Analyst Day, we simply see that -- see this as a new beginning as we see many opportunities to drive this higher. We look for non-GAAP operating margins in the range of 28% to 29% in fiscal year '26 with a long-term opportunity for those to be in the low to mid-30s as we further scale our platforms and gain confidence in the power of AI and other business transformations. We're also committed to growing non-GAAP EPS on a compounded rate greater than 20% from fiscal year '23 to '26.\nMoving on to cash flow. Recall that in fiscal year '21, we guided to 33% free cash flow margins. In front of that guidance, we spent considerable effort looking at our entire business end-to-end, from the point of view of cash flow and understanding all the drivers. We have now had 2 years' operating in this manner. We're confident we can sustain our high cash conversion, focusing on areas such as best-in-class working capital management and low CapEx business models. Our top line growth and underlying improvement in operating margin form the foundation of our strong cash generation. There are other factors impacting cash flow that I want to highlight and that we have already included in our forward-looking guidance.\nFirst, with the rising cost of money, we have seen more customers asking for deferred payments over the last 3 years, but especially in the last 12 months, as we previously talked about. Also, our rise in GAAP profitability and some changes in U.S. tax law, we see rising tax -- cash taxes. This has all been included in our forward-looking guidance.\nI wanted to double-click on the impact of deferred payments for a moment. We've already seen this have a significant effect on our cash flow. In the second half of fiscal year '20, along with the pandemic, we launched Palo Alto Networks Financial Services, or PANFS, to ease customers' challenges with short-term cash flow issues. As I mentioned, with the rising cost of money in the last year, we have seen this trend broaden. PANFS and deferred payments allow us to drive success partnering with our customers on long-term transformation of their security architectures while working with their cash flow constraints. The amount of bookings with deferred payments was up 4x in the fourth quarter as compared to 3 years ago. This impacted our reported cash flow in the last 3 years, yet we have maintained our strong cash generation.\nAs we look to the next 3 years, we expect this impact to continue and have accounted for this in our medium-term targets. A byproduct of the rise in deferred payments is greater predictability of our cash flow over time. For example, we now expect about $1 billion in cash flow from deals entered into in prior years where payments will now come in fiscal year '24. This $1 billion is twice what it was in contribution to our fiscal year '23 cash flow when we entered the year.\nSummarizing cash flow, I'm confident we can maintain a baseline of 37% free cash flow margins over the next 3 years after accounting for the factors I noted. This and the revenue growth targets I covered should keep us on the aspirational path to Rule of 60 economics in our business. This combination of top line and cash generation puts us in a rare peer group and allows us the flexibility to navigate the changing environment.\nFinally, I'll cover the capital structure as the last tenant in TSR. With all the opportunities ahead of us, organic investment in our business to drive growth will remain our #1 priority. We have ample cash generation to make these investments. From here, we have 3 capital allocation priorities. As we've done previously, we will continue to balance these. Our first capital allocation priority is our M&A strategy. We have successfully acquired companies that are early leaders in adjacent and emerging cybersecurity markets. Many times, these are markets in which we have had an early organic effort but we see external innovation that can significantly accelerate our time to market. We target companies that have achieved product market fit with teams that can accelerate their innovation inside Palo Alto Networks. Revenue is not a focus for us, but we do ensure that we have a solid plan to accelerate the trajectory of our business. We've used $2.5 billion in cash over the last 5 years, pursuing the strategy successfully.\nSecondly, we manage a capital structure that gives us flexibility. For example, we use our balance sheet as a competitive advantage with PANFS and deferred payments. We repaid our 2023 convertible debt in July and have another convert coming June about 2 years, which we also plan to settle for cash. Beyond enabling reasonable flexibility in our capital structure, we are also focused on minimizing dilution and reducing our organic stock-based compensation expense as a percent of revenue by at least 300 basis points over the next 3 years.\nLastly, we will use share buybacks opportunistically, something that you have seen from us over the last 5 years as we have repurchased nearly $4 billion cumulatively.\nIn concluding my section on bringing it all together, I wanted to bring together the financial targets I've covered. As Nikesh mentioned at the outset, we're focused on an evergreen, innovation-led approach that will continue to fuel our transformation into a software and AI-driven cybersecurity company. I am more excited than ever about our growth prospects over the next several years and our plans to continue to do this profitably, benefiting from our platform business model. I hope my excitement comes through today, and you can clearly see the drivers are confident in these targets from the various presentations.\nWith that, we will now transition to taking your questions, and I will hand the call back to Walter to manage this. Walter?"

We have and continue to work on these problems. We should talk more about this today.\n\nOn the other hand, we continue to see limited underlying growth in hardware in the industry.\n\nWhilst the supply chain crisis and its effects are all but over, there is a shift that the crisis created. We have seen a higher appetite for software-based solutions and networking and a higher appetite for cloud-delivered form factors. This is particularly salient to the current CAPEX-constrained environment.\n\nOn the adversary front, there seems to be no impending recession in threats. Increased cloud activity and connectivity continues to drive the threat environment. This is best illustrated by recent findings in the seventh installment of our Unit 42 Cloud Threat Report. It still takes the average security team approximately six days to resolve a security alert.\n\nIn contrast, it only takes a threat actor a few hours to exploit a newly discovered vulnerability.\n\nWhile over 7,000 malicious versions of open source software packages were circulated in 2022, less than a quarter of those packages are sourced properly to ensure a clean software version is incorporated into a typical customer's codebase.\n\nRegulatory interest continues to rise and is prevalent across multiple governments. There is sustained activity around incremental regulatory mandates and executive orders to create awareness around cybersecurity.\n\nThis is true not only at the government level, but also as companies' board of directors are bringing additional oversight and driving alignment of accountability for cybersecurity.\n\nThis requires incremental organizational focus and investment by our customers.\n\nOn the macro front, customers anticipate that global growth may slow. Some are grappling with rising capital costs and are watching their bottom lines more closely. This means looking for efficiencies in their business.\n\nWithin cybersecurity, complex architectures and long vendor rosters have come into focus, and many customers see this as an opportunity to simplify and drive consolidation.\n\nFive years ago, when I highlighted the need for platform architectures and consolidation,\n\nThe idea was met with some resistance.\n\nOver the last few years, our industry leading solutions three platform approach has continued to take hold and has allowed us to provide a much needed option for simplicity, a modern stack and better security outcomes for our customers.\n\nI mentioned earlier that our customers are engaging in more scrutiny of deals and value, resulting in robust discussions internally with us. We continue to work hard to stay ahead of deal cycles, engaging the CFO and procurement departments. The cost of money continues to become a topic of conversation as customers enter into larger and longer term relationships with us.\n\nSome also seek more flexible business terms.\n\nA strong balance sheet allows us to accommodate customers while we maximize our medium-term castle.\n\nLet us turn to efficiency in operations.\n\nAs we started this fiscal year, we pivoted our efforts and focused our effort on doing more with less. Our teams responded effectively.\n\nCoupled with the waning of the supply chain crisis, we have been able to adapt our operating model significantly.\n\nDeepak will get into specifics, but it suffices to say we have found a new rhythm and at our scale we believe we can continue to drive better margins from our business. We have achieved this through selective hiring in our customer facing teams as well as streamlining our go-to-market efforts in addition to hiring for key innovation areas, which we expect to continue to do.\n\nThese efforts are self-evident in our higher Q3 operating margins and our increased operating and free castle margin guidance for the year.\n\nWe continue to see platformization in cybersecurity. I talked about consolidation earlier. A key part of our thesis at Palo Alto Networks has always been to drive superior cybersecurity outcomes for our customers. To do that, we need a robust portfolio that works both individually and cohesively to reduce the burden on our customers.\n\nwho have to stitch together disparate cybersecurity products.\n\nWe've had to navigate this fine line with our customers.\n\nWe continue to see the benefits of this approach and think we are in a multi-year trend.\n\nWe have the opportunity to do to security what we have seen done in financial software, HR software or CRM where customers have adapted to platforms due to their inherently superior benefits from data integrity, integration, seamlessness and outcome orientation.\n\nAs they say, the proof is in the pudding. You can see our success here driving larger platform transactions. Across the board, the size of the transactions we are signing is increasing. This is evidenced by booking from transactions valued over $1 million, $5 million, and $10 million in the third quarter.\n\nwhich are up by year over year by 29%, 62%, 136% respectively.\n\nWe see a similar trend in cohorts of our customers. For example, when we look at the average lifetime value for our 200 largest customers, we see a steady growth of 30% plus over the last 3 years.\n\nWhen we look at purchases of our platforms amongst the global 2000s, we see now that 53% of our customers have bought a product in all three platforms of Stattra, Prisma and Cortex, up from 48% a year ago and 33% two years ago.\n\nWe see this as a continuing trend. It convinces us that the opportunity to impact outcomes for our customers is large, if we can get this right. We see the path to continued success with large customers and multi-product expansion around stall-based.\n\nI'll now update you on our three platforms starting with network security.\n\nWe are the comprehensive Zero Trust Network security company. This quarter, we are proud to be named a new leader in Gartner's most recent security service edge magic quadrant. This recognition is apt as our teams have been delivering significant innovation and seeing stronger customer adoption in SASE for years.\n\nThis, in addition to our leadership position at SD-WAN, makes us the only SASE vendor in the industry to be named leader in the Gartner SASE and SD-WAN magic quadrants.\n\nAdd to that our leadership position in network firewalls and our number one market share position in virtual firewalls, we are the only vendor with clear leadership across Zero Trust Network Security.\n\nThis leadership across the network security category is a testament to our ability to drive significant innovation in new markets while maintaining our leadership in core markets and offering this innovation as part of our cohesive platform.\n\nLet's talk about SASE. SASE remains one of the fastest growing markets within all of cybersecurity. RAR is growing over 50%. At scale, we have surpassed 4200 customers in Q3. Our success has spread across all three major geographies, as highlighted by large deals in each of these territories in Q3. Let me tell you about three of these notable...\n\nA global beverage company with US headquarters signed a transaction north of $30 million which includes $24 million of SASE for a complete SASE transformation that included Prisma Access, Prisma SD-WAN, and our ADEM, or Autonomous Digital Experience Management, for tens of thousands of employees. Second, a Japan-based technology company signed an eight-figure transaction to modernize this transaction.\n\nits network and its network security after an extensive PoC. Before standardizing on our SASE, the customer replaced its legacy firewalls and other network security capabilities and standardized on our next generation firewalls, driving a full zero-trust network strategy. Finally, a European technology company signed a high seven-figure SASE deal that was part of an overall transaction to Pylo Auto Networks.\n\nof once again nearly 30 million dollars in total value the customer brought from us because of our multiple network security form factors in the broader transaction we added capabilities such as IOT and fully adopted our core network security subscription\n\nYou all might remember, at the beginning of this fiscal year, as part of our scaling efforts, we combined our SASE sales organization into our core sales organization.\n\nThe drivers here with that we saw SASE demand going mainstream and we saw encouraging signs that our core sellers could sell the more complex SASE offering.\n\nAfter three quarters of executing as a combined organization, we're delighted to report that over 80% of our core reps participate in the creation of Prisma SASE pipelines as we enter Q4.\n\nQC was a strong quarter of innovation highlighted by our AI-powered SASE launch. This flagship release includes capabilities to enable organizations to automate their increasingly complex IT and network operations center functions with AIOps. It improves monitoring for networks and apps at the branch office and significantly improves integration with IoT security.\n\nMoving over to our firewall business. Broader than SASE, the future of network security is clear to us. It is centered around software. And while we have led and expect to continue to leave the hardware appliance market for many years, software and cloud-delivered form factors have been an increasing focus since I joined as CEO . There are multiple reasons why the shift to software is accelerating.\n\nIn the changing macro environment, customers are more challenged in their CapEx budgets, which often fund appliance purchases. As a result, their interest in software and cloud delivery form factors remain high. This is especially true when tied to strategic initiatives around cloud adoption. Illustrating this, we saw a significant uptick in customer request to evaluate our virtual firewall offerings at the beginning of the pandemic. Our interest in VMs was also sparked by supply chain challenges.\n\nwhere we saw evaluation sustained. We continue to see primarily net new demand for software and cloud deliver form factors. However, we are seeing more appliance replacements and planning for this trend to continue and possibly accelerate. Beyond the strength I already covered in SASE, we saw VMCs deal over $1 million more than double in Q3.\n\nincluding an eight-figure deal we signed with a government agency where they moved from a primarily appliance-centric model to VM series as a fully leveraged public cloud as their primary infrastructure. This year so far, our VM series bookings are up more than 40% year-over-year and it grew over 55% in Q3.\n\nMost investors have equated our product revenue with hardware. However, given the drivers I have mentioned, here, this has been rapidly shifting. Software now contributes 30% of our product revenue. This is up from about 10% three years ago.\n\nWe expect this trend to continue and as Deepak would remind you, bookings from our VM series and SASE transactions are recognized as revenue more over time than an appliance booking.\n\nGiven the conversation about AI,\n\nAs I mentioned, there is a renaissance in artificial intelligence driven by significant advances in large language models. The development of more powerful and efficient computing is a broad availability of large volumes of training data. As a result, we have all seen some of the fastest innovation cycles and launches of unique applications in the last several months.\n\nAt Palo Alto Networks, we have been focused on this technology for many years, and our efforts have been accelerating over the last two years. We first introduced machine learning capabilities as part of our Wildfire offering seven years ago. In the ensuing years, we added AI and machine learning capabilities across our network security portfolios.\n\nand has been a critical driver of our innovation and differentiation in the market. In 2020, we introduced the industry's first machine learning powered next generation firewall, where machine learning detection moved in-line to prevent zero-day attacks. Since then, we have overhauled nearly all of our security subscriptions with advanced AI capabilities DNS security, advanced URL filtering, advanced threat prevention, and more.\n\nand advanced wildfire all harness machine learning for inline detection and prevention of zero-day attacks. This means even new attacks that have never been seen before are blocked at the very first attempted use by an attacker. Additionally, we applied AI to IoT security to discover, identify and secure IoT devices and most recently,\n\nit was expanded to cover both medical IoT and OT security needs. We had a signature release in SASE that included AI-powered autonomous digital experience management in addition to leveraging AI for SD-WAN as well as AI-powered phishing prevention. In short, we have really been accelerating the application of AI to our network security stack.\n\nand is one of the most mature applications of AI in the security industry today.\n\nWe are not only ahead in investments in AI and machine learning as a differentiator in our products, but these investments have driven tangible customer benefits.\n\nIn a typical day, we analyze nearly 750 million new, unique telemetry objects worldwide. This includes files, URLs, domains, DNS connections, and other signals. Our AI models analyze this data and every day we see 1.5 million new attacks that have never been seen before.\n\nWe take these new insights and add them to all the other things we have already known about and we use them to block 8.6 billion attacks across our customer base daily.\n\nThis form is the foundation how we do better security across our network security platforms and is how we continue to get better and better at detecting zero-day attacks and being in a position actually to prevent those attacks as well.\n\nMoving on to Prisma Cloud, our early days in Prisma Cloud continues to strengthen. Most of our competitors continue to provide only point products, while customer demands continue to shift towards the platform approach. Within this, connecting the left side to the right side, otherwise known as Code to Cloud is becoming paramount.\n\nAs an example of our platform's success, we continue to see strong usage of our cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection offerings. Customers are increasingly standardizing on these foundational modules with 49% of Prisma Cloud customers using both CSPM and CWP.\n\nThis quarter, Gartner noted that in 2022, only 25% of enterprises buy these capabilities from a common vendor. They expect this will increase to 60% of enterprises by 2025. At the same time, we continue to stay ahead of the industry's need for new capabilities, which is core to our commitment as a platform. We are on track to launch our 11th module as we innovate slider security.\n\nWe also focus on driving industry certification in Prisma Cloud. In this last quarter, we were accepted by the Joint Advisory Board and reached ready status for FedRAMP High, a first for our cloud security platform. This comes in addition to other certifications we have achieved including recently announced Prisma Access Achieving Impact Level 5 for IL-5 provision authorization.\n\nI-05 is the highest unclassified authorization level for DOD agencies under the FedRAMP process.\n\nWe continue to see steady growth in consumption of Prisma Cloud credits, which are up 44% year-over-year in Q3. Our platform is key to the steady growth.\n\nWe continue to see customers increase their consumption as they deploy workloads and strategically leverage the public cloud at the core of their IT and business strategy. This includes migrating workloads to the hyperscale cloud, building new applications in the cloud and leveraging new cloud services. They are also deploying new Prisma Cloud modules of which we currently have 10.\n\nThe number of customers using two or more Prisma Cloud modules grew 37% a year, while the number using four or more modules almost doubled. We now have one in five of our Prisma Cloud customers using our Cloud Code module across our capabilities and infrastructure as code, SCA, our software composition analysis, and SICAS management.\n\nas they leverage the more efficient approach to detect and remediate security issues as core decision for cloud applications before it reaches production.\n\nleverage the more efficient approach to detect and remediate security issues as co-decision for cloud applications before it reaches production. Now moving on to Cortex.jeff ilar\n\nThis has been a net new business for Palo Alto Networks, a business which is born in the belief that we need to bring next generation innovation to the SOC and all the related activities.\n\njust like we had brought firewall business years ago. We're delighted to announce that Cortex achieved a billion dollar booking milestone in the last 12 months.\n\nCortex was born in 2019 and since then, they have focused intensively on ensuring they have industry leading capabilities across endpoints, SOC automation, and attack surface management.\n\nIn the last four years, we have risen to a leading player in automation, application of AI, attack surface management, and continue to climb the charts of the XDR industry as one of the most technically capable solutions.\n\nWe particularly pull out of the fact that XDR has consistently led in security efficacy. XDR delivered 100% prevention and 100% detection across the 19 evaluation steps conducted by MITRE and has had the highest quality detection of any part in the latest round of evaluation.\n\nOn the back of our hard work driving these capabilities, we have built Cortex's business to over a billion dollars in bookings over the last 12 months, as I mentioned. It is up from 150 million in annual bookings when we launched Cortex as a business in 2019.\n\nAs we look forward, these three core capabilities in Cortex are precursors to leading the next generation autonomous security operations center, which pulls this all together and was launched publicly a few months ago, called XIM.\n\nOur next generation SOT platform, XIM, built totally on AI, is on track to be our fastest growing new offering.\n\nXIM represents another significant opportunity within Cortex as we fulfill our vision around autonomous security operations. Like network security a decade ago, security operations have evolved slowly. XIM is now paving the way for us to drive AI-driven security transformation outcomes.\n\nAfter our GA launch in late Q1, our design partners made significant commercial commitments to XIM. We followed that up in Q2 by broadening our go-to-market and achieving early success with $30 million in bookings. This quarter, we established momentum for XIM, with quarterly bookings more than doubling sequentially as we signed our first eight-figure deal.\n\nand transactions across all three of our major geographic theaters with this product. We remain optimistic about the prospects of XIM with the product of the center of customer security operations center transformation. We're seeing XIM give us access to a broader swath of our customers' budgets. Based on what we have achieved this quarter and what we see in the pipeline, we're confident we can achieve our goal of $100 million in bookings faster than we originally anticipated. This would make it one of the fastest growing security platforms from Palo Alto Networks.\n\nNot only does XIM bring together the core capabilities of Cortex, it also brings AI-driven outcomes to customers.\n\nThis heralds a new approach to security, an outcome-based approach. The inspiration came to us from our own sock, where we were woefully slow in our own mean time remediate five years ago.\n\nOur MTTR was in days, which in today's adversarial environment is unacceptable. With that insight in mind, we were able to collect billions of events and then using AI, it reduces down to just over 100 alerts from a handful of incidents. From here, continuing to use AI and automation, we are able to investigate and respond while detecting incidents in a matter of seconds and responding to high priority ones in under a minute. This is one of the most compelling outcome stories in security.\n\nSo far, in the early customers that are farthest along on this journey with us, we are seeing the benefits accrue in a similar way. We process over 3.5 petabytes of data a day across the customer state of XDR and XIM. From here, we employ approximately 1,000 AI models to detect attacks.\n\nWe then leverage smart scoring in these automations to accelerate investigation response. We are seeing early indications that customers are able to see reductions and in the meantime respond from days or weeks down to hours or minutes just like we did.\n\nand smart scoring in these automation to accelerate investigation response. We are seeing early indications that customers are able to see reductions in the meantime to respond from days or weeks down to hours or minutes just like we did. Sh Zimbabwean.\n\nWe are fortunate to be focused on the part of the technology market that is more resilient. Our customers depend on their partnership with us to address challenges that are only becoming more sophisticated. The market is tough and definitely more challenging than when we started the year. I'm proud that our team has executed through this environment.\n\nOur strategy focuses on having industry-leading capabilities, helping customers simplify their architectures and consolidating vendors is working. Given our diverse portfolio of products, some of our products are growing faster in any given quarter and others are moderating. Combined, you see this portfolio benefit in the top-line results we reported today. We also see significant opportunity as we begin to embed generative AI into our products and workflow.\n\nWe will leverage our large cybersecurity dataset and telemetry to provide a more intuitive and natural language-driven experience within our products which will improve NPS and drive efficiency benefits for our customers. And finally, as our employees leverage generative AI, we will drive significant efficiency in our own processes and operations across the enterprise.\n\nWe intend to deploy proprietary Palo Alto Network security LLM in the coming year and are actively pursuing multiple efforts to realize these three outcomes.\n\nOur portfolio approach, company's overall scale and focus on efficiency have enabled us to drive significant leverage.\n\nWe are well ahead of schedule here and we're not done. As we continue to execute our plans, we see additional opportunities for efficiency.\n\nWith our visibility into incremental leverage, we continue to see the operating property levels in our fiscal year 2020 guidance as a baseline to build upon. With that, I will turn the call over to Deepak to discuss the details of Q3 and our guidance.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q3, revenue was $1.72 billion and grew 24%. Product revenue grew 10%. Total service revenue grew 29%, with subscription revenue of $838 million, growing 31%, and support revenue of $495 million, growing 25%.\n\nMoving on to geographies, we saw revenue growth across all theaters, with the Americas growing 24%, EMEA up 23%, and JPAC growing 24%.\n\nThe strength of our next generation of security capabilities continues to drive our results, with NGS ARR of $2.6 billion, growing 60%.\n\nWe saw strength across all three platforms, network security, cloud security, and security operations. We delivered total billings of $2.26 billion, up 26%, and above the high end of our guidance range.\n\nTotaling the third revenue in Q3 was $8.1 billion, an increase of 38%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $9.2 billion, increasing 35%, with current RPO just under half of our RPO. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was significantly ahead of our day.\n\nhighlights. non-GAAP gross margin of 76.1% was up 320 basis points year over year, driven mainly by a higher software mix, reduced supply chain costs and some efficiencies in customer support.\n\nOur non-GAAP operating margin of 23.6% increased 540 basis points year over year.\n\nIn addition to improving gross margins, slower headcount additions contributed to our operating leverage.\n\nBased on our performance in Q3, we are raising our fiscal year 23 non-GAAP operating margin guidance.\n\nnon-GAAP net income for the third quarter grew 86% to $359 million or $1.10 for the living tax on their first winter in New York STAR.\n\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. We again delivered GAAP profitability in Q3 with GAAP net income of $108 million or 31 cents to value the GAAP.\n\nNow turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement.\n\nWe ended Q3 with cash, equivalents and investments of $6.7 billion.\n\nIt is worth reminding investors that our 2023 convertible note will mature on July 1, 2023, and we expect to settle the principal obligation with cash on our balance sheet of $1.7 billion. The excess will be settled in shares. These shares have previously been accounted for in our non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding.\n\nHuge free cash flow from operations was $432 million with total adjusted free cash flow of $401 million this quarter.\n\nStock-based compensation declined by 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, stock-based compensation was down 220 basis points as a percent of revenue. As we look forward, we remain focused on profitable growth.\n\nAt our analyst day in 2021, we outlined plans to drive 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion annually in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024. In the months leading up to this profitability commitment, we focused in-depth on optimally balancing investments in our business and opportunities to capture efficiencies and benefit from our growing scale.\n\nWe also saw signs of a changing macroeconomic environment.\n\nAs such, it was the right time to accelerate our efficiency plans. We focused our headcount additions in sales and R&D to fuel our medium-term growth prospects.\n\nOutside of these critical investment areas, we've leveraged our scale and employed technology to accommodate our growth in other business areas. Additionally, supply chain challenges have continued to abate at an increasing pace, helping to improve our gross margin.\n\nThe results have been a significant acceleration and operating margin expansion through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2023 and also increases to operating with recafelin margin guidance through the year.\n\nAs you see with our guidance, the non-GAAP operating margin fiscal year 2023, we're nearly 300 basis points ahead of the midpoint of our fiscal year 2024 range that we implied back in 2021. We now see our fiscal year 2023 non-GAAP operating margins as a baseline to build on in the future. Moving on to guidance.\n\nFor the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.20 billion, an increase of 17 to 19%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.937 to $1.967 billion, an increase of 25 to 27%.\n\nWe expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of 126 to 130 and increase of 58 to 63%. For the fiscal year 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $9.18 to $9.23 billion and increase of 23 to 24%.\n\nWe expect NGS ARR to be in the range of 2.80 to 2.85 billion dollars, an increase of 48 to 51 percent. We expect revenue to be in the range of 6.88 to 6.91 billion dollars, an increase of 25 to 26 percent.\n\nWe expect product revenue growth in the range of 15 to 16 percent of fiscal year 23 as we see supply chain challenges normalized as we exit fiscal year 23. For fiscal year 23 we expect operating margins to be in the range of 23 to 23.25 percent.\n\nWe expect non-GAAP UPS to be in the range of 4.24 to 4.29, an increase of 69 to 70%.\n\nWe expect our adjusted free cash flow margin to be 37.5 to 38.5 percent and we expect to be that profitable for fiscal year 2023 including in 2.4.\n\nAdditionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22%, the Q423 and fiscal year 23, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. The Q423, we expect net interest and other income of $50 to $55 million. We expect Q4 diluted shares outstanding of $326 to $332 million.\n\nWe expect fiscal year diluted shares outstanding of 322 to 324 million and we expect Q4 capital expenditures of 35 to 40 million dollars.\n\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Walter for the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you, Deepak.\n\nTo allow for broad participation, I would ask that each person ask only one question.\n\nOur first question will come from Saket Kalia of Barclays with Hamza Fadarwala from Morgan Stanley on deck.\n\nquestion will come from Saket Kalia of Barclays with Hansa Fadarwala from Morgan Stanley on deck. Saket, you're muted.\n\nWhy don't we go to Hamza next. Can you hear me now? Go ahead.\n\nSorry, it didn't let me unmute. Thanks so much for taking the question here. A nice job to the team executing in a very challenging environment. Nikesh, maybe a lot of good things to talk about, but I'd love to just double click on the operating margin improvement here that you've seen, and really a new baseline that the team is creating going into next year.\n\nMaybe the question is, can you and Deepok maybe talk about what areas the team is finding efficiency in, and what are the opportunities for efficiency maybe going forward as well? Thanks. Yeah, look.\n\nis can you and Deepak maybe talk about what areas the team is finding efficiency in and what are the opportunities for efficiency maybe going forward as well. Thanks.\n\nPreface that as Deepak highlighted, supply chain crisis all but over and you know there were some adverse impacts to gross margins by given by hardware. I think the product makes us in our favor as we go from hardware to software. Our gross margins are way better on software than they generally are on hardware.\n\ngiven software firewalls are much more profitable for us. Couple with that, I think what Deepak really has been driving for the last year as we flipped into the new macroeconomic environment has been real focus on resource utilization, ROI, as well as making sure\n\nwe are focused on hiring only on stuff where it's important. We also talked about streamlining sales forces. If you remember, Saket, we had the conversation around making sure our SASE team is integrated with our core, which saved us hundreds of heads in terms of efficiency, as well as driving more outcome and output from a SASE perspective. So generally, those have been some of the key drivers, but Deepak, did you want to add something?\n\nNo, I think you've covered it all. I think we've talked this before. You're welcome. Yep. We scale well as a company, right? And I think that's across all the different elements of our P&L. I think Nikesh has talked about the supply chain. We talked about the OpEx. I just also mentioned cloud hosting, cloud consumption. As we get bigger and we consume more, we have the ability to go back to our service providers and try and negotiate better contracts. So I think across\n\nall the areas of the P&L, we scale pretty well as a company. And I think to your question in terms of where this goes, as Deepak said, this is a new baseline. We think there is continued opportunity from here and we haven't even factored in the potential impact of generative AI as you've been hearing all the conversation in the industry. We're still working on it, we're standing here, we're really looking at processes, but\n\nNow we believe there is a there there. We think there will be an opportunity in the future to get more efficiency from generative AI as we go ahead and implement some of the capabilities to our organization. So I think there's upside both in the continued efforts of what Deepak has been driving for the last nine months and there's the sort of the icing on the top is the potential after\n\nMaybe the questions for Nikesh and Lee Claire, if he's around. Nikesh, on AI, you've clearly been thinking about this a lot based on what I can tell from your Twitter. But we were at RSA last month and while there's a lot of opportunity...\n\nWhile there's a lot of opportunity around AI, did there seem to be a lot of risks around data security, around sort of the data that these models are trained on? So I'm curious as you have that AI-based conversation with your customers, how are you getting them comfortable around that to really leverage the full capabilities of AI to automate their thoughts?\n\nYeah, I think there's two different parts of it. I think one part is us using AI already in our products, where we have been using it for a while to look at pattern recognition, look at what it's telling us from a real-time analysis of data perspective, as I mentioned. We deploy over a thousand AI models to go look at what happens the next time. There's all proprietary is happening.\n\nIn our instance, this is not an LLM that's going out and getting trained. This is the proprietary AI model used by Palo Alto Networks, built by Palo Alto Networks, being used for a specific use case and a task for security. Now, to the extent that we intend and will deploy conversational AI in our models, we are working with every public model and open source model out there to understand how can we build it.\n\nusing our own proprietary data. I don't know, Lee, can you elaborate on that, please? Yes, of course.\n\nIt's very early in the large language model adoptions that we're seeing, and as you point out, there are a number of risks associated with them, particularly in enterprise use cases.\n\nWe've already seen some examples where data has fed into large language models without the understanding of how the data would be used, and the data has been publicly made public available even though it was confidential. It's very clear that there is sensitivity there.\n\nThere's also sensitivity from a security perspective of things like prompt injection attacks, data poisoning and things like that that have to be taken into account.\n\nAnd so I think what we'll see is the enterprise use cases of LLMs will evolve a little bit more – actually, I should say need to evolve a little bit more methodically and carefully to take these security challenges into account.\n\nAt the same time though, it's also important to recognize that they offer tremendous promise, as Nikesh mentioned earlier, in terms of being able to help guide product adoption, product usage, to help enhance security capabilities, and to drive greater efficiencies across the business. I think to cap it off, I think.\n\nThere is no doubt we will continue to deploy our proprietary AI models for XIM or for our network security use cases I highlighted. We believe in our preliminary analysis of the last three months and driving a lot of these work streams internally, that there is a there there with generative AI. So we believe that we will be deploying generative AI over the course of the next few months.\n\nand we'll talk more about it at a later event, but we think that has an opportunity both to significantly improve our customer efficiency and the efficacy of our products, at the same time also to drive efficiencies within the way we run Palo Alto Networks. I think last but not the least, which is something you didn't ask, but I'll say separately, Lee and his team have been working hard.\n\nto see and look at the adverse impact that generative AI could have in terms of adversaries using generative AI to build new malware to try and attack our customers. And there's a lot of work we're doing as well to make sure we are able to protect our customers against any such activity that is conducted using generative AI.\n\nThank you. Thanks for your question, Hamza. Next question is from Brian Essex at JP Morgan, held by Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Brian , go ahead.\n\nYeah, hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and, you know, to follow up on Saka's comments, nice progression in operating margin here and it's good to see cash flow margin guidance go up as well. If I could take down, if you could maybe, you know, peel back a couple layers on that core drivers of that cash flow margin improvement how sustainable it is we noticed that, you know, capex look like\n\ncash flow margins remain relatively consistent going forward.\n\nYeah, so Brian thanks for the question. Let me just start off with like the biggest driver over the long term is really just to strengthen your bookings, at least your billings and then comes down. Then the foundation really is your operating margin that then makes up the base that you can do on your cash. There are multiple other factors that\n\nAnd then last but not least, we do have Panafest. We have a certain amount of our business that we do structure and financing. Frankly, that's been broadly in line with what we assumed at the beginning of the year, but those are really the drivers and we feel pretty comfortable on.\n\nwhat we're able to do with those different drivers and developing our numbers.\n\nNice job both to Nikesh, Deepak, and the entire team. Nikesh, my question is about M&A, which I feel like typically comes later in the call, but I feel like it's such a great opportunity right now. What's the hurdle to doing the large deal? And can you remind us how you think about transformative M&A and just related to that.\n\nYour competitors naturally knock you on having grown through required innovation. Just to set the record straight, can you talk about how much a priority and a focus it is to have a deeply integrated product? Yeah, Brian , I think first of all, I'm amused that you're asking for transformation in M&A. I think I feel like somehow we at Power, the networks, have been going through a transformation already for the last time.\n\nby our team internally. It was designed, built, and delivered by the Cortex team. So I think it's a disservice to them to say that some of the fastest growing platforms being built at Power Autom networks was acquired. Similarly, our next generation firewalls or our SASE product, our SASE product for the most part is entirely homegrown driven by the security capabilities that we built.\n\ncapabilities and our tax surface management. So bottom line, we're very comfortable with the three platforms that we have and what we need to get done. I think we've been very clear about, from an acquisition perspective, we look for product capability, where we can take product capability and attach that and make sure we can solve more problems for our customers.\n\nSo from that perspective, my view in M&A is consistent that we find something interesting, an industry trend which is added incremental tech capability, we will do it. I think from a transformational M&A, I think we can transform this company and have continued to transform it to where it is based on our innovation and our balance of execution. I think we will continue to do that. I don't think the market is particularly cheap yet.\n\nif you were to try and look for a transformation, and I think it's kind of a dual double.\n\nedge situation, one, I think we continue to get stronger as we get execution under our bell, and we continue to grow in value as Palo Alto Networks. And if some of the large players out there end up committing missteps, then we'll go take a look at it for now. I feel very comfortable with the position Palo Alto has in the industry. I feel very, very comfortable with the amount of cash we have on our balance sheet.\n\nI believe it is our job to keep our heads down and keep executing because it's a tough market. And I think one of the things which was brought up just a minute ago, I think the opportunities from AI have not been fully comprehended by most enterprise businesses. I think we are going to undergo a transformation.\n\nboth as part of the network as well as generally an enterprise software industry for the next 12 to 24 months as we embrace generative AI. I think that's the real opportunity and challenge in front of us. And I think half of the people out there will get it wrong and hopefully we're on the right side of history. You're doing a great job. Keep it up. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Brad. Next question is from Andy Nowinski from Wells Fargo followed by Matt Hedberg from RBC. Andy, go ahead.\n\nOkay thank you and congrats on a great quarter.\n\nSo nearly every single vendor and nearly every single reseller we you know we talked to you says they're seeing an elongation of sales cycles yet you seem to defy those headwinds with massive growth in in large deals and customers spending five and ten million dollars with you I guess would you view this as\n\ninflect an important inflection point as it relates to sort of consolidation in that if you can drive large deals in this macro constrained environment you could potentially see an acceleration of those consolidation trends when the macro improves are you predicting a macro improvement Andy?\n\nI certainly hope so. Well look, I think first and foremost I don't want to leave you with any impression that the macro is not hard. It is hard out there. I think everything you're hearing from resellers, from other people in the industry is true. Customers are spending more time paying attention to deals. Customers are.\n\ntaking longer, some are right sizing deals, some are focusing things that are important, some are looking for financing, some want to pay annually. So all the effects that you talked about are true in the industry. And we recognize this towards the end of our first quarter. And I'll tell you what, we've been working at double time. Like literally the day...\n\naround the fact that our quarter ends on July 31st. There's no budget year-end for any part of the world on July 31st. It's a date that's been created, that Palo Alto finishes here, Q4 on July 31st, which means the year to run as hard as we can to get business done by July 31st. We know that's the end of our year. We know that's the end of our quarter. Our customers know that. So what we're doing is we're getting ahead of it. We're hoping that us.\n\ngetting ahead of it and continuing to rigorously execute is going to allow us to be able to improve our conversion rates. Our conversion rates on our pipeline are down. Guess what? You've drawn up more pipeline, therefore your conversion rate that's down still allows you to make the number that you promised us to read. That's what we've been trying to do, and as I've said, the macro is hard, and we're going to keep trying to keep our heads down and execute. Thanks, Nikesh. Keep up the good work.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Andy. Next question from Matt Hedberg at RBC, followed by Gabriella Borges at Goldman. Go ahead, Matt. Thanks, Walter. My congrats again, team, outstanding results. I guess, Nikesh or Lee, on the success you've seen thus far with XIM, you noted you essentially have full access to SIM budgets right now. And I'm curious, with some of the large deals you're seeing, are these generally replacing legacy SIM vendors, or are you actually just seeing a lot\n\nwe believe the only way to have normalized good source, single source of truth data is to deploy our endpoint products and then we use that as I showed in the AI funnel of how we can go cross-correlate that and go drive great security outcomes. So in every case we are replacing an existing vendor but I will tell you the sock\n\nindustry is upside down. It was designed so far to go understand when a breach happens how the breach happened and try and figure out how to remediate it. And those remediation times as I highlighted are six days and now most modern attacks are in and out in under 12 hours. So if you've got a SOC infrastructure which allows you to come up with what happened to you after six days, the bad actors have gone in and out in 12 hours.\n\nyou have a mismatch. That is a problem. But Lee, can you highlight some of the key use cases that were seen in the first 30 plus customers that we have, what's driven some of this transformation?\n\nYeah, but nearly, so ExAM is replacing the SIEM, it's also replacing other tools in the SOC as well.\n\nThere's three core elements to how this is happening. The first is around data. As you saw, three and a half petabytes of data is being ingested and analyzed. Data is the key to driving good AI, and XIM is specifically designed to be able to adjust large amounts of data across different data sources into an AI data lake. Second is how we drive AI-based analytics on that data.\n\nbe able to detect attacks in real time. This is something that the traditional sim industry was just not well designed to be able to do. That is driving the meantime the detection that you're seeing. And then three is the integration of automation natively into XIM that allows us to drive the meantime remediation down.\n\nfrom what in the past used to be, in many cases, days, down to hours and even minutes. And so in all of the XIM deployments we're seeing, it's amazing how quickly we're seeing the outcomes that we saw in our own SOC when we deployed an operationalized XIM.\n\nI think the last thing I'll add, sorry Matt, the only thing I'll add on this is that over the last 15 years what has happened is the cost and value equation in existing SOX has diverged tremendously.\n\nSo people are spending a lot of money collecting data in large data stores, and they're not getting adequate value out of it, and they're not getting adequate security outcomes out of it. So I think that is a big gap, and that gap is something we've built this product to try and fill. And now it really is, very early days for us, I think the fact that we'll get to $100 million.\n\nin a time span if you thought was aggressive, less than that, I think tells us there's a huge potential out there, which means we have to keep our heads down again, keep building, keep executing, and keep trying to solve the problems that our customers are presenting in front of us, but I have a good feeling about that.\n\ntime span if you thought was aggressive and less than that, I think tells us there's a huge potential out there, which means we have to keep our heads down again, keep building, keep executing, and keep trying to solve the problems that our customers are presenting in front of us. But I have a good feeling about that. Certainly seems that way. Thanks.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Matt. Next question, Gabriela Borges at Goldman Sachs with Adam Tindall from Raymond James on deck. Gabriela, go ahead. Good afternoon. Thank you. Either for Leona Cash, I wanted to ask about your cloud security strategy in Prisma, specifically with respect to how you think about the right balance of incentives that you give customers up front to catalyze adoption, and then also how you think about the balance of top down growth versus product led growth, given that DevSecOps, DevOps, some of those tools seem to be driven by product led growth as well. Thank you.\n\nThanks, Matt. Next question, Gabriella Borges at Goldman Sachs with Adam Tindall from Raymond James on deck. Gabriella, go ahead. Good afternoon. Thank you. Either for Leona Cash, I wanted to ask about your cloud security strategy in Prisma, specifically with respect to how you think about the right balance of incentives that you give customers up front to catalyze adoption, and then also how you think about the balance of top down growth versus product-led growth, given that DevSecOps, DevOps, some of those tools seem to be driven by product-led growth as well. Thank you. Please.\n\nGo ahead, answer that question. So, one of the challenges that we set out to address with Prisma Cloud was this fundamental challenge in enterprise cybersecurity of sort of the proliferation of point products. Every time there's a new security need, there's a new product, and then customers become the system integrator of all the different point solutions. And they spend more time trying to be the system integrator than they are actually getting the value from the products.\n\nAnd so with Prisma Cloud, we've taken the unique approach of building a platform where we can deliver many different capabilities pre-integrated from the same location. Now, at the same time we did that on the technical side, we also approached it from a...\n\nsort of the adoption side and I'll call it the procurement side of having a single Prisma Cloud credit system that makes it really easy for customers to buy a level of capacity, and then simply use it to adopt as much of the platform as they need and when they need. And so we've, it's allowed us to focus more of our attention in terms of how we engage with customers and how the product works.\n\non in-product adoption, guided adoption of additional capabilities, and enabling them to easily use more and more the services as they need them, as opposed to having to go back and turn every module into a new transaction with a customer. And as you saw from what Nikesh showed, the...\n\nthe new credit usage year over year going up about 44% year over year, but then also the number of customers, the two or more, three or more, four or more modules, in the case of four or more, almost doubling year over year shows how well that is working. Great, thanks Gabriella. Next up, Adam Tindall, Raymond James, followed by Greg Moskowitz and Mazuho. Adam, go ahead.",
    "content2": "Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to start by just acknowledging the progression and operating margin is really impressive and commitment to that being a baseline is a really important point. If I'm thinking about tomorrow, some of the distracting questions that might come up would be around product revenue. I think you grew 10 percent year over year in 2-3 and you had previously guided the fiscal year to 10 percent.\n\nBut if I saw on the slides correctly, I think you're now raising that to 15 to 16 percent. So what's driving that increase in product revenue and the acceleration in Q4, despite the cautionary comments? And anything we can think about in terms of puts and takes to product revenue as we think about fiscal 24 so we don't get ahead of ourselves. Thanks.\n\nAdam, I think there's two parts to it. One is, as you will appreciate, we highlighted that software has become 30% of our product revenue. So, we, you know, whilst when you book a hardware firewall, you get a dollar for dollar for revenue, in software you don't get a dollar for dollar for revenue. There's some part of an amortized value we get from our software firewalls and some part of our SD-WAN, which becomes part of our product revenue. So we have to run harder on billings to be able to deliver.\n\nproduct revenue in the context of software. But as I mentioned, our virtual firewalls grew at 55% this quarter, they grew at 40% for the year so far. This is a tailwind we had not expected. The same time the hardware, as I mentioned, is not as strong as we'd expected. So they balance each other out, but the balance is in favor of software for now, coming off a low base of last year. So as a result, we have been able to improve our product revenue guidance. So probably it costs 2020, 20 years since we launched the new app release. pulled like this, but not as cybersecurity as it, all thatscale. Our experience differences in what we do now with the existing technology ourselves. What's else is better out of applied Barack themselves and what Google thinks about these new technologies Let's take another little look at what technology hasDan\n\nfor a future rainy day. So Tom, right financially? No, that's correct. Even if it's a rainy day, there we are. The only other thing that I would maybe just add to that is simply the supply chain dynamics that Nikesh talked about in his remarks. I mean, that does have some factors, but we really have been able to, with a world-class team, get ahead of the supply chain reality. And so that...\n\nthat may explain some of the variability you're seeing. Great, thank you, Adam. Next up, Greg Moskowitz from Mizzou, followed by Shaul Al from Talon. Thank you, can you hear me? Yes. Yes.\n\nAll right, I have a follow-up for Lee or Nikesh on generative AI. So your comments on LLMs were helpful, but do you think Gen AI will tilt the scales in favor of Palo Alto and perhaps some other security vendors over time? Or is it ultimately more likely to cause an even faster game of cat and mouse between the vendors?\n\nand the attackers? How do you see this playing out?\n\nWell, first and foremost, the benefit of generative AI so far is twofold. One is its ability to summarize data and give you access to information much faster. Can I imagine a sales rep at Palo Alto having access to their fingertips about all Palo Alto information? Of course I can.\n\nCan I imagine my customers support people having access to amazing amounts of information that's at the tip of their fingers so they can answer questions much faster. Can I imagine showcasing that information directly to my customers as you're seeing the industry now suddenly a plethora of co-pilots start to emerge in every product. So I think that is going to become an obvious benefit of generative AI. Now don't forget it relies on one principle called having a lot of data.\n\nIt's very important that whether you're using it for sharing your own information from your customers to your customers, you need all that data. You have to clean all your data processes and have that. Secondly, if you're in the security business, it definitely helps if you have the largest data lake in the world full of security data. So from that perspective, I think it favors the people.\n\nwho have a lot of data already as part of their strategy, and they have built a business in the back of a data-led strategy. I think not just specific to security, in any industry, especially consumer internet, if you've been a UI company, you have something to worry about. And if you're a travel booking operator or something with just\n\ntakes other people's data and makes a better UI, you have something to worry about. So I think from that perspective, it favors companies which have tremendous amounts of data. I think the second thing is also important to understand. If I have 14,000 people, I spend thousands of, billion dollars in customer support or more, there is leverage. I can go spend 30, 40, $50 million deploying an NLM and saving half my cost. If you're running a small company and your entire cost is $50 million, it probably doesn't behoove you to go\n\nGood afternoon, congrats team. I want to go back, actually, you know Brad was asking about M&A. I want to ask about the competitive landscape, but specifically with a focus maybe on the CNAP front. My question is, how do you think about it?\n\nAny change, do you think that the product right now as it stands is comprehensive or anything you might be thinking of maybe augmenting specifically on the C&F front? Thank you for that. That's by far the most comprehensive.\n\ncloud-native application protection platform there is. That doesn't mean that we do everything, but we do far more than any other solution out there.\n\nThere's tremendous amount of focus on delivering capabilities that we've been building internally, organically amongst the team. We've seen the most recent one we delivered with secret scanning just a few months ago. We've seen very good early adoption of that.\n\nAt the same time, we're also delivering on the latest acquisition of CIDR security, where we expect that to become a new module in the next couple of months available to all of our Prisma Cloud customers. And so Nikesh talked about how we've leveraged M&A in the past to help build some of the key technology areas of Prisma Cloud, which is absolutely true. We're going to take a look at the new version of the Prisma Cloud. So, let's take a look at the new version of the Prisma Cloud. So, let's take a look at the new version of the Prisma Cloud.\n\nWe have also shown an ability to deliver new cloud security capabilities organically and be very successful at that. And right now, feel good about the balance of both those capabilities and how we're bringing them together and how we continue to deliver new innovations.\n\nThank you for the question.

Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter with the balance of top line growth, significant expansion and non-GAAP operating margin and strong free cash flow. Billings and revenue each grew 26% year-over-year. Our RPO grew 39% as we continue to sign large multiyear deals with our customers. We also delivered an acceleration in our operating leverage in Q2 as we focused on driving profitable growth. Our non-GAAP operating income grew 55% year-over-year, supported by a non-GAAP operating margin, which exceeded 22% for the quarter, up over 440 basis points year-over-year. This translated to another quarter of profitability on a GAAP basis. We have now been GAAP profitable on a cumulative basis over the last 4 quarters. In addition, our strong free cash flow generation this quarter also puts us on track to outperform prior guidance.\nI know many of you are wondering about the macro environment, so I want to start with an update there. There's clearly a tougher macro emerging out there as the Fed continues on its crusade to tame inflation. The changing macro is clearly making business leaders more cautious. Some of our customers are seeing signs of a slight slowdown while others are less impacted. I, however, feel that we're not done yet. And while not expecting shocks, I do think we will see more cautious activity over the next few quarters. Clearly, caution is abundant, driving more scrutiny, making customers demand more value from their partners. We've seen some projects get delayed or descoped, none canceled, while most continue on track. We've always maintained that we expect cybersecurity to be resilient, and we continue to see evidence of that.\nOn the large deal front, this behavior is definitely widespread. For us, this has meant we need to get ahead of this and work closely with our CIO and CISO partners. Not just that. It's creating more conversations around payment terms, discounts and scope of deal with purchasing teams, something we've been working with our customers on as well. I'm delighted that based on our field teams getting ahead of this problem, earlier this quarter, we did not see any major deals slip from the quarter. Our deal cadence quality was consistent with the same quarter last year.\nOn an equally positive note, this environment drives the need for consolidation not just to generate clear security outcomes, but also to reduce the security vendor sprawl that has been prevalent in our customers' infrastructure and the need for a long-term security strategy based on total cost of ownership and value. We feel fortunate that with our portfolio, we are best positioned to deliver this to our customers.\nWithin our own business, 2 things have happened. One, we have become more focused on efficiency from early this year. For example, our headcount growth this year is likely to be lower than any of the last 3 years. At the same time, we do not anticipate slowing down the pace of our development or business outcomes. Dipak and his team have been rigorously inspecting our cost structures across our portfolio to ensure we are set up to deliver consistent gross margins in all areas. This has been one of the major drivers of our improved operating margin, and we hope to continue to improve as we scale.\nSecondly, as anticipated, supply chain challenges and product have abated significantly versus 6 months ago. While this is evident in our product gross margins and our overall profitability, there are some lingering impacts, which we expect to further abate through the end of this year.\nLet's also take a moment to discuss hardware growth. Over the last 12 months, a lot of factors have impacted hardware growth, including supply constraints, uneven demand given supply chain impacts and backlog. Additionally, we have noticed our customers continue to be more focused on their cloud, network and security operations and transformations and are willing to sweat their hardware assets longer. Underlying all this, we still believe that the industry hardware growth rate is in the low to mid-single digits. As all these extraneous factors mitigated over the next few months, we will see the long-term growth gravitate back to those levels.\nSo what does this mean for the second half of this year and beyond? Somewhat counter to the market, we're raising guidance both on top line metrics, metrics and profitability. Of course, this requires the current demand to sustain, and for us to maintain a continued focus on execution. We have a unique opportunity in this environment to strengthen our position in the market. Hence, we are investing with an eye towards disciplined growth and positioning ourselves as the partner of choice for customers looking to consolidate. You'll hear more about this from Dipak, but we are raising billings and next-generation security, our guidance, on the back of the strength in our software-based and cloud-delivered capabilities. In our hardware pipeline, we're seeing specific transactions that are on track for Q4, which has caused us to shift some forecasted revenue from Q3 to Q4 while maintaining our annual guidance. With all I have said about efficiency and better operations and the impact, we're now guiding to 21.5% to 22% operating margin for fiscal year 2023. Additionally, we're also increasing our cash flow guidance.\nConsolidation continues to be a key theme with our customers. Of course, customers are not willing to compromise on quality and cybersecurity. Given our market leadership in 13 categories, we are fortunate to be engaged in many such conversations. Those conversations are driving business, and many customers are on a long-term transformation path to this. The number of deals we closed over $1 million grew nearly 20% year-over-year, and the value of these transactions grew nearly 60%. Similarly, the number of greater-than-$5-million deals grew 84% and a number of greater-than-$10-million deals grew over 140%. We saw deal values in these cohorts grow significantly. This continued momentum is critical to us being able to drive platform consolidation. Time and again, we see early millionaire customers become an onboarding ramp to help us drive more cybersecurity value to our customers. Almost all of our $10 million deals involve multiple platforms on an underlying transformation that is driving vendor consolidation.\nLet's take a look at some of the ways we are driving consolidation. First, with Zero Trust transformations, we're helping customers standardize their appliance and software firewalls with a broad line of security subscriptions. A life sciences customer signed an 8-figure deal to standardize their operations using our next-generation firewalls, VMs and security subscriptions. In other cases, we're helping customers adopt SASE and software firewalls and consolidate their security stack across our consistent set of offerings, driven by hybrid work and securing SaaS apps.\nA financial service firm recently signed an 8-figure deal with us because they wanted to transform their network and reduce both operational challenges and cost of ownership. They chose us over pure-play SASE competitors because of the breadth of our offering in our comprehensive Zero Trust network.\nSecondly, cloud transformations. We're using our Prisma Cloud and Prisma Access capabilities to help customers adopt hyperscale cloud and Software as a Service. Another financial services firm with a mandate to run over 90% of the apps in the cloud, signed a high 8-figure deal to standardize in both Prisma Access and Prisma Cloud.\nLastly, in cloud transformations, we're using our Cortex platform with XSIAM to help customers transform their security operations center and retool around high-fidelity data sources, AI and automation. A retail company started a relationship with us around Unit 42 incident response with an Expanse trial and small XDR deployment. They expanded the relationship with a high 7-figure deal to standardize on XDR and XSOAR.\nThese strategic customer relationships and transformations would not have been possible without us building a new security industry paradigm, a paradigm around constant innovation. Our success is driven by investments in innovation, and is increasingly clear to us that there is a flywheel at play here. This starts with R&D investment, where we have the largest budget of all dedicated cybersecurity companies, approximately $1 billion in non-GAAP spending on a trailing 4-quarter basis. This is 2x to 5x as much as our pure-play peers. Our scale also allows us to spread this budget across a larger revenue base and the shared needs of our 3 platforms.\nR&D investments then translate into a record number of product releases. Our first half major release is number 35, up 59% from the first half of last year. Some of the key releases in the first half included: our flagship PAN-OS 11.0 Nova; our third advanced subscription, Advanced WildFire; our new AI-based SOC platform, XSIAM; and new modules and updates in Prisma Cloud.\nThis constant innovation is causing industry analysts to take notice. We recently received recognition for leadership in the cloud-native application protection platform category, or CNAPP, bringing our total number of active leadership recognitions to 13, which compares to 9 a year ago.\nAll these leadership positions have helped us grow our NGS ARR at 63%. We still believe there is a large untapped TAM for many of these services given the robust adoption of advanced software services that we have launched, which are all cloud delivered and us being in the early part of the SASE cloud and AI life cycle, we feel confident in our future ability to drive NGS ARR.\nLet's take a deeper look at some of the highlights. I'll start with my personal favorite, our network security business. We launched our first SASE capability, Prisma Access, at the end of fiscal year 2019. In the first year, we booked less than $100 million in business. Over the last 6 quarters, we booked about $1 billion, with our largest deal last quarter being a TCV deal for $40 million for SASE. We now have over 4,000 customers and are growing ARR approximately 50%. In Q2, we saw a healthy number of large competitive wins in SASE, and SASE has one of our strongest pipelines looking 12 months out.\nBeyond the top line traction, we're also seeing improving economics in the business. Two years ago, we showed you how the 5-year revenue from a SASE customer compares to an appliance customer. At that time, SASE was about 2x higher. Since then, we've added additional value to SASE. We launched autonomous digital experience management in FY '22, followed by AIOps and SaaS security posture management this year. AI has the power to transform SASE. Our integrated security services are now all powered by AI to detect and prevent even zero-day attacks. And we'll soon be introducing additional AI-driven capability to transform the user experience when using the platform. We now expect our 5-year revenue from a SASE customer to be more than 2.5x that of an appliance customer. We've also seen some improvements in our SASE gross margins over this period, as we have scaled to become more efficient.\nIf you go to the other side of our network security portfolio, our software firewall business is going strong. This includes the broadest deployment options for customers, including VM-Series and CM-Series, which can run in their data centers or be purchased in the cloud marketplaces and the first-to-market integrated cloud next-generation firewall offerings for hyperscale clouds. We have the highest market share of any company in this market. We believe it's more than 3x of our any closest competitor.\nThe current macro environment is causing more customers to watch their CapEx budget. This shift, along with the fact that customers are transforming the data centers moving to the cloud, is leading more of them to adopt software firewalls. In Q2, the number of deals over $1 million for our software firewall was nearly doubled, and 6 of our top 8 deals in Q2 included software firewalls in our offering.\nMoving on to our cloud security business. We continue to make steady progress with Prisma Cloud. Platform enhancements are important to our growth. We released the new API risk profiling capability to enhance our web application security module. This capability helps security teams assess their API stack surface, attack surface quickly based on more than 200 risk factors, including misconfigurations, exposure to sensitive data and access privileges. This helps teams prioritize the most significant risks and take preventive measures to address them.\nWe also continue to shift left and focus on securing workloads as they are developed, solving our customers' application security channels. To that end, we closed the acquisition of Cider, and have brought their team under common leadership with our cloud code security team to help bring Cider's CICD security capability to our platform.\nAfter releasing cloud core security a year ago, over 15% of our customer base has adopted these capabilities. Our cloud core security customers in Q2 grew 30% over Q1. Our new secret management module launched in December scans code repos used by developers for hard-coded secrets like passwords and API keys to make sure this information is not exposed and used as a vector of attack.\nWe continue to see these new capabilities and enhancements drive an increase in customer module adoption. For example, our customers with 2 or more modules grew over 40%, and customers with 4 or more modules more than doubled. Credit consumption of Prisma Cloud increased 48% year-over-year. This growth is being driven by new customer additions, customers increasing their cloud footprints and customers consuming additional modules. While there has been discussion on moderation and cloud consumption in the market, we believe the relatively early stage of cloud security adoption has and will continue to shelter us from this headwind.\nBefore I move on to Cortex and talk about continuing signs of optimism I see in that category, I feel compelled to take a detour towards AI. Clearly, AI has been on everyone's mind given the continued conversation in the tech industry. Most of you know the story of my arrival at Palo Alto Networks. I talked about fragmentation and the need for a solution there, which we have talked a lot about. I also talked about automation and AI. We counted. I used the word AI more times than my first 6 months at Palo Alto Networks than platform or consolidation. The challenges you all know is that AI has been a data problem and continues to be so. Unlike consumer where we can talk about sonnets and ChatGPT's creative capabilities and the revolution that is going to drive in search or advertising, its ability to summarize data and continue to amuse and inform us, the demands from AI and enterprise are far more exacting and so are the returns.\nAn enterprise AI needs to be clean. It has to have comprehensive data. And in security, especially it needs to be real time. So not only do you need to have the best data to create great security outcomes, you also need to be positioned in line to block threats.\nLet me make a case why with petabytes of data from trillions of events, billions of sessions, hundreds of millions of URLs and tens of millions of flies flowing -- files, not flies -- flowing through our product across cloud, network and endpoints daily, we are best positioned to deliver security outcomes using AI machine learning.\nPalo Alto Networks' next-generation firewalls broke through the firewall industry in the early days because of our ability to then deliver next-generation security. These services were driven by expansive data collection capabilities, EAL, or enhanced application logs. We have since applied that capability across our entire network security stack. We estimate that this network secure data is just under half the valuable security data that is needed for any AI-driven outcome. We have over 60,000 customers where we can help them use this data.\nAs we conceived with Cortex, we built XDR to ensure we collected the best endpoint data across the industry. We acquired and deployed the largest security automation footprint at XSOAR, but we're not stopping there. We then acquired and integrated Expanse, which looked at vulnerability data from a different and unique perspective. These formed the fundamental building blocks for XSIAM. With our leadership position in automation, analytics and attack surface management, again, we're driving an AI-based SOC transformation. With our 4,500 Cortex customers, we're able to bring what we believe is the next largest set of security data that is useful for AI.\nWe applied the same thought and rigor as we built Prisma Cloud, integrating data from all hyperscalers, integrating shift-left data from developers. Slowly and steadily, the Prisma Cloud integration is being built on a stronger foundation of security data. Cloud is becoming an increasingly important contributor to AI, and our 2,000 customers will benefit from it.\nWe have delivered unique AI-based outcomes, including blocking unknown yet malicious websites, command and control domain and files at scale. Also, we have shown in our own security operations center that we can reduce the mean time to detection to seconds and the meantime to respond to minutes. These are all outcomes that cannot be achieved without the data we have and the AI/machine learning expertise we apply.\nLet's take a look into how we believe this has made us more excited and encouraged us around XSIAM. In Q2, as part of the Cortex and XSIAM platform, we released important new capabilities, including SaaS-enabled XSOAR, delivering a cloud-based interface and Expanse active attack surface management, allowing our customers to remediate issues discovered using XSIAM.\nWe launched XSIAM and GA at the end of Q1. So far, we've closed approximately $30 million in business and have a growing pipeline of customers that are looking to transform security operations of the new platform. I think XSIAM is going to pave the way for us to drive AI-driven security transformation outcomes. We will continue to work hard with our early customers to drive evolution and success in XSIAM.\nI'm extremely positive, perhaps, and cautiously optimistic about XSIAM. Its early relevance, product market fit, and with the concurrent discussion on AI, it makes me hopeful that this could be the fastest ramp of any security product. We see our first milestone to getting to $100 million in bookings faster than Cortex SASE or Prisma Cloud in our portfolio.\nBefore I turn the floor to Dipak, I want to put all this together and talk about where we're focused as we enter the second half of our fiscal year and beyond.\nWe see a clear road map ahead of us. We intend to put our head down and execute. Right now, we're in the process of transforming our business to software-based and cloud delivery offerings. Our revenue, which is increasingly driven by our next-generation security capabilities, is becoming more recurring in nature, and we have an opportunity to own a greater share of our customers' cybersecurity budget. This should allow us to sustain high revenue growth for longer.\nOver the last couple of years, we set in motion a plan to expand our operating margins, including driving scale in our faster-growing businesses. Over the last 6 months, we've listened to investors who have encouraged us to focus on profitable growth and accelerate incremental leverage in our business, and we made good progress in Q2. We're now well positioned for the second half of the year. We are appreciably raising our margin target for FY '23 up 200 basis points from our prior guidance and 250 basis points from our initial FY '23 guidance. We believe we can continue to build on this into fiscal year 2024 and beyond, putting us 3 years ahead of our profitability targets we offered at our last Analyst Day in September 2021.\nAs Dipak will describe, we believe the combination of sustaining higher top line growth and focus on efficiency sets up well to build on this base of higher profitability and grow EPS ahead of revenue. I want to emphasize that achieving GAAP profitability is an important milestone for our company. In support of this, we're actively focused on managing our stock-based compensation to continue bringing this down as a percent of our revenue.\nWith that, I'll turn the floor over to Dipak to take you through our details of our results and guidance, and then we'll take questions.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q2, revenue of $1.66 billion grew 26%. Product revenue grew 15%, whilst total service revenue grew 29%, with subscription revenue growing 32% and support revenue growing 25%.\nMoving on to geographies. We saw revenue growth across all theaters, with the Americas growing 22%, EMEA up 35% and JAPAC growing 32%. The strength of our next-generation security capabilities continues to drive our results, with NGS ARR of $2.3 billion, growing 63%. Strength was broad-based across all 3 of our platforms: network security, cloud security and security operations. We delivered total billings of $2.03 billion, up 26% and above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q2 was $7.6 billion, an increase of 39%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $8.8 billion, increasing 39%, with current RPO representing about half of our RPO similar to recent quarters.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share was significantly ahead of our guidance, and this metric as well as our trailing 12 months adjusted free cash flow accelerated. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 grew 81% year-over-year, while trailing 12-month adjusted free cash flow of $2.7 billion grew 76% year-over-year.\nMoving on to the rest of the financial highlights. Non-GAAP gross margin of 75.5% was up 150 basis points year-over-year, driven mainly by an increase in our software mix. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we saw less pressure from incremental costs related to the supply chain. We've made significant progress in driving leverage. This is something that we articulated at our Analyst Day in September 2021 and kicked off in fiscal year '22. And we have accelerated this in fiscal year '23 with a focus on profitable growth as evidenced by our Q2 performance.\nOur operating margin of 22.8% increased 440 basis points year-over-year. This result was driven by improving gross margins and a slower level of headcount additions. We expect to see ongoing improvements in our operational efficiency. And as a result, we are raising our fiscal year '23 operating margin guidance.\nNon-GAAP net income for the second quarter grew 79% to $332 million or $1.05 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. Delivering fiscal year GAAP profitability is another milestone in our balance of driving growth and profitability. For the quarter, GAAP net income was $84 million or $0.28 per basic share and $0.25 per diluted share. This was our third consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. And as Nikesh noted, we have now been profitable on a cumulative basis for the last 4 quarters. We believe we now meet the criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We ended Q2 with cash equivalents and investments of $6.2 billion. Our average duration -- our new contracts increased slightly year-over-year, driven by deals with strategic customers. It remains at approximately 3 years, where it has been historically. Q2 cash flow from operations was $695 million, with total adjusted free cash flow of $685 million this quarter. Our strong free cash flow in Q2 was driven by increased operating profitability, higher interest income and improvement in billings linearity due to improving supply chain conditions.\nDuring Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares at the open market at an average price of approximately $139 per share for a total consideration of $250 million. As a reminder, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, and we are committed to this method of returning cash to shareholders over the medium term.\nStock-based compensation ticked up 20 basis points as a percent of revenue sequentially related to the issuance of our annual grants and the impact from the Cider acquisition. On a year-over-year basis, stock-based compensation was down 350 basis points as a percent of revenue.\nBefore I get to guidance, I wanted to cover my thoughts on operating margin. We have continued to drive improvements in the profitability for our fastest-growing businesses as they have gained scale. Also, over the last 6 months, we have developed and executed on detailed plans to accelerate our operating leverage. This includes raising the bar around the return on investment we expect as well as remaining prudent in our hiring. We've also spent a lot of time looking at our peer group and studying benchmark data. As we look towards the second half of the year and into fiscal year '24, we believe we can continue to execute against our plans and drive higher operating margins. We expect that this will translate into us growing our EPS faster than our revenue growth rates.\nNow moving on to guidance. We're offering guidance for Q3 and also Q4 to make this explicit and then offering updated annual guidance. You'll see we're maintaining our annual revenue guidance and giving explicit guidance for Q3 to Q4 based on what we see in our pipeline for product revenue. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $2.20 billion to $2.25 billion, an increase of 22% to 25%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.695 billion to $1.725 billion, an increase of 22% to 24%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.90 to $0.94, an increase of 50% to 57%. For the fourth quarter of the year, we expect billings to be in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.17 billion, an increase of 16% to 18%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.937 billion to $1.967 billion, an increase of 25% to 27%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22 per share, an increase of 48% to 53%. For the fiscal year, we expect billings to be in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, an increase of 22% to 23%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $2.75 billion to $2.8 billion, an increase of 45% to 48%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.91 billion, an increase of 25% to 26%. We continue to expect product revenue growth in the range of 10% for the full fiscal year. For fiscal year '23, we're expecting our operating margins to be in the range of 21.5% to 22%. And we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.03, an increase of 57% to 60%. We expect our adjusted free cash flow margin to be between 36.5% to 37.5%, and we expect to be GAAP-profitable each quarter and for the fiscal year 2023.\nAdditionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q3 and fiscal year '23, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q3 and Q4, we expect net interest income -- net interest and other income of $45 million to $49 million. We expect Q3 diluted shares outstanding of 321 million to 327 million shares. We expect Q4 diluted shares outstanding of 326 million to 332 million. We expect fiscal year '23 diluted shares outstanding of 320 million to 326 million. We expect Q3 capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million, with full year capital expenditures of $165 million to $170 million.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A part of the call.",

Good afternoon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. As you can see, we had a solid first quarter where we showed balanced top line growth and a demonstrable focus on profitability. Early in the quarter, we saw some customer behavior changes and have adapted our operations to align with the changing market conditions.\nOn the top line, billings grew 27% year-over-year, while RPO grew 38%. We have consistently maintained that cybersecurity is the most innovative sector of the technology industry. Demonstrate progress on our transformation, we have shared how our new cloud-delivered and cloud-enabled offerings are contributing to our business via our NGS ARR. In that context, this quarter, our NGS ARR hit a key milestone. It crossed the $2 billion mark and grew 67% year-over-year.\nAs the macroeconomic environment changes, we are accelerating our efforts to drive incremental operating leverage in our business. Given that we're the largest independent cybersecurity business, we can meaningfully improve our margins over the next phase of our company's next cycle. Our focus on profitability in the quarter drove operating income growth of 44% year-over-year, with operating margins up 260 basis points during the same period. We also generated over $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. For the second quarter in a row, we generated net income on a GAAP basis as we focus on GAAP profitability for the fiscal year.\nAt the center of our strategies, the need to drive consolidation to get customers to a better security posture. Towards that end, we continue to see large cross-platform buys and grow our millionaire customers at a steady clip. Our customers have been in a journey with us, initial deals that give them comfort with our products and help distinguish our abilities from our competition, over time, lead to customers seeing an opportunity to consolidate into one of our platforms. As they get comfortable with either Strata, Prisma or Cortex, we see them looking at further consolidation across multiple platforms from us. This strategy has allowed us to continue to transition our deal sizes with satisfied customers, and we expect this to continue.\nConsistent with that approach, we have had some marquee deals this quarter. The U.S. federal government agency chose our Cortex technology. This transaction allows the total spend to grow into 9 figures, with additional years in customer option. This selection highlights unique capabilities and market leadership of our Expanse technology, which was at the center of this transaction. We received the purchase order for the first 3 years of the deal for over $60 million in Q1.\nA large U.S. utility signed a 7-figure deal for software firewalls, security subscription in Prisma Cloud. The customer has hundreds of appliance-based firewalls, and chose our software firewalls because of our consistent architecture, and chose Prisma Cloud as a standardized security across 4 public clouds. A major European media company signed an 8-figure multiproduct deal, replacing several incumbent network security vendors and consolidating on Palo Alto Networks, including our full line of cloud-delivered security subscriptions.\nWe closed a 7-figure deal with a U.S. technology company, spanning all 3 platforms. The customer did not have our physical firewalls in their environment but valued our consistency of software firewall deployment across on-premise and cloud, our unique Expanse offering and the total cost of ownership benefits of consolidating on our platforms. You can see evidence of our broader success with large customer commitments in our active millionaire customer count where we added over 230 year-over-year in the first quarter.\nWe continue to innovate across our platforms and get recognized by the market for our abilities. This quarter saw us launch software composition analysis in Prisma Cloud, SaaS security posture management in SASE, and just this week, across our next-generation firewalls. Lastly, we announced the general availability of XSIAM in Cortex. External recognition of our innovation is important to us as many customers rely on this third-party validation as a part of their evaluation process. This quarter, we received leadership recognition in 2 new categories, adding cloud security posture management, or CSPM; and cloud-native application protection platform, or CNAPP, to our list.\nLet's take a deeper look at our 3 platforms. We have continued to see solid growth in our network security business. Our innovations in the appliance firewall form factor, including our Gen 4 refresh and our investments in the virtual form factor, have continued to drive our share of gains. On a year-over-year basis, we have gained approximately 3 percentage points of market share in the appliance market and 7 percentage points in the VM market. Our customers see an opportunity to drive standardization and make decisions to move away from competitors that have not kept up with our pace of innovation.\nWe also see many customers extending the standardization to SASE. Many are in the relatively early stages of executing SASE, given it involves changes to their security network architectures. Our Prisma SASE offering has gained industry recognition, and we've seen an increasing number of wins within our installed base as well as with new customers. To put this into perspective, our firewall customer base is over 15x larger than our SASE customer base. With our core sellers now enabled and executing and driving SASE into the installed base, SASE continues to represent our largest pipeline.\nConsolidation of network security capabilities of our customers is driving attached subscription into our installed base across all firewall form factors. Our constant innovation and capability expansion in network security has been a hallmark of our platform since we entered the market over 15 years ago. While we have highlighted the number of new subscriptions we offer, we have also reimagined our existing capabilities. Our advanced URL filtering and threat prevention versions leverage deep learning to block evasive, zero-day unknown attacks in real time. Yesterday, we introduced the advanced version of WildFire to stop more zero-day cloud attacks as part of our PAN-OS 11.0 Nova release. The new subscriptions provide significant additional value to our installed base and have already seen promising adoption.\nMoving on to Prisma Cloud. Prisma Cloud continues to be the industry's leading CNAPP platform, built from best-in-class acquisition and organic innovation. We acquired Bridgecrew 18 months ago to shift left and introduced the Cloud Code Security module, with Infrastructure as Code scanning. Building on this, released our SCA, or Software Composition Analysis solution in Q1. The integration of SCA with the Prisma Cloud platform, enables developers and security teams to prioritize known vulnerabilities that impact the application life cycle proactively. We have seen hundreds of Prisma Cloud customers use our IaC and SCA capabilities as part of our Cloud Code Security module.\nWe continue to see Prisma Cloud customers increase their credit consumption as they expand their hyperscaler footprint and adopt more of our 9 modules such as Cloud Code. Half of our Prisma Cloud customers are using 2 or more modules, and nearly 20% are using 4 or more modules. In Q1, our credit consumption grew 55% year-over-year.\nBuilding further upon our success, shifting left to the IaC Security and SCA adoption, we're doubling down on investing in software supply chain security. Today, we announced our intent to acquire Cider Security, which is key to the strategy. Cider brings the ability to visualize customers' application development and deployment environment, analyze the tools, identify risks and how to remediate them. This ability to secure the software supply chain is backed up by Cider's leading CI/CD security research team. With the integration of Cider's capabilities into Prisma Cloud after the closing of the acquisition, we will further our leadership in cloud security, helping enterprises secure applications from code to cloud.\nAcross Cortex, we are focused on driving momentum in a number of areas. The first key is ensuring we are winning customers with our best-of-breed product capability. In Q1, we saw strong Cortex large deal performance. We had success not only with XDR, XSOAR and Expanse on a stand-alone basis, but a number of notable examples are multiproduct deals. This included a multimillion dollar transaction at a European construction company, which replaced their existing SIEM and SOAR with XDR Pro and XSOAR. One of the government customer adopted XDR Pro and XSOAR in a 7-figure deal as it formalized a new SOC for multiple agencies. These are in addition to the federal customer we already talked about.\nWe continued to innovate across Cortex during Q1, delivering a new managed detection and response service built on our XDR capability and enriched by our Unit 42 world-class threat intelligence. I'm most excited about the general availability of XSIAM, our breakthrough autonomous security operations platform. Our launch events for XSIAM were oversubscribed, and we see a lot of resonance with our product and its future road map as customers reimagine the world of SOC management.\nJust a few months ago, we had launched the Design Partner Program. Most recently, we've had 2 multimillion-dollar commitments from XSIAM Design Partners as they expanded into production deployments. At this point, the majority of our design customers have transitioned to paying customers. In fact, we are carefully managing how we onboard future XSIAM customers because we want to ensure fast customer time to value. Our interest list is north of 50 customers who would like us to deploy XSIAM. We're qualifying them and carefully onboarding them so that we can scale the business appropriately and give them value.\nIn summary, I feel our teams did a good job in a seasonally tough quarter, where also the macroeconomic climate is fast changing. I'm sure all of you are trying to figure out what all of this means for us over the next 3 quarters.\nAs we all know, the Fed is working to tame inflation impacting growth. While cybersecurity is somewhat resilient, we do see some marginal signs of impact. Cybersecurity deals are getting more scrutiny, suggesting deeper and longer reviews of transformational projects. New conversations that include payment terms, the discounts are causing deal cycles to elongate.\nOn a positive front, while some deals have been side down and broken to phases, we are experiencing few deal cancellations. We do expect this behavior to become the norm over the next year. The impact is not uniform across all sectors, but those feeling the impact of interest rate increases are more likely to scrutinize their budgets than those prospering in the high interest rate environment. Technology, CPG and some parts of retail are feeling an impact, while utilities, oil and gas, defense and public sector verticals continue to be on course with their plans.\nComing off Q4, Q1 tends to be a seasonally more challenging quarter, but we were able to tame some of these early trends by doubling down on execution. FY '23 will require continued excellent execution to overcome some of these macro impacts.\nTowards that end, we have already taken concrete action. We have front-loaded hiring of our field teams to increase coverage across our customer base. We have also expanded our level of activity around both new accounts and existing customers to ensure faster time to value with our products.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we have seen some customers delay hardware refresh plans. While they will ultimately need to refresh, some are choosing to defer and reassess at a later date. I continue to believe that hardware will have a long-term industry growth rate in the 5% to 8% range, and we might trend to the lower end of the range. However, coupled with an easing supply chain, I expect that near term, we'll continue to report a low double-digit growth rate for product revenue.\nToo many vendors leads to complexity and increased risk. Given the increased scrutiny and return requirements, the silver lining for Palo Alto Networks is that we are having more conversations around consolidating platforms than we've ever had before. We think customers are less likely to purchase newer security products. Instead, they will continue to consolidate towards like-for-like capabilities from fewer vendors.\nCybersecurity is critical to IT transformation and hyperscaler adoption. We believe that whilst there may be short-term bumps to the pace of investment by some of the customers, these projects will continue for the medium and long term. We see cybersecurity spending as resilient but not immune to customers adjusting for the current environment. Having said that, I continue to believe that we can overcome these macroeconomic impacts with strong and focused execution, which is what we plan to do.\nIt was just 6 to 9 months ago that we were talking about the challenges we face in the competition for talent. We're now finding it easier to recruit and hire top talent, but also seeing lower attrition rates, which necessitates fewer overall new hires. We will closely monitor our hiring as well as our overall spending to further sharpen our focus on efficiency.\nAs we proceed through the year and focus internally how we respond to the external landscape, sharp execution from our teams will be paramount.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dipak, I want to provide some perspectives on how we're thinking about the forecast. We are adjusting the high end of our guidance ranges for revenue billings for the year for the upside we saw in Q1. Within our revenue, we do expect slightly higher product revenue growth in the range of 10-plus percent as we are able to ship some orders that had previously been held back by the more challenging supply chain situation I mentioned earlier.\nWe're also reflecting the strength we saw in NGS ARR during Q1, with higher NGS ARR guidance range for the year. This reflects not only the performance of our Cortex Prisma Cloud SASE and software firewalls, but also the success we have seen in advanced cloud-delivered subscriptions that I noted.\nOn a positive note, we're focusing more and more on execution and how our teams focus on driving incremental operating leverage. Towards that end, we were able to take steps to accelerate the profitability we previously outlined at our Analyst Day, which was reflected in our Q1 operating margin and EPS performance. We will remain focused here. And as a result, we're raising our operating margin guidance for the year by 50 basis points. This, as well as higher interest income, is driving the increase to our EPS and cash flow guidance as Dipak will cover.\nOver the last 3 years on a compounded basis, our EPS and adjusted free cash flow have grown below our revenue growth rate as we made significant investments. We are now targeting EPS and adjusted free cash flow to both grow north of 30% at our guidance midpoint, which is ahead of our revenue growth.\nWe are confident in our strategy and wouldn't trade our position with any other cybersecurity company. We believe our broad portfolio focus as an advantage as we focus on emerging areas where customers are allocating new budget dollars, while also capturing an increased portion of the customers broader cybersecurity budget as they look to consolidate spending. We will continue to invest for the long term with our commitment to fund innovation, while we also pursue near-term opportunities to drive efficiencies in our business.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Dipak.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. For Q1, revenue of $1.56 billion grew 25% and was above the high end of our guidance range. Product grew 12%, and total services grew by 30%. By geography, we saw growth across all theaters, with EMEA up 32%, the Americas growing 24% and JPAC growing 26%. Our next-generation security capabilities are increasingly driving our results, and our NGS ARR grew 67% and at $2.11 billion exceeded $2 billion for the first time. We continue to see strength driven by our broad portfolio within next-generation security. This includes Cortex, Prisma Cloud, Prisma SASE, software firewalls and the advanced versions of cloud-delivered subscriptions. We remain optimistic about the prospects of this broad and diverse portfolio.\nWe delivered total billings of $1.75 billion, up 27%, which was above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q1 was $7.2 billion, an increase of 39%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $8.3 billion, increasing 38%, with current RPO representing about half of our RPO, similar to previous quarters.\nMoving beyond the top line metrics. I already highlighted non-GAAP gross margin of 74.3% was down 10 basis points year-over-year, with some incremental supply chain-related expenses being incurred for components and shipping.\nOperating margin was 20.6%, an increase of 260 basis points year-over-year. This strength in operating margin was the result of lower expenses as a percent of revenue across all 3 expense lines, R&D, sales and marketing and G&A. We have already focused on aligning our investment plans to the areas of highest return. And thus, as we proceed through this environment, it is sharpening of these efforts.\nNon-GAAP net income for the first quarter grew 56% to $266 million or $0.83 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. GAAP net income was $20 million or $0.07 per basic share and $0.06 per diluted share.\nNow turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Our balance sheet is strong, closing Q1 with the highest cash and investable balance ever with cash equivalents and investments of $5.9 billion. We have ample flexibility to repay debt coming due, invest in the business, do tuck-in acquisitions and return capital to shareholders. We're in the enviable position to be able to do all of these at the same time.\nQ1 cash flow from operations was $1.24 billion. We generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow for the first time in our history, with total free cash flow of $1.2 billion this quarter. This puts us well on track to hit our annual guidance, which we are raising today. This cash flow performance was largely driven by strong collections in the quarter, that we expected based on the strength of our business in Q4. During Q1, we did not repurchase any of our shares. As a reminder, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, and we're committed to this method of returning cash to shareholders over the medium term.\nAs Nikesh discussed, on the M&A front, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Cider Security for approximately $195 million in cash, excluding the value of replacement equity awards, subject to adjustments. We expect this deal to close in the fiscal second quarter. We expect the financial impact of the transaction to be immaterial to our fiscal '23 guidance.\nStock-based compensation ticked up slightly as a percentage of revenue quarter-over-quarter, as expected, with the issuance of a portion of our fiscal year '23 grants. On a year-over-year basis, we continue to manage our SBC down as a percent of revenue, in line with our long-term plans. As we've had a number of questions about the impact of foreign exchange volatility on our business, I wanted to remind investors that we price our products in dollars around the world and therefore are not exposed to the direct translation impact to revenue that you may be hearing about from other companies.\nNow moving on to our guidance for Q2 and for the year. For the second fiscal quarter of 2023, we expect billings to be in the range of $1.94 billion to $1.99 billion, an increase of 21% to 24%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.66 billion, an increase of 24% to 26%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.78, an increase of 31% to 35%.\nFor the fiscal year, we expect billings to be in the range of $8.95 billion to $9.1 billion, an increase of 20% to 22%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion, an increase of 40% to 43%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.91 billion, an increase of 25% to 26%. We expect product revenue growth in the range of 10%, up slightly, as Nikesh outlined in his remarks. We expect fiscal '23 operating margins to be in the range of 19.5% to 20%, up 50 basis points versus the range we outlined coming into the year.\nWe expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.37 to $3.40, an increase of 34% to 37%. We expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 34.5% to $35.5%, and we continue to expect to be GAAP profitable for fiscal year 2023.\nAdditionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q2 and fiscal '23, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q2 '23, we expect net interest and other income of $18 million to $20 million. We expect Q2 '23 diluted shares outstanding of 320 million to 326 million shares. We expect fiscal year '23 diluted shares outstanding of 325 million to 331 million. We expect Q2 capital expenditures of $40 million to $45 million, and we expect fiscal year capital expenditures of $190 million, $200 million.\nAs an additional modeling support based on our prior seasonality, we expect the quarter-over-quarter revenue and billings growth for Q3 '23 to be in line with last year. Also, we expect operating income in Q3 to be roughly flat with our Q2 levels.\nTo wrap up, we are confident in our strategy and wouldn't trade our position with any other cybersecurity company. We're focused on sharp execution and sales intensity to stay ahead of the changing macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we're focused on taking steps to accelerate our profitability, as I guided.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call.\nAs you can see from the video, we were excited to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our IPO in early July. Our employees are engaged and excited as we continue confidently on our mission to be the cybersecurity partner of choice.\nMoving to Q4, I'm pleased to report that we again saw very strong results, starting with top line results that were well ahead of guidance we initially outlined for the fiscal year '22. We delivered this growth while balancing our profitability commitments. We also made significant investments to continue to transform our company and take advantage of the large and rapidly growing market opportunity we see in cybersecurity.\nOn the top line, billings growth of 44% was the highest we've reported in 4 years. We also grew RPO ahead of our revenue growth rate. The key focus of our team has been rapidly positioning us as a constant cybersecurity innovator. And one way we measure our progress is how our NGS ARR develops. We're delighted to report this metric grew 60%, reaching $1.9 billion exiting the year. We are expecting it to reach $2.6 billion in FY '23. If this was an independent start-up, it would be amongst the fastest-growing cybersecurity businesses to achieve scale.\nWithin our core network security business, Firewall as a Platform, billings grew 26%. When we started reporting this metric, the intent was always to show that we continue to take share in the network security market. At the same time, transform the business to a software business. Today, close to 50% of that comes from software form factors. Operating income grew 52% in Q4 and our operating margin for the year finished to the high end of the guidance range, with adjusted free cash flow margin coming in above the high end of the range we provided. We achieved a major internal goal we've had on the profitability front, delivering GAAP profitability this quarter. Looking forward, we're guiding to full year GAAP profitability in fiscal 2023.\nWe've had many of you asked us about the macro environment and how is it impacting our business and the markets we serve. In the last year, we arguably saw the most challenging supply chain conditions the technology industry has ever seen. We executed through this well during the year with modest impacts to our gross margins. We expect conditions will eventually ease. For our planning, we're assuming a material improvement won't be seen prior to the end of fiscal year '23. However, as the supply challenges fade, we expect this will start to have a favorable impact on our product gross margins.\nThere's a continuing debate on inflation, it's nature and duration. We saw some labor and other inflationary pressures in the second half of the fiscal year. We do not anticipate these pressures going away in the next fiscal year and we have planned for it to persist through fiscal year '23. And hence, it is included in our plan and is reflected in our guidance.\nWith respect to the macro impact on demand, we've just come out of Q4 with exceptional 44% billings growth. In enterprise sales, as most of you know, there is Q4 magic. We did, however, see some marginal changes in the macro environment in Q4. Whilst early, it is important to see how the overall macroeconomic conditions develop over the next year.\nFirst, we saw more longer duration deals as customers increasingly have the confidence to make large long-term commitments with us. This is important to the transformation objectives we set out for Palo Alto Networks. It confirms and validates our view that customers will consolidate if we give them constant best-of-breed products and ensure that they are integrated to deliver better security outcomes.\nSecond, we saw some isolated instances of customers extending the life of hardware potentially driven by macro forces. We expect that on the margin. This could continue into FY '23. It is counterbalanced by some customers refreshing their state and our continued share gains in the hardware form factor.\nThird, in transformational projects, the vast majority of our customers continue on their investments here despite the expected short-term macro impacts. Security spending is tied into our customers' desires to move to the cloud, drive more direct relationship with their customers, modernize their IT infrastructure as well as drive efficiencies while adapting to a new way of working. Those efforts continue. Coupled with a heightened awareness and need to do something around cybersecurity, we expect secular tailwinds to persist in cybersecurity, and we are best positioned to deliver against our customer needs.\nAnother trend I would like to highlight is the return to Palo Alto Networks by employees who had left for seemingly greener pastures. Over a 6-month period, as part of our Welcome Home program, we have engaged with many former employees. To date, dozens of top performers have been rehired with many more in the funnel. Over 70% of of people reached out to have expressed a desire to come back to us and a significant number already have. 50% are returning from start-ups, the next largest percentage coming from peer companies. We're happy to welcome these employees back to Palo Alto Networks.\nAs we embark on new fiscal year, my fifth as Palo Alto Networks CEO, is worth reflecting where we came from. Our transformation strategy has not been easy, but we are unwavering in our resolve to build the most comprehensive and relevant offerings for our customers, taking away their complexity and delivering a better security outcome for them. We see a path to being the largest cybersecurity company backed by constant innovation and excellent execution becoming our customers' cybersecurity partner of choice while delivering increasing value to our shareholders.\nJust 4 years ago, we were a different company. We have reinvented the firewall market and captured the market share leadership position. There were glimmers of our next-generation security strategy, but it made up just 8% of our billings. Our software story in network and security was early, with some traction in our virtual firewalls and a fledgling precursor to SASE called GlobalProtect Cloud Services. We made our first acquisition in cloud native security and had early point products that will become part of Cortex.\nWhen we step back and took stock in the industry, we had a key hypothesis, which we then tested, proved to ourselves and have reproduced across the business today. There has not previously been a cybersecurity company with a leadership position in multiple categories. Now the customers believe that our cybersecurity platform could anchor their architecture. We set out on this ambitious journey as you see at Prisma Cloud and Cortex as well as innovated significantly in our network security capabilities.\nFast forward to today, our transformation has taken us far. We are a recognized leader in 11 cybersecurity categories across our 3 platforms. Next-generation security contributed more than 38% of our billings, helping to accelerate our growth. In network security, we now have the most comprehensive solution across 3 form factors that share a common architecture and also offer a suite of market-leading security subscriptions. We have built, assembled and integrated capabilities in 9 modules that make up Prisma Cloud, which is now the leader in cloud native security. Lastly, we have 3 anchor products in Cortex, which with our new XSIAM product showing promise in the revolutionized security operations is going to hold us in good stead.\nThe proof that this transformation is working is in the momentum we are seeing in our customers. The number of customers that spend over $1 million annually with us continues to grow, with the millionaire count now in excess of 1,200 and the number of Global 2000 customers that have purchased products in all 3 of our platforms is now 50%.\nWhile we've had many large customer wins recently, I want to highlight a team in 3 transactions. The first is a technology company that purchased products in all 3 of our platforms in a transaction over $75 million of value. The second is a financial service company that standardized its network security in our platform, including adding VMs and deploying Prisma Cloud spending north of $40 million. And third is a professional services company that spent over $75 million across Strata, Prisma and Cortex.\nOne of the outcomes from our transformation over the past 4 years is a steady increase in our subscription and support mix primarily driven by the growth of our next-generation security business. Subscription support now exceed 80% of our billings. This has resulted in greater predictability in our revenues. We have seen growing commitments from our customers represent a greater portion of our next year's revenue. As we enter fiscal year '23, that number is 59% at the midpoint of our guidance.\nIncreasing revenue visibility gives us further confidence in our ability to invest and drive future growth. This number is over 70% for the revenue we expect in Q1. All of this has occurred while our revenue growth has accelerated from FY '20 to FY '22, in part due to the accelerated growth in our next-generation security offerings, while we have also taken share in traditional network security appliance form factors as reported by third parties.\nDespite the success so far in our transformation, we still see significant potential ahead of us. We estimate our large addressable market to be growing at a rate of 14%. At 29%, our fiscal year '22 revenue growth more than doubled this market growth rate. As we have transformed the business, we have seen our revenue growth reaccelerate. Even with this significant growth over the last 4 years, we still only represent approximately 6% of our TAM we last presented at our Analyst Day in September 2021. 6% share of the market is low for the market leader as compared to other categories and technology. So we see there is ample room to grow.\nThere are numerous trends that excite us around our ability to drive this growth and continue our share gains. You may soon see a day where there will be $1 trillion in public cloud consumed. Our observation thus far in this early market is that companies allocate 2% to 5% of the cloud budgeted security, creating a significant Prisma Cloud opportunity.\nThere are 3.5 million worldwide cybersecurity jobs that are unfulfilled. Our view is that more training and hiring alone will not effectively and efficiently counter the growing use of automation employed in attacks and the volume of alerts that is overwhelming the security operations center. We believe a new paradigm and security ops is needed that heavily leverages AI and automation. We are targeting this opportunity with our Cortex products and XSIAM products specifically. Lastly, hybrid work is here to stay. There are more than 1 billion knowledge workers globally. We believe we have a strong position in SASE with our coverage of users and branch offices today, just catching the surface of loss opportunity. We have a clear mission in front of us in each of our security platforms to harness the opportunity that we have outlined.\nAs this is Q4, I figured, rather than having me outline all the accomplishments from our product team, I would invite Lee Klarich, who patiently listens and sits in our calls, to give you a more detailed update to help you understand how we will continue to build on our success we had in FY '22.\n\nLee Klarich\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Product Officer, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh.\nAs Nikesh highlighted, across cybersecurity, one of the biggest challenges has always been the overwhelming number of point products that customers must deploy, integrate and operationalize to achieve the security they need. In most cases, this has never fully achieved, leading to expensive yet suboptimal security outcomes. We are bringing a new approach, one that delivers market-leading capabilities tightly integrated in 3 platforms.\nFY '22 has been a significant year for us in network security, where we have furthered our position delivering a consistent security architecture across hardware, software and SASE. We neared completion of our Gen 4 hardware rollout, which on some models delivers close to 10x performance over Gen 3. As a result, we saw over 50% of NGFW hardware sales in Q4 on Gen 4.\nAlso in FY '22, we introduced the cloud NGFW across 3 of the major clouds, enabling our customers to adopt best-in-class network security in a cloud native service. And Prisma SASE had 3 major launches in FY '22, including the most recent ZTNA 2.0 launch, firmly establishing our next-gen approach to Zero Trust.\nAcross our hardware, software and SASE form factors, we are able to deliver a consistent set of core security capabilities as ML-powered cloud services. In FY '22, we saw the rapid adoption of advanced URL filtering, and we now see nearly all URL filtering sales on this advanced ML-based service. Advanced Threat Prevention, which was introduced in fiscal Q3, is also now off to a strong start. And perhaps most importantly, customers can manage all form factors and security subscriptions from a single management console to deliver consistent user experience and tremendous operational leverage.\nWhile we believe the full platform is where customers will end up, we want to ensure customers can start their adoption with any form factor and receive a truly best-in-class solution. The number of $1 million lifetime value SASE customers that are also customers of our 2 other network security form factors ended FY '22 at 210. This is up eightfold since FY '19.\nWe have 7 customers that have purchased all 3 of our form factors with $100 million in lifetime value in network security. More broadly, when we look at our network security customer base, customers that have bought all 3 platforms from us spend 10x more than those who are customers of only 1 form factor. This showcases the true value of our network security platform.\nIn Q4, we introduced ZTNA 2.0, which redefines state-of-the-art and Zero Trust network access to bring uncompromised security and deliver 0 trust with 0 exceptions. We have seen significant momentum in our customer traction on SASE in FY '22 on a number of fronts. Our overall active SASE customer base grew by 51% in Q4, and our $1 million SASE deals also accelerated this year, up 83% with over 50 $1 million deals in Q4 alone.\nWhile many of these large deals are coming from our installed base as they see the value across our form factors, it is equally important that over 30% of our new SASE customers in Q4 were new to Palo Alto Networks. This highlights the competitiveness of our SASE solution and enables us to reach net new customers. Additionally, once we land with the new SASE customer, we are seeing customers look to standardize on our hardware and software appliances.\nIn the cloud, we see that most customers are still relatively early in their journey. They are migrating workloads to the cloud and building new applications, growing their footprints, consuming more sophisticated services and adopting multiple clouds. With this has come an expansion in their cloud security needs. Our approach with Prisma Cloud delivers a comprehensive platform with a growing set of capabilities to stay ahead of our customers' needs.\nIncreasingly, cloud security needs to start at the moment, developers write their first lines of code through to deploying and running this code in public cloud. The acquisition of Bridgecrew brought us infrastructure [as] code, a way of detecting and fixing security issues during development. IAC became our ninth integrated module of Prisma Cloud at the end of January. And in the first 6 months of availability, we already have over 200 customers, making it our fastest-growing new module.\nWe designed an incredibly easy way for our customers to activate any of the 9 modules and have grown the number of customers that use more than 3 modules to over 1/3 and those using 4 modules to nearly 20%. This frictionless module adoption has helped to fuel our 55% growth in credits consumed on the platform. We are also closing in on 2,000 customers for Prisma Cloud.\nIt's great to see all the third-party recognition like the SC award as Best Cloud Workload Protection Solution that we announced today, but we're not done yet. We see several opportunities for new modules and we'll continue to look at both organic development and external technology to drive continued expansion of the Prisma Cloud platform.\nWe are earlier in our Cortex platform journey, executing well across our 3 core product categories of XDR, security orchestration and automation, and attack surface management. We saw significant progress in FY '22 as we drove sales of our key products and increased traction, combining offerings in larger cross Cortex transactions. Our customer count surpassed 4,000, and we also signed 52 transactions greater than $1 million in Q4. Combined with this customer success, we also continued the rapid innovation that we believe will be required to be a leader in security operations more holistically.\nWhen we envision the future of cybersecurity, I don't see a path to success that is not heavily driven by AI and automation. Attackers are too well funded and determined while customer networks, clouds, applications and users are too complex to manually defend. The only way to deliver meaningful security outcomes is by collecting rich useful data normalizing all data sources to a single source of truth and then applying AI models to detect attacks and automate responses in real time.\nWe are now taking this to the next level. Earlier this year, we announced XSIAM, a fully integrated AI-driven SOC platform and kicked off a program with a limited number of design partners to ensure we had strong product market fit. The results of this design partner program are incredibly encouraging, proving our assumptions about the value of good quality data powering AI-based attack detection and native automation simplifying and speeding response. And I'm happy to say our first paid customer was a 7-figure purchase and most of the other design partners are likely to purchase in the coming months. We are on track to launch the product into a broader set of our customers in the first half of fiscal '23.\nWe could not have accomplished all we have in the last several years in advancing our lead in network security, standing up our cloud-native security platform and progressing towards the autonomous stock without our investments in innovation. Over the last several years, our R&D spending has grown in order to enable our ambition to lead with the 3 platforms. You see this in major product releases, which reached nearly 50 in FY '22.\nAs we move into FY '23, we are more committed than ever to leading in cybersecurity innovation. My team went through a rigorous process of prioritizing our most important investment areas across our 3 platforms. With the continued investment in R&D, I'm confident we're set up to deliver a great set of innovations in the coming year with focus on the most important areas for our success.\nWith that, I'll pass it back to Nikesh.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nChairman & CEO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lee. Before I wrap up and pass it to Dipak, I want to provide you with a high-level overview of how we are thinking about our financial targets in FY '23.\nI highlighted the strong drivers at play, including technology sector forces as well as drivers within cybersecurity. Lee just talked to you about all the innovation we have underway. We continue to have confidence in our team's execution and the traction we're seeing across our platforms. We expect to continue to deliver strong results, in line with the profile we have talked about for the last year since our Analyst Day.\nFor fiscal year 2023, this includes billings growth of 20% to 21% and revenue growth with increasing predictability that is in the mid-20s. After achieving operating margins at the high end of our guidance in fiscal year '22, we intend to deliver operating margin expansion of 50 basis points to the high end of our guidance, with adjusted free cash flow margins of over 100 basis points at the high end of our guidance while absorbing increased supply chain costs and inflationary impacts. We achieved GAAP profitability in Q4 fiscal year '22 and we project this will continue for fiscal year '23.\nLastly, today, we also announced a 3-for-1 stock split. This was done to help ensure our shares are accessible to all employees and investors. The stock split also demonstrates our belief in the future of the company and the momentum and confidence we have in our strategy.\nWith that, I will pass on to Dipak to discuss our Q4 results in more detail as well as our Q1 and fiscal year '23 guidance.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone.\nToday, we again reported another strong quarter, which culminates in a strong fiscal year for Palo Alto Networks. For Q4, revenue of $1.55 billion grew 27% and was at the high end of our guidance range. Products grew 20% and total services grew by 30%. By geography, we saw strong growth across all theaters with EMEA up 33%, the Americas growing 26% and JAPAC growing 24%.\nNext-Generation Security ARR grew 60% to $1.89 billion with strength across the portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we delivered total billings of $2.69 billion, up 44%, which was above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q4 was $6.99 billion, an increase of 39%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $8.2 billion increasing 40% with current RPO representing about half of our RPO similar to recent quarters.\nWith nearly all of our hardware products now refreshed, as Lee had mentioned, over 50% of our Q4 product orders were booked with Generation 4. Customer reception has been positive, with the majority of customers still in the early phases of their upgrade. Our Firewall as a Platform billings grew 26%. We also continue to see an increasing software mix within our FWaaP billings, up 2 points to 48% in Q4.\nMoving beyond the top line metrics I've already highlighted, non-GAAP gross margin of 73.2% was down 210 basis points year-over-year as we continue to incur additional expense for components and shipping. We expect this headwind to persist through much of fiscal year '23. Last Q4, we guided for a fiscal '22 operating margin of 18.5% to 19%. We're pleased to have achieved the high end of our goal by delivering 19% operating margin for fiscal year '22, while absorbing higher-than-expected supply chain costs. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter grew 57% to $254 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%, GAAP net income was $3 million or $0.03 per basic and diluted share.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We finished Q4 with cash, equivalents and investments of $4.69 billion. Days' sales outstanding was 98 days, several days above where it would have landed without the impact of late quarter shipments. Our discounts continue to be in line with what we have seen over the last year. Q4 cash flow from operations was $524 million. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $485 million. We achieved 33.3% adjusted free cash flow margins for the year, above the high end of our 32% to 33% guide for fiscal year '22.\nDuring Q4, we repurchased approximately 755,000 shares on the open market at an average price of approximately $483 per share for a total consideration of $365 million. Additionally, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $915 million for share repurchase, refreshing our authorization for future share repurchases back to $1 billion expiring December 31, 2023.\nOn the M&A front, we closed 1 very small acquisition in Q4. We reduced our stock-based compensation as a percent of revenue by approximately 3% year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. SBC will remain a focus area in fiscal '23 as we balance the use of SBC to attract and retain top cybersecurity talent with scale leverage we expect in this area.\nLastly, moving to guidance and modeling points. It is worth noting that in fiscal '22, we have flexibility built into our plans that allowed us to execute through some real-time developments during the year, such as supply chain and labor inflation. We've used the same approach in building our fiscal year '23 plans, incorporating a degree of flexibility of outcomes. It's also worth noting that we saw a very strong Q4 business activity. In some cases, this was from customers taking advantage of ordering hardware and especially subscriptions ahead of a price increase that took effect on August 1. We also saw some customers make large commitments in the fourth quarter that might have otherwise happened in fiscal year '23. As you think about next year, note that in the second half of fiscal '22, we have very strong billings with some benefit from an increase in invoicing of multiyear contracts for a few large customers. In Q4, without this impact, our billings would have been in the mid to high 30s.\nTurning to our guidance for the fiscal quarter of 2023. We expect billings to be in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.70 billion, an increase of 22% to 23%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.535 billion to $1.555 billion, an increase of 23% to 25%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.06.\nFor the fiscal year '23, we expect billings to be in the range of $8.95 billion to $9.05 billion, an increase of 20% to 21%. We expect NGS ARR to be in the range of $2.60 billion to $2.65 billion, an increase of 37% to 40%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $6.85 billion to $6.9 billion, an increase of 25%. We expect product revenue to be in the mid to high single-digit percent range year-over-year. We expect fiscal '23 operating margins to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, which is 50 basis points ahead of the range we provided at our fiscal -- for fiscal '22 and consistent with the growth targets we presented to our fiscal -- during our fiscal year '21 Analyst Day. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $9.40 to $9.50. We expect adjusted free cash flow margin to be 33.5% to 34.5%, and we expect to be GAAP profitable for fiscal year 2023.\nRegarding our fiscal year '24 financial targets, which we outlined at our September 21 Analyst Day, we have strong confidence in achieving those objectives and we hope you take away from our call today some of the reasons behind this confidence.\nAdditionally, please consider the following modeling points. We expect approximately 42% of our operating income to come in the first half of the fiscal year and approximately 58% in the second half. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q1 fiscal year '23, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q1 '23, we expect net interest and other income of $6 million to $8 million. We expect Q1 '23 diluted shares outstanding of 108 million to 110 million shares. We expect fiscal year '23 diluted shares outstanding of 111 million to 113 million shares. We expect our Q1 capital expenditures of $35 million to $40 million. And we expect fiscal year '23 capital expenditures of $190 million to $200 million.\nAnd finally, as Nikesh noted, we announced today a 3-for-1 split of Palo Alto Networks common stock. The decision was driven by a desire to make our stock more accessible to our employees and the broader group of investors. It is also supported by our underlying confidence in our continued business momentum. Shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6, 2022, will receive 2 additional shares after the close of business on September 13, 2022, for every outstanding share held on September 6. Our stock will be trading on a split-adjusted basis on September 14, 2022.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.",

I will now turn the call over to Nikesh.\n\nNikesh Arora\n\nChairman & CEO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Clay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our earnings call.\nIn this time of increased macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical uncertainty, we saw a combination of strong cybersecurity market demand and our team's execution in line with our strategy to drive our Q3 financial results. We reported strong top line metrics with both billings and RPO growing 40% year-over-year. This is the highest billings growth we have reported looking back over the past 4 years and was driven both by strong demand for our next-generation security offerings and strong customer commitments to our network security business.\nIn network security, we saw product again grow over 20% as we continue the transition to software. Customers continue to consolidate their network security to Palo Alto Networks as a result of the significant expansion in our subscription capabilities over the last several years. Our net security ARR ended Q3 at $1.61 billion, up 65% year-over-year. Our top line performance translated into non-GAAP operating income that grew ahead of revenue and enabled strong cash flow conversion. We were pleased that we were able to achieve these bottom line results despite challenges in the supply chain.\nSpeaking of the global backdrop, whether it's supply chain, geopolitical conflict or rising interest rates and inflation, this environment is creating challenges for our customers and testing our execution. I'm pleased our teams have risen to the occasion and have shown strong execution across sales, operations and all areas that support the business. The trend that started with the pandemic and the widespread cyberattacks, the trend of network transformation, cloud transformation and fortifying one's infrastructure continue to be strong. Coupled with consolidation in cybersecurity, we expect this to continue to drive strength and growth both for the industry and us in particular given our unique 3-platform approach.\nOf course, the events of Ukraine are on everyone's mind. We stand with the people of Ukraine against Russian aggression and have been working to provide direct cybersecurity support to Ukrainian organizations. This geography has not been significant for us in terms of revenue or our overall growth expectations. For this quarter and our most recent quarters, our combined Russia and Ukraine revenue was well below 1%. We have halted new sales in Russia and we're also complying with all government sanctions.\nSince December, we've deployed protection for over 3,400 new indicators of attack that defend organizations from disruptive and destructive Russian cyberattacks. As you might expect, we're seeing heightened interest from commercial and government customers in Europe around mitigating this nation-state activity. This ever-challenging threat landscape is driving broader and more strategic customer conversations. We continue to see our customers look for an elevated level of partnership and this is expanding our market opportunity.\nWe continue to see success in consolidating share within the enterprise market, and this has become a core tenet of our growth strategy. We see evidence of this in our multi-platform sales with 48% of our Global 2000 customers having transacted now with us on all 3 of our major platforms of Strata, Prisma and Cortex. The number of million-dollar-deal transactions we signed was up 65% in Q3 and the average size of our million-dollar deals increased in the quarter. We also saw the number of $5 million deals increase by 73% year-over-year. Large deals are an important selling motion for us as we further penetrate Global 2000 customers with our second and third platforms.\nInnovation is the engine that underpins our growth in the market, which Gartner estimates will total over $250 billion in end-user spending by 2026. With the trend towards vendor consolidation in the market, customers appreciate our best-of-breed capabilities within each of our 3 platforms. This quarter, we added 4 additional categories to the recognition we received for our best-of-breed capabilities. Remember, they're all integrated into our 3 platforms. So the customer gets the benefit of our platforms as well as the individual best-of-breed capabilities which compete effectively against independent vendors in our industry.\nForrester recognized our position in cloud workload security with a leader designation in their inaugural wave in this market, the only company to have that recognition. Early recognition of the importance of attack surface management, which we entered through the acquisition of Xpanse in 2020 was validated as we were recognized as an outperforming leader by GigaOm. We received strong performer designations from Forrester in 2 categories, incident response and EDR.\nI'll next provide you an update on our platforms and what progress we've made in the last quarter, starting with Prisma Cloud. We continue to see strong momentum driven by both new customers and notable for this quarter, large upsell and expansion commitments, which drove 25 deals north of $1 million. This growth in customers and existing customer expansion is evidenced in our credit consumption, which grew 50% year-over-year in Q3. We continue to drive cloud security leadership across the industry. And as I've said before, all Prisma Cloud customers are inherently customers of hyperscalers, yet they choose us. Customers are looking for a scaled, integrated cloud security platform that Prisma Cloud provides, enabling us to deliver high double-digit growth.\nOur customers are increasingly recognizing that operating securely in the cloud means ensuring that software that is written for the cloud is secure. This starts with the developer. Our early observation of this trend led us to acquire Bridgecrew in early 2021. We have been focused on building out a portfolio of offerings targeted at developers. This is our fifth pillar of Prisma Cloud. Cloud Code leverages all the existing capabilities of Prisma Cloud, including its approach to credit consumption, deployment and reporting. One quarter from release, we've seen success in 6-figure commitments to Prisma Cloud driven by Cloud Code and also this is amongst the fastest modules adopted in Prisma Cloud in terms of credit consumption. Critical to our developer strategy, we continue to see strong downloads of our Checkov open source offering, which reached over 7 million in Q3.\nMoving on to Cortex. We are helping customers reimagine how they operate their security operation centers with automation and AI/ML at the core. Cortex customers grew over 60% in Q3, supported by multiproduct Cortex transactions in EMEA and the Americas. We achieved an important milestone in Q3 with approximately $500 million in Cortex ARR. In Q3, we saw strength in each of our established Cortex product areas with a record number of transactions for XDR and Xpanse and nearly that level of business with XSOAR. XDR continues to shine with industry awards and benchmarks. This quarter, XDR was recognized for 100% threat prevention and detection in the recent MITRE evaluation. Forrester also recognized the significant progress we have made with XDR in our series of releases over the last 9 months, recognizing XDR as a strong performer in its EDR Wave.\nOur Xpanse performance, with transactions up well over 100% in the last 12 months, shows that attack surface management is now seeing an inflection in mainstream demand. After our recent limited releases of XSIAM, we are making progress in our goal to initiate co-design work with 10 partners and expect to be on track at the end of this quarter with our plans. XSIAM will ultimately enable us to achieve our Cortex vision around SOC automation, delivering what we expect to be a very unique value to our customers and disrupting the multibillion-dollar SIEM category by offering a modern alternative that leverages AI and ML.\nMoving on to SASE. Last week, we made a call to the industry to adopt ZTNA 2.0, which ushers in a new era of hybrid workforce security based on key zero trust principles like least privilege access, continuous trust verification and continuous security inspection across all apps. Our mantra for Prisma Access is to provide zero trust with zero exceptions. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of SASE. In addition to significant traction from our installed base, we continue to see strong momentum from net new customers for whom Prisma SASE is their first significant purchase for us. These customers then become opportunities for incremental engagements across our other platforms. SASE saw particular success with large transaction in Europe as we signed 11 large transactions in EMEA, further reinforcing the global nature of SASE demand. SASE is in the early innings, and we're making significant investments to ensure we continue our momentum in this category.\nMoving on to Strata, our hardware and subscription services platform. For the third consecutive quarter, we delivered north of 20% product revenue growth. We saw strength across our portfolio, both hardware appliances and software form factors. As you're all aware, the industry is dealing with unprecedented supply chain issues, which are likely to persist for yet another year. Our team is deftly managing these with our partners, allowing us to maintain better lead times than some in the industry. We have seen instances where we are advantaged in having supply where competitors cannot timely deliver and we believe this has helped contribute to market share gains.\nWe saw our momentum validated by third-party recognition of market share gains in both hardware and VM form factors. In hardware, Omdia recognized Palo Alto Networks as being #1 in market share for the appliance market with over 27% share, up more than 5 points year-over-year. In the VM market, according to Dell'Oro, we added 6 points of market share year-over-year and command nearly 34% of the market.\nWe continue to execute on our Generation 3 to Generation 4 transition. We have now released nearly all Gen 4 appliance models. Although customers are very early in their evaluation and adoption of Gen 4, we expect this Gen 4 adoption will help drive our appliance growth rates ahead of the market growth rate. We're seeing strong uptake of advanced URL subscriptions and strong early demand for our new advanced threat prevention subscription. We released next-generation CASB last quarter and saw solid Q3 performance here.\nLastly, we announced our second partnership with a hyperscaler to embed our network security into the fabric of their cloud. This is differentiated innovation that leverages our engineering scale, our market leadership position and relationships with hyperscalers. Cloud Next-Generation Firewall on AWS brings the combination of Palo Alto Networks' industry-leading network security in a cloud-native form factor and marries it with the ease of use of Amazon Web Services. This relationship with AWS follows the launch of Cloud IDS on the Google Cloud Platform last July.\nWe expect Cloud Next-Generation Firewall will drive further growth of our Firewall as a Platform and specifically, our software form factors. It also gives customers another reason to standardize on our network security platform. Innovations like Cloud Next-Generation Firewall on AWS, Cloud IDS on Google Cloud and our licensing of security subscriptions to SaaS providers to protect their cloud applications are differentiators for us versus competitors that are primarily focused on the appliance form factor.\nBringing it all together, we are very pleased with our Q3 results, where we saw exceptional top line growth. At the same time, even while growing faster, we are prioritizing investments and delivering on the profitability targets we committed during our September 2021 Analyst Day. We believe this is an important discipline, and we intend to maintain this focus on profitability targets while maximizing growth. We continue to see broadening demand for cybersecurity, which is enabling us to grow and invest from a position of strength. As we focus on our mission to be our customers' cybersecurity partner of choice for today and tomorrow, we also aspire to deliver to our shareholders outstanding returns as a proxy for growth of the cybersecurity opportunity as well as world-class execution.\nWe are very pleased with the first 3 quarters we have delivered so far in fiscal year 2022. We look forward to updating you in 3 months on our plans to continue accelerated growth, balanced profitability and look at how we intend to target GAAP profitability in the near future.\nWith that, I will pass the call over to Dipak to talk about our results in more detail.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone.\nOur strong results continue to be driven by solid demand across the breadth of our offerings with results again ahead of our guidance across all metrics. In the midst of top line strength, we balance profitability well. With the strength of this momentum and our favorable outlook, we are again raising our full year guidance. For Q3, revenue of $1.39 billion grew 29% and was above the high end of our guidance range. Product grew 22% and total services grew by 32%. By geography, growth was balanced across all theaters, with the Americas growing 30%, EMEA up 28% and JAPAC growing by 29%.\nNGS ARR grew 65% to $1.61 billion, supported by balanced strength across this portfolio. As noted in our Q2 earnings, going forward, we focus on NGS ARR as one of our core metrics as we believe it's indicative of the return we're seeing on our growth investments and also helps investors track the growing mix of this business within our revenue. We saw strong double-digit growth across all of our major NGS offerings with Prisma Cloud, Prisma SASE and Cortex as well as growing contributions from recently introduced NGS offerings. We are pleased with this diversified portfolio-driven growth. Overall, this performance as well as the continued maturity of our go-to-market organization in selling our NGS capabilities gives us confidence to raise our annual guidance for NGS ARR again in Q3.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, we delivered total billings of $1.8 billion, up 40% and also above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q3 was $5.9 billion, an increase of 34%. Remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $6.9 billion, increasing 40% with current RPO representing a similar percentage of the total as in recent quarters. Our teams executed very well again in Q3, and you see the result of the strength in these top line metrics, which lead revenue.\nThere were a few factors to call out that drove the strength that we saw this quarter. In addition to the significant strength in our NGS business, we saw strength in our attached subscriptions. We've seen customers use their budget to make incremental commitments to our attached subscriptions as they anticipate firewall upgrades and overall network security capacity increases. As well, they're seeing the value in newer subscriptions we have brought to the market over the last 12 to 18 months. This gives us further conviction around sustained demand for appliances as well as our software-based FWaaP form factors as customers look to benefit from our consistent architecture, including the subscription capabilities.\nProduct revenue again was strong, growing 22% in Q3 with demand exceeding our ability to ship due to supply chain challenges. We estimate customers refresh their products every 4 to 7 years, with many now evaluating our Gen 4 hardware. We're in the early days of this refresh cycle with only a small proportion having updated their products. As I noted earlier, we're seeing signs of customers making commitments to our hardware platform, both based on strong subscription demand and also the beginning of our installed base refresh activity.\nOur Firewall as a Platform billings grew 25% on top of the accelerated Q3 growth in the year ago period. We continue to see this performance well balanced across our FWaaP form factors. Within our FWaaP offerings, the strength of our product business held our Q3 software mix at approximately 39%, in line with Q2 and the year ago quarter.\nTurning to the details of our results. Product revenue was $352 million, growing 22%. Subscription revenue was $640 million, increasing by 35%. Support revenue of $395 million increased 27%. In total, subscription and support revenue of $1.04 billion increased 32% and accounted for 75% of total revenue.\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 72.9% was down 170 basis points. The driver continues to be supply chain-related costs as we incurred additional expense for components and shipping. Despite the pressure on our gross margins, non-GAAP operating margin of 18.2% was up 120 basis points year-over-year. We were able to offset higher supply chain costs with lower operating expenses as we drove efficiencies across the business.\nNon-GAAP net income for the third quarter grew 38% to $193 million or $1.79 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. GAAP net losses were $73 million or $0.74 per basic and diluted share.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We finished April with cash equivalents and investments of $4.6 billion. Product and associated subscription shipments shifted toward month 3, resulting in days sales outstanding of 71 days. Cash flow from operations was $390 million. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $351 million, a margin of 25.3%.\nWith regard to capital allocation priorities, we did not repurchase stock during Q3. However, we do expect share repurchase to be a major use of cash flow as previously stated. We currently have approximately $450 million remaining on our authorization for future share repurchases. This current authorization expires on December 31, 2022.\nOn the M&A front, we did not close any acquisitions in Q3. Managing stock-based compensation remains a management focus. This quarter, we reduced SBC as a percentage of revenue by approximately 4 points year-over-year and 2 points quarter-over-quarter. We will continue to apply discipline to this process while balancing reductions against the market dynamics for cybersecurity talent. Key to our ongoing success is maintaining balanced top and bottom line growth while continuing to acquire and retain top talent.\nLastly, moving to guidance and modeling points. As Nikesh highlighted, we continue to see very balanced demand from customers across our portfolio. This includes demand for our appliance form factors that outstrips our ability to fulfill in the near term as well as strengthen our next-generation security portfolio. Our Q4 guidance takes into account the strong demand picture, the best information we have today on supply chain and other factors. Recall that a year ago in the second half of fiscal year '22 (sic) ['21], we were hiring aggressively. As we move beyond that comparison, investors should be considering the comments we provided around medium-term margin expansion goals.\nTurning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect billings to be in the range of $2.32 billion to $2.35 billion, an increase of 24% to 26%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion, an increase of 25% to 27%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.26 to $2.29 based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 106 million to 108 million shares.\nFor fiscal year 2022, we expect billings to be in the range of $7.106 billion to $7.136 billion, an increase of 30% to 31%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5.48 billion to $5.50 billion, an increase of approximately 29%. We expect next-generation security ARR to be $1.775 billion to $1.825 billion, an increase of 50% to 55% versus a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. We expect strength in product revenue to continue in Q4 with full year growth of 20%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 18.5% to 19%. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $7.43 to $7.46 based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 106 million to 107 million shares. We continue to expect an adjusted free cash flow margin for the year of 32% to 33%.\nAchieving the rule of 60 was an aspiration we called out in our September 21 Analyst Day. The rule combines revenue growth and adjusted free cash flow margin. Based on our Q4 guidance, we're pleased to project that the combination will exceed 60% for fiscal year '22, which is ahead of our prior stated plan. We've seen strong growth in fiscal year '22. On a revenue basis, our guidance for the year is 3.6% higher at the midpoint than where we started and 7.5% higher at the midpoint for NGS ARR. Along with this top line, we've absorbed incremental supply chain costs and are happy to be able to continue to project the same operating profitability range as at the beginning of the year.\nAdditionally, please consider the following additional modeling points. We expect non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q4 and fiscal year '22, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. For Q4 '22, we expect net interest and other expenses of $1 million to $2 million. We expect capital expenditures in Q4 of $36 million to $41 million, and we expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year of $190 million to $195 million, which includes $39 million outlaid in Q2 '22 related to our Santa Clara headquarters.\nStepping back, we're focused on balancing our drivers of total shareholder return. We're recognizing not only the importance of top line growth as we focus on executing strong market demand, but also profitability, cash conversion and our capital structure. Balancing profitability is a commitment we made at our Analyst Day, and we've been able to deliver on this in fiscal year '22 despite increased costs related to our supply chain. We will continue to make progress on our commitment of 50 to 100 basis points operating margin expansion and 100 to 150 basis points of adjusted cash flow margin expansion beyond fiscal year '22 through '24 whilst balancing top line growth opportunity.\nWe're on track to achieving our fiscal year '24 targets we outlined in our September 2021 Analyst Day, including $10 billion in billings and $8 billion in revenue. We believe we can continue to deliver to shareholders outstanding returns as a proxy for the growth of the cybersecurity opportunity as well as world-class execution.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call.",

Good afternoon and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our earnings call. As you've seen by our results we released, we had an exceptional Q2. We continue to accelerate the growth of our business in line with our stated direction of fiscal year '22 being the year of focused execution.\nBut first, let's talk about the market and the trends we're seeing. Firstly, we continue to see strong demand for cybersecurity. We have not seen any changes in the IT spending patterns of our customers or a slowdown in companies investing in IT systems through our competitive advantage. On the contrary, we see acceleration around trends associated with the shift to the cloud as well as the continued efforts to redefine network architectures to enable employees to work effectively from anywhere, a trend which has been bolstered by the pandemic, and we continue to believe we are still in the early innings here. Both these factors underpin continued demand for cybersecurity services.\nSecondly, we continue to see an evolving and complicated threat landscape. We've highlighted in the past that cybersecurity is at the front and center of all conversations around risks and threats at companies as well as nation-state levels. We believe cybersecurity will continue to become more and more relevant and important. With increased alliance and technology and the prevalence of cyberattacks, there is an ability to disrupt businesses and critical systems, making cybersecurity an area will -- that will need continued focus on investment.\nIn addition to industry-specific trends, we're seeing a trend that is unique to Palo Alto Networks. Given our investments in the areas and continued relevance across multiple platforms and needs of our customers, we're having more and more significant partnership conversations, which encompass the entire Palo Alto Networks offering. Whilst early, we believe this is the true differentiation that Palo Alto Networks provides, both best-of-breed and integrated security that works.\nThirdly, our continued focus on execution. This focus is bearing fruit as we execute multiple dimensions across our business. Execution from our product teams means continuing our rapid pace of integrated platform delivery. We will talk about innovation across our platforms. But to highlight, just today, we unveiled our XSIEM product, which is poised to reimagine security operation centers and truly deploy technology to resolve cyberattacks in real time.\nExecution from our go-to-market teams means focusing on the broader customer-driven priority of helping them significantly improve their cybersecurity posture. This is demonstrated by the multi-platform large deal commitments we're beginning to see.\nExecution from our supply chain team means we are able to work with our suppliers in this tough environment to deliver critical security appliances to our customers. We had to balance some of the increased costs with price increases as an offset, but we've been able to keep these increases modest in comparison to our peers.\nExecution from our people leaders means despite this being a hot market for great talent, we're able to attract and retain the best minds in cybersecurity. As you saw in the opening of the call, we launched a Welcome Home program to welcome back employees that had left our company. We have seen good initial success here.\nLet's take a quick look at some of the outcomes caused by the focus on execution. In Q2, revenue was up 30%, while the leading billing and RPO metrics were up 32% and 36%, respectively. We're building a more predictable business model. Our CRPO balance of $3.4 billion gives us significant visibility into our next 12 months revenue. Next-Generation Security, or NGS, ARR finished Q2 at $1.43 billion. As we hit our midyear point, we have greater confidence that our strategy is working, which is driving us to make further investments in these businesses.\nAt the same time, we continue to transform our core network security business with a software mix within our Firewall as a Platform billings came in at 40%, up 5 points versus last year. We drilled these strong top line results while balancing non-GAAP profitability even as we absorbed some incremental expenses from supply chain challenges. Operating income grew 20%, and adjusted free cash flow grew 33%. We outperformed our non-GAAP EPS guidance midpoint by $0.09.\nFor a number of quarters, we've talked about our large deal momentum. To accelerate these results as we exited fiscal 2021, we layer on a sales strategy to elevate our focus and drive efficiency in our largest opportunities. With a growing portfolio of products across 3 platforms, making large deals selling a repeatable process is core to our sustaining and accelerated growth trajectory.\nWith BJ Jenkins taking over the leadership role for our broader sales organization, we've had an ability to increase management attention on the largest deals in the form of Amit Singh, our CBO. We're pleased with the results we have seen in the first half of the year. These deeper multi-platform relationships are a win-win for Palo Alto Networks and our customers. As a testament to this, at the end of Q2, 47% of our Global 2000 customers used products from all 3 of our platforms, up from 38% a year ago. In Q2, we closed 221 7-figure transactions, including 3 transactions over $20 million.\nOur military customers were 1,077 in Q2, up 26% year-over-year. Our combined rate of growth in [$1 million] customers as well as an increase in size of our large deals has helped us sustain the accelerated level of growth you've seen over the last several quarters. In all, it's a strong quarter and I want to thank our global team for their strong execution across the board.\nDriving these results are the transformation of our firewall business and our focus on capturing the growth in next-generation security. In particular, this quarter, our strengths were well balanced in both of these categories. Let's do a quick review of our progress across our 3 platforms.\nAs you know, we have them designed modularly so customers can initiate their partnership journey with Palo's Networks whatever their current need is, but over time, we work with them to both expand across any one of our platforms and also work with them to adopt our other platforms in line with their plans.\nAt the heart of our 3-platform strategy is innovation. This is a fuel of our growth, especially in next-generation security where we play in markets that are early in their life cycle. In the first half of fiscal year 2022, we had 22 major product releases, which is equal to all the releases we had in the full year of fiscal 2020. Even more impressive is that this quarter marks the end of all integrations of our acquired businesses over the last few years, i.e. all of our products are now seamlessly integrated and can have organic development continue on them.\nWe were also pleased to receive 2 new industry awards, adding one in developer security tools and other in secure web gateway. We now have a leadership position in 10 categories.\nFocusing first on our firewall business. We're continuing to refresh our platform. And just last week, we announced 2 more new families with the PA 3400 and PA 5400. These new Generation 4 platforms have industry-leading performance on real work encrypted traffic using our single pass architecture and performance that is 3x faster than similar Gen 3 appliances. We also rolled out PAN-OS 10.2 Nebula release, which adds significant new capability in using machine learning to stop the current generation of highly malicious attacks in line. This capability powers our recently released advanced URL and new advanced threat prevention subscriptions as well as bring significant enhancements to the capability of our DNS security subscription.\nWe have the industry's first integrated AIOps to our next-generation firewalls, our tenth subscription added to the firewall family. This capability assists customers to prevent firewall misconfigurations and proactively addresses performance issues before they impact customer networks.\nWe were pleased with our ability to grow our product revenues at 21%. This contributed to our Q2 revenue upside and was ahead of our guided mid-teens growth for the full year, which we will be raising. Our teams worked tirelessly during Q2 to ensure we could fulfill product demands to customers as quickly as possible while also navigating through Gen 3 to Gen 4 refresh. We did see demand for our next-generation firewall appliances outstrip our ability to ship in the quarter, and this is reflected in the growing RPO I spoke about earlier.\nStrong secured demand, innovations we're bringing to customers such as our Nebula release as well as customer appetite for Gen 4 gives us strong conviction and sustained product demand into fiscal year 2023. Next, I want to spend some time on our NGS business. This is one where our teams have done work, which I personally believe has not been done in the cybersecurity industry before. And this is what makes Palo Alto Network special. We have built a formidable set of services which are cloud-first, and these services are resonating with our customers. This success is truly driven by us working with our customers to anticipate their challenges, delivering best-of-breed solutions in an integrated fashion whilst continuing to focus on security outcomes. This has resulted in us building an NGS ARR stream of $1.43 billion driven by billings growth of 79% in NGS.\nDiving deeper into SASE, which has been a strong contributor to NGS. We continue to see strong uptake from our existing customers. We're also seeing marquee new customer wins, which are reflected in our current customer count of 1,983, which is up 62%. A recent report from the IT industry analyst Enterprise Strategy Group noted that 78% of organizations have begun or are planning SASE implementations. We see this mirrored in our customer conversations, where hybrid work is now the way many of these companies are planning on supporting the future work.\nWe are pleased to again stand on Autos Business Work report where we were identified as a leading provider of remote access solutions. We're seeing SASE emerge as a key platform for our customers with these customers looking to Prisma SASE to deploy leading capabilities. We rolled out integrated CASB within Prisma Access 3.0, including a new capability around in-line DLP for SaaS, and in particular, collaboration applications. We continue to see success attaching autonomous digital experience management, or ADM, as an upsell in Prisma Access as customers rely more on SASE as a foundation of the network architecture.\nOn the cloud front, we're seeing mainstream adoption of hyperscale public cloud in our customer base as well as an acceleration in production workloads. This is driving sustained strength we're seeing from Prisma Cloud. 4 years ago, we made it a conscious strategy to be a first mover with multiple big bets to proactively invest where we believe the future of security is going. Our pivot began with several acquisitions targeting companies with the best technologies. We developed a unique go-to-market approach, allowing us to promote future modules as part of an integrated offering. We're seeing tremendous success with this approach.\nWhile our active customers grew 21% to 1,810 in Q2, we saw north of 56% growth in credit consumptions driven both by increased adoption of the cloud by our customers and their continued adoption of more security modules in Prisma Cloud. While our 2-core modules, cloud security posture management and cloud workload protection, are mainstream within most of our customer base, we're seeing an increased adoption of 3 and more modules.\nThere are 2 areas I would like to highlight in Prisma Cloud this quarter: first, the launch of cloud code security; and second, the launch of agentless scanning. Approximately 1 year ago, we acquired Bridgecrew, which has strong early traction in DevSecOps, enabling security to be shifted left into the software development life cycle. This addresses security problems before they are created in production deployments and is far more efficient. A single deployment template can be propagated hundreds of times. When there are multiple vulnerabilities in the code, each deployment could create hundreds of security events even once in production.\nBridgecrew had significant traction with its checkout open-source tool, momentum that has significantly accelerated since its acquisition closed, and downloads are up to 5x year-over-year. Building on the Bridgecrew technology, in Q2, we released our fifth Prisma Cloud pillar, cloud code security, which is part of our [3] release. Our stand-alone Bridgecrew product has about 70 customers. We're pleased to see DevSecOps customer momentum building as Prisma Cloud customers adopt cloud core security to several weeks after its integrated releases into our platform.\nLet's talk about agentless scanning. You've seen a number of smaller provider focused on small initiatives in cloud-native security. Providing only agentless scanning is one of them. What we hear clearly from a customer is that they want a platform approach to cloud security, which offers the flexibility of both agent and agentless scanning, depending on their architecture and security needs. Towards this end, our teams rallied and delivered agentless scanning in record time. This makes sure that our customers can deploy either approach via the integrated platform that is Prisma Cloud.\nNow turning to Cortex, our endpoint security, security analytics and automation solutions. We continue to see significant customer demand for automation and security as threat data and volume security events grow at exponential rates. The human-only approach to interpreting data and responding to events is not keeping pace. We're seeing strong customer adoption of our market-leading technologies across XDR, XSOAR and Xpanse. Total customers across XDR Pro and XSOAR reached 3,232 and increased over 69%. Q2 was a strong quarter for new customers, both those that are brand-new to Palo Alto Networks and also cross-sell to Cortex. We also saw acute strength across all of our geographies for Cortex.\nAt our Ignite event last November, we launched our managed partnership program, XMDR, and we continue to see partners join the program to further align the opportunity across our Cortex portfolio. We now have 27 partners there and have a strong pipeline of interest of partners working through the certification process.\nCore to our growing success with Cortex is the innovation investments we have made over the last years in XDR, XSOAR and Xpanse with market-leading capabilities in each. Shortly after leasing XDR 3.0 in Q1 to enable cloud detection response, we release XDR 3.0 -- 3.1 in Q2 to further enhance our cloud asset visibility and insights. Cut also marked the release of our intelligence modules for XSOAR, providing end-to-end railroad the intelligence to identify and discover new malware familiar -- families or campaigns or attack techniques that are related to security incidents.\nThis morning, we announced our Cortex extended security intelligence and automation management, or XSIEM, platform and shared our vision to provide an autonomous cybersecurity solution as a modern alternative to SIEM solutions. We believe security operations teams have an urgent threat detection remediation problem, and only by leaning into a natively AI-driven platform, we will be able to bring down response times from hours and days to seconds and minutes. We're on a mission to revolutionize how data analytics and automation is leveraged in cybersecurity, and XSIEM is a product of years of research and development we've been doing in this area. XSIEM is currently available to a limited number of customers that will be broadly available later this year.\nIn summary, I am very pleased with our Q2 results. We both continue to benefit from strength in our core next-generation firewall business and is a strong sign of our future growth prospects, significant strength across our next-generation security portfolio. This balanced performance is a hallmark of our long-term strategy to drive durable growth. On the back of this trend and based on what we're seeing in our pipeline heading into the second half of fiscal year 2022, we are raising our total revenue, product revenue and total billings guidance for the year.\nWithin this top line, given our confidence in both our pipeline and our sales execution NGS, we're also raising NGS ARR for the year. Lastly, we're delivering this top line while we continue to make significant investments in our business for future growth. We not only continue to see strong near-term demand but also strong medium-term trends in cybersecurity, fueled by underlying spend in IT spending and secular trends like hybrid work and cloud-native adoption. We have aligned investments both to building sales capacity for fiscal year '23 as well as medium-term investments and product capability. These investments have been made while also absorbing unexpected supply chain-related costs this year. Despite this, we have been able to deliver upside to our non-GAAP EPS forecast so far this year. We're lifting our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year, reflecting much of the upside we saw in Q2.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Dipak to go into more detail on the Q2 performance of our guidance.\n\nDipak Golechha\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Palo Alto Networks, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nikesh, and good afternoon, everyone. We again delivered results ahead of our guidance across all metrics as we continue to transform our business. Top line growth remained strong in Q2 with balanced strength across our portfolio, including product and especially in our next-generation security offerings. Supported by the strength in our differentiated offerings, we're releasing our full year guidance.\nFor Q2, revenue of $1.32 billion grew 30% and was above the high end of our guidance range. Product grew 21%, and total services grew by 32%. We saw strong growth in all geographies and across all platforms. By geography, the Americas grew 33%, EMEA was up 22% and JAPAC grew 23%. NGS ARR finished the quarter at $1.43 billion, supported by broad strength across each of our platforms. Prisma Access ARR more than doubled year-on-year, and we continue to see especially strong growth from XDR and Prisma Cloud. This demonstrates that our portfolio approach to driving growth in our high-growth markets is working and what gives us confidence to raise our guidance here, which I will talk more about shortly.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we delivered total billings of $1.61 billion, up 32% and also above the high end of our guidance range. Total deferred revenue in Q2 was $5.4 billion, an increase of 31%. As a reminder, billings is total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue. Our NGS billings grew 79% year-over-year. Going forward, we encourage investors to focus on our NGS ARR metric as we view this measure as being more indicative of the underlying drivers of this business. We will not be updating NGS billings in the future.\nRemaining performance obligation, or RPO, was $6.3 billion, increasing 36%, with current RPO growing largely in line with total RPO. As mentioned previously, we believe RPO adds meaningful insight into our future revenue as it includes both prepaid and contractual commitments from customers. The strength of our RPO growth gives us confidence in our future quarters as it effectively provides us a head start from a revenue perspective.\nOur product growth was 21% in Q2 and above what we have seen historically, reflecting strong customer demand for our appliance and software offerings. Within our Firewall as a Platform business, we saw billings grow 26%, in line with the growth we have seen over the last year as customers purchase hardware, software and SASE form factors. Within FWaaP, our software mix increased 5 points to 40%.\nLast quarter, we raised our fiscal year '22 outlook for product revenue growth to mid-teens. We're raising this outlook to high teens as we continue to balance the forces of very strong customer demand and supply chain constraints.\nTurning to the details of our results. Product revenue was $308 million, growing 21%. Subscription revenue of $618 million increased 34%. Support revenue of $391 million increased 30%. And in total, subscription and support revenue of $1.01 billion increased 32% and accounted for 77% of our total revenue.\nNon-GAAP gross margin of 74% was down 130 basis points, in part due to the ongoing costs associated with the supply chain. Our production teams have done an outstanding job in fulfilling the growing demand and keeping the priority focused on enabling shipments to customers. We will continue that posture moving forward.\nNon-GAAP operating margin of 18.4% was again up sequentially and down year-over-year as expected, with higher product and support costs impacting the year-over-year trend. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter grew 20% to $185 million or $1.74 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 22%. Our GAAP net loss was $94 million or $0.95 per basic and diluted share.\nTurning now to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We finished January with cash equivalents investments of $4.2 billion. Days sales outstanding were 60 days, unchanged from a year ago. Cash flow from operations was $483 million. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $441 million, a margin of 33.5%.\nIn Q2, we again balanced multiple financial priorities with strength in both top line, underlying non-GAAP profitability and in cash conversion. We believe it is important to hold ourselves to this discipline even when growth is robust in order to drive a best-in-class financial model as we scale into a larger company. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities that outlined in our September Analyst Day. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares on the open market at an average price of approximately $534 per share for a total consideration of $550 million.\nWe continue to expect a large part of our cash flow to be used for share repurchase. We have approximately $450 million remaining on our authorization for future share repurchases expiring December 31, 2022.\nOn the M&A front, we did not close any acquisitions in Q2. As we noticed at Analyst Day, we continue to focus on managing down our stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. This quarter, we reduced SBC by about 2 points year-over-year as we apply our overall discipline to this process whilst balancing the current market for cybersecurity talent. We look forward to continuing this trend. Similarly, we talked about an aspiration for achieving the Rule of 60, combining revenue growth and adjusted free cash flow margin. You will see that with the revised midpoint of our fiscal year guidance, we are now expecting to achieve this once aspirational goal.\nLastly, moving to guidance and modeling points. As Nikesh highlighted, we continue to see very balanced demand. This includes demand from our appliance form factors that outstrips our ability to fulfill them in the short term as well as strengthen our next-generation security portfolio. Our Q3 guidance takes into account the strong demand picture as well as the best information we have today on supply chain and other factors.\nTurning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '22. We expect billings to be in the range of $1.59 billion to $1.61 billion, an increase of 24% to 25%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.345 billion to $1.365 billion, an increase of 25% to 27%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.68 based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 106 million to 108 million shares.\nFor fiscal year 2022, we expect billings to be in the range of $6.8 billion to $6.85 billion, an increase of 25% to 26%. We expect revenue to be in the range of $5.425 billion to $5.475 billion, an increase of 27% to 29%. We expect NGS ARR to be $1.725 billion to $1.775 billion, an increase of 46% to 50%. We expect product revenue to grow in the high teens with the seasonality weighted to Q4 as we have seen in prior years. We continue to expect operating margins to be in the range of 18.5% to 19%.\nNon-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.23 to $7.3 based on a weighted average diluted count of approximately 106 million to 108 million shares. Adjusted free cash flow margin is expected to be in the range of 32% to 33%.\nAdditionally, please consider the following additional modeling points. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 22% for Q3 '22 and fiscal year '22, subject to the outcome of future tax legislation. We expect net interest and other expenses of $5 million to $6 million per quarter. For Q3, we expect capital expenditures of $40 million to $45 million. For fiscal year '22, we expect capital expenditures of $185 million to $195 million, which includes $39 million outlaid in Q2 related to our Santa Clara headquarters.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Clay for the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the Investors section of our website www.danaher.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings.\nThe audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A dial-in replay of this call will also be available until November 4, 2025.\nDuring the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Our Form 10-Q and the supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the third quarter of 2025 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets.\nDuring the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer M. Blair\n\nEVP, Danaher Corporation\n\nAll right. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We're encouraged by our strong third quarter results. Our team's DBS-driven execution paired with continued momentum in our bioprocessing business, and better-than-expected respiratory revenue at Cepheid enabled us to exceed our revenue, earnings and cash flow expectations.\nAcross our end markets, underlying conditions in the third quarter were generally consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year. In pharma, global production of monoclonal antibodies, where the majority of our exposure lies remain robust. We continue to see a modest recovery in pharma R&D spending, but remains below historical levels. In academic and government, demand was stable sequentially but remains soft amid ongoing uncertainty around research funding despite some encouraging headlines late in the quarter. Clinical diagnostics and applied markets held up well.\nNow we remain intensely focused on what we can control to continue delivering for our customers, associates and shareholders. Our team is leveraging the Danaher Business System to mitigate ongoing geopolitical and policy related pressures and drive meaningful productivity gains across our businesses. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in innovation to strengthen our long-term competitive position, including accelerating digital and artificial intelligence initiatives. We're accustomed to tackling challenges head on and turning them into opportunities, and we expect that mindset and momentum to continue as we move forward into 2026 and beyond.\nSo with that, let's take a closer look at our third quarter 2025 results. Sales were $6.1 billion in the third quarter, and we delivered 3% core revenue growth. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were up mid-single digits, with North America up mid-single digits and Western Europe approximately flat.\nCore revenues in high-growth markets were up low single digits as solid performance outside of China was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in China. Growth in our biotechnology and life sciences businesses in China was more than offset by declines in Diagnostics due to volume-based procurement and reimbursement policy changes implemented in the last 12 months.\nOur gross profit margin for the third quarter was 58.2%, and our adjusted operating profit margin of 27.9% was up 40 basis points year-over-year as the favorable impact of higher volume leverage and disciplined cost management more than offset the impact of productivity investments.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.89 were up approximately 10% year-over-year. We generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.5 billion in the first 3 quarters of the year, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 146%.\nNow during the quarter, we deployed approximately $2 billion of capital towards the repurchase of 10 million shares of Danaher common stock. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program, authorizing the purchase of up to 35 million additional shares of Danaher common stock. Our substantial investments in innovation over the last several years led to the launch of several leading-edge products and technologies this quarter. Each one of these new solutions is designed to enhance our competitive positioning while enabling customers to improve quality and yield, lower cost and accelerate the delivery of life-changing therapies and diagnostics.\nSo let me highlight a few examples and the tangible value they're creating for our customers. In biotechnology, Cytiva launched the ÄKTA readyflux TFF system 500, a fully automated benchtop tangential flow filtration system, developed to meet growing demand for efficient low-volume processing, the readyflux TFF system 500 minimizes product loss, improves yields and enables effective process development with limited material. Importantly, the readyflux platform is now scalable from process development to commercial production, enabling customers to quickly and smoothly transition across different stages of drug development.\nThis system is one of several planned launches, including the new TFF filter cartridges and our next-generation perfusion system together with our new AcelRx X platform bioreactors and differentiated filtration and cell culture media offerings, these solutions provide a powerful upstream package that helps customers improve yields and efficiency in the intensified biologic drug manufacturing process. It also underscores the breadth and the depth of Cytiva's leading portfolio and our ability to support customers across the bioprocessing workflow. From early-stage process development through to commercial manufacturing.\nIn Life Sciences, IDT announced a strategic expansion of its end-to-end translational gene editing portfolio with the launch of high-purity customizable guide RNAs. As scientists move from early research towards clinical applications, the need for greater purity and flexibility and CRISPR tools increases. These new guide RNAs, key components that direct CRISPR systems to specific genes give researchers more control over sequence design, length and modifications to meet their precise needs. These capabilities are especially valuable for scientists and preclinical testing who require high-quality materials for studies like toxicology ahead of clinical trials.\nIn Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter launched the Access BD-Tau assay. This is the industry's first fully automated research use-only immunoassay for brain-derived tau protein, a promising blood-based biomarker for researching neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. This assay leverages the high-resolution DxI 9000 analyzer to bring automation and scalability to tau protein quantification. Ultimately, this powerful technology combination can help improve research efficiency, enhance consistency on long-term clinical trials and support accelerated regulatory pathways through stronger real-world evidence.\nNow let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio, and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our Biotechnology segment increased 6.5%. Core revenue in Discovery and Medical grew low single digits in the quarter. Growth in medical and lab filtration was partially offset by declines in protein research instrumentation where academic research customers continue to face funding constraints. Core revenue in bioprocessing grew high single digits with double-digit growth in consumables, partially offset by declines in equipment. Consumables growth was driven by robust demand for commercialized therapies at our large pharma and CDMO customers. Equipment revenue grew sequentially, but declined in the high teens versus prior year, as expected.\nNow while we're seeing strong funnels and customers have a healthy pipeline of planned projects, this hasn't translated into equipment order growth as customers are awaiting additional clarity on the policy environment before finalizing their investment decisions. Based on what we're seeing today, we expect cautious equipment spending through the remainder of the year. Now that said, with several billions of dollars invested to expand capacity at Cytiva since 2020, including meaningful additions at our facilities in Florida, South Carolina, Utah and Michigan, we believe we are very well positioned to help customers execute in region, for region manufacturing strategies.\nNow the long-term outlook for the biologics market remains very healthy. The primary growth driver of Cytiva's bioprocessing business is the increasing global production of biological medicines, particularly monoclonal antibodies. Underlying biologic demand has grown double digits annually over the last 10-plus years, and we expect strong demand growth to continue in 2025 and beyond. This growth has been supported by a steady pace of new FDA drug approvals, building on several consecutive years with record-setting FDA approvals as well as a continued shift in pharmaceutical pipelines towards biologics. In fact, more than 2/3 of the world's top 100 drugs are projected to be biologics by 2030.\nAt the same time, we've seen increased development of biosimilars and expanded indications for existing therapies, both of which are expected to drive production volume growth. The substantial and sustained level of activity we have seen reinforces our conviction in the significant opportunity ahead in this market, and supports the long-term core revenue growth trajectory for our leading bioprocessing franchise.\nNow turning to our Life Sciences segment. Core revenue decreased by 1%. Core revenue in our life sciences instrument businesses was up slightly in the quarter. By end market, clinical and applied markets held up well globally. Demand from academic and government customers remained soft but was stable sequentially. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see modest recovery in pharma spending with revenue from these customers growing in the quarter. In China, moderate improvements in the funding environment led to increased activity levels, which contributed to revenue growth in the quarter.\nCore revenue in our life sciences consumables businesses, which include IDT, Aldevron, Abcam and Phenomenex declined in the quarter, primarily due to lower demand for plasmids and mRNA from 2 of our larger customers as well as continued funding pressure across early-stage biotech and academic research. Declines related to these funding pressures were partially offset by growth in next-generation sequencing products at IDT and recombinant proteins at Abcam.\nMoving to our Diagnostics segment. Core revenue increased 3.5%. Core revenue in our clinical diagnostics businesses was up low single digits with high single-digit growth outside of China. Leica Biosystems delivered over 10% core growth with broad-based strength across core histology, advanced staining and digital pathology. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics also had another solid quarter with mid-single-digit growth outside of China. This marks Beckman's fifth consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit or better core growth outside of China driven by continued uptake of recent innovations such as the DxI 9000 and strong momentum in commercial execution.\nIn Molecular Diagnostics, Cepheid's core revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter. High single-digit growth across Cepheid's core nonrespiratory test menu was led by approximately 20% growth in sexual health. Respiratory revenue exceeded expectations as customers began purchasing earlier than typical in preparation for the upcoming respiratory season. Cepheid continued to expand its global installed base in the third quarter. The sustained growth in Cepheid's installed base is driven in part by health care system and IDN customers adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to patients in order to provide faster diagnostic and treatment decisions. We believe this ongoing installed base expansion combined with a leading test menu and workflow advantages, provides a long runway ahead for durable long-term growth at Cepheid.\nNow let's frame how we're thinking about the fourth quarter and the full year 2025. For the full year 2025, we're maintaining our full year adjusted diluted net EPS guidance range of $7.70 to $7.80. In the fourth quarter, we expect core revenue to grow in the low single-digit percent range as we expect market conditions to be largely consistent with what we saw in Q3. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 27%, which importantly includes the impact of anticipated productivity investments aimed at further improving our cost structure.\nNow before we wrap up, I'd like to share our initial thoughts on next year. For the full year 2026, we expect core revenue growth in the 3% to 6% range as we are assuming modest recovery across our end markets. Looking across the portfolio, we're assuming bioprocessing growth trends remain at levels consistent with 2025 including continued strength in consumables, driven by healthy growth in monoclonal antibody demand and our strong positioning across the biologics workflow.\nIn Life Sciences, we're assuming a modest improvement in end markets but assume growth will remain below historical levels given the current geopolitical and policy environment. And in Diagnostics, we're assuming higher growth in 2026 due to moving past headwinds from policy changes in China and our expectation that we will continue to execute well globally. Additionally, we anticipate respiratory revenue at Cepheid will be approximately $1.7 billion in 2026, consistent with our expectations for 2025.\nTurning to 2026 earnings. We expect the operating leverage on anticipated core revenue growth and the benefit of our 2025 productivity initiatives to drive more than 100 basis points of adjusted operating profit margin expansion, which would result in high single-digit adjusted earnings per share growth before any benefit from capital allocation. As always, we will provide more color and a formal guide with our Q4 earnings in January.\nSo to wrap up, we're encouraged to deliver third quarter results ahead of expectations in what remains a dynamic operating environment. Our team's commitment to innovating and executing with DBS has driven meaningful improvements in our businesses and enabled us to deliver more breakthrough solutions to our customers.\nNow looking ahead, we remain focused on the areas we can control to drive results for our stakeholders. We're taking thoughtful actions to reduce structural costs, supporting earnings growth and margin expansion in 2026, while maintaining the right foundation to continue investing in opportunities that strengthen our long-term competitive advantages. We believe Danaher is well positioned for sustainable long-term value creation. Our businesses are well positioned in attractive end markets, supported by long-term secular growth drivers and share a common set of relatively durable, high recurring revenue business models. And on top of that, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation positions us well to strategically deploy capital going forward.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rainer. Operator, that concludes our formal comments. We're now ready for questions. .",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Now, before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to touch briefly on the announcement we made this morning regarding our CFO succession plan.\nAs I'm sure many of you saw, we announced that Matt Gugino, the current Group CFO of our Life Sciences Innovation Group and Vice President of Corporate FP&A, will succeed Matt McGrew as Chief Financial Officer of Danaher at the end of February 2026. As we've done with past transitions, Matt McGrew will continue on as an Executive Vice President as he begins his gradual path to retirement. Matt, it's been a privilege working with you. For more than two decades, we've all benefited from your outstanding financial leadership, your thoughtful guidance, and trusted partnership. Since stepping into the CFO role in 2019, you've helped guide Danaher through pivotal moments, including launching Envista and Veralto as public companies, the acquisition of Cytiva, and the challenges of the pandemic, all while developing an exceptional internal finance talent pipeline.\nMatt, Danaher simply would not be the company it is today without your leadership, strategic vision, and humility. Thanks, buddy, for everything. Now, many of you know Matt Gugino from his time as Vice President of Investor Relations. Matt has had a number of important roles during his past 12 years with Danaher. Throughout Matt's time at Danaher, he has gained extensive experience in several key areas, including investor relations, FP&A, mergers and acquisitions, talent development, and most recently, operational experience as Group CFO. He has consistently demonstrated exceptional leadership and has played a central role in shaping our financial strategy and portfolio evolution. I know he'll be an outstanding CFO as we continue to grow Danaher into one of the most respected science and technology leaders. We look forward to helping him transition to his important role at the end of February 2026.\nWith that, let's get to our results. Our team's strong execution with the Danaher Business System drove solid Q2 results in what remains a dynamic operating environment. Strong growth in our bioprocessing business, paired with disciplined cost management, enabled us to exceed both our adjusted operating profit margin and cash flow expectations for the quarter. While global trade tensions have led to some uncertainty, market conditions in the Q2 were generally consistent with what we saw in the Q1. In pharma, global production of monoclonal antibodies, where the majority of our exposure lies, remained robust, and we continued to see a modest recovery in pharma R&D spending.\nAcademic and government demand remained soft as expected, with ongoing uncertainty around research funding. Clinical diagnostics and applied markets, meanwhile, remained stable. Now, while the macro environment remains fluid, we're intensely focused on what we can control, and that's to continue delivering for our customers, associates, and shareholders. Now, our team has done a nice job running the DBS Playbook to offset cost pressures from tariffs, deliver meaningful productivity gains, and turn challenges into opportunities. At the same time, we're taking thoughtful actions to protect our financial and competitive positioning, including addressing structural costs while continuing to invest in innovation for the long term. Our Q2 results also highlight the strength and resilience of our portfolio. We're well-positioned in attractive end markets, driven largely by non-discretionary healthcare needs and supported by strong secular growth drivers. Our businesses share a common set of relatively durable, high-recurring revenue business models, with the majority of our revenues being consumables that are specified into regulated manufacturing processes or specific to the equipment that we supply.\nOn top of this, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. With that, let's take a closer look at our Q2 2025 results. Sales were $5.9 billion in the Q2, and we delivered 1.5% core revenue growth. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were up low single digits, with North America up slightly, and a high single-digit increase in Western Europe. Core revenues in high-growth markets were flat overall, as solid performance outside of China was offset by a mid-single-digit decline in China. Growth in our biotechnology and life sciences businesses in China was more than offset by declines in diagnostics due to volume-based procurement and reimbursement changes implemented in late 2024. Our gross profit margin for the Q2 was 59.3%.\nOur adjusted operating profit margin of 27.3% was flat year-over-year as the favorable impacts of higher volume leverage, product mix, and disciplined cost management were offset by productivity investments to reduce our structural costs. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.80 were up approximately 5% year-over-year. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2.2 billion in the first half of the year, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio of 143%. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make significant investments in long-term growth initiatives across Danaher. In the Q2 alone, those investments translated into several important new product and technology launches, each reinforcing our long-term competitive position while delivering meaningful benefits to our customers.\nLet me highlight a few of these key introductions and how they're designed to help customers improve quality and yields, reduce costs, and bring new therapies and diagnostic tests to market more efficiently. In biotechnology, Cytiva expanded its comprehensive purification portfolio with the launch of two new protein A resins, MabSelect SuRe 70 and MabSelect PrismA X. Each stage of drug development presents unique purification needs, and these resins are designed to offer cost-effective solutions for preclinical and clinical production without compromising on quality. They also underscore Cytiva's commitment to delivering innovative solutions to help customers reduce manufacturing costs, increase flexibility, and maintain the high-performance standards they expect across all stages of the drug development process. Now, life sciences reinforced their leadership position in mass spectrometry with the introduction of the ZenoTOF 8600 at June's American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting.\nThe ZenoTOF 8600 expands SCIEX's high-resolution mass spectrometry footprint and delivers tangible performance improvements across proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and small molecule workflows. The 8600 offers competitive molecular identification and superior quantification compared to other leading high-end platforms, helping scientists better understand molecular structures and measure more targets and complex samples with greater speed and confidence, with the ultimate goal of accelerating drug development times. In diagnostics, we announced a new partnership with AstraZeneca to develop diagnostic tools that help clinicians identify which patients are most likely to benefit from precision medicine treatments. This collaboration is leveraging the newly launched Danaher Centers for Enabling Precision Medicine to support a more streamlined end-to-end development process. The first product in development uses technologies from Leica Biosystems with a focus on digital and computational pathology, including AI-assisted algorithms to improve diagnosis and enable more targeted therapy decisions.\nNow let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our biotechnology segment increased 6%, with bioprocessing up high single digits and discovery in medical down low single digits. In bioprocessing, we were pleased to see the positive trends in our order book continue through Q2. Revenue growth was led by low double-digit growth in consumables, with particularly robust demand for commercialized therapies. Equipment declined as expected as customers continued to absorb capacity added over the past several years, and global trade uncertainty contributed to delays in some larger capital investment decisions.\nIn addition to strong demand for commercial production, the number of therapies in development and clinical trials remains robust. Monoclonal antibodies, which comprise more than 75% of our bioprocessing revenues, remain the largest investment area for our customers, and there is a healthy pipeline of new molecules in development. At the same time, biosimilar development, production, and demand for our solutions are increasing as patents on high-volume therapies expire, making life-saving treatments more accessible and driving broader adoption. With our comprehensive portfolio and an innovation engine geared toward increasing yields and enhancing manufacturing efficiencies, we're well-positioned to support our customers as they advance these therapies through development and into commercial production.\nThe strength of the development pipeline, paired with consistent growth in commercial production, also reinforces our conviction in the high single-digit long-term growth outlook for our leading bioprocessing franchise. Now, turning to our life sciences segment, core revenue decreased by 2.5%. Core revenue in our life sciences instrument businesses collectively declined low single digits in the quarter. Looking across our end markets, clinical and applied markets held up well globally, while demand from academic and government customers remained weak. As I mentioned earlier, we continued to see modest recovery in pharma spending, with revenue from these customers growing in the quarter.\nIn China, we saw an improvement in demand as stimulus-related funding translated into new customer orders and revenue. Core revenue in our genomics consumables business declined in the quarter, driven by lower demand for plasmids and mRNA from two of our larger customers, along with funding pressure across early-stage biotech and academic research customers. Now, you likely saw IDT and Aldevron in the headlines this quarter for their groundbreaking role in helping develop the world's first on-demand mRNA-based personalized in vivo CRISPR therapy. This achievement marks a major milestone for in vivo CRISPR-based therapies and serves as a powerful example of how our genomics businesses are helping advance the future of personalized medicine.\nNow, moving to our diagnostics segment, core revenue increased 2%. Core revenue in our clinical diagnostics businesses was up low single digits, with mid-single digit growth outside of China. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics led the way with high single-digit growth outside of China and notable strength in instrumentation. This marks Beckman's fourth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit or better core growth outside of China, and is a direct result of good traction from recent innovations such as the DxC 500i Integrated Clinical Chemistry and Immunoassay Analyzer, the DxI 9000 High-Resolution Immunoassay Analyzer, and continued momentum in commercial execution. In molecular diagnostics, Cepheid's respiratory revenue was modestly better than expected, though slightly below prior year levels.\nCepheid's core non-respiratory revenue grew double digits, including double-digit or better growth in sexual health, urology, and hospital-acquired infections. This sustained growth in non-respiratory revenue reflects increasing menu adoption and system utilization across our installed base, along with continued strength from newer assays such as the Multiplex Vaginitis Panel, which grew over 75% in the US this quarter. Now, Cepheid continues to expand its global installed base of more than 60,000 instruments. This expansion has been driven by notable wins across large healthcare systems and integrated delivery networks that are standardizing testing on the GeneXpert platform. As these customers look to allocate resources more efficiently, Cepheid's point-of-care molecular testing is proving increasingly valuable, helping deliver greater efficiency through fewer total tests, higher rates of correct treatment, and ultimately lower overall treatment costs compared to other testing strategies.\nWith that, now let's frame how we're thinking about the Q3 and the full year 2025. For the full year 2025, we continue to expect core revenue growth of approximately 3%. Additionally, we're raising our full-year adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to a range of $7.70 to 7.80 versus our previous range of $7.60 to 7.75. In the Q3, we expect core revenue to grow in the low single-digit percent range, and additionally, we expect the Q3 adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 25.5%. To wrap up, we're encouraged by the momentum we've generated in the first half of the year, particularly in our bioprocessing business. Our team's focused execution in a dynamic operating environment enabled us to deliver financial results ahead of our expectations while advancing solutions that are at the forefront of improving patient and healthcare outcomes.\nOur solid Q2 results also underscore the unique positioning of our portfolio. Our businesses are well-positioned in end markets with long-term secular growth drivers, and our business models are resilient, with more than 80% of our sales today comprised of consumables and service revenue, which is typically highly recurring. At the same time, the strength of our balance sheet and financial position allows us to invest for the future, both organically and through strategic capital deployment, to further enhance our long-term competitive advantages. Looking ahead, we remain focused on what we can control and what has become a more complex macro environment since the start of the year.\nWe believe the combination of our talented team, the differentiation of our portfolio, and our strong financial profile, all powered by the Danaher Business System, will enable us to continue delivering strong results for the remainder of 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, Rainer. Operator, that concludes our formal comments.

It's great working with both of you, and I look forward to it. Rainer, I want to start on just I want to start on the order trends commentary real quick on bioprocess.\nYou had some really positive commentary in terms of positive trends in the order book continuing, especially in the consumables. I was wondering if you could dive into that a little bit more in terms of what the book-to-bill was, whether you saw orders accelerate from Q1, just sort of expectations for order trends in Q3, Or any call, you can provide maybe by biotech versus pharma, just any additional color you can provide on bioprocessing trends. Thanks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning. Let me put the order trend right into the context here of some of our comments. I think first, it's important to note that our biotechnology segment consists of two businesses. One is the bioprocessing business, which is the $6 billion annual revenue business that you were just asking about.\nThen the other is the discovery and medical business, which is a $1 billion business. That business, the discovery and medical, behaves a lot more like a Life Science Tools business. Now, to your point here, let's talk about bioprocessing and work through to the orders development here. First of all, the performance and trends in Q2 were very consistent with what we saw in Q1. Consumables continued to lead the way globally with low double-digit growth, and consumables really driven by commercial demand and large pharma CDMO customers. Smaller customers, while they were stable, are still below historical trends or historical levels. Now, equipment remains below those historical trends with funnels improving. We're seeing better funnel activity, but we continue to see order delays with trade policy creating some incremental noise here and probably slowing some decision-making.\nNow, overall, our book-to-bill was consistent with prior quarters and around one with some lumpiness in equipment orders. Overall orders activity in the first half and Q2 are fully supportive of a high single-digit core growth in the second half. If you put all that together here, and I think it's important to also comment on the top-line performance here, which continues to drive strong profitability with fall-through of over 50% in bioprocessing in the first half. When you put all that together, we're really encouraged by the strong first half. We expect high single-digit growth in the second half of the year. All of this reaffirms our belief that bioprocessing is a high single-digit grower both in 2025 and the long term.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Thanks. I want to touch on something you also brought up a couple of times.\nYou mentioned global trade tensions a few times in the prepared remarks. You just touched on it in your prior answer. If you could expand on that, where you're seeing it, is it sort of what regions geographically and also what customer segments, whether it's pharma or some of the more industrial or applied markets? Is it pausing of orders? Is it cancellations of orders? Is it delays of new orders? Just sort of how are you seeing those dynamics play out? Do you expect a recovery in that or improvement in that as we go through the rest of the year and we have sort of continued discussion on the tariff front?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks. Mike, I mean, I think there's a general overlay here of trade uncertainty as it relates to how the tariffs will play out.\nIf we think about the different end markets, in pharma, certainly, as we pointed out, this market continues to grow over time. There is going to be a need for capacity expansions. Now pharma companies have to ask themselves the critical question as to where they're going to build that new capacity. Of course, that's hard to do if you don't know yet what the tariff situation ultimately plays out to be. We would expect that that overhang here clears here certainly in the next six to 12 months. That's certainly our planning assumption. That is an overlay on pharma. As it relates to the applied and clinical markets, I think that's less of a factor. Clinical markets, we see volumes remaining fairly consistent. Capacity increases are more incremental in that regard. As it relates to applied markets, I would say the same thing.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks. I'll leave there.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll next go to Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and the Head of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. Matt and Matt, congrats and thanks for all the help. Thanks to the Blair team for giving us some time this morning. I just want to talk about bioprocessing a little bit more. I really just want to clarify your bioprocessing assumptions that are embedded into guidance. First, you had previously told us to expect high single-digit bioprocessing revenue growth for the year. Is that still the case? Second, you got two and a half points of price in the biotech segment in Q2. What is your assumption for pricing for the second half within the segment? What does that imply regarding volume pacing?\nThen third, really more to the point, it seems like you may have increased bioprocessing guidance while reducing DNM assumptions. You kind of referenced this in your response to Mike. I just want to see if that's the case. Thank you.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, Doug, maybe I'll take a first stab at it. Kind of to your first part of the question on bioprocessing, I think the simple answer is yes. High single digits is still our guide for the year for the bioprocessing piece. Again, just for folks, that's that $6 billion of the $7 billion in the segment. We are still expecting to see high single digits. I think your second question was around price and what we saw here. I think we saw about, call the first half one and a half, 2% kind of price is what we saw in the segment.\nI think we're probably going to do roughly the same, maybe a little bit better here in the second half from a price perspective in the segment. From a volume pacing perspective, which I believe you asked about as well, we really will see Q2 kind of step down in Q3. Very traditional for us to have a kind of a volume step down in Q3. We do some work on some of our plants, and typically Q3 is our lowest volume quarter. You see that both in you see it really in the margins too in bioprocessing Q2 to Q3. Then you step right back up, Q4 is our best quarter in bioprocessing. I would expect to see the same kind of cadence on that.\nThen lastly, I think it was on just sort of maintaining the full margin or the full guide for the year on the segment. I think that's right. I think on the margin, you're probably a little bit lower at DNM, but we're probably a little bit better here in bioprocessing in that $6 billion piece. Again, it's on the margin. It's not huge, but we would maintain the guide for the full year for the segment, a little better in bioprocessing, maybe a touch worse in DNM. As Rainer said, that DNM piece is very different than bioprocessing. It kind of acts almost like a life science tools business to some degree.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and the Head of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. I'll echo my congrats.\nRainer, you're lucky to have two rock stars with you there. Three, including John. Sorry, John.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nTotally agree. Totally agree. Thanks, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nJust first, just to clarify something. Is the structural cost out part of the story? Is that behind us now?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. I mean, I think we feel very comfortable and confident that we are going to get all of that $150 million. I think we've probably got about half already, Scott, and the other half will come as we work through the second half, but I feel very comfortable with it.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. I'm actually just kind of curious of you here. I mean, early-stage biotech, and just trying to get a sense of what you think this is going to how this is going to play out in the next couple of years.\nIs this a case of where kind of AI spend is crowding out perhaps some of the opportunities? Is there pent-up demand here? I mean, just kind of are we still going to be talking about this in 12 months, I guess, is my question. I'm just kind of curious how you guys view the market.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, I would say that if we just look where we are today, biotech is at lower activity levels, but stable. The investment environment has been tough here with the amount of venture capital that goes into these biotechs slowing, and those that are already out there really needing to focus on those therapeutic programs that show the best data.\nI think that is representative of what has been going on here more generally in the sector, that the enormous wave of investment that we saw during and just after the pandemic has waned. The market is now finding its footing. Now, as it relates to AI, we really see that ultimately as a tailwind because we see then less money being spent on getting to compound ideas, if you will, and more money being spent taking great ideas, which have been validated in silico, as they say, through the development pipeline, ultimately driving more manufactured and commercialized therapies. And of course, that's where our business is, where we have the most volume, of course, the most share. We view this really positively. We have to say that we're at a low activity level currently in the discovery phase of the biotech market.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay.\nGood color. All right. I'll pass it on. Congrats again, Matt and Mike.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morning, Tycho.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I want to probe a little bit on the guide. You're not flowing through the entire EPS beat. I'm just curious if there are areas of maybe incremental caution in the back half of the year. Then on Q4 specifically, you've got a step up in life sciences, I think kind of ramping to mid to high single digits. The comps there are more difficult. Just curious if you can get us more comfortable with that in particular. Is that contributions from the new SCIEX launches at ASMS?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, that's a piece of it.\nMaybe I'll let Rainer kind of take the second half piece because he can talk about, like you said, some of the new stuff that's out there. Maybe I'll take the first question, which is sort of on the guide and the flow through. Maybe I'm kind of sort of thinking about the guide like this. We got off to a pretty good start in the first half, both on the cost actions. Like I said to Scott earlier, I feel very comfortable with where we are on those. We had a little bit better FX as well. Probably FX was maybe $0.05 better for us. Like I said, I think we get the full cost actions, which is probably $0.15 or so. I kind of look at that, say, $0.20.\nThat's what we flowed through to the full year. All the cost actions and the better first half FX. We started in January with, call it $7.60 as sort of the range, put the $0.20 on top of that. That's how you get to kind of the high end of the range now at $7.80. There are two other things here that I think you're right, we have not flowed through fully. I think maybe the easiest way to think about it is, one, we had a good start in respiratory in Q1 and Q2, and two, FX. In the second half, that's going to be much more favorable than we thought in January. I think the combination of those two, maybe probably another $0.15, $0.20, that has not flowed through.\nThe reason we haven't flowed it through is, one, we're going to maintain the full year respiratory guide at $1.7 billion, see how that plays out in Q3, Q4. You know that is a variable number. Then FX is the same, right? That could fluctuate and come back. That has made a significant movement since January. That could very well come back. We've decided now to hold back on respiratory, hold back on the second half FX, and just kind of see what happens, especially in a pretty dynamic policy and operating environment. Just felt like we'll sit and see how things play out before we commit to that final $0.15, $0.20.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nTo the second part, Tycho, I mean, what we're really saying is the first half in the life science segment was down low singles.\nWe expect the full year to be flat. The second half needs to be up, positive low singles. What we're really seeing there is the impact of three factors. The first is, and we're actually not assuming a significantly improved activity level. In genomics, we expect to see better comps, as an example. In China, we're seeing it's incrementally firmer with some stimulus dollars following through. Then, as you suggested, we have a number of new product introductions that are gaining traction in our funnels here in the first half, including SCIEX, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, and some others. We expect those to gain traction here in the second half.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMaybe to put some numbers around it for you, Tycho, that step up from one hald to two half to go from down low single to up low single in life sciences, call it $150 million, roughly. I think if you are kind of trying to bridge that, I would say that genomics, again, remember the first half, we had those two large customers really fall off. I think that's probably 1/3 of it. I would say that we are assuming China, especially China and tools with some comps, easier comps and a better funding environment is another 1/3 of it. Then lastly, new products and kind of other things is the final 1/3.\nAthird, a third, a third between China, genomics, new products, other, that's sort of what we're assuming and have baked into the model from the step up from one half to two half of roughly $150 million.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Then one quick follow-up. It sounds like you're not flagging any incremental headwinds on volume-based procurement. Obviously, one of your peers did last week. Maybe just get us comfortable that that's not a lingering issue that could get worse.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nIn China, volume-based procurement and the reimbursement changes was essentially what we thought in Q2 and for the first half of the year. In fact, volume was consistent with Q1 and our expectations. There's really no change to our expectations of $150 million adverse impact from volume-based procurement in 2025.\nNow, under the hood there, there's been some recent policy changes, which largely did not affect us because they're really geared to different aspects of the testing menu, which we actually don't have. It's possible that different companies experience different things here. For us, we saw the quarter develop as expected. Volumes were consistent with Q1. We don't have a different perspective on the $150 million here for the year on volume-based procurement.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Tycho.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Vijay.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research, Evercore\n\nHi, Rainer. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats to both Gugino and McGrew. Maybe one on biotech for you, Rainer. Guidance 7% was maintained. You look at your Q2 and Q3 assumptions here for 6% implied growth. For Q4 should accelerate high singles, maybe 8% or 9%.\nWhat is the guide assuming for Q4 acceleration in biotech? Is that maybe China coming back, small biopharma coming back, or maybe equip turning around?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nNo, I mean, I think I would say that we've got high single-digit core for both Q3 and Q4. I don't know that there's any real material changes that we have tried to bake in by a certain geography or in equipment or anything like that. I would say we're just assuming a fairly steady environment, which is we've seen really good double-digit type growth out of consumables. Equipment has been pretty muted, and we expect that to continue here throughout the back half of the year as we work through. I don't think it's a massive change for us.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. This is not about a step up in activity level. This is just the normal seasonality, Vijay, that you see with Q3 being sort of the lowest level of activity in bioprocessing and some other markets as well. Then as the fourth quarter kicks in, that's always been and continues to be the largest quarter for us from an activity level.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. Then maybe my follow-up sort of related question here. Was there any pull forward either in academic channels or biopharma channels? I think that question comes up because of tariffs. Was there any customer change in customer behavior? I think given all of these macro situations, right, is this biotech thing sort of high singles? Is this now a sustainable number, or is macro still sort of an overhang when you think about 2026?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSo, Vijay, we haven't seen any meaningful pull forward.\nWe just haven't.\nWe're often asked, and our numbers, and our surveys, and our customer conversations don't indicate that. We think the bioprocessing market has for years, and the activity levels continue to confirm that this is a high single-digit growth market, and that'll continue. Now, as it relates to 2026, we obviously have still half a year ahead of us in what is a pretty dynamic operating environment with some questions that still need to be answered, as I spoke to earlier. It is our plan to provide some preliminary thoughts on 2026 for Danaher overall during our October earnings call. We just want to see here how the Q3 plays out. Then in October, we'll give you our preliminary thoughts on 2026.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research, Evercore\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Vijay.\n\nOperator\n\nNext, we'll go to Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Puneet.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks, Rainer.\nMatt and Matt, my congrats also. Just wondering, I know you talked about tariffs, but just I wanted to clarify. You previously sized at about $350 million in tariff costs with room to mitigate via supply chain and optimization. Can you talk to us about the updated number there and just given the interquarter changes with US-China trade policy and the 25% tariffs going to now 30%?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. I would say that from a number perspective, we're still at kind of a couple hundred million dollars of exposure right now today. That's what we would think of versus the $350 million. I mean, and that obviously could change in very short order.\nAs far as kind of China and the tariff there, we've got a lot of different things that we can do both internally that we have control over, and then also other levers that were available to us within the quarter that we were able to use to effectively not have to charge our customers in tariff. We took advantage of those levers. Ttherefore, from our perspective, as we've always said, we plan on offsetting all the tariffs, and we only plan on offsetting them if we have to pay it. We will try and pass that along somehow, some way. If we don't pay it, we're not going to try and pass it along. That was a net neutral event for us in China.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nGot it. Thanks, Matt.\nThen just briefly on a question that is on minds of investors, just given the impact that has happened in the gene therapy market. One of your customers has seen suspension of their therapies from FDA on safety concerns. The question is, how broad is the exposure to gene therapies? I totally recognize that innovation doesn't come without risk. Just how are you thinking about this risk overall and the AAV exposure that you have with respect to Aldevron and also the Cytiva segment as well? Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGene therapy, so AAV-based gene therapy, as you were just suggesting, is really in the early innings, Puneet. This is going to have its vacillations, two steps forward, one step back. Of course, what we just saw here in the news is a step back.\nIt's not to say that that therapy is not a very interesting and important alternative here for all kinds of different disease forms that are out there, so specifically some genetic diseases. I think as we think of the broader picture, genomics is in the early innings and has the potential to be an exciting and effective treatment regimen. Now, as we think about our own exposure here across Danaher, we're not talking about more than a couple hundred dollars. Keep in mind, we're a protein house here with really 85% of what we do focused on proteins. Of course, that's a well-established market, and that's what drives our business and our earnings. Now, we typically talk about these things more narrowly, but if we think about our guidance, and you mentioned Sarepta here and Aldevron, our guidance in the market is essentially playing out as we expected.\nThe Aldevron Sarepta revenue, we expect to be $30 million for the full year with a minimal contribution here in the second half. Our guide contemplated and did not expect significant revenue contribution from that particular therapy.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nGot it. Helpful.\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Puneet.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we'll go to Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Dan.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. I was hoping, Rainer, that you could elaborate on trends in China outside of diagnostics. Is that business turning a corner? If you could elaborate further because you touched on it briefly a few times in the prepared remarks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSo our China business outside of diagnostics has been firming up. The bioprocessing business has shown slight growth here in the quarter. We see the biotech and pharma market there showing some more solid activity levels. So we do see that in bioprocessing.\nAs we think of life science tools, we did see more stimulus activity. That's flowing through not just orders and revenues. It's still not at normal activity levels, but we do see it firming up. We're encouraged by what we see here for those two businesses. That's reflected here in our second-half view. You'll recall Tycho's question here. The firming up of China in life science tools is a part of that.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Just a clarification question for Matt McGrew. Matt, did I hear you correctly that at current foreign exchange rates, that your guide would be $0.15 higher?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWith both the respiratory and the current FX, probably $0.15, $0.20. I'm not sure I'd say that the guide's higher, but that's what the math would imply that we have not, if you would, not flowed through.\nYeah, between those two, $15 to 20, and we haven't flowed that through.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks a bunch.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYep. Thanks, Dan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we'll go to Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question, Matt and Matt, obviously, congratulations. Rainer, I wanted to just go back to bioprocess orders, if you don't mind. I just wanted to confirm sort of Mike's earlier question. I think you said the book-to-bill was around one. Equipment more lumpy. Because, I mean, if I look back at the Q1 transcript, I think you talked about the seventh consecutive quarter of a book-to-bill that was solidly over one. I'm not trying to nitpick. I'm just trying to clarify. Maybe that was related to consumables. Just maybe if you can expand upon that a bit.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThe trends are really very comparable here,\nI would tell you that this book-to-bill is not a perfect measure. That lumpiness, especially with larger orders, sometimes does not play through. What we see here is consistent with what we've seen in prior quarters. It's around one. Yes, we saw some lumpiness here in equipment and some larger orders. But the activity level is very comparable.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Then maybe moving over to Cepheid again. I know you had a nice quarter. I think it was low double digits, ex-COVID. Could you just speak to kind of what's baked in for the 25 guide, how we think about that low double digits continuing or changing as we get into the back half of the year? I know you gave some color in the prepared remarks, but any further color there would be great. Thanks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure.\nWell, as you said, overall, Cepheid had exceeded our expectations on a little bit better respiratory and double-digit non-respiratory growth. In fact, the non-respiratory reagents grew low double digits in the quarter, Q2. We did see strength across the test menu with double-digit or better, I would say, or better growth in sexual health, virology, and hospital-acquired infections. We actually expect that strong non-respiratory demand to continue in the low to mid-teens for the full year. The reason is we continue to expand that installed base, particularly at large IDNs that are standardizing across their network as they go a little bit closer to patients in their satellite settings. It just shows how Cepheid's strategy is playing out. I mean, we see increasing menu adoption and utilization of the existing installed base, and we continue to expand that.\nThen with that, we see the pull-through of assays such as the hospital-acquired infections and virology.Then lastly, this recent menu expansion around our MVP, so that's the Multiplex Vaginitis Panel. That's up over 75% in the US. We feel very good about the non-respiratory portfolio continuing to track at higher growth levels, mid-teens.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next, we'll go to Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan for our last question.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Rachel.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Good morning, you guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to echo everyone's earlier comments and congratulations to both of the Matts here. My first question, I just wanted to dig into some of the trends on bioprocessing equipment. You've highlighted that revenues were weak and orders were lumpy in the quarter given some of that global trade uncertainty, but you said that the funnel remains strong as well.\nIf we look at some of these press releases on companies building out additional capacity, I just wanted to get your thoughts on how are you thinking about the timing of recovery on bioprocessing equipment given those dynamics? Are you assuming recovery in equipment in the back half of the year on a revenues basis? Then how are you thinking about the opportunity for onshoring and reshoring longer term?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rachel. Well, it is as you suggested here that larger projects are in discussion, and the decisions are being delayed, certainly for the reason that I talked earlier: trade policy, tariffs, and a couple other points. What's also important to note is that the reality of this is that it takes a number of years to build new pharma manufacturing plants. That building that capacity is going to take some time.\nIt's really too early to determine what all these large announcements will, how they play out, and when that money flows. Now, that said, I mean, Cytiva is very well positioned here to capitalize as these decisions start being taken and move through their CapEx processes. Because of the breadth of our portfolio, our scale, and of course, the global footprint, we can do this anywhere in the world. Now, to your point earlier about how do we think about the guide for 2025 here, we expect 2025 is going to be a down year for equipment. We do not expect in our guide a significant step up here. When I talk about the improved funnel activity, what we do expect here is the continued small capacity expansions that you see where the decisions are much easier to make in existing plant footprints.\nWe'll see as we get to October here, we'll talk a little bit more about how we're thinking about 2026.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan",
    "content2": "Great. Then for my follow-up, I wanted to dig on respiratory a little bit more. You raised the endemic rate on respiratory to $1.7 billion earlier this year. You typically see that split roughly 50/50 between the first half and back half. Just given your tracking to $900 million at this point, that's slightly ahead of expectations relative to the $1.7 billion assumption for the year. Now, I know it's too early and you guys are kind of pushing towards that Q3 call in terms of how you're thinking about respiratory assumptions, but just can you walk us through, would you consider revisiting that endemic rate as we get towards year-end? Would you potentially revisit it for a fifth time?\nThen can you remind us, what are you currently assuming on that $1.7 billion number in terms of the mix on four-in-one versus COVID-only tests?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nCFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. No, I mean, I think the way to think about respiratory is we've got a guide that is $1.7 billion. We've been kind of guiding to that really for the last probably three years. It's been a little bit better the last couple of years. We are not. That is not a number that we are completely beholden to. I think if we start to feel as though that number is a little bit higher, we would sign up to that. I think we've had those conversations. I think I'd like to see how this year goes. This year started in January. That felt much more like a typical sort of a typical respiratory season.\nIt did get a little higher for a peak higher there, but it followed a more similar pattern than we had seen before. I think if we can get another year behind us, we'd be open to revisiting that number for sure. As far as the $1.7 billion, like you said, we're a little north of $900 million. We'll see how Q4 plays out. That's usually the big quarter, Q4 and Q1, as you know. See also the difficulty with respiratory straddling sort of two years does make it a little bit difficult. That's kind of where we're at. Four-in-one, I think we're at this point probably 75%, 80% four-in-one. We do do some regular COVID-only, typically mostly. I shouldn't say a lot of it is in Europe, but there is some in the US too that will do that.\nI mean, that's basically been our mix for the last couple of years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'd like to turn the call over to John Bedford for any closing remarks.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, Margo, and everybody. We'll be around all day for questions. Bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's program. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our Q1 revenue, earnings, and cash flow all came in ahead of our expectations, highlighted by continuing strong momentum in bioprocessing and higher-than-anticipated respiratory demand at Cepheid. Our team executed well, leveraging the Danaher Business System to accelerate innovation, drive share gains, and deliver meaningful productivity improvements. Now, as you all know, the macro backdrop has become more dynamic since the start of the year, with rising geopolitical and trade tensions contributing to greater uncertainty across global markets.\nSo before we get into our first quarter results, I'd like to share a few thoughts on how we're approaching this environment. First off, we're navigating this evolving landscape from a position of strength, supported by our talented team and with the Danaher Business System as our driving force. Now it's early, and the macro environment remains dynamic, but it's in times like these that Danaher's positioning and capabilities truly stand out. Our businesses are well-positioned in attractive, typically non-discretionary end markets with strong secular growth drivers, united by a common set of more durable business models. In fact, more than 80% of our revenues are recurring, the majority of which are consumables that are specified into regulated manufacturing processes or specific to the equipment that we supply. It's not just the relative durability of our portfolio; it's how we run the business using the Danaher Business System.\nWe're leveraging DBS to proactively manage our supply chains and drive process improvements to help ensure we continue to reliably support our customers each and every day. Now, at the same time, we're taking thoughtful actions to protect our financial position, including addressing structural costs while continuing to invest for the long term. Now, looking into Q2 and beyond, our focus remains clear: delivering for our customers, supporting our associates, and creating long-term value for our shareholders. We've operated through uncertain times before and have come out stronger than we entered. Our team is accustomed to tackling challenges head-on and turning them into opportunities, and we expect that mindset and momentum to continue as we move forward. So with that, let's take a closer look at our Q1 2025 results. Sales were $5.7 billion in the first quarter, and core revenue was flat year-over-year.\nGeographically, core revenues in developed markets were down slightly, with a low single-digit decline in North America and a low single-digit increase in Western Europe. High-growth markets were up low single digits, with solid performance outside of China more than offsetting a high single-digit decline within China. Declines in China were primarily driven by volume-based procurement and reimbursement changes implemented in late 2024, which impacted our diagnostics businesses, while the rest of the portfolio collectively delivered modest growth. Our gross profit margin for the first quarter of 61.2% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, and our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.6% was down 50 basis points as the favorable impact of higher volume leverage in our biotechnology segment and disciplined cost management was more than offset by productivity investments to reduce our structural costs. Adjusted diluted net earnings for common share were $1.88.\nWe generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, resulting in a free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio of more than 110%. As I mentioned earlier, we're continuing to make significant investments in long-term growth initiatives across Danaher. During the first quarter, the investments we've made over the past several years resulted in several impactful new product launches. These innovations are not only reinforcing our long-term competitive advantages, they're also helping customers improve quality, yields, and reduce costs while helping bring new therapies and diagnostic tests to market faster and more effectively. Let me highlight a few of these key launches. In biotechnology, Cytiva introduced the 500-liter and 2,000-liter formats of the Xcellerex X-Platform bioreactor at the INTERPHEX trade show earlier this month.\nNow, the X-Platform is designed to increase cell culture productivity and process intensity, helping drive higher yields while reducing the time and cost of biologic drug manufacturing. With these next-generation technologies, scientists can now seamlessly scale from 50 L-2,000 L to meet growing demands ranging from clinical trials to commercial production. In life sciences, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences added spectral flow cytometry capabilities to the CytoFLEX platform with the launch of the mosaic spectral detection module. The mosaic enables researchers to switch seamlessly between conventional and spectral flow cytometry while leveraging machine learning-assisted data analysis for more precise characterization of multiple parameters simultaneously. Now, these capabilities are especially valuable in the fields of oncology, where they facilitate tumor cell profiling and may also help uncover novel therapeutic targets.\nIn diagnostics, Leica Biosystems leveraged the capabilities of our newly established Center for Enabling Precision Medicine to launch two new primary antibodies, PD-L1 and HER2, widely used in studying breast, lung, and other cancers, with the goal of helping customers accelerate cancer research and therapy development. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our biotechnology segment increased 7%, with bioprocessing up high single digits and discovery and medical up low single digits. In bioprocessing, we were very encouraged by the better-than-expected start to the year. Consistent positive momentum in our order book continued into the first quarter, with orders increasing sequentially for the seventh consecutive quarter. Revenue growth in the quarter was led by low double-digit growth in consumables, with particularly robust demand for commercialized therapies.\nOn the equipment front, funnel and order trends are improving, but revenue declined as expected. Now, the long-term health of the biologic market is incredibly strong, with a growing number of therapies advancing through development and into commercial production. Given the significant growth opportunities ahead, we're investing to help ensure our leading bioprocessing franchise continues supporting customers as they develop and deliver life-saving therapies to patients. In addition to the new product innovation I mentioned earlier, we've invested approximately $2 billion since 2020 to expand capacity and help ensure supply security for both us and our customers. These additions include new single-use technology facilities in South Carolina, filter capacity expansions in Florida, and a cell culture media expansion in Utah, all of which are now online, as well as a resins manufacturing plant in Michigan that is nearing completion.\nNear-term, this capacity is critical for supporting existing customer demand, but it's equally important to support Cytiva's robust long-term growth outlook and illustrates our in-region, for-region manufacturing strategy. Now, turning to our life sciences segment, core revenue decreased by 4%. Core revenue in our life sciences instrument businesses collectively declined low single digits. Demand across pharma, clinical, and applied markets, which make up the majority of our revenues in these businesses, held up well globally, while academic and government demand softened through the quarter, particularly in the United States. In China, demand remained stable sequentially, and we were encouraged to see a modest benefit from stimulus programs. Core revenue in our genomics consumables businesses declined in the quarter. We saw continued positive momentum in next-generation sequencing products, but this was more than offset by weaker demand for plasmids and mRNA at two of our larger customers.\nNow, in March, IDT announced a partnership with Elegen, a leader in next-generation DNA manufacturing, to offer customers early access to Elegen's Infinia plasmid DNA. This collaboration enables IDT to deliver cost-effective, long, and high-complexity clonal genes alongside its highly differentiated portfolio of custom synthetic biology solutions. With Infinia DNA, life science and drug discovery researchers can integrate high-quality DNA directly into their synthetic biology workflows with minimal or no cloning, saving weeks or even months of development time. Now, moving to our diagnostics segment, core revenue declined 1.5%. Core revenue in our clinical diagnostics businesses was essentially flat, with mid-single-digit growth outside of China. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics had a solid quarter with both instruments and consumables growing mid-single digits outside of China, reflecting strong demand and continued traction in commercial execution. Now, during the quarter, Beckman Coulter received a 510(k) clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration for the DxC 500i Integrated Chemistry and Immunoassay Analyzer. The DxC 500i is purpose-built to improve efficiency and meet the unique workflow needs for low-volume laboratories, such as those in community hospitals. This approval strengthens Beckman's position across the healthcare network, enabling it to offer a comprehensive portfolio of solutions for low, mid, and high-throughput core labs. In molecular diagnostics, Cepheid's respiratory revenue exceeded our expectations, driven by elevated levels of circulating respiratory illness paired with continued share gains. Strong growth across Cepheid's non-respiratory test menu was led by mid-teens growth in virology. In sexual health, US revenue for our Multiplex Vaginitis Panel was up 40%, as women's health clinicians are increasingly recognizing the value that rapid diagnostics at the point of care brings to patients.\nCepheid's healthcare system and integrated delivery network customers continue to increase instrument placements at alternative care sites, such as clinics and urgent care centers. So, as healthcare decision-makers work to most efficiently allocate resources, Cepheid's point-of-care molecular testing is proving increasingly valuable, offering greater efficiency through fewer total tests, higher rates of correct treatment, and ultimately lower treatment costs compared to other testing strategies. So now let's frame how we're thinking about the second quarter and the full year 2025. We expect end-market demand remains relatively consistent with the first quarter for the remainder of 2025. Regarding tariffs, based on what is currently implemented, we believe we can largely offset the impact from these tariffs through a combination of supply chain adjustments, surcharges, manufacturing footprint changes, and other cost actions. Now, for the full year 2025, there is essentially no change to our previous expectations.\nWe continue to expect core revenue growth of approximately 3%, which assumes better performance in our bioprocessing business will be offset by slightly more modest expectations for life sciences. Additionally, we're initiating full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $7.60-$7.75. Given the current environment, we believe providing adjusted EPS guidance offers the best anchor point for assessing business performance and will provide better clarity for our investors. In the second quarter, we expect core revenue to grow in the low single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect the second quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 25.5%, reflecting normal seasonality in Cepheid's respiratory business and continued productivity investments. So, to wrap it up, we're confident in our positioning in what could be choppy waters, and we're leveraging the Danaher Business System to ensure we navigate this environment from a position of strength.\nDBS is what enables us to turn challenges into opportunities, drive meaningful productivity gains, and support our customers when it matters most. At the same time, the strength of our balance sheet and financial position allows us to invest for the future, both organically and through strategic capital deployment, to further enhance our portfolio and our competitive positioning. Now, as we move forward, we believe the combination of our talented team, the differentiation of our portfolio, and our strong financial profile will enable us to continue generating sustainable long-term value for shareholders in 2025 and beyond. So, with that, I'll turn it back over to you, John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rainer. Operator, that concludes our formal comments. We're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And as a reminder, that is star one to ask a question. And our first question will come from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.\nYour line is open.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the strong start, guys. Rainer, first, I want to start off on bioprocess. You just had a lot of comments there on the order strength you saw in the quarter. You're raising the full-year bioprocess expectation modestly. Just wondering, is that coming more from the consumable side of things? Is it equipment? I think when we spoke on the fourth quarter call, you talked a little bit about how you want to see some of the trends continuing. So, could you just talk about what you've seen over the last three months that gives you a little bit more confidence in bioprocess? And if there's any change that you've noticed from customer order behaviors in the last month or two, just given what's going on globally? Thanks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure, Mike. Thank you, and good morning.\nLook, we had a solid start here to the year, and the bioprocessing business is clearly a part of that. We're really encouraged by the continued positive momentum we saw here in Q1. So, to your point around orders, we saw strong orders and revenue performance, which we now expect to be high single digits core revenue growth for 2025. Those orders grew sequentially now for the seventh consecutive quarter, with the book-to-bill solidly over one. Now, consumables continue to lead the way globally, no doubt about that. We saw low double-digit growth in consumables, which was driven by strong commercial demand at large pharma and CDMO customers. Smaller customers were stable, but still below historical levels. Now, as we think about equipment, it's not quite back to normal, but our order and funnels are a little better.\nAnd I suspect the current environment's probably causing a couple of order delays there. But our commercial programs here on the equipment side and the demand related to them remains healthy. Now, we haven't seen any meaningful change in demand from the current tariff situation or reshoring efforts, but we're really well-positioned for that if and when that occurs. So, if you put it all together, we're really encouraged by the strong start to the year. And we reaffirm our belief that bioprocessing is a high single-digit grower, both in 2025 and for the long term.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Thanks. And for my follow-up, I mean, you just touched on tariffs. You spoke about it earlier. In the 10-Q, you called out several hundred million gross impact, but it sounds like you're offsetting most of it.\nCould you just, between those various levers you talked about, supply chain, the pricing surcharges, the manufacturing footprint, any sense you can give us for how you're using those levers, which ones are giving you a little bit more confidence and ability to offset that? And I think the risk with tariffs is, right now, we're in a little bit of a holding period. If that comes back or if additional tariffs are implemented, just give us some visibility into your confidence to offset that in this dynamic environment. Thanks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMike, we have a number of levers there, but it's important to think about this in the following frame. And including that, we have to avoid some false precision here, given some of the assumptions involved. But the way we sit here today, we think our tariffs could be several hundred million dollars of impact, something like $350 million.\nBut actually, we don't think that the current state, so where we sit today, is where things ultimately end up. But regardless, we're really well-positioned to largely offset these headwinds. And here are some of the levers that we think about. For instance, we've been executing to regionalize our manufacturing network of over 100 plants for several years now, which allows us to rebalance these trade flows over time. Think China for China. I talked about the billions that we've invested here to increase our US capacity. So, we have a combination of both short-term and long-term countermeasures, such as surcharges, supply chain management, again, cost actions, but also relocating manufacturing. And of course, DBS is a real advantage to us here as well as we're focused on this topic.\nSo, again, as things change here over time, we've got a number of levers that we can deploy to address the tariff situation.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nAnd if, Mike, if things get worse here or higher, or the actions that we find aren't enough, I mean, we can be much more aggressive if we need to be. We've got all those levers to pull. I would say everything is on the table here in that situation, if that's what we get to. So, I think we'd be looking at more significant surcharges. I think we'd be going after costs even harder, and we'd probably be looking at our manufacturing footprint even harder. So, everything would be on the table at that point, but we feel like if that's what we're given, that's what we're going to deal with, and we'll make it work.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director of Global Equities, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Want to probe a little bit on the last point on tariff offsets, pricing in particular. I think in Q1, obviously, you've got the VBP headwinds on the diagnostic side, but I think biotech and life science pricing was a bit below what we'd expected. Can you maybe just talk on your comfort and your ability to take price, areas where you think you can push it more, and maybe the mechanism to do it? Is this going to be kind of rolling over the course of the year? And what is your pricing assumption for the year at this point?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nI mean, I think from a price perspective, yeah, Tycho, like you said, you saw sort of a little bit below where we've been historically, but I'm not sure it's meaningfully below. So, I think our price for the year is kind of flattish is the assumption at this point. And that's largely due to the VBP that we've got already baked in. So, that kind of brings everything else from a little bit of growth in price down to flat. So, now, that would not include anything to do with surcharges or tariffs. That is sort of not included in that concept or that number. So, that would be something in addition to that would be out there. But as you know, a surcharge really sort of is priced with no OP associated with it.\nSo, I think from a normal perspective, how we think of price, that's kind of where I would put us.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director of Global Equities, Jefferies\n\nOkay. And then following up on bioprocess, obviously, equipment has kind of lagged in terms of the recovery. We've seen, I think, $150 billion in new CapEx announced, including Roche today in the US. When do you think that becomes a tailwind for you guys? You're obviously in a great position. Is that 2026, do you think you start to see some benefit from some of that new build-out? Do you think it's 2027? What's kind of the time horizon for you guys?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nTycho, it's a little bit early to say right now, but generally speaking, where existing plants are being debottlenecked, so additional capacity being added to existing footprint, that will come a little bit quicker here. We're not yet seeing that in our orders.\nAnd then, as you think about greenfield investments, that's likely going to take a little bit longer. But as you say, we feel as though we're very well-positioned there to support those expansions right here where they're being built.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director of Global Equities, Jefferies\n\nOkay. And then just last one, crazy I have to ask this, given all the moving pieces, anything you can say on kind of the long-range outlook in 2026? The street's got you just under 7%. I think that's the big debate for tools is, in general, can this group get back to high single-digit growth? So, anything from your perspective sitting here in April that concerns you for next year?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, there's nothing that we see in our end markets that makes us think differently about our long-range plans. And as we've talked about before, some of the headwinds that we've talked about for 2025, we believe to be transient.\nAnd once we comp those, we expect to be back at those higher growth rates for the long-term plan. So, we believe the end markets and how we're dialed into those with our leading franchises, plus getting through some of these one-time headwinds, leaves us well-positioned here for the long term.\n\nTycho Peterson\n\nManaging Director of Global Equities, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Tycho.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, Rainer, Matt, and John.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, guys, can you give us a little bit more color on China? And when I think about the VBP and what it's done to your diagnostics business there, how do you guys think about the algorithm of kind of long-term growth there versus kind of the reality that maybe the pricing environment is never going to make it a very attractive business?\nBut I suppose there's a certain level of scale where maybe it is again. But how do you guys think about China in that context?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, Scott, I think longer term, we believe China will be either the second or the largest diagnostic market in the world. We believe we have a real role to play there. The pricing adjustments that you've seen really bring China closer to what global pricing is in other markets and continues to be an attractive end market for us. So, as we digest both the reimbursement as well as the volume-based procurement topics here in 2025, we look forward to having strong business development here in China.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nFair enough. As for balance sheet optionality, guys, I think you bought back something like $1 billion in the quarter of stock. I think you did something like $6 billion last year.\nBut I mean, the market has re-rated lower. Presumably, assets have re-rated lower in the M&A world, although we don't have a lot of data points there yet. How do you guys think about that environment, I guess, just overall, the balance sheet optionality and what your preferences are here in 2025?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, Scott, I mean, as you know, our bias is to M&A and our capital allocation. We continue to evaluate all the capital allocation alternatives. They compete against each other for our investments. No doubt that the current environment has pulled in valuations. We're going to have to measure the degree of uncertainty in relation to those valuations. But one thing's for sure, we're going to stick with our framework, attractive end market, outstanding asset. Then, of course, the valuation framework has to work as well.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nScott, we've seen this before back in the days. You get a shock like this, right? And there's sort of an initial freeze where everybody tries to figure out what's going to happen. And as we sort of work our way through the process of how this is all going to work itself out, that's when I think having the balance sheet that we've got from a position of strength here, we have seen historically that this is a really good time to do M&A once the winds start to blow, if you will. So, I like where we're at. We've got the ability to be aggressive there when stuff does break itself free, probably just the beginning here. But if we keep going down the path, likely a very good buying opportunity in the future.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Makes sense. Best of luck, guys. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning, guys. And thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to talk about two topics. One is on the genomics segment, and one is on earnings guidance. So, first, on genomics, it seems like Aldevron remains under pressure due to destocking at one large gene therapy and one large mRNA customer. I just want to make sure this is a continuation of trend and not really anything new in terms of a further deterioration relative to recent quarters. I don't think there's anything new there, but just want to make sure and kind of building off of that, when do you move past that dynamic? So, that's the first topic. The second is on earnings. You gave us top-line guidance.\nYou gave us a lot of detail below the operating line. I don't think you gave us full-year operating margin targets, but I think mathematically, it looks like you're maintaining the 28.5 target that you talked about coming off of the Q4 call. If that's right, I'm just wondering kind of where the offsets are built into the P&L, especially given that in Q1, you came in, I think, about 300 basis points ahead of operating margin targets. So, I just want to see what the offsets are. And is that a function of prudent conservatism given the environment we're in, or is there something else we should be contemplating? Thank you.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, no, I think you're right, Doug, on the margin side.\nPart of the reason that we gave an EPS guide was we just felt like in this environment, there are going to be moving pieces in your P&L depending on sort of how you tackle these tariffs, some surcharges, costs out, etc. So, I just think we felt like an adjusted EPS guide was a place for us to anchor and make sure that as things move in the P&L, as they play out during the year, there was a point of anchor, which is why we sort of did the EPS guide for everybody. As far as what that margin translates to, you're about right with the 20.5 that you talked about. So, I don't think that that's different.\nAs far as offsets, I think if you sort of, I think what you're kind of getting at is, look, we had a $0.25 beat here in Q1 and probably have some FX tailwinds. And we've got a little bit of cost-out tailwind behind us too. And you start to add those up, you probably can get to a number that's above that range. And I think your math is correct there. But we do have some cushion in this environment. Probably, I think Rainer and I believe that that strikes the right balance given the uncertainty in the macro today. A lot of positives to start the year here. We told you guys we were going to get after that cost structure. We're making really good progress on that. Got after it in the first quarter. Gives us a head start as we head into the year.\nBut in this current world we are in, I think it makes sense for us to frame the guide of $60 to $775. We've got some cushion there, obviously, to the degree things sort of get worse. And if they don't, and we see there's probably further upside. I think you're right. If things don't get any worse from here. So, let's see how things progress. Lots to do on the policy front to get us to some resolution. But that's sort of our philosophy on how we're thinking about this guide.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nDoug, and as it relates to Aldevron, as you suggest, there's really nothing new there. We anticipated this to occur, and we see those two customers progressing as we thought. And we expect that to get better here, to your question, in the second half of the year as we comp through it.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, Rainer. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. My first question on the tariff math here, the $350 million of that gross headwinds, is that a full-year impact or a partial-year impact? And maybe if you could parse out, is this majority of this coming from China? What is being assumed for ex-China? And is tariff the primary reason why second-quarter margins are trending down Q on Q?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nLet me start with the last one. Q on Q trend down, that has nothing to do with tariffs. So, the Q2 sequential trend down has everything to do with lower respiratory volume at Cepheid. We've got an assumption of Q2 revenue for respiratory of about $250 million, down from $625 million.\nVery similar dynamic to what we saw last year when respiratory had that same big step down. So, unfortunately, that is just part of our seasonality now if you do get a good start to the respiratory season in Q1. Also, in Q2, there is some restructuring. As we talked about, we are getting after some of the cost structure, in particular in diagnostics, which is probably where it will show up the most. Given the VBP headwinds there and some of the things that they're doing to globally recenter, if you will, some of their go-to-market exercises, that is where we're seeing the biggest piece. So, that's sort of Q2. As far as I think about the 350, that is a rest-of-year tariffs-in-place-now number. So, that's just kind of what we expect for here in 2025.\nAs far as what we might see in 2026 for a full year, I wouldn't take that and multiply it by two. We're a long way away from December 2025 or January 2026 or December 2025. So, I think, very difficult to kind of just double that number and assume that's what it's going to be. We're going to need to get a little bit more information before we can validate that for next year. And then sort of where is that exposure coming from was your other question. I think the easiest, the frame that we sort of have is it's kind of 50% of it is coming from, of our headwind, if you will, is coming from US to China. And most of that is diagnostics where we sell into from an asset perspective. The other half of that exposure is mostly US from Europe.\nI mean, there's some others, obviously, with the 10% global, but the easiest way to think about it is half is US to China. The other half is US from Europe.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's extremely helpful, man. Rainer, maybe one for you on biopharma. There is some of the pharma customers talking about potential R&D cuts if they face some tariffs. What is Danaher's total exposure to pharma, pharma overall, including bioprocessing? And how much of that is pure production or manufacturing, which shouldn't be impacted even if R&D goes down? Maybe some commentary on R&D versus production.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nAs you think about life science R&D for pharma, that is really represented primarily in our instruments group there. And it probably represents 1/3 of that. So, this is relatively small exposure. Keep in mind, our life science instruments, so the research tools exposure overall for Danaher is less than 10% of sales.\nThen, once again, now we're talking about 1/3 of that. Also, if you think about our performance here in Q1, we actually saw that pharma segment be fairly robust here. We haven't seen yet any additional deterioration as it relates to that particular segment. So, pharma, we see steady and investing independent of what one pharma company does versus another. But overall, we see the segment is fairly robust here from a research perspective. We continue to see bioprocessing. As I mentioned, we took up the guide here. We're really encouraged by what we see there. Yeah.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nAs far as Vijay and kind of the exposure-wise, I mean, maybe the easiest way to think about it is bioprocessing is $6 billion of revenue.\nAnd that's probably the one that you're most worried about given the size of how big that is versus anything else we might have in life sciences or elsewhere. And that's all essentially commercial, right? 75% of that is going to be on market or phase III. So, I mean, that's kind of the frame of how I think about our pharma exposure.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Good morning, you guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to dig into the life sciences performance. So, you took down your assumptions for the life sciences guidance to now be flat for the year versus the prior assumption of low single-digit growth. You also called out some of the weakness in US academics and government.\nSo, I was wondering if you could unpack that for us a bit. What types of products are you seeing the most weakness in in that research market? And then specifically regarding US academics and government, how much was it down in the quarter? And what are you assuming for the full year for US academics and government, especially in light of the reports last week that the new administration is going to be proposing a 40% cut to NIH?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSo, to start with, morning, Rachel. And just a reminder, as I just mentioned to Vijay, we're talking life science tools here, which are less than 10% of our revenue. So, keep that in mind as you read across. For Q1, our life sciences finished modestly better than anticipated. And the reasons are that the comps are beginning to ease.\nTo your point, outside of US government and academic segment, the market conditions are stable. And why is that? Because we've dialed our portfolio into what we believe are the more attractive market segments here for the long term. Pharma, clinical, and applied are by far how we've positioned our business. Now, again, to your point, academic and government demand did soften through the quarter. That's particularly a US phenomenon. Other geographies were a little more stable there. So, as we think about the guide here in 2025, we have taken account of the fact that we expect the US government and academic market to continue to soften with the noise that we're hearing. And that is basically offset by the strength that we're seeing in bioprocessing.\nThe kinds of instruments and the kinds of products that we're talking about here are the instruments that you're familiar with in research, but also then some of the laboratory consumables and reagents that you would use in that research with some of these government, US government-funded labs.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nRachel, just a word on the academic. I mean, this is not a huge number for us, obviously. I think for Q1, it was kind of down mid-single-digit type range, just to give you some sense of it. Now, orders were getting worse than that. So, I think that's the read-through, if you will, to why we take a bit more cautious stance. But again, this is a pretty small number for us.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. I think that's a good answer.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. Direct NIH, Rachel, is less than 1% of our revenue. And government and academic globally is low single-digit percentage.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect.\nYeah. Thanks for that color. Maybe just to follow up on some of the earlier answers regarding bioprocessing. So, you mentioned that book-to-bill is comfortably above one this quarter, and that orders grew sequentially for the seventh quarter in a row. So, digging into that a little bit more, last quarter, you noted that bioprocessing orders grew high single digits sequentially. So, did you see orders grow high single digits again this quarter sequentially, or was order growth slightly less given that standard seasonality that you typically see? And then on a go-forward basis, should we expect that bioprocessing orders continue to step up throughout the year, or have we kind of reset back to this normal order seasonality at this point? Thanks.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll say a word on orders and the expectations. We guide the revenue here.\nSo, from an order perspective, we're not going to kind of have an order guide and a revenue guide. But like we said, we think it's going to be high single digits from a growth perspective, and the orders, obviously, will support that. So, as far as this quarter, it was sort of in that range from a sequential perspective. I think the really good news from my chair here is that a book-to-bill that was, as we said, solidly over one is encouraging. That is a good first step here to support the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Thanks for the questions.\nMaybe just on the life sciences guide, I know you gave some color earlier on, Aldevron, but Q2 guide down low single, I think mid-single is a little bit below us. And then the full-year guide would imply a nice step up in the back half of the year. So, just can you walk through some of the visibility and drivers of the step up in the back half of the year?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. I mean, from a number perspective, as I think about it, I mean, I think about the seasonality both for life sciences, but just generally speaking for Danaher. I look at the seasonality last year. And from a revenue perspective, it was kind of first half was 48%, and the second half was something like 52%. So, it's pretty similar here in what we're assuming on a revenue perspective in 2025 at the Danaher level.\nSo, I think that's kind of the way I look at it. There's some puts and takes, I'm sure, within the segments. But just in total, I feel like we're kind of in the same zone that we were here last year. And it kind of has been that way historically, frankly, if we go way back, but those are different times.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thanks, Matt. And then maybe just on China, I know you talked about, I think, VBP, things looked pretty good. Could you just unpack it a little bit how we're thinking about the rest of the year? We got a lot of questions on just the tit for tat here with the tariffs and kind of what China is doing, maybe to take a more sharper view against kind of Western vendors.\nSo, just if you can unpack a little bit how to think about the rest of the year and then kind of any activity from the government in kind of reaction to the tariff wars? Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSo, we're seeing a fair amount of stability other than this volume-based procurement and reimbursement issue for diagnostics and patient volumes. So, patient volumes continue to be strong. We don't see China looking to move Western suppliers out of their supply chain. Certainly, like all customers around the world, customers are looking for supply chain security. They want to make sure they're going to be supplied. And as we think about bioprocessing, that continues to be stable as they've reached the bottom there, and we're starting to see a little bit of life. And we talked about life sciences.\nLife sciences is stable on the back of a little more stimulus than we've seen in the past, making up for some of the demand contraction that we had seen. Generally speaking, we expect this to be stable. We're prepared with our supply chain to supply China. The majority of our supply is either China for China or coming from non-US plants. We've been working on that for years. We'll continue to see what happens here on the policy front. For now, we see China as stable and as anticipated. We don't expect to change that full-year guide today.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Managing Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (Barclays)\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThis is Suleman for Luke. Thanks for taking our questions. Could you talk a little bit more about VBP headwinds this quarter?\nAny pull forward there, or did that come in line with the expectation of it being like a $50 million headwind? And is the cadence of VBP still intact from what you stated last quarter, which was kind of the $50 million, $50 million, $30 million, then $15 million-$20 million framework?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nI think so, yeah. I wouldn't change off of that, come off of that. And VBP was very much in line with what we thought here in Q1. So, I would not say we have seen any change to what we thought would be our impact here from VBP.\n\n[Analyst] (Barclays)\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGotcha. And then just sticking to China, could you talk about the magnitude of the China stimulus as a tailwind for you guys this quarter? And then kind of what the expectations are for the rest of the year as you see it right now?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nI would call the stimulus measured. We saw that in the life science instruments primarily. That was with some government agencies, more specifically in food testing. And then we also see some of the tier two universities starting to get their arms around that funding mechanism. So, we also saw that as well. But I would call that a measured level of stimulus that is essentially making up for some of the demand contraction that we saw earlier.\n\n[Analyst] (Barclays)\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks for that. Appreciate it.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Luke.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you. Morning, guys. Thank you. Matt, the $7.60-$7.75 EPS guide, does that assume the full $150 million of cost savings is captured this year?\nThen now that you're out of the gate, I think you said, should we just assume that the remainder of that gets layered fairly evenly across the next three quarters? Or is there a skew from a timing perspective there?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nNo, I think the cadence is right. I think it will layer in fairly evenly. It might get a little bit more here in Q3 than Q4, but I'd have to, but I would just put it for modeling. I'd do it evenly. I mean, maybe the way to think about the $150 million that we've talked about, we've incorporated into the guide what we've achieved so far. And so, of the $150 million, we think we got about $50 million in Q1, and that is incorporated in the guide.\nThe other sort of $100 million is what I might call cushion to see, like I kind of talked to when I think Doug asked the question earlier around walking through the math to something that might be potentially a higher number. I would put that as part of that cushion that exists for what might go bump in the rest of the year.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nOkay. Is there any reason why you wouldn't capture that? I mean, it seems pretty, to hear you talk about it, it seems pretty straightforward. So, is it just really, well, we'll factor it in when we actually capture it? Or is there something that needs to develop in order to feel confident about that happening?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nNo, I mean, I think we'll be able to capture it.\nI think it was more the general view of how we sort of outlined how we're thinking about the rest of the year in the current environment and wanting to sort of see how things play out, especially from a policy perspective before we get too constructive. But we feel like we're in a pretty good spot here if things do go out to be able to talk about higher numbers if things do improve. But we're taking a little bit of a conservative approach given we are 20 days into a new environment.\n\nDan Arias\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nYeah. Sure. Okay. Thanks a bunch.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn it back over to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJohn Bedford",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. we finished the year strong with better than anticipated Core revenue in all three of our segments, and we were particularly encouraged by another quarter of positive momentum in our Bioprocessing business and the improving performance in our Life Sciences Instruments businesses. Our team's disciplined execution also drove solid cash flow and operating profit margin expansion.\nNow throughout 2024, our 63,000 associates demonstrated an unwavering commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System, which enabled us to successfully navigate a dynamic operating environment. Now their dedication not only drove meaningful process improvements across our businesses. It also delivered impactful innovations for our customers, both of which are positioning Danaher for sustainable long-term success.\nNow, looking to 2025 and beyond, we believe Danaher is better-positioned than at any point in our 40-year history. The transformation in our portfolio since the beginning of the pandemic has shaped us into a focused Life Sciences and diagnostics innovator with an A-rated long-term growth, margin, and cash flow profile. Our differentiated science and technology portfolio paired with the power of DBS and our talented team positions us well to create long-term shareholder value while making a meaningful positive impact on human health.\nWith that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2024 financial results. Sales were $23.9 billion and core revenue declined 1.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 28.6% was essentially flat year-over-year and adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $7.48. We also generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of approximately 135%. Strong free cash flow generation is one of the most important metrics at Danaher and 2024 marks the 33rd consecutive year of free cash flow to net income conversion which exceeded 100% and speaks to the differentiated quality of our earnings and business models.\nNow through 2024 and into the start of 2025 we deployed approximately $7 billion of capital towards the repurchase of 28 million shares of Danaher common stock. This includes approximately 20 million shares purchased in the second and third quarters and approximately 8 million shares purchased in the Q4 and into January 2025. We also remained active on the M&A front completing several strategic acquisitions during the year. Now these acquisitions bring innovative technologies and solutions that further strengthen our competitive advantages and position us for sustained long term success.\nNow we also continue to make substantial investments in innovation throughout the year, enabling the launch of several groundbreaking technologies that are advancing our customers' critical work. In Biotechnology, Cytiva introduced the Sefia cell therapy manufacturing platform, which is helping address critical cost and capacity constraints associated with CAR T-cell therapy manufacturing. The efficiencies customers gain through the Sefia platform have the potential to increase patient access to these life-saving therapies.\nIn Life Sciences, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences introduced the Cydem VT automated cell culture system, which simplifies and accelerates the cell line development process, enabling pharmaceutical researchers to bring therapies to market faster. In diagnostics, Beckman Coulter Diagnostics made significant strides in expanding the cardiac and blood virus menus on the DxI 9000, our next-generation high-resolution immunoassay analyzer.\nWith sensitivity 100x greater than traditional immunoassay systems, the DxI 9000 is enabling faster and more accurate patient diagnoses and ultimately paving the way for precision diagnostics. These are just a few examples of how our innovation engine is driving long-term growth and helping customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world.\nNow let's turn to our Q4 2024 results in more detail. Sales were $6.5 billion in Q4, and we delivered 1% core revenue growth. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were essentially flat, with a low single-digit decline in North America and a low single-digit increase in Western Europe. High-growth markets were up low-single-digits, with solid performance outside of China, more than offsetting a mid-single-digit decline in China.\nOur gross profit margin for the Q4 increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 59.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.6% was up 90 basis points, driven primarily by the positive impact of cost savings initiatives. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.14 were up 2.4% year-over-year and we generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.\nNow let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our Biotechnology segment increased high-single-digits year-over-year, with our bioprocessing business up high-single-digits and our discovery and medical businesses up low-double-digits. In bioprocessing, the gradual recovery we saw through the year continued into the Q4.\nWe were particularly encouraged by the sustained positive momentum in our order book, which grew high-single-digits sequentially, and this represents the sixth consecutive quarter of high single digit sequential order growth. Revenue growth in the quarter was primarily driven by consumables supported by robust demand for commercialized therapies. Equipment demand, while improved, remained subdued as customers continue to be cautious with their capital spending.\nNow in China, underlying activity levels were relatively stable but weak as customers faced ongoing challenges in a difficult funding environment. The continued progress we're making in our business, coupled with healthy underlying market trends, reinforces our confidence in the long term outlook for Cytiva's bioprocessing franchise. Monoclonal antibodies, which comprise more than 75% of our bioprocessing revenues, remain the largest investment area for our customers, and 2024 was a near record year of FDA approvals for new monoclonal antibodies.\nAt the same time, biosimilar development and production are increasing as patents on high-volume therapies expire, making life-saving treatments more accessible and driving broader adoption. With our comprehensive portfolio and an innovation engine focused on increasing yields and enhancing manufacturing efficiencies, we believe we're very well-positioned to support our customers today and for the long term.\nNow turning to our Life Sciences segment, core revenue increased by 1%. Core revenue in our Life Sciences instrument business was up slightly, exceeding our expectations. In the US and Europe, we saw modest demand improvements at our pharma and applied customers. In China, while we did see a modest benefit from the ongoing stimulus program, market conditions continue to be challenging as customers remain cautious with their investments.\nIn October, Leica Microsystems expanded its STELLARIS confocal microscopy platform with the introduction of SpectraPlex, a cutting-edge solution for 3D imaging in spatial biology. SpectraPlex enables researchers to gain deeper insights into cellular organization, interactions, and spatial phenotyping, advancing the understanding of disease progression and aiding in the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Now, core revenue in our genomics consumables business declined in the quarter.Growth across next generation sequencing products and basic research was more than offset by declines in proteins, plasmids, and gene writing and editing solutions.\nMoving to our diagnostics segment, core revenue decreased 2%. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered low single-digit core revenue growth. Leica Biosystems led the way with nearly 10% growth driven by strength across core histology, advanced staining, and digital pathology. Notably, Leica placed a record number of its GT450 digital pathology slide scanners this quarter as clinicians are increasingly looking to leverage its predictive algorithms and productivity gains to deliver more accurate and timely patient diagnoses.\nTo further enhance the digital pathology capabilities, Leica recently established a strategic partnership with Indica Labs, a global leader in AI-powered digital pathology software. This partnership aims to accelerate the development of next-generation cancer diagnostics by combining Leica Biosystems' expertise, instrumentation, and extensive global footprint with Indica Labs' leadership in enterprise software and artificial intelligence.\nCore revenue at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was essentially flat with mid-single-digit core revenue growth outside of China, offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China. Earlier this month, Beckman introduced several cutting-edge research-use-only assays for neurodegenerative disease research on the DxI 9000. Now these assays allow researchers to detect and quantify emerging neurodegenerative biomarkers with exceptional sensitivity and specificity, providing valuable insights into conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.\nIn addition, the US Food and Drug Administration granted breakthrough device designation to Beckman's p-Tau 217 and beta-amyloid 1-42 assays designed to aid clinicians in identifying patients with Alzheimer's. This designation reflects the potential of Beckman's test to transform how clinicians diagnose and manage Alzheimer's, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for patients and families affected by this devastating disease.\nIn molecular diagnostics, increasing menu adoption and system utilization contributed to another quarter of mid-teens core revenue growth in Cepheid's core non-respiratory reagent portfolio. All of these product lines delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, led by over 20% growth in sexual health as customers are increasingly adopting our Multiplex Vaginitis Panel or MVP. The rapid growth of the MVP panel since its introduction highlights the value rapid turnaround diagnostics brings to women's health clinicians at the point of care.\nCepheid's Multiplex panel enables physicians to quickly and accurately diagnose infections and prescribe targeted treatments, reducing the need for multiple office visits. Now, beyond enabling improved clinical outcomes, MVP underscores the significant growth opportunities ahead as we continue to expand our women's health business, and is also a great example of how Cepheid is unlocking long-term growth opportunities in outpatient settings.\nCepheid's respiratory revenue of approximately $550 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $350 million as we saw both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV. In 2024, Cepheid's installed base grew by high-single-digits and is now more than 60,000 instruments globally. In recent quarters we've seen healthcare systems and integrated delivery network customers accelerating the placement of new instruments at alternate care sites such as clinics and urgent care centers.\nThis expansion beyond the hospital helps customers improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs by standardizing care across their networks. With the continued expansion of our leading global installed base, the largest test menu on the market, and a robust innovation pipeline, Cepheid is well-positioned for sustained long-term growth.Now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for Q1 and the full year 2025.\nFor the full year 2025, we anticipate core revenue growth of approximately 3%. In addition, we expect an approximately 2% revenue headwind due to recent strengthening of the US dollar. We also expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 28.5%. In the first quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the low single digit percentage range. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26.5%.\nTo wrap up, we are pleased with our Q4 performance and look forward to building on this momentum as we move into 2025. Our team successfully executed through a dynamic environment to deliver strong financial results while continuing to invest for the future. Looking ahead, the transformation in our portfolio paired with our organic growth investments has created a lineup of outstanding franchises and that are very well-positioned in highly attractive end markets and we're a better, stronger company today positioned for higher long-term growth, expanded margins, and stronger cash flow with tremendous opportunities to continue building upon this foundation.\nWith the powerful combination of our leading portfolio, talented team, and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System. We feel well-positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value for years to come. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press the star and one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star two. Once again, that is star and one to ask a question. We will take our first question from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morningJack.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nWanted to start by digging more into the guide for Life Sciences in 2025. That's where I'm getting most of the questions, notably the pacing. Starting down mid singles, getting the low-single-digits up for the year. As you look at the operating businesses there, can you just call out, is there anything that stands out as one-off or notable in terms of the ramp? Just when in the year will you return to growth? Is Q2 reasonable or is it more back half weighted?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nJack, good morning, and thanks for the question for 2025 and Life Sciences. You know, it's the one segment where we see a little bit of noise right now with the external environment. Given that we're trying to take a reasonably prudent approach to the guide for 2025, and we're assuming Life Science Tools up for up low-single-digits and Pall and genomics will be down, so we'll possibly do better. Where we sit today, this is probably a good starting point. As we think about the phasing, we would expect each quarter to get a little better.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nOkay.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYou know, Q1 like you said, it's kind of down mid single digits. I think we probably are kind of flattish as we head into Q2 and then kind of ramp up from there. Really Q1 the big kind of comp issue is a lot of it really is Pall, and in particular some of the things in the industrial business both year-over-year with some big projects that we saw there. Then also sequentially kind of the step down, if you will, from Q4 in Life Sciences.\nThey were a double-digit grower here in Q4. I think they're going to be negative here in Q1 and given the size of that business, it's almost, you know, $2 billion. It does kind of move the needle, but you know, the core tools we think is still in pretty good shape.Kind of at the high end of low-single-digits.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGreat. Okay. Then Rainer, you alluded to this a little bit. Obviously had the change in administration and US academic government funding has been a hot topic, a lot of headlines. Was curious if you could give us a state of the state, what you're seeing in the market today, and how did that influence the way that you set the guide?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, it's only been a couple weeks here of the new administration, Jack, but in general we'd expect the environment to be more business friendly. Certainly the election has not changed our view of our portfolio, which we know is positioned towards the most attractive secular growth trends in Life Sciences and diagnostics. Sure. We plan for this. As you said, we've talked about that here in the Life Sciences Guide for 2025. There's likely going to be some puts and takes, but you know, we're confident we can leverage our portfolio and the Danaher Business System to continue to outperform.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nJack, I do think it's fair to call out that this is the one segment in Life Sciences, you know, where the noise around, like Rainer said, the noise around it is higher because I think that's where we've seen most of the noise has been around that segment. I think, you know, we're trying to take some of that noise into account. I think mostly it's going to be in Life Sciences is where you see that. I think it probably, you know, it's probably fair to say that we took a fairly prudent approach to how we thought about starting the year here, given some of the, given some of the recent news.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThat all makes sense. Thank you, guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Jack.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on when you called out for the diagnostics segment. I think there's a little bit of a shortfall there versus expectations. In the guide, you called out specifically Cepheid Respiratory; you're looking for $1.7 billion versus, I think, $1.95 billion in fiscal year 2024. Then for volume-based procurement in China, you talked about $150 million for the year versus previously.\nYou were expecting sort of a steady cadence of $50 million per year. Can you just talk through those both pretty quickly? One is what changed in the VBP. Sounded like it changed a little bit in the Q4 as well. Just how do you think the VBP headwinds come through in 2025 and 2026. Then for Cepheid Respiratory, why is $1.7 billion the right number?\nI mean, we've talked about this for a while. It's sort of like, at what point do you say, okay, this is the new endemic. you know, you did 1.95 in 2024. Why isn't that just the new normal going forward where, you know, we're four years post Covid? It feels like respiratory sort of like settled down a little bit. What are you seeing in January that's making you revised that?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, Mike, let me see if I can capture all that. First VBP 150 versus the 50 that we thought before? That is correct. I think. We think now and we saw 50 here in 20 in Q4, so probably 200 all up, but 200 in two years instead of the three that we thought I think that's right. As far as why did that and how did it accelerate it in Q4? I mean, we just saw in Q4 a lot more aggressive stance in China, particularly from the central government, to sort of really get after VBP and do some other things outside of just straight VBP, also going and doing some reimbursement cuts.\nI think the combination of the tenders that we saw come through, the reimbursement cuts really accelerated here late in the quarter. Frankly, this was kind of a November, almost in December phenomenon. That kind of came through and informed our guide as we think about going forward from a respiratory perspective.\nYou're right, we're here at 17. We've always thought that that was about the normal range for a normal respiratory season in an epidemic state. The last two years we did about $2 billion. I think what we saw the last couple years was we sort of had a bit of a double dip, if you will. We had a big spike in September, October, as people sort of return to school and then, you know, return to work, return to school.\nThen we saw another one here. Usually a typical respiratory season in January and February. We didn't really see that this year. That was, you know, we're kind of assuming that we're going to go back to that normal respiratory pattern where we see a bit of a spike up in the ILI like we are seeing now.\nDid not see it as much here in Q3 like we normally do. You know, I feel pretty comfortable that 1.7 is the endemic rate. We did a little bit better the last couple years, but that's no real different than what it was like, you know, prior to, you know, COVID, we had respiratory season. Some are better than others, not better but from a testing perspective, more testing versus not.\nI feel pretty comfortable with the 1.7 still versus 2 being some sort of new number. I just, you know, maybe we're proven wrong, but given what we've seen in the data, I think 1.7 is probably going to be a pretty regular, pretty normal respiratory season.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. If I could squeeze in a follow-up on bioprocess and Biotechnology, you talked about. 6% to 7% for the year in Biotechnology, same thing for the first quarter. It seems like sort of pretty steady throughout the year. I think we talked about bioprocess being maybe more of a high single digit business. Thinking more of like an 8%, maybe 7% to 8%. Is the delta there really just the instrumentation part of it?\nSort of if it wasn't for that, would you be at that 8% rate for the year? If it is instrumentation, just any signs of that, any hope of that coming back as you go through the year? Just sort of like, what's holding that back? Why is that still so subdued if the consumables are really back and the demand continues to be there?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nI'll tell you, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing in the bioprocessing business and the orders growth. Six consecutive quarters now of high single digit orders growth. We don't normally talk about the year-over-year numbers, but even in the Q4, well over 30% orders growth there and probably one of the biggest quarters that we've had in two years in terms of orders growth. We think the bioprocessing sets up very nicely.\nNow to your point, look, we expect 6 to 7% core growth in 2025. That's essentially similar to what we saw in the Q4. What we're seeing is consumables are essentially also back to normal here with large customers driving that. We do see some improvements there with smaller customers as well, but they're still not back to normal. To your question, and then as it relates to equipment, it's also better, but not quite back to normal. We continue to be really encouraged by what we're seeing, and the recovery is clearly underway.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI'm going to go into a completely different direction. Because guidance, we can kind of fixate on for the rest of the call. I'm sure lots of people will. It was maybe a little disappointing, but. I wanted to get a sense from you guys just in talking about seeing some of the build out of test capabilities in Cepheid. What does AI do for you guys? It could be broader than just Cepheid, but when you think about ability to kind of lever that computing power into something that maybe materially or meaningfully increases your ability to broaden out those test kits and really make them more ubiquitous, how do you guys think about that?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, thanks for the question, Scott. We're well into the application of artificial intelligence throughout the corporation here. To your question also in research and development and essentially how we're applying it is to accelerate the development time not only of our assays. Certainly the technical and research aspect of R&D, but also in terms of how we get the integrated evidence plan that you need to get that assay to market much more quickly and broadly on top of of course, the decision support systems that we're building.\nAnother example is at Leica Biosystems where you just saw us do a deal with Indica Biolabs where clearly the journey takes us to digital diagnostics in pathology that is supported by artificial intelligence, helping those pathologists to make not only faster diagnoses, but to see things that they might not normally see. We are definitely down the path here and investing significantly in accelerating cycle times throughout the corporation, but certainly in R&D as well.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Guys, just as a completely different follow-up, but where does Abcam and Aldevron, or however you pronounce it, where do they sit versus the deal model? When, when you guys close those deals, are we still ahead of the deal model on those? It sounds like we may have taken a little bit of a step backwards, but maybe I misheard that.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nNo, I think, I think on Abcam we're still pretty close. That's still pretty new, Scott. That's only about a year old, so I think we're pretty much tracking close there. Aldevron, we're behind. I don't think there's any way to say it other than that. Largely it has to do with, you know, the end markets of genomics are proving to take a little bit longer sort of to round themselves out and, but you know, ultimately while behind on the deal model, it's disappointing working hard to make sure that we try and close that gap.\nIt's still a business that we are going to want to own. We need to be in genomics. We're going to be in genomics. If you're in Life Sciences, you have to have that presence. We feel as though that business is a fantastic business with really well-positioned to take advantage of the genomics market when it does sort of ramp beyond the current levels and I think it will. For the long term, I think it's the right business to own for sure but we're working hard to kind of catch back up on the deal model but I would say that we are behind. Yeah.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Thank you for the integrity of that answer. I'll pass it on. Thank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will take our next question from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just starting on bioprocessing for a moment. Just back to Mike's question. You talked about really strong order growth in the Q4. I think you had the same thing really in the third quarter. Call it probably maybe north of 30 or north of 20. Can you just remind us, Rainer, of the linkage between orders and the forward growth for your bioprocessing business as we're thinking that such strong second half order growth shouldn't portend for potentially much stronger growth in 2025 for revenues?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, I mean it certainly sets us up well. Some of our customers get their orders in very early, and it has implications for the second half of 2025, and others do that with the shorter lead times that we're able to deliver on for the first half. Again, as we think about our orders development, of course, that is what is in our guide and supports our guide for the year. We really like where we're positioned here, both competitively, but also we are seeing the recovery here clearly underway essentially in all segments.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Okay.Then maybe just kind of a big picture question, you know, the next five years. I know pharma patent expirations are set to grow versus the prior five. I think 28 is a particularly big year. In your prepared remarks you talked about the benefit of biosimilars to your bioprocessing business. Just how do we think about the impact of Danaher's, kind of your overall growth from these patent expirations? Are these going to be more of a tailwind or a headwind? If you want to think about maybe separating between bioprocessing, your more R&D related areas. Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, as we think about bioprocessing, that business is driven by volume, and it's really critical to understand that the more volume there is, the more we benefit and drive growth, both top and bottom. We're so well-positioned there. We've talked about the number of monoclonal antibodies being approved, and you can expect that we are participating in all of those.\nThat momentum of monoclonal antibodies going forward, which represents 75% of the business, is really what drives the train. As you think about these biosimilars starting to penetrate other patient groups that heretofore have not been able to candidly afford to buy these kind of therapies, or even payers have been unable to pay for those kinds of therapies, that's a tailwind for us. Biosimilars is an important category to understand.\nWhat's interesting about biosimilars, once again, in biologics, the end product cannot be perfectly characterized. The regulators tend to lock down the process to ensure consistency there. Even biosimilar manufacturers will try to use the inputs that have been previously approved by those regulators to ensure speed to market and a minimum of delay to getting to patients. Biosimilars, higher volumes. Tailwind for Danaher.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will take our next question from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nHead of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I want to start on diagnostics and then kind of pivot over to a philosophical question. First on diagnostics, if I'm doing the math right, on the respiratory headwind and the VBP incremental headwinds, I think this implies kind of what's embedded into your guidance is an implied 5% core and normalized diagnostic growth rate. Is that right? If not, why isn't this a little bit higher? Then when would we see evidence of you getting back to that high single digit growth rate that I believe you're still targeting? That's the diagnostic topic. The second one, which I'll just get out of the way, is the guidance philosophy question.\nIf you go back and look at how 2025 EPS expectations have progressed over time, if you go back to the beginning of 2023, the Street was at $11.20. At the beginning of last year, the Street was at around $8.80. Yesterday, estimates were at $8.09. If I'm doing the math right, I think you essentially got it to around $7.60. It's hard for a stock to work when the estimates keep moving in the wrong direction.\nI'm just wondering how much does these things factor into your guidance philosophy this year? Especially as it seems like your end markets are continuing to improve. Related to that, what are the biggest risks to guidance from an earnings and EBITDA standpoint, and what are the biggest sources of potential upside? Thank you.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, sure. Let me see if I captured all that. As far as diagnostics goes. I think you're right, Doug. I mean, I think if you sort of think about diagnostics, maybe just outside of China, we are kind of mid to high-single-digits here for the guide. I think you're right. I think we're pretty much in the zone of where we thought we would be. I mean, I think China is the big piece with VBP and the respiratory headwinds. I think those are the two pieces. I think we're pretty close to where we thought we would be or where we aspire to be, which is high-single-digits.\nI feel pretty good about where we are from a diagnostic perspective outside of what we're seeing in China, really, and in respiratory, I guess. As far as guidance philosophy goes, I mean, you know, I kind of, I don't necessarily look backwards when we think about guidance and philosophy. I think we always try and do a bottoms-up, what our businesses are telling us, what we are seeing, and we try and incorporate that into the guidance.\nWe do probably, you know, include some external factors like I talked about. I think in particular, Life Sciences currently, you know, there's been just kind of a lot of news and maybe noise around that segment here. I think we try to incorporate some of that news and noise into it to be prudent, especially from a planning perspective early in the year.I want to make sure that not only for your purposes, but for my purposes internally, that we're setting the cost structure right and we're setting expectations at a level that.\nWe can overdrive, if you will. That's sort of our overall philosophy. I understand stock doesn't work when earnings are going down, but I would posit that there were some external things that we had to work through in bioprocessing as well as stimulus in China and some other things. I think we worked through them. I think we've done a pretty good job of managing the cost structure.\nI think, from a margin perspective, despite the fact that we've been down two years in a row, I really like where our margin profile is. Look, we try and build it from the bottom up. We try and tell you what we're seeing in the moment and give you that information. That's how we've always thought about it and continue to do that.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nHead of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe my first one. Rainer, I think good morning to you. I think you mentioned something around Life Sciences Q1. Was there anything one off in Q1 maybe? Which is different versus the rest of the year. I think you mentioned Pall, maybe if you could elaborate on what the Q1 headwind is? We'll start there.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nLook. Paul, in the prior year, so Q1 2024, we had a very, very large tens of millions energy project, and that's giving us a one-off effect here in the first quarter along with some of the other things we talked about. More specifically. Again looking at the first quarter guide here, in general.\nThe trends really remain the same as they were in the Q4 with the exception of diagnostics. Matt just talked about that. Bioprocessing, 6% to 7% core growth. That's consistent with the Q4 exit rate. Life Sciences, they're expected to be consistent here in the tools sector. Here we go. Paul and the rest of the segment is getting off to a slower start in the first quarter.\nTalked about the comp here just a minute ago. We really saw two meaningful changes in diagnostics in the Q4, and Matt described some of those. One was the acceleration of volume-based procurement in China, and the second is a slower start to the respiratory season. You bring that together between volume-based procurement and respiratory, that's about a 350 basis point headwind versus Q1 2024.\nThe underlying market as we just talked about in diagnostics everywhere are growing mid to high-single-digits with the exception of China. We view this as an isolated topic and we see that in Q1 and certainly expect every quarter thereafter to be better.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. Maybe my one follow up is on that. Capital deployment looks like Q1 is assuming a big share repurchase. How much of that is being contemplated in Q1 and rest of the year? Can you just remind us on your M&A criteria? I think there's been some chatter about deal activity picking up in the tool space. How's the pipeline looking for you guys?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, Vijay. In Q4 and in Q1 collectively, we started in Q4 and kind of spilled over into Q1 if you will. We did buy back about eight million shares for about $1.09 billion or so, so that is complete.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. On the deal front, you know, we see more activity out there, no doubt, and we see that in our funnels as well. We're very active across all three segments cultivating assets. As it relates to the environment, not everywhere, but we're starting to see some pockets where valuations are getting a little bit better. We feel very well-positioned here, Vijay, with the way our balance sheet sets up.\nWe're going to remain disciplined, as we always do, around our deal philosophy, where we have to be in the right end market with those secular growth drivers. We've got to like the asset or the company. Then of course, the valuation framework, the model has to work as well. We feel good about where we're positioned, markets are a little more active. Balance sheet looks good.We're going to remain disciplined.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. Thank you, guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Vijay.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will take our last question from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. Good morning. Thanks so much for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on some of the export control headlines that we got earlier this month surrounding flow cytometry and mass spec. Can you walk us through? Are you expecting Danaher to be impacted by this at all? Then more conceptually, Life Sciences were usually viewed as a sector that was more insulated from some of these export controls. How are you thinking about the risk here going forward? Do you expect that we could see other instruments potentially added to the list as well?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, good morning, Rachel. Thanks for the question the current export controls that have recently been published are really not meaningful for us. Our portfolio is positioned differently. More generally speaking, this category has required export licenses for many years. It's really not that new for Life Sciences, but what they've done is expanded the category a little bit to include some other technologies.\nAs we go forward, I think during the normal course of any administration, these kind of export controls are regularly reviewed and adjusted. We don't expect anything particularly different than the standard process here, and at least to date have not seen a meaningful impact to what we do.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThen my follow up, I just have a multipart question here on bioprocessing.You mentioned that the recovery is underway. How should we think about the pace of recovery throughout the year in bioprocessing, and really what can we be exiting this year at for growth in that portion. Then other areas, just how are you thinking about some of the comps embedded, especially in the first part of the year? You have some easy one year comps, but also appreciate some of the multi year stocks. Then lastly, what are you guys assuming at this point for standard seasonality by quarter on bioprocessing? That's a lot in there. Thanks so much, you guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rachel. Let me start off with one more time that the recovery in bioprocessing is well underway, and we're really seeing it in nearly every category of the bioprocessing portfolio. We see a positive development here throughout the year. That said, the way we've set up the guide is 6% to 7% core growth essentially on a quarterly basis. That's how we're starting our perspective on the year here, and then we'll see how that plays out.\nIf you look at the multi-year stacks and that makes sense to do, you'll see that the math shows that this is right in line with sort of a high single-digit growth rate, which is what we've talked about this market as its long-term growth rate. We think that this is the right perspective, and we sure like the fact that the momentum is building here.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nAs far as seasonality goes, Rachel, we sort of Q1 in that business is usually the kind of the lightest. We see a bit of a step up in Q2, and we do have a phenomenon there where Q3 is lower than Q2. That's always sort of been in that business. Some of the pandemic that didn't happen but that is a normal trajectory where we see a step down Q2 to Q3, and then obviously a step up in Q4. Sort of Q1 is your low point, a little bit up in Q2, down in Q3, and then a big step up in Q4.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rachel.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. It appears that we have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the program back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks everybody. We're around all day for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

My name is Todd, and I will be your conference facilitator this morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings.\nThe audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until August 6, 2024.\nDuring the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to results from continuing operations and relate to the second quarter of 2024 and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer M. Blair\n\nEVP, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team executed well during the second quarter, delivering better-than-expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. We were particularly pleased with the sustained positive momentum in our bioprocessing business and with the strong performance at Cepheid, which we believe gained market share in molecular testing again this quarter.\nNow across the portfolio, market conditions were largely as we anticipated. In our bioprocessing business, conditions in the U.S. and Europe continued to improve, and we were encouraged to see orders increase high single digits sequentially this quarter. In China, bioprocessing demand and underlying activity levels were stable sequentially but remain weak as customers continue to manage liquidity.\nIn Life Sciences, capital equipment investments remain constrained, while recurring revenue was relatively stable. And in Diagnostics, we saw healthy demand globally across our businesses. As we move through this transitional period, we believe Danaher is well positioned for sustainable long-term value creation. Our strong positioning in attractive end markets, coupled with durable, high recurring revenue business models and the power of the Danaher Business System supports our long-term expectations of high single-digit core revenue growth with a differentiated margin and cash flow profile.\nSo with that, let's take a closer look at our second quarter 2024 results. Sales were $5.7 billion in the second quarter, and core revenue declined 3.5%. We Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were down low single digits with strength across diagnostics, offset by declines in biotechnology and life sciences. High-growth markets declined high single digits, including a high teens decline in China.\nOur gross profit margin for the second quarter was 59.7%. And our adjusted operating profit margin of 27.3% was up 60 basis points as the favorable impact of cost savings initiatives more than offset lower volume. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $1.72 were essentially flat year-over-year. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $2.6 billion year-to-date, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 129%.\nNow additionally, through the second quarter and into July, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares. While M&A remains our bias for capital deployment, we believe these repurchases will provide an attractive return given the strength of our long-term organic growth, earnings and cash flow outlook. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today.\nCore revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 7% with the bioprocessing business down high single digits and the Discovery and Medical business down mid-single digits. In our bioprocessing business, revenue declines moderated from the first quarter as we believe our larger customers in the U.S. and Europe have worked through the majority of their excess inventories and are returning to normal ordering patterns. Many of these customers are also seeing strong momentum for therapeutics in their late-stage pipeline, which is promising for our future growth.\nOur emerging biotech customers continue to prioritize projects, particularly for cell and gene therapies in an effort to manage liquidity. However, we are encouraged by the improvement in the overall funding environment, which is a positive leading indicator for these customers. So based on the trends we saw through the first half of the year, we continue to expect a low single-digit core revenue decline in our bioprocessing business for the full year 2024. There is also no change to our assumption of a bioprocessing core revenue growth rate of high single digits or better as we exit the year.\nBiologics market remains very healthy as evidenced by the increasing number of treatments, both in development and production. Notably, the number of new FDA approvals for biologic and genomic medicines in the first half of this year, clearly doubled compared to the first half of 2023 and the full year 2024 is on track to set another record. Underlying demand for biologic medicines also remains on track to grow at a high single digit or better rate again for the full year 2024.\nSo given the substantial and sustained increase in approvals and production volumes, we expect the growth rate in bioprocessing to remain very robust for many years to come. We continue to make substantial investments in innovation to support our customers as they pursue these life-changing therapeutics. To support monoclonal antibody production, which comprises the majority of our bioprocessing revenues, Cytiva expanded its comprehensive filtration portfolio with the launch of Supor Prime.\nNow support Prime filters are specifically designed to address key challenges associated with high concentration biologic drugs whose complex formulations and high particle loads make them prone to premature filter blockage and costly drug product losses. We're also developing innovative solutions for emerging modalities. In May, Cytiva introduced the Cepheid cell therapy manufacturing platform, which is helping address critical cost and capacity constraints associated with CAR-T cell therapy manufacturing. The Cepheid platform's fully automated manufacturing process can increase productivity by up to 50% per year compared to the industry standard, reducing our customers' costs and increasing throughput. Addressing these key manufacturing challenges will help improve patient access and facilitate wider adoption of these important therapeutics.\nNow turning to our Life Sciences segment. Core revenue decreased by 5.5%. Core revenue in our life sciences instrument businesses collectively declined high single digits as expected, with trends in the second quarter largely consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Global pharma and biotech demand remained weak. Academic markets were weaker sequentially and applied markets performed comparatively better, particularly for our advanced solutions, which provide critical capabilities needed by our customers. In China, we're seeing improving sales funnels and quoting activity driven by the recently announced stimulus measures. However, we don't anticipate this to convert to orders until 2025 and as these programs are in the early stages of implementation. In the meantime, many customers are delaying purchasing decisions as they await funding.\nNow last month, at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting, SCIEX reinforced their market leadership in quantitative mass spectrometry with the release of the 7,500-plus triple quad mass spectrometer. The 7500 plus pairs the ultra-high sensitivity of the 7,500 with faster acquisition speeds and the ability to maintain the highest sensitivity quantitation for up to twice as many sample rents.\nThis makes the 7,500-plus particularly well suited for complex applications such as PFAS analysis, where customers need to test more samples across diverse sample types with high precision to meet challenging new regulations. In our genomics consumables business, core revenue declined mid-single digits in the quarter. High single-digit growth in gene writing and editing solutions was more than offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and the impact of project timing in our plasma business.\nDuring the quarter, IDT opened a new manufacturing facility at their Corville, Iowa campus, which enables the team to manufacture differentiated new offerings such as rapid gene synthesis. This is the second facility expansion for IDT within the last 12 months and provides the capacity needed to support the rapidly expanding global DNA synthesis market and related drug development activities.\nNow moving over to our Diagnostics segment. Core revenue increased 3%. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth led by high single-digit growth at Radiometer. Leica Biosystems was up mid-single digits with notable strength in digital pathology driven by Aperio GT450 Diagnostics Digital Pathology slide scanner, which recently received its FDA 510(k) clearance.\nBeckman Coulter Diagnostics was up low single digits with balanced strength across both developed and high-growth markets. Now in May, Beckman received FDA 510(k) clearance of its Access NT-proBNP on the DXI 9000 immunoassay analyzer. This important expansion of Beckman's cardiac testing menu allows clinicians to quickly and accurately diagnose and assess the condition severity of patients suspected of having acute heart failure.\nNow this clearance is just the latest confirmation of the DXI 9000 platform's capability to develop increasingly more sensitive and clinically relevant diagnostics.\nIn Molecular Diagnostics, Cepheid's respiratory revenue of approximately $300 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $200 million, driven by both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A and B and RSV. So we continue to expect respiratory revenue of approximately $1.6 billion for the full year 2024.\nNow as I mentioned earlier, we believe the Cepheid team continued to gain market share during the quarter. increasing menu adoption and system utilization helped drive mid-teens growth in our core nonrespiratory reagent portfolio, including more than 20% growth in sexual health and virology assays. We also continued to expand our nearly 60,000 system installed base as many existing health care systems and integrated delivery network customers are adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to patients.\nIn June, the FDA granted Cepheid marketing authorization for its hepatitis C RNA test. Hepatitis C diagnosis has traditionally been a multistep process requiring follow-up appointments and leading the treatment delays. With Cepheid's test, which is the first molecular based point-of-care test for hepatitis C, patients can be tested and receive treatment during the same health care visit. So this is a great example of how bringing accurate, easy-to-use molecular testing closer to patients is improving treatment outcomes and driving long-term growth at Cepheid.\nNow before we move on to our expectations for the remainder of the year, I'd like to highlight our recently released 2024 sustainability report which details several important milestones across the 3 pillars of our sustainability program, starting with building the best team, innovating products that improve lives and our planet and protecting our environment.\nNotably, we have committed to setting science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with the Science-Based Target Initiative, including reaching net 0 value chain emissions by 2050. So I encourage you all to read through the report to learn more about the depth and scope of Danaher's commitment to sustainability and the important work we're doing to make a positive holistic impact on the world around us.\nSo now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year 2024. In the third quarter, we expect core revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect the third quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26%. For the full year 2024, there is no change to our previous guidance. As a reminder, we anticipate a core revenue decline in the low single-digit percent range and a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%.\nSo to wrap up, we're pleased with our better-than-expected second quarter results and are encouraged by the continued momentum in our bioprocessing business. Our strong performance is a testament to our team and their commitment to innovating and executing with the Danaher Business System. And they have done a tremendous job navigating the current environment to support our customers' life-changing work today while also delivering breakthrough innovation that is reinforcing our long-term competitive advantage.\nThe transformation in our portfolio over the last several years has created a focused life sciences and diagnostic leader positioned for higher long-term growth, expanded margins and stronger cash flow. And our recent share repurchases reflect our conviction in a bright future ahead for Danaher.\nSo looking ahead, the unique combination of our incredibly talented team, the strength and differentiation of our portfolio and a leading financial profile provides us with a strong foundation to create sustainable, long-term shareholder value.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. We're now ready for questions. .",

With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call, and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the Investor section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly earnings.\nThe audio portion of this call will be archived on the investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call.

These forward looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statements except as required by law. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks very much, John, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We're off to a good start in 2024 with our team delivering better than expected revenue, earnings, and cash flow. We were especially pleased to see improving order trends in our bioprocessing business and believe we continued to gain market share at Cepheid in the quarter. Now this better than expected start to the year paired with improving funnel and order trends further supports our full year outlook, which is unchanged from our previous guidance.\nOur Q1 results also reflect the unique positioning of Danaher's portfolio. Today our businesses are well positioned in attractive end markets, all underpinned by long-term secular growth drivers with high-margin, high-recurring-revenue business models. Our strong free cash flow generation also positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward.\nNow it's not just the portfolio that differentiates Danaher; it's how we run the business and using the Danaher Business System or DBS. Our team's commitment to executing with DBS enables us to deliver impactful new innovations to our customers and drive meaningful process improvements in our businesses, both of which are helping position Danaher for sustainable long-term performance.\na prime example of the power of DBS is the CEO Kaizen. We kicked off just two weeks ago. During this pivotal annual event, our most senior leaders, operating company presidents, and thousands of associates come together to address some of our most significant opportunities for material and sustained improvement in our businesses. In fact, just last week I rolled up my sleeves at one of our filtration manufacturing facilities in Pensacola, Florida, to focus on increasing manufacturing throughput and reducing lead times. DBS is our culture, and this year's CEO Kaizen underscores how our commitment to continuous improvement at all levels of the organization can contribute to a better customer experience and lasting competitive advantage across our businesses.\nWith that, let's take a closer look at our Q1 2024 results. Sales were $5.8 billion in Q1 and core revenue declined 4%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets were down slightly with broad-based strength across diagnostics offset by declines in biotechnology. High growth markets declined low double-digits including a high-teens decline in China, where the economic landscape remains challenging. Our gross profit margin for Q1 was 60%. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 30.1% was down 170 basis points as the favorable impact of cost savings initiatives was more than offset by lower volume.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $1.92. We generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, resulting in a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 130%. Now let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Core revenue in our biotechnology segments declined 17% with bioprocessing down high teens, and discovery and medical down approximately 20%.\nIn bioprocessing we had a modestly better than expected start to the year. Orders increased mid single digits sequentially from Q4 2023 and our book-to-bill ratio increased to approximately 0.95. Now this is particularly encouraging as we typically see a seasonal order decline between Q4 and Q1.\nIn North America and Europe, our larger customers are making steady progress working through their excess inventory with many returning to their regular order patterns. We expect inventory levels at these customers have largely normalized exiting the Q2. We're also encouraged with improvements in the overall funding environment. While we don't expect these improvements to impact order activity in the near term, it is a positive indicator for the long term health of the bioprocessing market. Now in China, demand and underlying activity levels remain weak as customers are continuing to conserve capital and prioritize programs.\nNow for the full year 2024, there is no change to our expectation of a low single-digit core revenue decline in our bioprocessing business, and there's also no change to our assumption of a gradual improvement through the year to a core revenue growth rate of high single-digits or better as we exit 2024.\nDespite near term headwinds, robust underlying market trends reinforce our confidence in the health and long term growth profile of the biologics market. Underlying demand for biologic medicine is projected to grow at a high single digit or better rate again for the full year 2024. There's also an increasing number of therapies advancing through the development pipeline and reaching the market. In fact, the number of new FDA approvals for biologic and genomic medicines grew more than 50% last year. These positive trends reinforce our conviction in the significant opportunity ahead and the high single digit long term core revenue growth trajectory for our leading bioprocessing franchise.\nNow we continue to make substantial investments in innovation geared towards helping our customers reduce the time and cost of biologic drug production. Cytiva's recently released Xcellerex magnetic mixing system is a great example of how we are improving productivity and reducing risk in biologic drug manufacturing. This innovative single-use cell culture media mixer enables faster and more consistent mixing and is specifically designed to prevent leaks common with other large-scale mixing systems that can lead to complete batch loss. This also marks another significant milestone for Cytiva as the first new product release to be developed leveraging the capabilities of our recently combined Pall Life Sciences and Cytiva R&D team.\nNow let's turn to our Life Sciences segment where core revenue decreased by 3%. Core revenue in our life sciences instruments businesses collectively declined mid single digits, with trends in the first quarter largely consistent with what we saw in the second half of 2023. In developed markets, pharma and biotech activity remained stable but at lower levels of demand. We did see improving funnel activity as the quarter progressed, but this increased activity is not yet translated to orders.\nAcademic and applied markets performed comparatively better, particularly for our more advanced instrumentation. In China, declines were driven by difficult comparisons as a result of the prior year stimulus programs and lower demand as a result of weaker underlying activity levels. Our genomics consumables business delivered low single digit core revenue growth in the quarter. Double digit growth across plasmids and proteins was partially offset by declines in next generation sequencing and gene writing and editing solutions.\nWhile current end market conditions remain challenging, our life sciences businesses are well positioned for the long term. A combination of investments in innovation and strategic acquisitions over the last several years has increased our exposure to attractive end markets in life sciences and accelerated our growth trajectory. Additionally, with high margin recurring revenue now comprising more than 60% of the segment, we see opportunities for future margin improvement.\nLet's move to our diagnostics segment where core revenue increased by 7.5%. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid single digit core revenue growth. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics was up mid single digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, with solid growth in both instruments and consumables. Beckman's recent strong performance is a direct result of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve both innovation and commercial execution. New product introductions over the last few years, including the DxI 9000 immunoassay analyzer, the DxC 500 chemistry analyzer, and the DxA 5000 Fit automation system have expanded our offerings and improved Beckman's competitive positioning. We're also seeing better win and retention rates across the portfolio.\nAt Leica Biosystems, the Aperio GT 450 DX digital pathology slide scanner recently received FDA 510(k) clearance. Now with this significant milestone, the GT 450 can now be more widely used in pathology labs, moving digital pathology one step closer to becoming the standard of care for clinicians. Digital pathology provides many benefits to clinicians, including improving analytical capabilities through predictive algorithms, enhancing slide imaging, and increasing productivity, all of which help provide a more accurate and timely diagnosis of patients. So this clearance also highlights how proprietary innovation is driving long-term core growth at Leica.\nIn molecular diagnostics, Cepheid's core revenue increased double digits, and as I mentioned earlier, we believe the team continued to gain market share during the quarter. Cepheid's respiratory revenue of approximately $675 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $575 million, driven by both higher volumes and a favorable mix of our 4 in 1 test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and RSV. Now, based on current global trends and respiratory infection rates, we continue to expect respiratory revenue of approximately $1.6 billion for the full year of 2024.\nCepheid's installed base continued to grow in the quarter to over 55,000 systems globally, a more than threefold increase since 2019. The team's thoughtful approach to placing systems at customers with clinical use cases beyond the pandemic has continued to drive increased menu adoption and utilization. We're seeing this today through growth rates in assays such as Group A strep, and sexual health, which were each up more than 40% in Q1. We're also seeing customers return to testing protocols that were suspended during the pandemic, which helped drive mid-teens growth in hospital-acquired infection assays.\nNow, in January, Cepheid received expanded FDA clearance with a CLIA waiver for the Xpert Xpress MVP test, which is the latest addition to our growing women's health portfolio.\nWith the addition of the CLIA waiver, Cepheid's customers can now provide critical testing in care settings that are more easily accessible to patients like a physician's office or local clinic, reducing the need for multiple office visits and significantly narrowing the test to treatment gaps often associated with therapeutic failure. This is a great example of how bringing accurate, easy to use molecular testing closer to patients is improving treatment outcomes and driving long term growth at Cepheid.\nSo now let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the Q2 and the full year 2024. In the second quarter we expect core revenue to decline in the mid-single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect a second quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26%. For The full year 2024. There is no change to our previous guidance. As a reminder, we anticipate a core revenue decline in the low single digit percent range and a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%.\nSo to wrap up, we're pleased to deliver Q1 results ahead of our expectations and look forward to building on this momentum as we move through the year. Our team's commitment to innovating and executing with DBS is driving meaningful improvements in our businesses and enabling us to deliver more breakthrough solutions to our customers. So there's a bright future ahead for Danaher. The transformation in our portfolio, paired with our organic growth investments, has created a lineup of outstanding franchises that are all well positioned in highly attractive end markets. We're a focused life science and diagnostics leader positioned for higher long term growth, expanded margins, and stronger cash flow. So we believe this unique combination of our incredibly talented team, the strength and differentiation of our portfolio, and leading financial profile provides us with a strong foundation to create sustainable long term shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star two once again. If you would like to ask a question at this time, please press Star one. Our first question will come from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. Good morning. Wanted to focus on the bioprocessing business here, so orders to start the year bucking the seasonal trend in a positive way. Rainer, can you unpack for us? What do you think is driving that? Any commentary across customer types like pharma versus CDMO. Any comments on cancellation trends would be great.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Jack, and thanks for the question. Maybe we start off with Q1 and what we're seeing today. So as we talked about from a revenue perspective, we had a modestly better than expected start to the year, and looking at orders, we grew mid single digits sequentially, and typically order declined from Q4 to Q1, so that's encouraging. And our book to bill increased to approximately 0.95, which was right in the middle of our expected range. Jack. So. We've also gotten some questions here regarding recurring versus equipment orders.\nI thought I'd talk about that for a minute, and I characterize both our equipment and recurring orders and revenues as in line with our expectations. Now, our recurring business was better than equipment growth in both orders and revenue and grew sequentially versus the fourth quarter. And our equipment was down sequentially versus the Q4. And while we saw some modest headwinds, those were as we expected. So there's really no new news here.\nGeographically, our larger customers in North America, Western Europe are increasingly returning to the pre-pandemic ordering patterns. So we continue to expect destocking to be largely behind us as we enter the second half of the year.\nNow, while the emerging biotech funding environment is improving, we're not yet seeing it translate into orders. So early days but helpful. Moving on to China, demand and underlying activity levels remain weak. So if you put it all together, the Q1 was an encouraging start to the year. As we look ahead to the Q2 and the rest of the year, there's really no change to how we're thinking about the full year. Expect the first half to be down mid teens as we talked about in January. We continue to believe we'll exit the year with high single digits or better core revenue growth.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nAnd Jack, as far as cancellations goes, I know you brought that up. So I would say that, you know, during the quarter, like Rainer said, the book-to-bill was 0.95-ish or right around there. It wouldn't have been much different. Cancellations really were pretty minimal here this quarter, which I think is another positive sign. I think we saw the last several quarters, they were much, much bigger than they were here in the quarter, so. A little bit of a tailwind there as well.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nExcellent. Another bioprocessing question as we get back to the new normal or I guess what is the new normal here. Everybody's trying to compare and contrast your commentary versus others. I was curious how you see competitive dynamics shifting at all in the industry. Just if you think back over the last couple years, there was this narrative that second tier players were picking up some share when Cytiva and others were out of stock. I'm curious if there was anything you would call out in that regard that you're seeing.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nJack, I really wouldn't. I would tell you that through the acquisition of the GE Biopharma business and now bringing Pall Life Sciences and that business together in Cytiva, we really feel like we have a very strong bioprocessing franchise. And you know, we continue with the Kaizen mantra, the continuous improvement mantra to improve what we do every day. And so we believe that, that we have a highly competitive franchise and that will not only continue to be the case, but increasingly so as we move through the year and the near future.\n\nJack Meehan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking the question guys and congrats on the strong print. I'm going to ask one follow up on bioprocessing and then I'll move on from that topic. So just to start, I mean Rainer, as you were saying, you were surprised that orders improved Q4 into Q1 and seems like you had some positive commentary on inventories exiting the Q2. So why aren't you raising the bioprocessing guidance for the year? Just given where you are sitting at the end of Q1.\nIs there any additional conservatism you're putting in or just like what are you waiting to see from the market to feel more confident than you did three months ago just given the progress you've seen so far?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks Michael. Good morning. Well, I mean like we said, we had an encouraging start to the year, but it's still early.\nThere's really no change, as you said, to our full year core revenue growth of down low single digits. What we're really looking for here is the order momentum to continue to build through the second quarter, and some continued stability in the run rate consumables, and, of course, longer term, with a view towards the longer term, we'd like to see equipment demand improve. While that's a small part of the business, only about 15%. Of course it's important for the long term.\nIt's good to see then the emerging biotech funding solidify, stabilize. We don't see that materializing in orders yet. There's a little bit more to go here and we think we're properly positioned with the guide.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay, I appreciate that. That's helpful. And then switching over to the margin side of things, again, really, really solid quarter. When we think about how you came in ahead in Q1 versus expectations, it seems like a combination of just overall volume, but then also mix from Cepheid and bioprocess, I'm sure, contribute. Anything we should think about as you go through the rest of the year? You're pointing to 26% margins in Q2 and then 29% for the year unchanged. I mean, anything in terms of mix that's leading to that or just how do we think the key pieces there?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, Mike, so for Q2, I think that's definitely right. You talked about approximately 26% adjusted operating margins. That is a sequential decline versus Q1. That was about 30%. And that is all due to lower respiratory volumes at Cepheid. It's, you know, the Q2 respiratory revenue was, sorry, Q1 was $675 million. We're thinking more like $200 million for Q2. So a pretty big drop off. And given that, you know, the margin profile of that business and the operating leverage we get, it's pretty meaningful when that decline. So I would say the Q1 to Q2 decline is all related to respiratory volume at Cepheid and maybe some FX as well.\nBut you bring up a good point as we think about the way that you're likely to see maybe different seasonality out of our margin progression than you have in the past, given that we're in an endemic state now versus where we were in COVID. It really does come back to that respiratory season. If you think about the respiratory. Season, which is both Q1 and Q4. Those are the highest volume quarters at Cepheid by a lot of. Right.\nQ1 and Q4 are going to be quarters that we anticipate being north of $500 million each. You saw that we did $675 million in Q1, Q2, and Q3 as we guided to, you know, talking about revenue of only a couple hundred million dollars. So, you know, the margin profile, operating leverage, you know, I think you're going to see Q4 and Q1 be Danaher's higher volume, higher volume and margin quarters going forward. And that's a little different than maybe what we saw in the past pre-pandemic, and that's largely because respiratory smaller business, only $250 million pre-pandemic 2019 and now it's $1.6 billion.\nSo hopefully it gives a little bit of color and help people modeling as we go forward, because I do think we have a little bit of a different dynamic that, you know, probably is just showing itself a little bit now here as we get through some of this stuff.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks a lot. Very helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, Rainer, Matt, and John.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nScott.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGuys, I'm looking at the life sciences margins and I see the breakdown of why they're down. They seem down a little bit more than I would have thought on a -3% core. Can you give us a little bit more detail on perhaps some of the ebb and flow there and mix issue?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, Scott, I thought the margins in Q2 actually came in probably a little bit above where we thought at 23%. I mean, I think if you look at the volume there being down, and also you've got Abcam that has come in here, and we've got some transition costs related to Abcam that are in that number as well. And so, operating leverage with core growth down low single digits, and as expected, had some of the dilutive impact of Abcam is probably the big thing here in the quarter. But I still think it came in around where we thought.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, fair enough. So guys, just going back to Abcam, I mean you didn't talk about in your prepared remarks, but you know, you've had a little bit of time with the business now, can you talk us through perhaps some of the early reads of positives and negatives?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure, Scott, as you know, we closed in December on the business and now have the first full quarter behind us. We put a new Danaher president and CFO in place, and they're really focused on the transition into Danaher and implementing the Danaher Business System. We're going to continue to work through it, and we're going to need a little time to get after some of the growth and cost opportunities we spoke about. Long term, of course, we continue to believe this is a great, a high single digit grower in a, in a fantastic market.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, and Scott, we've seen this before. I mean you've followed us long enough that sometimes these, you know, as you put in a new team, you've got a business that had some challenges on the cost side, you know, as we introduced DBS, we've seen maybe slow starts before like this and as we get going, you know, IDT was very similar. So it's not really surprising. But I do like where we're at in the long term and I think we are going to get after some of the costs here pretty quickly as well. So I think it'll cost some money to do that but we're getting after it and I think you should expect us to do that here for the balance of the year as well.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, sounds good. Best of luck guys. Appreciate it.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nAll right. Thanks Scott.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI, please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi Brianna, good morning and thanks for taking my question. For my first one on bioprocessing, you know, those comments were helpful, but the 0.95x and the order trends, could you perhaps talk about the progression in the quarter? I know the guide didn't change, but given the 0.95x in customer activity levels, should the exit rates for fiscal 2024 change? I think the prior was exiting maybe 1x or north of 1x, and I'm wondering if those assumptions have changed.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMaybe BD. I'll take that first and Rainer can add some color. I would say that as far as the pacing through the quarters goes, I would say that we saw a little bit better start in January and that really did continue through the quarter. So I'm not sure that it was a big inflection in any given month. As far as the exit rate, I still think we're going to exit here high single digits. We've talked about that. I don't think there's any change to that and I would not change anything from our initial revenue guidance where we framed that as in order for us to deliver the down low single digit revenue for the full year, we would need to see every quarter the book-to-bill in the 0.9s.\nAnd so I think we were right in that range here in Q1, and I don't think that there's any change for that. That's reflective of why we have also not updated or changed anything with the guide.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nUnderstood. Maybe my follow up, you know, perhaps Bryan around on this China and IDT comments. Right. China, I know you mentioned comps, but there's been some noise around new loan program, stimulus, etc. Does that change your view on China? Is this incremental? Does it matter in IDT, I think, you know, given some of these business have come up in the BioSecure Act, you know, what is IDT's exposure, if any, to China? And you know, I think you mentioned IDT decline in the quarter was the China ex, China was the share loss or end market. Any comments would be helpful.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure. So starting off with China, we have not changed our perspective for the full year, which we expect to be down high single digits. And certainly we are closely following these discussions around the stimulus that's in play that, you know, is very broad based in terms of an equipment replacement program that ranges from agriculture to heavy industry and also includes healthcare markets like our own. It's very early days, and it's not clear yet how that's to be implemented, whether that's via the central government, whether it trickles through to the provinces. So a lot to be seen there, and at this point we don't expect that to have a large impact here in 2024. And that's why we stick with our perspective of a high single digits decline for the year. So of course we'll keep monitoring that.\nNow when it comes to IDT, IDT is a very small exposure in China, and that's really not the part of the IDT playbook at this point. IDT is doing well, and we're actually very happy with IDT's performance, which has been growing mid-teens since we've acquired the company and has operating margins over 30%.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nFantastic. Thanks guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Vijay.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWelcome back, Doug.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, Rainer. Good to be here. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. So, life sciences as a segment that was better than you guided. You talked about instruments declining mid-singles. You sounded actually pretty good on what was going on with reagents and consumables. What I'm wondering is, were instruments a little weaker than you expected, and then by extension, were reagents and activity stronger than expected? I'm just trying to think about the trends there and what that could mean for the rest of the year.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Doug. Well, thinking about life science tools, which, you know, represents just around 10% of our business, you know, what we saw in Q1 is largely consistent with what we've seen through H2 2023, with core growth in Q1 down mid-single digits. To give you a sense, in developed markets, pharma and biotech customers are stable, albeit at a lower level of demand. Academic and applied markets held up better comparatively, particularly for our more advanced instrumentation. So we're actually starting to see improved funnel activity for later in the year, but those haven't translated to orders yet. So it's good to see more activity, but it's not showing up in the order book yet with the cycle times being what they are for those deals.\nNow, if you think about China, and that's an important part of this market, of course you last year were at the peak of the execution of the stimulus plan in China last year. So the comps are tough here both in Q1 and Q2. And in addition to that, of course you've got lower end market demand just due to the weaker macro there. And then lastly, and as I mentioned to Vijay, we're closely following those discussions around the stimulus, but it really is early days here and we're not able to include that yet in any view towards the future. So we'll continue to monitor that as we go forward.\nThen I'll just conclude here on the life science tools market that what we're seeing is, as expected, this normalization trend coming off tough comps in the first half of last year, and we expect that to continue here in the second quarter. Then in the second half we should see some improvement there.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nSuper helpful, Rainer. One very quick unrelated follow-up. I think as we sit here today, Danaher probably has $30 billion, maybe as much as $40 billion if you stretched for the right deal in M&A capacity. I'm just wondering how you're feeling about the environment right now, especially given where rates are and where funding is as we sit here today. Thank you,\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nDoug. As you know, our bias for capital allocation is towards M&A, but there's no doubt that with higher interest rates the bar is higher. As active as our funnel work is, we're not going to compromise on our earnings expectations here, our return on invested capital targets. That just means that we have to work all the harder here to meet those higher hurdle rates. Nonetheless we're very active as we always are and we'll continue as we have with great discipline around M&A.\n\nDoug Schenkel\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'll take our next question from Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Rainer, you've mentioned a couple of times that the improvement in biotech funding hasn't benefited the business yet. Can you elaborate a bit on your thinking there? How long of a lag do you think you'd see between improved funding and improved business activity? And how does that differ across your different operating units?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan, and good morning to you. So we have seen a stabilization, perhaps even the slightest improvement in biotech funding. But for that to be operationalized here will take some time. In fact, we believe so much time that we have not changed our perspective on our guide in any of the businesses as it relates to biotech funding. So it's early days, it's positive to see and helpful to see the biotech funding stabilize, and even showing the slightest of growth. But it's just too early, and that will take several quarters here to make any discernible difference across the business.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nJust to give you a sense of color on it, we really haven't contemplated anything from an order perspective until next year in how we've thought about our guidance.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Appreciate that. Just a quick follow up on China. I know you framed the high teens core decline as being in line with plan, but curious how different end markets within China progress versus plan. Also curious whether that comment you made on improving funnels and life sciences, whether that applies to China as well or are the trends in China different?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nBack to Q1 in China, our biotechnology segment was down nearly 40%.\nWhich is in line with what we've seen over the last quarters. Here in life sciences, we were down high teens. That gives you a sense of not only what's going on in the market, but the high comp of the prior first half in 2023, and then in diagnostics, we were down low single digits. That gives you a sense of how that's developing as it relates to biotech funding. You are correct that we expect the biotech funding to be skewed more towards developed markets than in China, and it remains to be seen when that returns. So while we're seeing a stabilization there, that stabilization is at a very low level in contrast to what we see in the developed markets.\n\nDan Leonard\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks for the color.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks Dan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nPerfect. Thank you guys, and congratulations on the quarter. So I just wanted to ask on BioSecure Act and how you're thinking about the potential impact to bioprocessing. So we've already heard that some pharma and biotech companies are starting to look at their supply chains and working with some of these Chinese CDMOs, given some of the headlines we've seen around BioSecure. So can you just walk us through what are you hearing from customer conversations on your end with the Chinese CDMOs, but also with pharma and biotech customers and their willingness to partner there? And then additionally, How should we think about this from a longer-term implications standpoint? Could this shift growth to other geographies, and if so, could there be some type of timing or air pocket dynamic as you shift manufacturing from China to other geographies?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rachel. Good morning. So the BioSecure Act, it is, as you can imagine, very difficult to say how this ultimately plays out if we look at potential passage or not, that thing. And of course there's many details are not known yet. Having said that.\nAnd as you suggested, customers are starting to call this out as a risk factor to their business, and of course are starting to take measures to de-risk their business in terms of the molecules that they've developed and ultimately want to manufacture. So, if manufacturing and clinical trials should they shift to other locations? Of course, our solutions follow the molecule. It's really important to note that with our global business and our capability, perhaps more so than anybody, we can deliver our solutions anywhere around the globe with full support from a technology and service perspective. So we have that ability to follow those solutions in terms of timing. Again, this is a business where pharmaceutical companies need to minimize and mitigate risk.\nSo in terms of air pockets, you know, that remains to be seen as pharmaceutical companies perhaps search for other partners for their clinical trials and their manufacturing. Of course we're going to do great work there, should it be necessary, in terms of technology transfers and making sure that any transitions here from one service supplier to the next run as smoothly as possible.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nPerfect, thank you. And then just as a follow-up on bioprocessing, so you highlighted that equipment was weaker, consumables were where the strength was in Q1. Can you just walk us through your assumptions for both of those trends for the rest of the year to get to the full-year guide, and then specifically by year-end, you pointed towards high single digits or above growth in bioprocessing on a core basis. What's really assumed from that from a recovery cycle standpoint on consumables versus equipment, and then any geography trends as well.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks Rachel. We actually don't break it down in terms of how we guide for a quarter or full year between consumables and equipment. We stay at the top level. As we pointed out, we were happy to see the sequential growth here in the Q1 of 5%. You know, what I can say is that the recurring revenue represents about 85% of bioprocessing, and of course that was also the major driver of the improvement in orders that you saw and the book to bill in the quarter. Of course that's where our focus was, that's where the destocking was taking place here over the prior quarters. If you think about our guide here for the full year for bioprocessing down low single digits, 85% of the business is recurring and roughly 15% is equipment.\nI think that's the best way to think about that in terms of our guide and how that splits.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you everyone for joining us today. We'll be around all day and the rest of the week for follow-ups. Have a good day.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude Danaher's Q1 2024 earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We delivered better than anticipated core revenue in each of our segments in the Q4, led by respiratory revenue at Cepheid. The combination of higher-than-expected revenues and our team's strong execution enabled us to exceed our margin and cash flow expectations in what remains a dynamic market environment. Now, before I get into the details of our performance, I wanted to briefly reflect on the progress we made to enhance our portfolio and accelerate our strategy this year.\n2023 was a transformational year for Danaher as we continued to strategically enhance our portfolio and strengthen our growth and earnings trajectory. With the successful spinoff of Veralto in September, we're now a focused life sciences and diagnostics innovator. Establishing Veralto as a standalone public company was one step in our portfolio transformation over the last several years, which has increased our exposure to end markets with durable secular growth drivers. The acquisition of Abcam, which closed in December, further increases our exposure to these highly attractive markets.\nNow, over the long term, we believe Danaher will be a faster-growing business with higher margins and stronger free cash flow generation. 2023 was also a challenging year operationally as pandemic tailwinds became headwinds in our businesses. Our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System helped us navigate these challenges while maintaining a healthy cadence of growth investments and productivity initiatives geared towards improving our cost structure.\nWhile we expect this transitional period to continue through the first half of 2024, these proactive steps, paired with the transformation in our portfolio, provide a strong foundation for sustainable long-term revenue and earnings growth. So, with that, let's take a closer look at our full-year 2023 financial results. Sales were $23.9 billion, and core revenue declined 10%, including core revenue in our base business, which was down slightly, and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 9.5%. Our adjusted operating profit margin was 28.7%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $7.58.\nWe also generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow, resulting in a free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio of more than 120%. Strong free cash flow generation is one of the most important metrics at Danaher, and 2023 marks the 32nd consecutive year our free cash flow-to-net income conversion ratio exceeded 100%. We continued to accelerate investments and innovations throughout the year, which enabled us to deliver several impactful new technologies to our customers. In biotechnology, Cytiva's new Xcellerex™ X-platform bioreactor is helping improve manufacturing yields and reduce the time and cost of biologic drug production.\nIn life sciences, new products such as IDBS's Polar Insight and Molecular Devices CellXpress.ai are helping accelerate the drug discovery process and bring life-changing therapies to market faster. And in diagnostics, new solutions such as Beckman Coulter's DxI 9000 next generation Immunoassay Analyzer are enabling faster, more accurate patient diagnoses. These are just a few of the many examples across Danaher of how we're positioning our businesses for continued growth and delivering on our commitment to help customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world.\nNow, let's turn to our Q4r results in more detail. Sales were $6.4 billion in the Q4, and core revenue declined 11.5%, including a 4.5% decline in our base business and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 7%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined low double digits, driven by lower respiratory, COVID-19 vaccine, and therapeutic revenues, coupled with ongoing investment normalization in pharma and biopharma end markets. High-growth markets were down high single digits, including a mid-teens decline in China, where the economic landscape remains challenging.\nOur gross profit margin for the Q4 was 59%. Our adjusted operating margin of 28.7% was down 420 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower volume in our biotechnology and diagnostic segments and costs related to productivity initiatives. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.09, and we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. Now, let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today.\nReported revenue in our biotechnology segment declined 21%, and core revenue was down 22.5%. Bioprocessing core revenue was down over 20%, as anticipated, and discovery and medical declined high teens. In the bioprocessing-basede business, core revenue declined high teens in the Q4 and was down approximately 10% for the full year 2023. Revenue and order trends were largely consistent with what we saw in the Q3, including our book-to-bill ratio. We were encouraged to see a modest sequential improvement in orders this quarter, with some of our customers returning to normal ordering patterns, but we haven't yet seen a broad-based inflection in demand.\nThe environment in North America and Europe is stable, with customers still working through inventory build-up during the pandemic. Demand and underlying activity levels in China remain weak as customers are continuing to conserve capital and prioritize programs. For the full year 2024, we expect core revenue in our bioprocessing business to be down low single digits. This includes an assumption of a mid-to-high teens revenue decline in the first half of the year, followed by a gradual improvement to a core growth rate of high single digits or better as we exit 2024.\nDespite the near-term headwinds from destocking, our confidence in the health and long-term growth trajectory of the biologics market remains as strong as ever. Underlying demand for biologic medicines continues to rise. 2023 was another record year of FDA approvals for biologic and genomic medicines, and the development pipeline is meaningfully higher than at any point in history. These positive market trends reinforce our conviction in the tremendous opportunity ahead and the high single-digit long-term growth trajectory for our leading bioprocessing franchise.\nOver the last several years, Cytiva has been accelerating investments in innovation to bring impactful new solutions to customers as they advance therapies from the lab through to commercial production. A great example is the recently launched Cytiva™ Protein Select™ technology, an affinity chromatography resin designed to optimize recombinant protein purification. This new technology simplifies the purification process in recombinant proteins, of which there are currently more than 1,800 in development, and enables faster, more efficient process development.\nTurning to our life sciences segment, reported revenue declined 1%, and core revenue was down 4%, including a low single-digit decline in our base business. Our life sciences instruments business collectively declined mid-single digits, with trends in Q4 largely consistent with Q3. We saw continued growth from academic and life science research customers globally, while investment levels at pharma and biopharma customers remained constrained, particularly in China and in North America.\nWe also expanded our capabilities and portfolio with the acquisition of Abcam, which closed in December 2023. The addition of Abcam to our life sciences segment expands our presence in the highly attractive proteomics market and is furthering our strategy to help map complex diseases and accelerate the drug discovery process. We couldn't be more pleased to welcome this highly talented and incredibly innovative team to Danaher. Our genomics consumables-based business was essentially flat in the quarter. Robust demand across plasmids, proteins, and gene writing and editing solutions was offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research.\nDuring the quarter, IDT opened a new CGMP oligonucleotide manufacturing facility at their Coralville, Iowa campus. IDT can now offer a complete CRISPR workflow from design to analysis that supports cell and gene therapy customers in all stages of therapeutic development. This expansion of our capacity and capabilities is both enabling our customers' important work today and fulfilling IDT's vision of improving patient lives by facilitating faster development and commercialization of life-changing therapeutics.\nMoving now to our diagnostics segment, reported and core revenue both declined 8.5%, with high single-digit growth in our base business more than offset by lower respiratory revenue at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered high single-digit core revenue growth. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics led the way with over 10% core revenue growth, including double-digit growth in both instruments and consumables, and notable strengths in clinical, chemistry, and immunoassay.\nThis strong performance in the Q4 rounds out a terrific year for Beckman, where the team has been doing a fantastic job improving their competitive positioning through new product innovation and enhanced commercial execution. In molecular diagnostics at Cepheid, increased menu utilization by customers paired with recent new product innovation helped drive low teens core revenue growth in our non-respiratory business, including high teens or better core revenue growth in group A strep and sexual health. In our respiratory business, Cepheid's revenue of approximately $650 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $350 million.\nA high prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses drove both higher volumes and a preference for our four-in-one test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and RSV. Based on what we saw the last two years and discussions with customers and public health experts, we believe annual respiratory revenue in a typical respiratory season will be approximately $1.5 billion. This increase from our initial assumption of $1.2 billion per year is driven by an expectation of modestly higher volumes and a greater mix of our four-in-one tests.\nThe durability and continued share gains at Cepheid are a testament to the significant value the GeneXpert provides customers at the point of care, close to patients, where the most impactful diagnostic and treatment decisions are made. Cepheid's four-in-one test has become the standard of care for clinicians, given its ability to provide a fast, accurate lab-quality diagnosis for four distinct respiratory illnesses with a single, easy-to-use cartridge.\nLooking ahead with our differentiated positioning and respiratory testing, a leading installed base of more than 55,000 systems, and growing adoption of the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market, Cepheid is well-positioned to help customers meet their clinical needs and continue gaining market share. Now, let's briefly look ahead at expectations for the Q1 and the full year 2024. Beginning with the Q1 of 2024, we will provide guidance for core revenue growth, but will no longer report base business core revenue as the pandemic has transitioned to an endemic state.\nNow, in the Q1, we expect core revenue to decline in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect the Q1 adjusted operating margin of approximately 28%. Turning to the full year 2024, we anticipate core revenue to decline in the low single-digit percent range, which assumes a core revenue decline in the first half of the year before returning to growth in the second half of 2024. Additionally, we expect our full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points versus the full year 2023.\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased to deliver Q4 results ahead of our expectations in what remains a dynamic environment. Despite the challenges we saw throughout 2023, we continued to strengthen our portfolio with M&A and took proactive steps focused on improving our cost structure. Our team's consistent application of the Danaher Business System also drove lasting process improvements in our businesses and enabled the launch of several breakthrough solutions.\nSo, reflecting back on the past few years, it's clear that Danaher is exiting the pandemic a much better, stronger company. We established our dental and environmental and applied solutions segments as standalone public companies in Envista and Veralto. We largely replaced their revenue contribution with higher growth, higher margin annuities with the acquisitions of Cytiva, Aldevron, and Abcam. Additionally, Cepheid's respiratory franchise is now 6x larger today than it was prior to the pandemic, and we expect this to be sustainable.\nSo, putting it all together, we've improved our long-term growth trajectory, significantly expanded margins, and strengthened our free cash flow generation. So, our future is bright, and I'm excited about what lies ahead for Danaher. The unique combination of our incredibly talented team, differentiated science and technology portfolio, and balance sheet optionality, all powered by the Danaher Business System, provides us with a strong foundation to maximize value for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. So, with that, I'll turn it back over to you, John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and one on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw yourself from the queue by pressing star two. Once again, to ask a question, please press star one. Our first question comes from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director of Research of Health Care of Life Science and Diagnostic Tools Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Rainer, maybe starting off just on bioprocess, could you give us a little breakdown here in terms of the outlook that you're providing, say, for China and then the rest of the world? And then I was hoping as well you can give us a snapshot, maybe of how much inventory do you think your customers have today, and how much has that changed versus the peak, and kind of what did your guidance assume kind of when that inventory reaches a normal state?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan. Good morning. And why don't I start off with sort of an overview here of how we've laid out the guide, and then we can dig into your bioprocessing question in a little more detail. So, our guide for the full year of 2024 on revenue is down low single digits. And now let me break that open and talk about the segments. Biotechnology will be down low to mid-single digits, and that's different than bioprocessing. So, keep in mind I'm now talking about the biotechnology segment in its entirety. The guide is down low to mid-single digits. Life sciences down low single digits, and diagnostics up low single digits.\nAnd once again, overall, that's then down low single digits. Now, at a high level, we actually expect that dynamic to be opposite of 2023, with a slow first half returning to growth in the second half. And now let me talk just a little bit about the assumptions around our guidance, starting with bioprocessing, which we're guiding to be down low single digits. And we think the first half will look a lot like the second half of 2023, down mid to high teens, coming off of a Q4, which showed incrementally improved orders versus Q3. Second half, we expect to return to mid to high single-digit growth.\nAnd we believe by then that this destocking in North America and Western Europe will have largely been completed. And of course, the comps ease there as well. So, importantly, for bioprocessing, we think exit rate for the year will be high single digits or better core growth. Now, if we look at life sciences, we expect life sciences to be down low single digits for the guide. And we expect a slow start, and we should see growth improve here through the second half, given some of the comps that we have seen as the normalization, particularly in the instrument business, continues.\nAnd we've been talking about that for some time, and we expect that to continue into 2024 as well. Now, if we look at that by end market, we see pharma and biotech stable, but at lower levels of demand, and then academic and applied markets holding up comparatively better. Geographically, we see China weak with a slower macro. And of course, in life sciences in particular, we have some prior year comps related to the subsidized loan program there. And then lastly, on life sciences, we expect developed markets to be relatively consistent with 2023.\nAs we look at diagnostics, which we are guiding up low single digits, we see no change to the underlying trends. Patient volumes have normalized. And in the non-respiratory business, we expect growth of mid-single digits. And of course, that's offset by lower respiratory revenue, which was $1.9 billion in 2023, and we anticipate that that will be $1.6 billion in 2024. So, Dan, that's how the year shapes up by segment. And of course, then we can now perhaps talk a little bit more detail around bioprocessing.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, Dan, maybe to just kind of to put some numbers around your question as well. So, I think China for the year for bioprocessing, you should probably think about the Q1 being down similar to what we saw in Q2, Q3, and Q4 last year, call it North of 40. And then I think for the full year, I think even that will still be down kind of mid-teens for bioprocessing in China. That's sort of what we've got dialed in. And as far as the rest of the world, I think we'll be down in the first half and then kind of return to growth here in the second half after we get past the destocking.\nAnd I know you asked how much kind of inventory is in the channel. It's kind of hard to say, Dan. I mean, we've got a kind of a moving target, but we've got a good sense that we will largely be through most of the destocking, particularly North America and Europe, where it was probably the biggest. I think we're going to be through that here in the first half, which then sort of speaks to why we think it gets a little bit better in the second half of the year.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director of Research of Health Care of Life Science and Diagnostic Tools Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thanks, guys. And then, and then maybe a follow-up just on bioprocessing, such a huge focus. Just in terms of the guide that you've laid out like, what does that assume from kind of a book-to-bill or bookings trajectory as we work through the year? And just kind of related to that, several peers have already pointed to book-to-bill is kind of above one. Obviously, everyone's order books or mix of business is different, but what's kind of unique about your business, do you think? Is it clinical versus commercial, or is it just the size of your book, or just any color, why you think some of the peers have seen the turn in their business faster than what you guys have seen? Thank you.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, let me give you a little bit of color on how I'm thinking about the guide or how we're thinking about the guide. Maybe start with, and this is for bioprocessing, start with kind of a qualitative overview of what this guide sort of is, right? This guide calls for a slight improvement versus our demonstrated book-to-bill of the last couple of quarters. We've been in that kind of 0.8, 0.85 range the last four or five quarters.\nAnd we, you know, are not calling for an inflection at any point in the year, but we are assuming some modest improvement as we move through the first half into the second half, as like I said before, as we think that North America and Europe destocking is largely behind us after the first half. So, no inflection, sort of just kind of gets a little bit better than where we were. As far as kind of some numbers around that, Dan, maybe start with the backlog. So, we're starting with about a quarter and a half of backlog.\nThat's pretty consistent with where we were in 2018, 2019. So, I think we're back to backlog levels that are, relatively speaking, pretty much in line with history. And then start with that backlog and add this book-to-bill assumption in there. We are assuming book-to-bills improve slightly, like I said, kind of from the 0.8, 0.85s into the 0.9s, and that those will get a little bit better every quarter as we build through the year. But we are not assuming book-to-bill above one in any given quarter. And so, that kind of assumes that we get past the inventory destocking in the first half, the second half gets a little bit better, and that we're kind of exiting here.\nLike I said, the first half will be down mid-teens, mid to high teens, but the second half we exit with high single digit or better without seeing an inflection. And I think maybe I know that there's been some questions on that second half ramp as well, maybe just to give people some quantitative numbers on that. So, the second half ramp in bioprocess assumed in this guide is about a $250 million year-over-year second half increase. So, that's on a, call it a $6 to 6.5 billion business.\nSo, yes, there is a step up, but I think it's relatively modest on a business with $6 billion to expect that we think we could do a couple hundred million dollars better year-over-year in the second half as we move past the destocking. So, hopefully that helps frame the guide a little better.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director of Research of Health Care of Life Science and Diagnostic Tools Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morning, Vijay.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning, Rainer. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess I'll start off with those last comments from that. The Q1 guidance here, Rainer, on biotech and bioprocess being down low 20s. I guess we did see sequential order improvements in Q4 for bioprocess. What is driving and comps to get easier for you? Q4 to Q1 on biotech, comps to get easier. So, what is driving the minus 20% maybe thought process around the Q1 guidance assumptions? And also, have you – I know there was a no-fee cancellation policy. Has that stopped for Danaher?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. Vijay, it's Matt. Maybe I'll take a first stab at it. So, if we think about kind of the first half here, I think it's probably instructive to sort of remember where we were. If you remember, our base business core growth in Q1 last year was actually up low single digits. For the first half of 2023, we were only down kind of low to mid-single digits in total, right? The second half, we were down mid-teens or high teens, as everybody remembers. But we do have that comp coming in Q1. So, when you think about year-over-year, that's really the biggest factor. As far as sequential goes, kind of Q4 to Q1, I would tell you that we would, you know, I think we talked about this in January.\nOur Q3 to Q4 sequential, that's pretty normal. That's a normal Q3 to Q4 step up. I think we attributed that to a normal seasonality when we were out at JPMorgan. It's also very normal to see Q4 to Q1 step down. So, just maybe some numbers to that. Q4 is usually 27% to 28% of our year, and Q1 is usually 24% to 25% of revenue for the year. So, I mean, it's pretty normal for us to see it. I think we saw it even in kind of a heyday of 2021 to 2022, we saw a step down. So, I think there's a normal seasonality. I think the other big thing to remember is, and it kind of ties into your last question there, Vijay, we are actively trying to continue to destock and get as much of this behind us as we can.\nAnd so, I think we've been pretty aggressive with that. We're going to remain aggressive with that. I think you're seeing that, hopefully, here in the first half, that we are. Back to your kind of no-fees question, it depends is the answer. But rest assured, we are doing what we can to get to the second half of the year.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nUnderstood. And I guess my follow-up here, Rainer, is when you look at customer activity levels or consumption, if you will, what's been the underlying activity at customer levels? When we think about drug volumes being up, high signals in that space, is that still intact? And sort of, I guess, one on diagnostics, if you will. Last year, you guys did base diagnostics up double digits. And I think you mentioned mid-singles for this year. So, is that just a comp issue why diagnostics would slow down?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Vijay. Well, starting with the activity level here for bioprocessing, we've really seen no change in the activity level, which continues to be along the long-term growth rate that we've been talking about, high single digits, 10%. And that's what's been important in terms of drawing the inventories down. So, and it aligns with how we spoke about the regional developments here, which Western Europe and North America are drawing down inventories more rapidly than perhaps regions that are more small biotech, emerging biotech companies such as China. So, the activity level continues to be strong.\nI mentioned to you during the prepared remarks that we've seen a historic level of both approvals as well as number of projects in the biologic development pipeline. So, we continue to be very confident in a continued positive development there.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Sorry, on diagnostics, Rainer?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, Vijay, I mean, I think it's just it's all going to be mostly a comp issue. The base business, the business outside of, I should say, respiratory continues to do well for Cepheid. All of the other businesses in diagnostics, no real change to the underlying demand. So, it's going to be a comp issue.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nAll of diagnostics. Yep.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nFantastic. Thank you.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Vijay.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Good morning, Rainer, Matt, and John. Guys, can you help us? When volumes are kind of still moving negative in the first half of the year, it's hard to get your arms around kind of what you've done to the cost structure with the 50 basis point guide up. Is there anything we could look at, any KPIs you can share around headcount reductions, rooftops, or anything that you guys have kind of tangibly done internally on costs that you can share that helps us understand perhaps what that impact on margins will be in not just 2024, but going forward? Thanks.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. Yeah, I mean, maybe the way to think about the OP is kind of at a high level, Scott, is you know, we ended 2023 with an adjusted operating margin of, you know, almost approximately 28.5%. And we think, like you said, it's going to be up 50 basis points here in the year. We had $350 million of sort of one-time costs last year. Some of that, if I think about what that was and the metrics around it, I would tell you that there's a lot of heads that did come out. And largely, that was reflective of the lower volumes that we saw last year, particularly at Cepheid. As we went from 70 million tests down to 35, we sort of knew there would come a day when we were going to need to pull back some of that capacity.\nAnd largely, last year, we did that. I think you also saw it at some of the other businesses in the second half, as well in life sciences and some others that have seen a little bit more difficult growth profiles. I think largely, it is heads. There are some rooftops here and there, but I think it's more trying to get after the cost structure to right-size it for what's going to be a difficult first half so that we're in a good spot. So, that $350 million of benefit, that would have been about 150 basis points on its own, Scott. But we do have the lower volumes, as you mentioned, in bioprocessing, respiratory, and that basically offset all of it.\nAnd so, really, the cost savings, if you will, from that $350 million that we deployed is what we're getting and flowing through as the 50 basis points of margin expansion. That should be pretty durable as we go. Hopefully, with a little bit better volume here in the gross and adjusted operating margin, margins we have, a little bit of volume is going to go a long way.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYeah, I would imagine so. Guys, can you help us understand China? I understand that, you know, I guess, you know, consistent with last quarter and the guide and such, still pretty conservative. How do you kind of separate the cyclical versus kind of what I'll call the secular, which is perhaps maybe government policy and other impacts are out there? And I haven't been to China in a while, so perhaps maybe you guys can help us understand the puts and takes there. And is that market still attractive long-term, or has there been some sort of change at the margin there that perhaps makes it less interesting? I'll just kind of open it up to that. It's a lot of white space, if you will. Thanks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure. Scott, you know, China, let me start with this. We continue to believe China is an attractive market in the long term that is going to be accretive to our overall growth. And the reason for that is that the Chinese government and, frankly, the Chinese people are prioritizing, among very few priorities, they are prioritizing healthcare more broadly, but also more specifically in terms of building their own pharmaceutical industry with both generic, and innovative, and biosimilar-type drugs. And that process, while it has taken a pause here or certainly slowed as the funding environment has become more difficult in the short term, we expect that process to work itself out here in the midterm.\nNow, for China this year, as it relates to our guide, we're assuming that China will be down high single digits. Yes, because of the challenging macro, we actually expect that macro to be more challenging than perhaps even what we see in the healthcare market. But we're not planning in that guide a stimulus from the Chinese government, but more of the same. And then, of course, the reversing of tough comps here in the second half. So, it's going to be a tougher start to the year as the activity level essentially remains where it has been here in the second half of 2023, particularly in biotechnology and life sciences.\nAnd then, as we get through those tougher comps in the first half, we'll see the second half where we're not assuming significantly higher activity levels, but we do see the math then working in our favor. Longer term, we believe the pull and the requirement in China for these innovative and highly effective drugs is intact and that the investment will continue.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nVery helpful. Best of luck in 2024, guys. Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Michael.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Hey, Rainer. Hey, Matt. I want to follow up on a couple of your comments from earlier in the Q&A just on bioprocess, make sure I got it right. I mean, first, I think you called out that you don't expect book-to-bill above one at any point during the year. So, I mean, that means you'll be continuing to deplete the backlog all year. But you already cited that the backlog is sort of at a normal level with one and a half quarters. So, I'm just wondering, how low is that going to get over the course of the year, then if your book-to-bill doesn't break one?\nAnd then sort of related to that, if you've only got one to two quarters of backlog and yet you're calling for this gradual improvement as the year goes on, high single-digit growth rate, just sort of what underpins that improvement from what you do see in Q1, Q2 to start the year?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, I mean, I think the way we talked about the guide, I mean, I did say that it doesn't go over one, but it gets pretty close in the second half. I mean, if you do the math, it does get pretty close to one. So, I think, you know, it is still a little bit early to call what we're going to see in 2025. But I think you're right. We are calling for gradual improvements in the book-to-bill through the year, and it will get pretty close to one, but not over one, in the second half. That's kind of how we're thinking about it. And as far as the growth rate, first half to second half, I think was your question. Is that right, Mike? I want to make sure.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, just visibility in that improvement.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, like I said, it's not a huge number, right? First half to second half, you're talking about $250 million. So, we are, I think the visibility is improving a little bit here as we move into the year, and we expect that it will continue to do so as we move past the inventory destocking in the first half. And so, I think, you know, with the assumption of a ramp, admittedly, but only on, you know, only of a couple hundred million dollars, I just feel like if we can get past the destocking, be aggressive with that, having a second half ramp that is $250 million bucks on $6 billion, it's not that steep in reality. And frankly, we constructed the guide to have no real kind of step up or inflection either in bioprocessing.\nIt may not happen that way, right? And if it does happen, if we do see something, you know, an inflection that's higher, we obviously will update the guide and update everybody. But we're trying to just lay out how we are thinking about not having an inflection, not calling an inflection. Things are getting a little bit better. They're going to get better through the year. And certainly, given the math and the anticipated modest step up, that's how you sort of get to a second half with high single digits. Remember, we're also working on a comp of the second half that's going to be down high teens. So, I think that's what gives us sort of the confidence, is we've got a little bit better customer visibility.\nWe think we're going to be behind the destocking, and we've got some comps that will help those numbers.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. All right. I saw the $250 million was second half to second half, not first half to second half, but I can follow up.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nNo, that is second half to second half. Yeah, that's second half to second half. I'm sorry. Yep. Yep.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Okay. All right. Well, either way, we'll follow up offline. For just follow-up question, I want to ask a little bit on the life sciences segment, and maybe put another way, I want to think about from a customer perspective. Can you talk about pharma and biotech outside of bioprocess, putting bioprocess aside? For the rest of pharma and biotech, it seems like your outlook is still somewhat cautious. You're talking about low levels of demand. Just curious, any early signs?\nI know we're still in January, still early in the year, but just sort of how those companies are thinking about budgets for the year, how, you know, how the life science segment and pharma and biotech specifically, you know, recovers post-2023. Thanks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSo, Michael, just to level set then, coming off of Q4, which the life sciences tools were down mid-single digits, and that was largely consistent with Q3. We anticipate that this normalization in life sciences instruments, which really began in the second half of 2023, will continue in 2024. If we think about it by end market, we do see pharma and biotech stabilizing, but at these lower levels of demand, just because we believe and saw, and the numbers showed here over the last two years or so, an anomalous level of buying and pulling forward of demand, whether that was China through loan subsidies or whether that was COVID dollars infused for additional research, we expect that normalization to continue here.\nAlso, in the Q1, where we expect life sciences to be down similarly to Q4. Now, keep in mind, for us, life sciences instruments is only about 10% of the portfolio. So, we may not be a good read across here. Nonetheless, we do think it's going to take some time here in Q1, first half in order for that normalization to occur. But we do believe that it's stabilizing at this lower activity level.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nHi, Rachel.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks so much. Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I wanted to push a little bit more on bioprocessing. You know, you've noted that you're not modeling an inflection in that business this year, but can you talk about if you're seeing any of these green shoots from customers signaling that they may have gotten too lean on inventory? And then, if we look back at last year, you'd mentioned on the Q4 call that you'd had conversations with customers that shifted your expectations around bioprocessing and order trends at the JPMorgan conference last year.\nSo, can you talk to us about how those conversations with customers trended at the conference this year and how that's impacting the guide as well?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. Maybe I can start, and Rainer can probably—he had more of the customer conversations than I did, if we're being honest. So, yeah, I mean, I think when we think about the guide, and you think about green shoots, I think maybe the way I would characterize it is, we, you know, six months ago, there were no anecdotes. There were no customers coming and saying, \"I needed something quickly.\" There were no pull forwards from our quarters into this quarter. I think we have started to see a little bit more of that here anecdotally.\nI don't think it is widespread enough to be able to say, you know, \"We're going to be beyond this in the next two, three months,\" which is why we sort of have the first half pegged where we do. But combined with the our tracking of the inventory, so we do know where it is at, we've got a much better handle on that. Combined with sort of some of these anecdotes and frankly, a little bit better sort of funnels that we are seeing, we do feel like we've got a little bit better visibility as we head into the year, which gives us the confidence, as we talked about earlier, to think that the destocking is going to be largely behind us as we get through the first half.\nAnd that's sort of how we modeled into the, into the book-to-bill, slowly kind of getting up, but not wanting to get real aggressive and call a big inflection anywhere. So, that's sort of how we, what we've seen here over the course of the last probably three, four months. So, anecdotally, a little bit better situation out there. We are hearing some good things that, you know, you want to call it a green shoot, I suppose you could, but I'd probably call it a good anecdote that is now starting to see more of those and sort of less of the negative ones, if you will. And maybe, Rainer, you want to talk about customer discussions at JP?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nJust really just to confirm that we continue to see a trend of more positive conversations, of customers returning to normal order patterns, thinking about how they're planning out not only the first, but the second half of the year. So, all of these conversations are directionally, we believe, positive and sort of support what we saw also in the sequential improvement, which was partially seasonal, certainly, but we also saw some improving order patterns there. So, what we're looking for ultimately, and that's what Matt referred to previously, is a broad-based improvement in order patterns, at which point we will update accordingly.\nBut where we sit today, we think that the first half will be slower, also related to some of the comps that we talked about, and that the positive development, which we've seen here in the past months will continue and then manifest itself really in the second half, where we then exit with high single-digit or better exit rate.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. And then my follow-up, I wanted to just press a little bit more on this pace of recovery within bioprocessing. So, one of your peers has slowly been ticking up their book-to-bill sequentially over the last few quarters. They just recently crossed that 1.0 level. That said, though, Danaher is really one of the few companies or only that has been actively working with customers to manage their inventory levels. So, while I appreciate the guidance, you know, isn't modeling a massive inflection at some point this year in bioprocessing, how should we think about that impact in managing your customers' inventory levels on what that does to the pace of recovery?\nAnd is there some reason why we shouldn't see more of a V-pace recovery, V-shaped recovery, excuse me, for Danaher? Thank you.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, I think it's a little bit tough, right? When everybody is going to be, while we are all in the same kind of boat, I think everybody will have a slightly different timing about when we get through sort of the inventory destocking. So, I think part of it is going to be the breadth of our portfolio. Part of it's going to be the geographic mix we have, and part of it's going to be just sort of, you know, our customers and where we were kind of heavier or not. So, I think there's a lot that goes into it. So, I think it'll be a little bit different for everybody. I think every, you know, kind of each modality might be different as well.\nSo, cell culture media might be different from chromatography and filtration. So, I think all of those things combined sort of are what we're seeing. I think everybody's going to see it at a different time. I think you saw that with us in the first half of last year. You know, and we were only down low singles, and I think some other folks were down, you know, mid-teens or more, right? I think there is going to be a little bit of a lag in timing. To your second question, could we see a V?\nI mean, it's possible, but we did not, you know, want to kind of model that in to, you know, for a lack of a better—we don't have enough confidence right now. We have not seen it in the order book of enough magnitude and duration to be able to call a turn of a V-shaped recovery. Is it possible? Sure. Anything's possible. But if we, and if we see that, we obviously we would talk about it. But we're going to exit the year here at high single digits, from a, you know, from a high single digit plus, frankly, as we exit the year. And if we do better than this forecast that we have here of in the nines, that will have obviously an impact on, you know, at some point, the exit trajectory, I suspect.\nIt depends on when it happens. Specifically, if it happens earlier, I think it would have an impact. But again, we're not planning for it. When we see it, we will obviously update and let people know. But for this guide, it is, you know, trying to be transparent with everybody. That's what we're expecting, or what our guide planning for.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Managing Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Leerink Partners\n\n[crosstalk] Yeah, hi. Yeah, thanks, Rainer. My first question, I'm tempted to ask about bioprocessing, but let me stick with instrumentation first. Could you tell us what you're, you know, expecting for growth in instrumentation in 2024? And maybe if you could provide some context on the instrumentation recovery, and when can we potentially start to see that at a normalized sort of growth level?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation",
    "content2": "So, we think our life science instrumentation business, well, for the year, be down at low single digits. And that's based really on a softer first half of the year and then slow but persistent improvement here in the second half of the year. What are some of the drivers of that? Well, first of all, here in the first half, we are looking at some pretty significant comps. You will recall the China loan program, in particular, in the first half of last year, put us into mid-to-high teens growth. And of course, at the current activity levels, that will result in a softer first half here.\nWe also talked about the fact that pharma, biopharma are constraining their investment a bit more along the lines of just recently having changed out their installed base, taking advantage of additional dollars available during the pandemic, and normalizing here as we get through the first half of the year. If we think geographically, China remains weak, and we don't expect that to improve here. If anything, that'll be a second half of the year dynamic. So, life sciences starting to stabilize, really, at the activity levels of the second half of last year.\nWe expect that to continue through the first and then see gradual improvement here in the second half of the year, also from a comp perspective.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Managing Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Leerink Partners\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then on Abcam, could you update us on the DBS efforts there? And what are you seeing in terms of the REO antibodies markets and expectations that you have for sort of Abcam in 2024? And lastly, if I could just ask about after the Veralto spin, how are you thinking about capital deployment overall? Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSo, first of all, Abcam, we couldn't be more pleased than having, you know, closed that early here in December. That'd a good finish to the year, and we are working with the team, and we're up and running. And of course, you can imagine the DBS implementation is proceeding in a focused way where the team is really pulling. So, Abcam is on the way. Then, as it relates to capital deployment, you heard my comments earlier around our balance sheet optionality, which is strong, we believe, differentiated. And post the Veralto spin, we'll continue, as we always have, to work on deploying that capital to strengthen our portfolio and continue to be active as always.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Managing Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Leerink Partners\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's question and answer session. I will now turn the call back to John Bedford for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Todd. Everyone, we're around for follow-ups. Have a good rest of your day. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation Q3 2023 Earnings Results Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during that time, simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then the number two on your telephone keypad. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to point out that our Form 10-Q for the Q3, our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, the reconciliations, and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call, and a note containing details of historical and anticipated future financial performance are all available on the Investors section of our website www.danaher.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call.\nA replay of this call will also be available until 8 November 2023. During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the Q3 of 2023, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. Before turning the call over to Rainer, I'd also like to point out that since Veralto was part of Danaher through the end of the Q3, our financial highlights will include the combined Danaher and Veralto results. We will then provide detail for the businesses remaining with Danaher. Veralto will be reporting their Q3 results separately later this week, and we'd ask that you please save any questions about the Veralto businesses until then.\nOur guidance for Danaher's continuing operations will exclude Veralto for the Q4 and the full year. I'd also like to mention that historical financial results reflecting only Danaher's continuing operations excluding Veralto are available on the investors section of our website under the subheading Financial Reports.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, thank you John, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today.\nCore revenue in Q3 came in ahead of our expectations with Biotechnology performing as anticipated and higher testing revenues more than offsetting slightly softer than expected demand in Life Sciences. Our team's consistent DBS-driven execution also enabled us to deliver better than expected earnings and cash flow in what remains a challenging and dynamic operating environment.\nThis was also a transformative quarter for Danaher. On 30 September 2025, we completed the spin-off of Veralto Corporation, a global leader in water and product quality. The successful launch of Veralto is a testament to the team's execution, focus, and outstanding teamwork. We believe this separation creates exceptional opportunities for both Danaher and Veralto to better serve their customers, deliver on their respective strategic priorities, and create greater long-term shareholder value in the years ahead. Now I want to thank Jennifer Honeycutt and all the Veralto associates for their contributions to Danaher over the past two plus decades, and we wish them the very best as they embark on their exciting endeavor to help safeguard the world's most vital resources.\nNow going forward, Danaher is a more focused Life Sciences and diagnostic innovator committed to accelerating the power of science and technology to improve human health. We've got a great line-up of leading franchises well positioned in attractive end markets with durable high recurring revenue business models, and our strong free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. This unique combination of our leading science and technology portfolio and financial strength, all powered by the Danaher Business System, differentiates us, and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage.\nSo with that, let's turn to our Q3 results in more detail.\nNow, John mentioned, since Veralto was part of Danaher through the end of the Q3, our financial highlights for the Q3 include Veralto's results.\nSales were $6.9 billion in the Q3, and core revenue declined 11.5%, including a 3% decline in our base business and a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 8.5%.\nGeographically, core revenues in developed markets declined low double digits primarily driven by lower COVID-19 revenues. High growth markets were down high single digits, including a mid-teens decline in China, where the economic landscape remains challenging.\nOur gross profit margin for the Q3 was 58.2%. Our operating margin of 20.9% was down 540 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower volume in our biotechnology and diagnostics segment and costs related to the separation of Veralto.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.02. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $4.6 billion year-to-date, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 120%.\nStrong free cash flow generation continues to be one of the most important metrics at Danaher and enables us to actively pursue high impact organic growth and M&A opportunities.\nNow let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 19% and core revenue was down 21%. Bioprocessing core revenue declined over 20% as anticipated while discovery and medical was down mid-single digits as a result of lower demand from our earlier stage research and lab filtration customers.\nIn bioprocessing base business core revenue declined mid-teens, and market conditions were consistent with our expectations coming into the Q3. Our customers are still working through inventory built up during the pandemic while also continuing to conserve capital as a result of funding pressures. China was down approximately 45% in the quarter driven by a weak funding environment and lower underlying activity levels. Based on what we're seeing today, we're maintaining our full-year outlook of approximately 10% base business decline in bioprocessing, which assumes that market conditions in the Q4 are consistent with what we saw in the Q3.\nAlthough these market dislocations are impacting our recent performance, global demand for biologic medicines continues to increase. Since 2018, underlying demand for biologics has grown at an average annual rate of approximately 10% and is continuing to grow in 2023. In addition to more patients using biologic medicines, this year is on pace to be a record year for FDA approvals of biologics, including approvals for meaningful indications such as Alzheimer's disease and several cancer immunotherapies. These positive trends reinforce our conviction in the tremendous opportunity ahead in the biologics market and the high single-digit long-term growth outlook for our leading bioprocessing franchise.\nNow the pace of innovation and advancement in biologic medicine is accelerating, and Cytiva is uniquely positioned to support customers as they pursue life-changing breakthroughs. Cytiva's recently launched NanoAssembler. The industry's first end-to-end lipid nanoparticle formulation system is a great example of how our investments in innovation are supporting customers' needs around quality, yields, and cost. The NanoAssemblr automates and streamlines the lipid nanoparticle manufacturing workflow, helping improve reproducibility and scalability in the nucleic acid therapy manufacturing process.\nTurning to our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue declined 1% and core revenue was down 2.5%, including a low single digit decline in our base business. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively declined mid-single digits, in part driven by China where an already challenging funding environment further deteriorated as the quarter progressed. Outside of China, we continued to see softness at pharma and biopharma customers while demand remained stable in life science research and applied markets.\nOur genomics consumables-based business declined low single digits in the quarter. Double-digit growth across plasmids, proteins, and gene writing and editing solutions, which are primarily used in projects that are in later stages of the drug development pipeline or have been commercialized, was more than offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research.\nOur Life Sciences businesses continue to deliver innovative solutions that are helping accelerate the discovery and development of biologic medicines. Molecular Devices recently released the CellXpress.ai, an artificial intelligence driven cell culture system that automates traditionally manual cultivation processes. The CellXpress.ai is engineered to improve workflows and reproducibility in growing and scaling human relevant cell lines which can reduce reliance on animal models and fast track potential therapeutics to preclinical trials.\nWe're also actively leveraging strategic M&A to enhance our capabilities and bring greater value to our customers. In August we announced our intention to acquire Abcam, a leading producer of protein consumables that are critical for advancing drug discovery, life science research, and diagnostics. Abcam has a long track record of innovation, outstanding product quality, and breadth of antibody portfolio, which positions them as a key partner for the scientific community. The addition of Abcam will give Danaher entry into this highly attractive market, furthering our strategy to help map complex diseases and accelerate the drug discovery process. We expect Abcam will be accretive on multiple levels including core growth, earnings, and talent and look forward to welcoming this incredibly innovative team to Danaher once the transaction closes.\nNow moving to our diagnostics segment, reported revenue declined 16% and core revenue declined 15.5%, with mid-single-digit growth in our base business more than offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth. Radiometer led the way with high single-digit core growth and solid results across both blood gas and point-of-care immunoassay product lines.\nBeckman Coulter Diagnostics was up mid-single digits with double-digit growth in instrumentation, and notable strength across clinical chemistry and immunoassay. Beckman's recent strong performance is a direct result of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve commercial execution. We're seeing better win and retention rates globally, particularly in North America which grew high single digits in Q3. The team has also been accelerating new product innovation and there's encouraging early traction in Europe for the DxI 9000, Beckman's next-generation immunoassay analyzer.\nIn molecular diagnostics, increased menu utilization by customers paired with recent new product innovation helped drive over 20% core revenue growth in non-respiratory testing at Cepheid, including more than 25% core revenue growth in Group A strep and sexual health.\nIn respiratory testing, Cepheid's revenue of approximately $350 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $100 million. A higher prevalence of COVID-19 drove both higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, flu A, flu B, and RSV. As we move into the Q4 and our customers begin planning for the respiratory season, we now expect approximately $1.6 billion of respiratory testing revenue for the full year versus our previous expectation of $1.2 billion.\nThe broad based strength across Cepheid's testing menu is a result of the team's thoughtful approach to placing systems over the last few years. Customers who realize the benefit of accurate, easy to use molecular testing during the pandemic are increasingly consolidating their point of care testing platforms onto the GeneXpert and adding additional assays from our leading test menu. Their preference for the GeneXpert within their labs and across their healthcare networks has led to a more than 2.5x increase in both our installed base and revenue since 2019, and we believe Cepheid is well positioned to continue gaining share and expanding our installed base in today's endemic environment.\nNow let's briefly look ahead at expectations for Q4 and the full year.\nAs a reminder, both our Q4 and full year guidance include only Danaher's continuing operations and exclude Veralto. In the Q4, we expect core revenue in our base business to be down mid-single digits year over year. We also expect total core revenue to decline in the high-teens percent range, primarily as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a Q4 adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 28%, which includes additional anticipated productivity initiatives to further adjust our cost structure.\nTurning to the full year 2023, we anticipate core revenues in our base business will be down slightly, and we also expect total core revenue to decline low double digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%.\nSo, to wrap up, we're pleased with our Q3 results and believe the combination of our team's DBS-driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled Danaher to outperform on a relative basis with the successful spinoff of Veralto. We are now a more focused company committed to deploying leading-edge science and technology to improve human health. Danaher is purpose-built to help customers solve some of the most important health challenges impacting patients around the world. Our proven ability to innovate is enabling faster, more accurate diagnoses and helping customers reduce the time and cost needed to sustainably develop and deliver life-changing therapies. So, as we look ahead, the unique combination of our talented team, differentiated science and technology portfolio, and balance sheet optionality, all powered by the Danaher Business System, positions us well to maximize value for our customers, our associates, and our shareholders.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw yourself from the queue by pressing star two.\nOur first question will come from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Dan.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director of Life Science & Diagnostic Tools Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning, Rainer. How are you? Thanks for the questions here. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just starting off with bioprocessing, if you don't mind, since there remains obviously, as you know, a tremendous amount of focus here. I know with Q2 you guys talked about order trends being down modestly in the second half of the year. Sounds like what you're seeing is consistent with that. But I was hoping maybe you can unpack a little bit of color on kind of what's going on in the order side for bioprocess and kind of what you're seeing in the field and kind of what this might portend as we think about, you know, looking out to 2024.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure, Dan. Let's, let's start off with Q3 one more time here. So Q3 results were consistent with what we expected.\nBut also have to be clear that we have not seen an inflection in orders. And I would say that we're sort of at the bottom here, bouncing along. And to give you a sense of this quantitatively, from our book-to-bill was around 0.8, which is consistent with what we've been seeing here for the last few quarters. And for Q4, we think that looks a lot like Q3 with likely similar book-to-bill. But we do continue to expect our base business for the full year for bioprocessing to be down 10%, so as expected.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nHey Dan, maybe just a little bit of other color too, just to give some sense of what we saw. You know, orders in dollar terms were actually down a little Q3 versus Q2. And like Rainer said, the book-to-bill here has been at 0.8. It's been like that for Q6. I think we anticipate that it'll be like that in Q4 as well. And I think kind of another triangulation that I look at is kind of on a two-year stack here. Orders have been kind of call it down 32%, 33%, 34% here for the last Q3. So, like Rainer said, I think we're looking at a Q4 that looks a lot like Q3 but.\nNo real change here.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director of Life Science & Diagnostic Tools Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it.\nThanks guys.\nMaybe just one, just kind of zooming out a little bit. If you could just any way, any helpful way to think about, you know, obviously we have Q4 ahead of us and you talked about this dynamic environment which we all, which we can all see, which we had better visibility, but we can all see it. As we, you know, if you're thinking about flipping, you know, the calendar to 2024, any early way to think about like a framework for revenue growth, earnings, and margins, you know, as we get into the new year.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nDan, I think as you look towards 2024, it's really important to understand the context here of the second half. So let me, let me lay that out for you briefly. Once again, our Q3 exceeded expectations. Diagnostics was better than we expected, driven by strength at Beckman Diagnostics and respiratory testing at Cepheid, and bioprocessing was as expected. And we don't believe that changes here either. So, we do believe that we're at the bottom here in 2023 in bioprocessing. That's partially offset by weaker life science instruments. And as a reminder, life science instruments for us is less than 10% of our total business. So Q3 all in a solid outperformance in the quarter with what we think are some important markers around diagnostics, bioprocessing, and life science instruments. Now if you think about Q4 and there bioprocessing and diagnostics, there's really no change to our prior expectations.\nWe expect those to continue to perform similarly as we've talked about in the past in Q3. Now as it relates to life science instruments there, we've seen some incremental weakness in Q3, and we would expect that to continue or step down slightly here in Q4. With that as a context for the second half, there's really no change to revenue as Q3 offsets Q4. We're holding the full year here. There's also no change to our bioprocessing expectations for the year. We continue to believe that 2023 represents the bottom now as it relates to 2024.\nGiven where markets are today and the broader macro, we want to see how Q4 plays out before we provide a guide on our Q4 earnings call in January, as we always do. We want to see the next couple of months here play out and then build the guide, as always, for our January earnings call.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nManaging Director of Life Science & Diagnostic Tools Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Thanks, Rainer. Thanks, Matt.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Rainer.\nYou know, one I just want to go back to this bioprocessing. So with book-to-bill 0.8x, I guess is bioprocessing going to grow next year if orders are below revenues in 2023? I don't know if there's a restocking phenomenon, like how should we generally broad strokes and bioprocessing, the pluses and minuses, as we look at the outlook, right? Should China inflect, or any levers that you have that could move bioprocess?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSo, you know, I think I come back to the actual data, Vijay, that we see, which is, you know, Q3 really was very similar to Q2. The book-to-bill was the same. We saw the market develop as we had anticipated, you know, from our prior call that we've been working with customers here to take some of the tension out of the system and try and ensure that as much inventory is burned off as possible here in the year. And that's why we're confident that this is the bottom. But as it relates to 2024, there's a lot of moving pieces here and it's quite hard to draw generalizations and that's why it's so important for us also to see the data here for another quarter in Q4 before we talk about what it looks like in 2024.\nNow having said that, you know, we do expect that this inventory dynamic and what's going on in China is going to also go into, if you will, impact into 2024 as well. This doesn't stop at midnight on the 31st of 2023, but we have seen a stabilization here with the last Q2, and we want to see how Q4 develops before calling 2024 in January.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nUnderstood. Matt, one for you. Thanks for giving the stand-alone numbers. I think it looks like the stand-alone margins here ex-EAS for Danaher for fiscal 2023 is about 28.5%, sort of rough numbers, and that includes, I believe, perhaps $400 million of cost actions. What's the right way to think about cost actions, Matt? Is that, you know, should that all come out next year? So, the right jump off point for us ex cost actions is 30%, and that's how we should be thinking about margins for next year?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, I mean, I think, you know, we'll kind of give a complete update when we, when we come out, because the core growth is going to be a big driver of margins, but just on the cost action part. Yeah, I think you're right. I think the way I'd probably characterize it is $350 million of one-time cost actions. We talked about $200 million in Q2 and Q3, so that'd be again the kind of a one-time cost actions. Another $150 million here in Q4, and like you said, that will roll forward and help next year. But that is sort of a net number, right? If you will.\nWe will have other pieces, some of them pretty meaningful here that will impact margin. So, think of, like I said, first, core growth will have an impact. FX, as we sit here right now, it's going to have an impact, and there'll be some other cost headwinds. So, when we get to the guide here in January, we'll sort of take that net 150 basis points, if you will, of course, of margin tailwind probably, and then and see what those offsets are to end up where we are for 2024. But that's $350 million is probably the right number to think about as one-timers that go away here for next year.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nUnderstood. Thanks guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood morning guys. Good morning everybody.\nRainer, you mentioned in your prepared remarks China down 45% on the biopharma side, I think you said, but could you walk us through first of all what is the materiality of China now that Veralto has gone, percent of sales? I don't think we have that number, but and second, just kind of walk us through the different markets in, in China and maybe, you know, any, you know, color or outlook or something on how that is bottoming out or hopefully bottoming out?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure, sure, Scott, and thanks for the question. So just to the materiality of China here post world, I think 12% is a good number to think about as total revenue.\nAnd.\nNow to your point, let me take you through what we saw across the portfolio here in the Q3.\nSo let's start with bioprocessing there. We did not see a change in market demand, which has been here now for several quarters, impacted by a weaker funding environment and excess capacity, and that was down 45% as mentioned previously.\nLife Sciences was worse than expected on a weaker macro as well as at the margin. So not to overread this, but at the margin, some of the anti-corruption initiatives in the country, which slowed down some equipment tenders, some installation of equipment, at the margin.\nAnd then Diagnostics, we're seeing consistent patient volumes, and it's largely back to normal. So, we expect; we don't expect this to change here going forward in Q4 and also expect that this is going to continue into 2024. So, we haven't seen a change.\nIn bioprocessing, Life Sciences, little worse at the margin here, and Diagnostics as expected, and largely back to normal.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, very helpful. Just to switch gears, you know, there's talk about M&A multiples. You know, in this type of rate environment you would expect at least some moderation. I didn't feel like Abcam was necessarily cheap. Despite some of the drama that is out there. It certainly seems fully priced even at higher rates. As you look at the rest of your pipeline, is there some relief in multiples that kind of reflect the reality of the higher rate environment?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nI would tell you that we take it as we always do.\nBased on, you know, the end market, the asset, and the financial model individually. As we look at our funnel, which is very active, there's no doubt that some valuations still do not reflect what is a higher and likely for some time sustained interest rate environment. When it comes down to the individual deal, we bring all aspects together and ensure that the deal model meets our expectations as well. And then we, as I've always said, we'll pull the trigger if all those lights flip green on end market. The actual target company as well as the financial market. Market, financial model. Excuse me. And then lastly, you know, to reiterate, we do think valuations still have some, some ways to go here on average in order to reflect the interest rate environment.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHelpful, Rainer. Best of luck. See you guys. See you, Matt and John.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMorning, Michael.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nMorning, Rainer. Matt, thanks for taking the questions. Let me follow up a little bit on the Life Science weakness. Sounds like you guys are pretty clear that in Q3 that was the biggest step down sequentially versus Q2 and versus your expectations. We have it in our notes that LS instruments grew mid-single digit Q2 and now declined mid-single digit Q3. So, could you parse that out a little bit? SCIEX vs Beckman by geographies, by customer?\nWhere you're seeing the slowdown? Do you think it's tied to some of the broader weakness you're seeing in pharma, biotech? and just any thoughts on? You already provided some commentary on Q4, but any thoughts longer term on when that could return to growth? Just because you think that LS instruments would have a slightly longer order books, you'd have a little bit more visibility there. So, some forward commentary would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks Mike. So let's level set on the numbers here. Our instrument portion of our Life Science tools is less than 10% of Danaher revenue, just to put that in context properly. As we mentioned, our Q3 performance was modestly below our expectations with higher end instrumentation holding up better than the less specialized solutions. Now if you think about this by end market, academic and life science research have held up well along with the service business that's associated with these instruments.\nApplied markets were also resilient, led by food and environmental, and within environmental, you are aware of the PFAS testing volumes out there. But pharma and biotech took a modest step down, and that was particularly the case in the US and China. We see large pharma customers also tightening their belts as it relates to capital expenditures. We were just talking about the interest rate environment, and that's playing out here as well. And in China, what we're seeing there is just a sunsetting of the subsidized loan program of the first half of the year and very high comps as well as the lower funding that's available in the marketplace today in China.\nSo just to wrap them geographically, our developed markets were down largely due to the softness in pharma and biotech, and China, as we just talked about, was really related to the weaker macro, and, like I said earlier, on the margin only some anti-corruption initiatives there. So, as we wrap up there, I think we remain cautious on LS tools, and you know, expect Q4 to be down in the high singles versus but still at the low singles for the full year. Now as it relates to 2024, like I said, I think Q4 is a very important quarter here for all kinds of reasons. As you know, in the life science business a lot happens in Q4, and it's also going to tell us a lot as we dialogue with our customers about how to view 2024, which as I mentioned we'll talk about in January.\nBut I do think it's fair to say that we expect a weaker pharma and biopharma end market here going into 2024.\n\nMichael Ryskin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks. That's really helpful. And then maybe as a quick follow up, I just want to touch on China a little bit. I'm not going to ask about 2024 outlook because I think you made it clear you're not going to address that. But just longer term, structurally, China has been a major part of the growth for tools as an industry and for Danaher over the last five, 10 years. Given everything that's happened over the last year, what's your view on China going forward on a multi-year basis? Will it still be accretive to total company, meaning above total company growth? Or do you think China is really taking a step back here and it's going to be a multiyear process for it to return to that level? Thanks.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWe think China, long term, continues to accrete to the fleet average from a growth perspective. Mike, the demand in China. We're just at the tip of the iceberg of the demand in China for biologic drugs, and there's no question that we're currently going through a reset that's based on many of the things that occurred.\nDuring the pandemic. If you think about the funds that were spent in the Zero Covid effort over several years, if you look at how the pharmaceutical industry is playing out in China, but all those things over time moderate, and you come back to an end market which has an enormous demand of a population which has already a large and increasing middle class and is really demanding access to the most advanced medications in the world. So, we continue to see China as an opportunity here in the mid and long term because the fundamentals are in the right place. Although we are going through, if you will, a reset here with different funding sources and so forth in the short term.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Managing Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Leerink Partners\n\nHey, Rainer, thanks for taking the questions. Quite a bit is covered here. So maybe let me ask about something that is being discussed in healthcare markets, and even now food and consumer markets, and that's the GLP-1s and the diabetes weight loss drugs whose indications are expanding here. So, wondering if you can provide some context on if you see contributions from these drugs in 2024, anything there that can potentially help you offset some of the headwinds? And maybe within that context, if you could also just talk about how should we weigh the GLP-1's opportunities versus Alzheimer's, which is also a very large market I believe for the mAbs?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Puneet. Let's start with the GLP-1s, which are real, and they are growing, and Danaher is represented and, to some extent, stacked into all of them, and we expect over time for those to contribute to our growth.\nNow, having said that, GLP-1s are a class of drugs where the intensity of the use of, if you will, the standard inputs of biologic processes, for instance, such as mAbs, and I'll come back to that part of your question in a second, is not as intense. So you have synthetic processes for GLP-1s, you have biologic processes. And depending on how that mix develops, that also impacts the degree to which this contributes to our business. This will contribute to our business, and we think that that provides a modest tailwind here over time. Now, as it relates to your question around Alzheimer's drugs, those are typically monoclonal antibodies, and the use of our industry's products there, it's far greater than, for instance, and GLP-1 processes.\nAs those continue to make their way through the development pipelines, through the regulators, and ultimately get reimbursed and then adopted by patients, we expect that to be a more significant tailwind, certainly than GLP-1.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Managing Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Leerink Partners\n\nGot it. Super.\nAnd then if I could follow up on Abcam, could you talk about where you see the biggest opportunities for cost reduction here in the antibodies business and the protein reagents business? And maybe what, where DBS can have the most impact? and wondering if, you know, what do you have in your algorithm longer term for the op margins for this business? Eventually. Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nPuneet. We have yet to close on this transaction, so we won't be able to talk about.\nThe model and its contents in any detail here. But I do want to take a second to reiterate that, you know, this acquisition gives us an entry into a really highly attractive protein consumables market. We estimate that market to be over $8 billion and growing high single digits. And very importantly, because of new detection technologies and other approaches, protein detection is now moving from research to biopharma, and we believe over time to the clinic. And so you can see how that fits our strategy of helping to map complex diseases, accelerate drug discovery, and hopefully someday even help identify these diseases earlier in their progression. Now, this is a differentiated company with a really terrific brand and a great long-term, sustainable business model. We've talked about this, but, you know, this is accretive to us in growth and earnings and also in talent.\nWe're looking forward to welcoming the team here. We're still focused right now, Puneet, on closing this transaction by mid-2024.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Managing Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, Leerink Partners\n\nAppreciate it. Thanks, Rainer.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Executive Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nHi, Rachel. Good morning.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Executive Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to follow up with a few more nuanced questions on China. So first you mentioned that anti-corruption had some impacts to the Life Sciences segment. So could you quantify the impact there? And then can you walk us through, are you just seeing that impact in the healthcare and diagnostics hospital settings or is that started to bleed into pharma and biotech as well? And then shifting over to more on the Diagnostic side for China. Another dynamic that we started hearing about in recent weeks is just China volume-based procurement. So can you walk us through what you're hearing on that front and what your potential exposure to that would be?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure, Rachel. Starting with anti-corruption, we really do see this as a transitory effect. There were, you know, some weeks, if I can say it that way, where we saw particularly equipment tenders being postponed, delayed, as well as the installation of hardware, so larger capital equipment. But frankly we've seen that wane here. So come back to normal, if you will, in the last couple of weeks. And that applies both to what we saw there in Life Sciences really at the margin, as well as what we see in Diagnostics. So I would not view the anti-corruption initiatives as a short or even mid-term growth headwind. Frankly, in the long term, we think this is a positive as it levels the playing field for multinationals in China.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nAs far as the volume-based procurement, Rachel, I think the best way to kind of think about it is I think we think it's going to be about a $50 million kind of annual headwind here for us over the next couple of years. Most of that is at Beckman Diagnostics. So I mean, maybe kind of the simple math is $800 million of Beckman revenues, and maybe 40% of that is sort of subject to the VBP. You know, kind of assume a 50% type price reduction there, and you can get to $150 million. We think that's kind of a two- to three-year kind of run rate here. So pretty modest and manageable for us over the period.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst and Executive Director of Life Science Tools and Diagnostics, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. And then my follow-up is just around Diagnostics. So you guys lifted that respiratory expectations for the year to $1.6 billion versus prior assumptions around $1.2 billion. So how should we think about that? Endemic number for respiratory is $1.2 billion still on average. The real way to think about this respiratory market and then just heading into 2024, given you guys lifted expectations for this year by $400 million, should we expect a softer year next year for respiratory? Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, I mean, I think it's a good question on the $1.2 billion. I think that's probably where my baseline would be, Rachel. And I think we did a little bit better this year because we had another respiratory season that started earlier than normal.\nRight.\nJust like last year. Similarly, we saw sort of September and October, the ILI kind of spiked up. That is usually something in the past that we have seen more in the January, February timeframe. So if I think about the last couple years and think about that, I think, you know, Q1, Q2 would be sort of where I would base it as a planning kind of purpose going forward. But, you know, we sort of typically, as we look forward from planning perspective, do that. We look at the last couple years of ILI and try and mirror that. So that's kind of where I think I'd be.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And that was our last question today. I will now turn the call back over to John Bedford for closing remarks.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, everybody, for joining. We'll be around the rest of the day for questions.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our team executed well and delivered our quarterly revenue, earnings, and cash flow expectations despite a more dynamic operating environment. The resilience of our portfolio showed through in the Q2 high single-digit base business core revenue growth in life sciences and diagnostics, paired with better than expected respiratory testing revenue, helps offset softer base business demand in bioprocessing.\nOur team's ability to navigate these challenging operating conditions is a testament to their commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. Their actions are helping mitigate supply chain constraints, enhance productivity, and improve manufacturing throughput. We're proactively addressing structural costs while maintaining a healthy cadence of growth investments.\nNow our Q2 results also highlight the durable balanced positioning of our portfolio. We have an exceptional group of businesses all powered by DBS that serve attractive end markets with favorable long-term secular growth drivers. This powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio, and balance sheet optionality differentiates Danaher and positions us well to operate through today's more dynamic operating environment.\nWith that, let's turn to our Q2 results in more detail. Sales were $7.2 billion in Q2 and core revenue declined 7%. We delivered 2% growth in our base business, which was more than offset by a COVID-19 revenue headwind of approximately 9%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined high single digits, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 revenues. High growth markets declined low single digits, with China down approximately 10%. In China, our diagnostics businesses benefited from continued recovery, and hospital patient volumes, while stimulus initiatives helped drive strength in life sciences.\nThis was more than offset by a decline in our biotechnology business where a significant deterioration in the funding environment during the quarter led to project delays and an increase in order cancellations. Our gross profit margin for the Q2 was 56.5%. Our operating margin of 20% was down 840 basis points due to the impact of lower volume in our biotechnology and diagnostic segments, and costs incurred to adjust our capacity and cost structure in response to COVID-19 transitioning to an endemic state.\nThese actions in this transition year are intended to ensure that we're in the best position to deliver on our long-term growth and margin objectives while maintaining an accelerated cadence of innovation investments. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.05. We generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date. This results in a year-to-date free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of more than 125%. Our notable strength in free cash flow generation differentiates Danaher and illustrates the quality of our portfolio business models and our team's consistent execution.\nNow let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our biotechnology segment declined 17% and core revenue was down 16.5%. In bioprocessing, underlying market conditions weakened further as we moved through the quarter, resulting in a high single digit base business decline. Larger customers are still working through inventory they built during the pandemic, and emerging biotech customers, which we define as customers without a commercialized therapy, continued their efforts to conserve capital.\nIn addition, we saw the ongoing biopharma market correction in China intensify as the Q2 progressed. Given these dynamics, where we can, we've started actively working with our larger customers to help them more quickly manage their inventory down to normalized levels. Now, while market dislocations are impacting our near-term growth, recent positive developments have only strengthened our conviction in the tremendous long-term opportunity ahead in the biologics markets and for our leading bioprocessing franchise. The number of biologic and genomic medicines in development is meaningfully higher than at any point in history.\nDuring the quarter we saw notable regulatory approvals for a novel gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the monoclonal antibody-based Alzheimer's therapeutic. These groundbreaking therapies are not only poised to improve quality of life for patients around the world, they're also serving as validation of these emerging therapeutic classes and reinforcing the potential of drugs currently in the development pipeline.\nNow in May we completed the combination of Cytiva and Pall Life Sciences, creating a premier global bioprocessing franchise. The combined business, which will go to market under the Cytiva name, uniquely positions us to support customers as they pursue these life-changing breakthroughs. Cytiva's portfolio has the broadest offering in the industry with end-to-end solutions across all major therapeutic modalities and an innovation engine geared towards helping customers bring life-saving therapies to market faster and more efficiently.\nA great example is the X-platform bioreactor, Cytiva, launched in Q2. Now this new bioreactor is optimized to enhance cell culture productivity and increase process intensity to improve manufacturing yields. The X-platform's modular design also enables customers to more predictably scale from the lab to production across all modalities, including monoclonal antibodies, and cell and gene therapies, helping reduce time and cost in biologic drug production. Turning to our life sciences segment, reported revenue grew 5.5%, and core revenue was also up 5.5%, including high single-digit growth in our base business.\nOur life sciences instrument businesses collectively delivered mid single digit core revenue growth, led by nearly 10% growth at Leica Microsystems and high single digit growth at SCIEX. Healthy demand across our life sciences research, academic, and applied markets, particularly for our more advanced instrumentation, helps offset softness at pharma and biopharma customers. Our genomics consumables-based business was up low single digits in the quarter.\nGrowth in plasmids, proteins, and gene writing and editing solutions which are primarily used in projects that are commercialized or in later stages of the drug development pipeline remained robust. This strength was partially offset by declines in next-generation sequencing basic research. Our life sciences businesses continue to deliver innovative solutions that are helping accelerate the discovery and development of biologic medicines. IDBS recently released Polar Insight, a biopharma data management platform that is leveraging artificial intelligence to help researchers more quickly analyze data sets to accelerate drug discovery, regulatory filings, and technology transfer in the therapeutic development process.\nSCIEX launched the Intabio ZT, a front end to the ZenoTOF 7600 that enables researchers to more quickly and more securely identify and validate drug candidates, improving development workflows and pipeline yields. Now moving to our diagnostic segment, reported revenue declined 13% and core revenue declined 11.5%, with high single digit growth in our base business more than offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at Cepheid. Our clinical diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid single digit core revenue growth. Leica Biosystems led the way with high single digit core growth driven by strength in core histology and advanced staining.\nBeckman Coulter Diagnostics was up mid single digits again this quarter with solid performance across both instruments and consumables and notable strength in amino acids. In May, Beckman Coulter launched the DxI 9000, their next generation immunoassay analyzer that automates up to 90% of standard daily maintenance routines while delivering best-in-class throughput.\nIn addition to significantly improving laboratory workflows and efficiency, the DxI 9000 will enable Beckman to provide a full menu of blood virus assays over time, closing an important menu gap and further enhancing the breadth and clinical value of our test menu. Now this is just one example of how the Beckman team is improving their competitive positioning through innovation, which is helping drive consistent mid-single-digit growth rates in molecular diagnostics.\nBroad-based strength across Cepheid's test menu drove another quarter of more than 30% core growth in non-respiratory testing. Customers who benefited from the workflow advantages Cepheid's GeneXpert delivered for COVID-related testing are increasingly adding additional assays from our leading test menu, most notably Group A strep and hospital-acquired infection assays, and strong momentum for our recently introduced Multiplex Vaginitis Panel. The Xpert Xpress MVP contributed to mid-teens growth in sexual health testing.\nIn COVID-related testing, Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $300 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $175 million. This was driven both by higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B, and RSV. We continue to expect approximately $1.2 billion of respiratory testing revenue for the full year.\nWith COVID now in endemic state, we believe Cepheid is continuing to take share as many customers look to consolidate their point of care PCR testing platforms onto the GeneXpert for both respiratory and non-respiratory testing. Their preference for the GeneXpert within their labs and across their health care networks is a testament to the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab-quality results and a best-in-class workflow provides clinicians.\nNow moving to our environmental and applied solutions segment, reported revenue grew 2% and core revenue was up 1.5%. Water quality core revenue grew mid single digits, and product identification was down mid single digits in water quality. DBS-led execution drove solid growth on top of a double digit prior year comparison. Strong performance at ChemTreat and Hach was balanced across industrial and applied end markets. At Trojan Equipment, sales and order rates remain strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects.\nAt Product Identification, Videojet declined low single digits against a high single digit prior year comparison. We're also seeing lower activity levels at our industrial and consumer packaged goods customers who are aligning their production schedules with end user demand. The Videojet team continued their strong cadence of new product innovation this quarter with the release of the Videojet 3350 laser marking system.\nThis impressive addition to Videojet's portfolio enables users to mark different size products and multiple levels of the same product without adjusting the laser, resulting in increased uptime and higher throughput. This is one of several product introductions planned for the year that are helping position the product identification platform for success as they begin their journey as part of Veralto.\nSpeaking of Veralto, we remain on track for a Q4 2023 separation. Veralto will be well positioned in some of the most attractive areas of water quality and product identification. Their portfolio will be comprised of leading companies with durable high margin business models supporting customers mission critical operations. The Veralto team is looking forward to hosting an Analyst Day in Chicago on 6 September and we hope many of you will attend.\nNow let's briefly look ahead at expectations for Q3 and the full year. In the Q3 we expect core revenue in our base business to be down low single digits year-over-year. We also expect total core revenue to decline in the low- to mid-teens% range, primarily as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a Q3 adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26%, which includes the impact of efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID-19 transitioning to an endemic state, particularly within our diagnostics and biotechnology businesses.\nNow turning to the full year 2023, due to the near-term challenges within bioprocessing, we now anticipate low single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single- to low double-digit for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full-year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 29%.\nTo wrap up, our team remains focused on consistent execution in the face of a challenging and more dynamic macroeconomic environment. We're confident about the bright future ahead for Danaher. Our talented associates are innovative and passionate about their work and committed to our culture of continuous improvement across our portfolio. We're helping customers solve some of the world's biggest health care challenges, including faster, more accurate disease diagnosis and accelerating the discovery, development, and manufacture of therapies.\nOur solutions are at the forefront of improving patient outcomes and ensuring more patients around the world have access to quality care. Financially, we've got a great lineup of leading franchises in attractive end markets with durable high recurring revenue business models, and our strong free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward. The unique combination of our talented team, differentiated portfolio, and balance sheet optionality, all powered by the Danaher Business System, provide a strong foundation for creating shareholder value while helping to meaningfully improve human health. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your touch-tone phone. You may withdraw your question at any time by pressing star two. Once again, that is star, one. We will take our first question from Mike Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morning, Mike.\n\nMike Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, Rainer. Thanks for taking the question. I'll start on bioprocess, the obvious one. You provided a lot of comments during the prepared remarks, but I'm just wondering if you could, you know, talk a little bit about order trends, anything that you're seeing from customers to give you a sense of when that destocking could continue. As part of that, you also talked a little bit about actively managing inventory with larger customers. Could you just walk us through what that means exactly and sort of how you see the rest of the year playing out? You know, you gave the total percent number, but qualitatively, what are your thoughts on bioprocess as you go through the year?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure. Let's start with orders. In the first half of the year, our orders are essentially down 20%. As we look forward here to the second half of the year, we think that our orders will be down modestly. That's a combination of various factors, one being that our large customers CDMOs continue to work through inventories.\nWe also see that China continues to deteriorate here from what we saw in the Q1, and certainly saw that deterioration in the second half of the Q2. We see that continuing. Then we are actively managing inventories down, while that is not new. We've intensified our efforts there really in order to get as much as possible of this stocking topic behind us here in 2023.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMike, maybe just let me give you a little color on some numbers here too. I think if you think about the first half, like Rainer said, we were sort of down 20% from an order perspective. Like he also said, I think we'll be down modestly in the second half but I think it's important to remember too, this is largely driven by the comps that we've got. If you think last year, you know, the first half we had kind of a low double digit comp and the second half was more like 20%.\nStep up, get a little easier here in the second half. I think the important thing that Rainer just said is, you know, we have not seen in the order book enough to call an inflection in the market. I think we, you know, we will see a step up to a more modestly down number here in the second half, but I would really characterize that as very much comp driven, not some sort of market inflection that we're seeing.\n\nMike Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks, appreciate that. If I could squeeze in a follow up on China specifically. You talked a lot about China, and Q2 deteriorated particularly as it touched on biopharma. Biopharma market correction. Could you expand on that? Just how significant, how protracted do you believe that will be? It seems like it's really mostly contained to bioprocess. You called out instrumentation in China actually holding in pretty well. What's the difference there? Why is it so specific to just that one part of your business?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nWe saw that continued deterioration in the second half of the Q2. To give you a sense, China orders were down 20% in the Q1, 40% in the Q2, but really 50% in June. Frankly we don't see that getting better here in the second half and that's really related to two or three factors. One, the funding environment continued to deteriorate. The foreign investment in projects and capacity has dissipated. It is not returned. There are fewer projects there that are being funded. Also over the last two, three years, a great deal of capacity has been built, particularly CDMO capacity, but also some with the smaller biopharmas there.\nThere's not a lot of additional hardware required here in the short term in the second half, nor are there that many molecules that are being worked on by the CDMOs, meaning that the consumables requirements of that capacity are also lower than we saw here in the first half of the year and then lastly, and part of this is related to our aggressively managing with our customers to get them to their target inventories. There are a fair number of order cancellations there.\nWhen you put all that together here for China, that is a different picture here in the second half than we saw in the first half. Once again, we're working here. If you aggregate this to the total global biopharma business to get as much of this as possible behind us in 2023. Just to give you a sense here, our China business in 2022 was about $1.3 billion, slightly over that. We expect that to be about an $800 million business by the end of 2023, which would be about 10% of the total bioprocessing business at Danaher.\n\nMike Ryskin\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Appreciate the color.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI, please go ahead.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, Rainer, good morning to you and thanks for taking my question. On the bioprocessing commentary, Rainer, if you just simplify the various moving parts, it seems like large pharma was languishing, early phase, early stage was languishing. What changed incrementally in Q2 was China. If that is correct, I think you mentioned China was down 50% in June. Is the second half assuming down 50% for China bioprocessing? I think you also mentioned Danaher actively managing customer inventory levels. What does that mean and what is the implication for fiscal 2024? Should any of these issues blow over into 2024?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nVijay, it's Matt. Let me give you. I just want to kind of set the numbers for everybody. We're talking so we've got what we're looking at for China, as you said, from a revenue perspective, in the first half we were down, call it, you know, 30%. We did see May and June sort of get down into the more like 45, 50% down so as we sort of think about what we're thinking about for China going forward for the second half, we are, we are kind of contemplating, if you will, for Q3 and Q4, both of those quarters to look like May and June at call it 50%+ down with that maybe. Rainer, you want to get some color on the commentary?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure. Vijay as it relates to 2024. We have a lot to work through here still, I think as an industry. In the second half of 2023, we talked about the various puts and takes of the destocking that I think you correctly summarized with pharma and emerging biotech. You see the China piece that we're flagging here, and then, of course, actively managing those inventories with our customers here in order to get as much as possible behind us in 2023. You know, we think 2023 probably is the bottom. Having said all that, it is a little early to be talking about 2024. As always, as we get closer here to the end of the year, we'll continue to update as we work through the second half here.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nUnderstood. Rainer and Matt, maybe one for you on margins here. I think. Your Q2 came in slightly above guidance but the sequential step down from Q1, that's 450 basis points. Can you bridge us on what drove that 450 basis point step down sequentially? I think some of this was cost actions Danaher undertook. Again, when I look at the annual guidance, I think you implied Q4 is perhaps 30%-ish. What drives that 31-ish? What drives that Q4 step up? Does it assume your bioprocessing inventory levels to step up? You know, bioprocessing orders exiting Q4, is that assuming like a normalized trend? Thank you.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah, no, I think that's right. You got that right, so Q1 we were kind of call it 31% margin, step down to 26.5% in Q2. I think we're going to be more like 26% in Q3 and then a step up to 31% in Q4. If you remember last quarter we sort of talked about there's a bunch of capacity adjustment, you know, if you will, measures not only at Summit Biotech, but remember significantly at Cepheid as the volumes there ramp down. We are, you know, being pretty proactive about taking down that capacity as we talked about. Really the step down in Q2, Q3 is largely due to, one, lower volumes but remember we had those big capacity reduction costs.\nThose are primarily Q2, Q3, and then they sort of go away here in Q4. Combined with higher volume in Q4 is how we get to kind of the 31% that really has no bearing or impact on anything to do with the bioprocessing inventory, et cetera. it just incorporates our guide of kind of bioprocessing ex-COVID down 10%. Really all about the higher volume and the capacity reduction stuff that we're working on kind of heading out of the P&L in Q2 and Q3.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll turn a question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, fellows. Rainer, Matt, and John. Yes, I was hoping you could put a little bit more teeth into this cost out and just a little bit more color, even if you, I mean, in a perfect world, love to see what the actual, you know, what tailwinds might be for 2024, what the benefit is. If you're not willing to go down that path, at least help us understand what's perhaps more rooftop versus labor versus, I know, when times are tougher like this, maybe your comp accruals are down, but maybe you guys can give us a little detail. Be helpful. Thanks.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nYeah. Scott, the capacity reduction, we talked last quarter that we had about $350 million of costs that was going to come through in Q2 and Q3. You know, we said probably about $250 million of that was going to be at Cepheid and that is, that is a rooftop effort. During the pandemic we added some rooftops to kind of meet demand. Now we're kind of scaling that back. That is a little bit of a rooftop dynamic as well as a people dynamic. As we scale down to where we are, about $100 million of that $250 million is over the same concept, but at BTG, given some of the lower, the lower demand there, I would characterize that less as rooftops and more sort of, you know, sort of other actions around kind of demand levels, if you will, at BTG.\nThat's sort of the $350 million we talked about last quarter. You know, some of that $350 million is going to be sort of, you know, one time, if you will and probably something in the range of a couple $100 million of it will be a bit of a one time cost that will, that we are hitting and taking P&L in this year that probably, you know, should come back to us here next year as well as the savings that we have moving forward. We haven't really talked about the savings, Scott. That's going to be a little bit dependent on how much we can get done here in Q4 or Q3 and Q2, Q3, and then what gets done in Q4 as well.\nIt'll be a little bit dependent on how much we can get done as to what the savings, the annualized savings, will be. We sort of, you know, told people last quarter that we kind of update that as we get, you know, towards the guide for next year to kind of bake in some of the savings numbers, so we haven't really gotten that yet. I've got, I have a sense or an idea but I do want to see if we can get everything done and kind of where we, where we end up before we talk about how much is coming. I do think we've talked last quarter about that sort of one-time benefit of call it $200 million.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nAll right, that's helpful, Matt. Guys, it wasn't clear to me why NAS margins were down. Is it a kind of price cost? Just because I'm assuming had maybe negative actual unit volumes with core up one and a half. Is it mix, price, costs? Is there anything? I know there's probably some prep into the spin that may add some near-term costs as well but some color there would help too. Thanks.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nI'd say yes to probably all of the above, Scott. I think you're right. You know, it was a little bit of a price cost. I think they are starting to see an environment where, you know, they had really good price actions as some of the supply chain issues and supplies and logistics issues they were able to kind of cover with price. I think you're right, we're starting to see a little bit of that come down. Probably not terribly unusual. Some of it they were able to offset with other measures but you're right.\nI think when you kind of look at what happened there in the quarter, it was a little bit of it. Volumes were on the margin sort of down but the price side did hold us up but that price is coming down a little bit from where it was but that was kind of what happened in the quarter, and like you said, also ramping up into the spin here probably had an impact as well.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Thanks for the color and best of luck the rest of your guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morning, Dan.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. Good morning, Rainer How are you doing? Thanks. Thanks for the questions here. Maybe the first one just on the company is obviously a superior executor. DBS is at your core. The string of bioprocess guide-downs is pretty uncharacteristic, but it's also a situation that has plagued many peers. I'm sure you're always doing forensic reviews. You go, you know, your future process, your future forecasting improves in terms of what you've learned.\nCan you just give us a sense of the latest bioprocess guide and you know what will provide confidence that the factors that surprise you here and led to the latest cuts won't surprise you again. Now the guide incorporates enough cushion so that investors can have confidence that the bottom of the bioprocess guidance has been reached?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan. Appreciate that question. As you can imagine, and as you suggested, we are constantly, continuously improving our forecasting processes, even when we get into these unusual circumstances. I think one of the aspects here is that the demand situation, the production planning of our customers around the world in the short term is very dynamic. In the sense that production plans are being changed as our customers manage their own inventories as they deal with the demand patterns that they're exposed to.\nWhat we have learned out of that is a more frequent touch point pattern that we have to have with our customers in order to ensure that we keep our finger on the pulse of what's going on there. We think that in the discussions that we've had that taking the approach of aggressively helping our customers manage their inventories to their target levels. In order to find what the true demand signal is, as well as thinking about the second half here with some degree of conservatism, positions us well in what has been a very dynamic environment with a number of new factors influencing demand. We think we're well positioned here for the remainder of the year in terms of the bioprocessing guide.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nMaybe, Dan, just maybe my thoughts on that topic. Like Rainer said, I think given what we saw in Q2, I think we feel like we've got sort of, you know, China in a pretty good place from a guide perspective, given what we saw. Given the fact that we began that active management in earnest in kind of the back half of Q2 and are going to be pretty aggressive with that to get everything possible behind us that we can here in 2023, I think this guide puts us in a pretty good place for the rest of the year.\n\nDan Brennan\n\nResearch Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Maybe just thinking about the exit rates that are implied in the guidance. I know you already commented, Rainer, 2024, official guidance will come later, but it'd be really helpful just to get some frame of reference about key inputs. We're coming out somewhere at $9.30 this year on earnings and maybe a little below $10, maybe $9.80 for 2024. I know consensus is still $10.23 as of this morning. Is there any help about how we think about the trajectory in 2024 either from an earnings basis and also even given the low single-digit base guide for this year, how we think about that comp and what that could translate into a starting point for base organic growth in 2024?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nDan, I do think that it's early to talk about 2024 because we still have an entire half of the year in front of us here with a number of factors to work through. We talked about the destocking dynamic in China as well as our efforts to actively get the stocking situation behind us here in 2023. We think that ultimately, you know, we're probably seeing in 2023 the bottom here and what is the bioprocessing stocking dynamic and I talked about this in the prepared comments. You know, are positive about, you know, the long-term growth of this business and this industry. It's just too early to be putting down a marker here in July on how we think about 2024 and do promise to come back here later in the year to update and then, of course, as always, provide our guide in January for 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Puneet Souda of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morning, Puneet.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nGood morning, Rainer and Matt. Thanks for taking the question. First one, you know, on China, you know, beyond the comments you made and the 50% expectation down for the rest of the year, orders being down, I'm wondering if there is anything fundamental in terms of the shift on the product portfolio. We heard one of your bioprocess peers talk about competition on the less technology heavy products. Wondering if you're seeing any of that and any share shift there that is also happening in this market?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nPuneet, our point of view on China is that the continued deterioration is far more about demand and funding than it is about local competition. The local competition has always been there, no question. During the pandemic, local competition became more relevant as lead times extended. Where we do see that local competition, it tends to be more for local China, for China therapeutics, than for products that find global applications. For us, this is really a topic at the margin. The real story here is that the funding environment, as well as the stocking situation in China, requires further mediation here in the second half. That's exactly what we're doing in order to get as much of this as possible behind us in 2023.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nOkay, that's super helpful. Then one on capital deployment, if I may, how are you thinking about capital deployment now with the EAS spin and the backdrop of somewhat of a rather weak end market in the near term? I know historically you pursued leading assets that are usually gross margin accretive. Wondering if any of that has changed and if you think services has gained more significance in your framework for capital deployment now. Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nSure. Puneet, for us, M&A continues to be the primary form of capital deployment. We do that when we see the end market, the asset and the model, the financial model align with our requirements, and that is relevant for any end market or adjacency that we might be thinking about, and we maintain a consistent perspective there. Now having said that, you likely noted that our balance sheet is in great shape, and we are in a market that provides opportunity, and we continue, as we always do, to work our M&A funnels to find those opportunities where all three lights flip to green, if you will: market, company, as well as the business model.\n\nPuneet Souda\n\nSenior Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nGot it. Okay. Thank you, guys.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morning, Rachel.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat morning. Thank you for taking the questions. First up, just kind of shifting gears over to the life sciences business. That was much better than expected this quarter. Notably, instrument strength was pretty strong with high single-digit growth at SCIEX and 10% growth at Leica. Could you just walk us through really what drove that strength in instruments this quarter? Some of your peers have called out a meaningful slowdown when it comes to CapEx spending and some of their customer segments for instrumentation. Are you seeing any of those same dynamics, and how are you thinking about instrument growth for the full year?\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks for the question, Rachel. As you suggested, our Q2 life sciences business finished as expected, up mid single digits. We've been talking about a normalization process for some time now, and that's also what we're expecting going forward. I'll come back to that in a minute. If we look at the strength here of mid single digits, geographically the US was okay. I would exclude large pharma there and sort of small biotech where that's relevant. Europe was solid, and we also saw a good level of activity in China on the remainder of the stimulus or the subsidized loan program that China had in place.\nFrom an end market perspective, we see the academic end market holding up well. We see the applied markets, if you think of food testing, environmental testing, with some strength. As I mentioned, we see biotech and pharma softer. If you think about this from a product category perspective, we think lower end, less expensive, perhaps even operating cost versus capital expenditure type of equipment is impacted more severely than the higher end, which we still see holding up.\nYou saw that with Leica Microsystems and SCIEX as well. As we think about the second half here, we continue to be cautious for a couple of reasons. We mentioned that, you know, the China market, while strong, the subsidies there have come sunset at the end of the Q1, and we'll have to see how that continues. There's no news on that front going forward. We think really the second half ends up being flat for life science instrumentation, putting the full year at low single digits as the normalization process, if you will, from what has been over several years now, very elevated growth rates continues.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nRachel, that's sort of on the back too if you think about the bookings here. Our book to bill in, you know, life sciences and into the instruments businesses was a little bit less than 1 in the quarter. I think to Rainer's point, you know, we look at the first half here in China for life sciences instruments, that was largely a backlog play from stimulus. As we sort of head into the second half, I think. Our assumption is that we're going to be flat in those businesses as China stimulus backlog kind of rolls off, does not have the impact that it had in the first half. We just don't see a real step up here in stimulus in the second half.\n\nRachel Vatnsdal\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you for all the color there. Maybe just a follow-up on pricing. Can you walk us through how much was pricing and impact for instruments in the quarter, and what are you assuming for pricing on instruments in the back half of the year? Then as a follow-up, just price on bioprocessing. You know, for bioprocessing it sounds like you took 350 basis points of pricing in Q1. What was that pricing contribution in Q2, and then how are you thinking about pricing evolving within bioprocessing in the back half of this year and also just heading into 2024? You know, last year you guys took 400 basis points of price in bioprocessing. Obviously, the industry is pretty dynamic right now, so any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nRachel. Overall, our pricing for the quarter, overall Danaher was up 350 basis points, with all four segments remaining above the historical average. Specifically, you were talking about life science instruments there. We saw in the quarter 450 basis points of price. Now as we look forward for the remainder of 2023, we do see that and expect that to moderate somewhat, but we do expect to be above our historical averages here for the remainder of the year. As it relates to 2024, I think we'll come back to you on that as we get closer here to the end of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, we'll take our final question from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRainer Blair\n\nPresident and CEO, Danaher Corporation\n\nGood morning, Luke.\n\nLuke Sergott\n\nHealthcare Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. This is just kind of to follow up on Dan Brennan. I know you guys aren't going to give 2024, given how everything is dynamic, but I think that the destocking is what it is, right? That's rolling off. That shouldn't be 2024, but that sets up an easy comp. Everybody's just trying to figure out right now what the industry demand is to support the type of overall industry growth typically the market grows. The bioprocessing markets, like high doubles to mid teens, and that's in a normalized market. How quickly do you think we can get back to that level?\nOn top of that, you have the comps which would take you over that, or do you think that we're going to be in a period of subdued contraction from a demand and capacity perspective, given COVID-19 rolling off, you have China, the headwinds there, there's several other things, you know, the lack of biotech funding. Give us a sense what that normalized market looks like for you guys right now.\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nLuke, I mean, I just keep coming back to it's July. We are, we're in a, we're in a pretty dynamic market. You know, where we are within the industry. Like you said, there's a number of dynamics that still need to be worked through. You mentioned some of them: destocking, China, the fact that we're sort of actively managing through this inventory situation. I know why people are trying to get to a 2024 number, but I just think it's too early.\nWe just need to get through the second half. We'll get a better sense of how those dynamics play out, which will give us a lot better sense as we get later in the year and into what we normally guide of what that looks like. I just think that there's so many parts right now that, unfortunately, I think we just do, we really do need to get through the second half here.\n\nLuke Sergott\n\nHealthcare Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah, I understand. Can you quantify how much destocking was in the quarter for you guys and kind of year to date?\n\nMatt McGrew\n\nEVP and CFO, Danaher Corporation\n\nI could probably come up with some number, but it would be imprecise. I think the reality is that it's going to be very customer dependent, it's going to be manufacturing site dependent, it's going to be, you know, drug dependent. We don't really spend a lot of time trying to figure out how much was destocking as much as spending time with the customers in a pretty proactive way these days to understand what's on hand, what's the real need that you've got site by site by site, so that we can help them manage down to an inventory level they're comfortable with.\nSome are comfortable with getting down to where they were pre pandemic, some are trying to get below that, and some are trying to be above that actually.It's, you know, it's not one number that we managed to, we're really doing it on a kind of individual basis.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call and the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings. The audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events and Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until May 9, 2023.\nDuring the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. The supplemental materials describe additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Unless otherwise noted, all references in these remarks and supplemental materials to company-specific financial metrics relate to the first quarter of 2023, and all references to period-to-period increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. We may also describe certain products and devices which have applications submitted and pending for certain regulatory approvals or are available only in certain markets.\nDuring the call, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer M. Blair\n\nEVP, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today.\nSo we had a good start to the year. Our team successfully navigated a dynamic operating environment to deliver better-than-expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. We're especially pleased with the strength of our base business, which grew 6% in the first quarter. Now across the portfolio, the quarter progressed largely as we anticipated. Our global supply chain has stabilized and component availability improved sequentially. Strong price realization helped offset inflationary pressures and disciplined cost management enabled us to continue our cadence of growth investments. So we believe these investments paired with DBS-driven execution contributed to market share gains in many of our businesses again this quarter.\nA prime example of the power of DBS and our commitment to continuous improvement at all levels of Danaher as the CEO Kaizen, which we kicked off 2 weeks ago. With this event, our most senior leaders are joining over 700 associates at 10 of our operating companies. We're focusing on the most significant opportunities for lasting competitive advantage across our businesses, including further reducing our best-in-class lead times at Aldevron and improving resin and filter throughput in the Biotechnology group.\nThe CEO Kaizen is just another terrific opportunity for our teams to come together and drive transformative change through DBS. In fact, once we wrap up here today, I'll be joining the Cytiva team at our resin facility in Uppsala, Sweden, to contribute to these efforts. Now our results also reflect the unique positioning of Danaher's portfolio. We just have an exceptional group of leading franchises serving attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers.\nAdditionally, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with the optionality to enhance our businesses both organically and through disciplined M&A. This powerful combination of our talented team, leading portfolio and strong financial position, differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage.\nSo with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.2 billion in the first quarter and core revenue declined 4%. So as I mentioned earlier, we delivered 6% core revenue growth in our base business, with 3 of our 4 reporting segments, up high single digits or better in the quarter. COVID-19 revenues were a headwind of approximately 10%. Geographically, core revenues in developed markets declined mid-single digits, primarily as a result of lower COVID-19 revenues.\nHigh-growth markets were up low single digits, with a low single-digit decline in China. Results in China were better than expected, driven by a quicker-than-anticipated recovery in diagnostic testing and a more favorable life science research funding environment. We expect these positive trends to continue as we move through the year. Our gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61%. Our operating margin of 25% was down 330 basis points primarily due to the impact of lower COVID volume in our Biotechnology and Diagnostics businesses. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.36, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.\nNow let's take a closer look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 16% and core revenue was down 13%. In bioprocessing, base business core revenue growth was in line with our expectations of low single digits in the first quarter.\n[indiscernible] demand at our large customers were primarily responsible for therapies in commercial production and later-stage clinical trials remains robust, and they're steadily working through inventory they built during the pandemic. Based on our most recent customer conversations, we now expect the inventory normalization process to continue through the second half of the year.\nDuring the quarter, we also saw softer demand globally at many of our emerging biotech customers as more pronounced pressures on liquidity and funding accelerated their efforts to conserve capital leading to project delays and cancellations. In consideration of these factors, we anticipate second quarter and full year base business core growth in bioprocessing will be largely consistent with the first quarter.\nThat said, these short-term pandemic-related dislocations have not changed our assessment of the tremendous opportunity ahead in the biologics market and for our leading bioprocessing franchise. The number of biologic and genomic medicines in development is meaningfully higher than at any point in history. In fact, there are thousands of biologic therapies currently under development, including more than 750 in Phase III clinical trials. With these therapies, our customers are making significant strides in addressing diseases that affect large segments of the population.\nFor example, GLP-1s have become blockbuster treatment for obesity and diabetes, and antibody drug conjugates are meaningfully improving treatment outcomes for many types of cancer. And we're also seeing promising developments in the field of Alzheimer's research, where several novel monoclonal antibodies are nearing regulatory approval.\nNow to best support our customers as they pursue these life-changing breakthroughs, our Biotechnology team has been accelerating investments and innovation over the last several years. Cytiva recently introduced the MabSelect VL, a new resin and ligand for bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments. The MabSelect VL's best-in-class binding capacity and improved alkaline stability makes industrial scale purification more efficient, helping customers improve yields, decrease bioburden and reduce manufacturing costs. This is just one of the innovative solutions from our Biotechnology team's project pipeline aimed at helping customers bring more life-saving therapies to market faster and more efficiently.\nTurning to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue grew 2.5%, and core revenue was up 5%, including high single-digit growth in our base business. Our Life Sciences instruments businesses collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth, consistent with our expectations. Funding levels and sales funnels remained healthy across most major geographies and end markets. The demand for our advanced solutions remains strong, notably for recent innovations, such as the SCIEX ZenoTOF7600 and Leica Microsystems, Mica.\nOur genomics consumables business had another quarter of double-digit base business core revenue growth. Robust demand for plasmids, proteins and gene writing and editing solutions was partially offset by declines in next-generation sequencing and basic research. During the quarter, Aldevron brought together capabilities from Cytiva and Precision Nanosystems to create a streamlined offering for the development, production and release of mRNA drug substance and drug product. This new offering will be available to customers later this year and is a great example of how we're integrating solutions from across Danaher to create differentiated offerings and deliver even greater value to our customers.\nMoving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue declined 10% and core revenue declined 7.5% with double-digit growth in our base business, offset by lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes at CES. Our Clinical Diagnostics businesses collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth and saw healthy market volumes globally.\nAt Radiometer, strong demand for blood gas testing in China drove double-digit core growth. Leica Biosystems, we made single digits, led by advanced staining and digital pathology. Strength across developed markets and China enabled Beckman Coulter Diagnostics to exceed expectations and deliver mid-single-digit core growth. On molecular diagnostics, broad-based strength across Cepheid's test menu drove more than 30% core growth in nonrespiratory testing. As our customers look for ways to capitalize on the workflow advantages, the gene -- the Cepheid GeneXpert delivered for COVID-related testing, they are increasingly adding additional assays from our market-leading test menu.\nThis increased menu utilization by our customers help drive more than 50% growth in infectious disease testing in the first quarter. We also saw good momentum for our recently introduced vaginitis panel, the Xpert Express MVP, which contributed to nearly 30% growth in sexual health testing.\nIn COVID-related respiratory testing, customers continued transitioning high throughput testing to the point of care and consolidating their point-of-care PCO testing platforms onto the gene expert. As a result, Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $550 million in the quarter exceeded our expectation of $450 million. This was driven both by higher volumes and the preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A and B and RSV. We continue to expect approximately 30 million respiratory tests and $1.2 billion of revenue for the full year.\nCepheid's strong results are a testament to the significant value and unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow provides clinicians. Given Cepheid's leading global installed base and growing adoption of the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market, we're well positioned to help customers meet their testing needs and continue gaining market share for years to come.\nMoving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 5% and core revenue was up 6.5%. Water quality core revenue grew low double digits and product identification was up low single digits. In water quality, Hach delivered their fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and ChemTreat was up double digits for the eighth consecutive quarter. Strength was broad-based across both equipment and consumables, particularly in our industrial end markets. This performance highlights the resilience of the high-margin recurring revenue business model that make up water quality and the significant value our solutions provide in support of customers' day-to-day mission-critical water operations.\nAt Product Identification, marking and coding was essentially flat, while packaging and color management was up low single digits. Videojet was up low single digits despite a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew high single digits in Q1 last year. Our growth investments are driving a healthy cadence of new product innovation at Videojet. In fact, in March, the team released the 15 ADC continuous inkjet printer, the industry's first dedicated soft-pigmented solution.\nThe 15 ADC uses soft-pigmented inks to print codes with consistent quality, excellent contrast and strong durability to avoid degradation and fading during production runs, helping customers reduce production downtime. So this is the first of several new product introductions Videojet has planned for the year and is a great example of how our teams are bringing impactful solutions to our customers.\nIn February, we announced that our Environmental & Applied segment will be named Veralto, when it is launched as a stand-alone company, and that it will be headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. This is an exciting milestone for the team, and they're making considerable progress towards becoming a separately traded public company. And we remain on track for our fourth quarter 2023 separation and look forward to sharing more details in the coming months.\nSo now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect core revenue in our base business to be up mid-single digits. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single digits as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccine and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a second quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 26%, which reflects the efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID transitioning to an endemic state, particularly within our Diagnostics and Biotechnology businesses.\nNow turning to the full year 2023. Despite the near-term and temporary challenges within bioprocessing, we anticipate mid-single-digit core growth in our base business. We also expect total core revenue to decline high single digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect a full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%, which reflects the previously mentioned efforts to adjust our cost structure and capacity in response to COVID-19 transitioning to an endemic state.\nSo to wrap up. We're pleased with our strong first quarter results. Our well-rounded performance is a testament to the durability and balanced positioning of our portfolio and our team's commitment to leading and executing with the Danaher Business System. While the transition of COVID-19 from a pandemic to an endemic state is causing near-term disruption, there is no doubt that the past 3 years have helped shape Danaher into a better, stronger company.\nWe meaningfully changed the scale of our bioprocessing business, with the addition of Cytiva and the creation of the Biotechnology group. And Cepheid's expanded installed base has significantly improved their competitive advantage. We've also increased our cadence of innovation and strategically deployed capital through M&A, including the acquisition of Aldevron, to accelerate our future growth trajectory. So there's a bright future ahead for Danaher, the combination of our talented team, differentiated portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, provide us with a strong foundation to create value for many years to come.\nAnd so with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Ashley, we are now ready for questions.",

Blair\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Danaher Corporation\n\nThank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. Our terrific fourth quarter results rounded out another great year for Danaher. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove nearly 10% core growth, strong earnings growth and free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which grew high single digits for the year and has now grown high single digits or better each of the last 10 quarters.\nOur well-rounded results this year would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 80,000 associates. The team overcame global supply chain challenges, logistics delays, COVID-driven lockdowns and inflationary pressures to reliably support our customers. We believe the DBS-driven execution, coupled with our proactive growth investments over the last several years, contributed to meaningful market share gains in many of our businesses.\nNow looking to 2023 and beyond, we see a bright future ahead for Danaher. Our portfolio is made up of leading franchises of durable business models and attractive end markets that benefit from outstanding long-term secular growth drivers. We're well positioned financially with our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet capacity, allowing us to actively pursue strategic M&A opportunities. So this unique combination of leading businesses and financial strength, all powered by the Danaher Business System, differentiates us and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage.\nSo with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2022 financial results. For the full year, we delivered nearly 10% core revenue and adjusted earnings per share growth, including 8% core revenue growth in our base business. We also expanded our core operating margins by 60 basis points and generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio exceeded 100% for the 31st consecutive year.\nNow our strong financial results allowed us to continue our cadence of high-impact growth investments throughout the year. In fact, our investments in research and development of more than $1.7 billion in 2022 enabled us to accelerate innovation across Danaher. New products such as the Leica Microsystems' Mica; Leica Biosystems' automated advanced staining platform, BOND-PRIME; and Hach's HQ Series portable meters are helping improve both human health and the environment while enhancing our growth trajectory.\nOur capital expenditures of over $1 billion included substantial investments to expand production capacity in our bioprocessing and genomics businesses. These investments have been critical to support current customer demand. But they're equally important to support the long-term growth opportunities and security of supply in these markets. With several of our customers' biologic therapies progressing through the regulatory approval process, we anticipate the size of our bioprocessing and genomics businesses to increase meaningfully here in the coming years.\nNow let's turn to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Sales were $8.4 billion. And we delivered 7.5% core revenue growth. Our base business core revenue growth was also 7.5% as our core revenue growth contribution from COVID-19 testing was neutral year-over-year. Geographically, core revenue growth in both North America and Western Europe was approximately 10%. We saw healthy demand across our major end markets with customer activity and funding levels largely consistent with the third quarter.\nHigh-growth markets core revenue was up slightly. China grew low single digits, driven by robust demand in our Life Sciences instruments and acute care diagnostic businesses. However, the reopening efforts associated with the ending of zero-COVID policies and subsequent increase in COVID-19 infections resulted in reduced patients and testing volumes in our clinical diagnostics business. We anticipate lower testing volumes to continue through the first quarter of 2023 before gradually recovering through the balance of the year.\nOur gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 59%. And our operating margin of 27.4% was up 100 basis points, including 105 basis points of core operating margin expansion. This strong margin performance was enabled by the disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions our teams implemented to help offset the impact of inflationary pressures across our business.\nWhile there continued to be supply chain disruptions and cost pressures, we saw a modest improvement in component availability again this year and this quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.87 was up 6.5% versus last year. And we also generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.\nNow before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to point out some updates we've made in our financial reporting. Due to changes in our organization resulting from the significant growth of our Life Sciences segment over the past several years, we have separated our former Life Science segment into two new reporting segments.\nCytiva and Pall Life Sciences, which include bioprocessing and our discovery and medical businesses, are now reported as the Biotechnology segment. Our new Life Sciences segment is comprised of the remainder of the businesses in our former Life Sciences segment. The Diagnostics and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments are unchanged. Now importantly, today's discussion reflects these changes.\nSo now let's take a look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Reported revenue in our Biotechnology segment declined 1% and core revenue was up 4%. In bioprocessing, robust customer activity across monoclonal antibodies, cell and gene therapies and antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, drove another quarter of more than 20% growth in non-COVID revenue.\nTotal core growth in bioprocessing was mid-single digits for the fourth quarter as customers continued to scale back their COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic programs. For the full year 2022, core revenue growth in bioprocessing was high single digits, which included non-COVID revenue growth of more than 20%.\nLooking to 2023, we expect customers to further reduce their COVID-19-related programs. Vaccination and booster rates have been significantly lower than initially anticipated. And the availability of alternative therapeutics has reduced the need for monoclonal antibody-based treatments. In light of these dynamics, we now anticipate COVID-19-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue will be approximately $150 million for the full year of 2023, down from approximately $800 million in 2022 and lower than our previous expectation of $500 million.\nOur non-COVID business has averaged more than 20% growth over the past 2 years. Given these elevated growth rates, we spent the past several weeks speaking with our customers to better understand their planning assumptions for 2023. And based on these discussions, we anticipate non-COVID bioprocessing core growth will be high single digits for the full year 2023. This includes low single-digit core growth in the first quarter as customers repurpose inventory purchased for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic programs to non-COVID projects.\nNow there is a bright future ahead for the biologics market and our leading bioprocessing business. A number of biologic and genomic-based therapies in development and production continues to rise. And we expect to see significant industry-wide investments in research, development and production capacity well into the future. With our differentiated portfolio, which is the broadest and deepest in the industry across upstream and downstream applications, our best-in-class scientific services and extensive global reach, we're exceptionally well positioned to support our customers as they undertake this complex life-changing work.\nNow moving to our Life Sciences segment. Reported revenue grew 8% and core revenue was up 13%. Strength was broad-based across instruments and consumables with all major businesses delivering high single digits or better core revenue growth. Our Life Sciences instrument businesses collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by Leica Microsystems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Demand remains solid across our major geographies and end markets. And we're seeing good momentum in our opportunity funnels as we begin the new year.\nOur genomics consumables businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, driven by strong demand for our plasmas, RNA and gene lighting and editing solutions. During the quarter, IDT strengthened its next-generation sequencing portfolio with the acquisition of ArcherDX NGS assays. These assays are foundational in researching novel cancer fusions and bring new capabilities, including an enhanced bioinformatics platform to expand IDT's suite of sequencing solutions.\nNow moving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 3% and core revenue grew 7.5%, led by mid-teens growth at Cepheid. Radiometer grew double digits, led primarily by demand for blood gas testing in China. Leica Biosystems was also up double digits with growth across all major product lines. In our digital pathology business, we saw record placements of the GT 450, Leica's best-in-class digital pathology slide scanner, as customers are increasingly realizing the operational and clinical benefits of digitization.\nIn molecular diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu grew more than 20%, led by infectious disease testing, sexual health and hospital-acquired infections. The acceleration in growth this quarter was due in part to increased adoption of Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu across our nearly 50,000 instruments installed base, which has doubled since 2020.\nDuring the quarter, Cepheid expanded their competitively advantaged test menu with the launch of the Xpert Xpress MVP. The Xpress MVP rapidly diagnoses three distinct health conditions that cause overlapping vaginitis symptoms in women using a single sample. This addition to our sexual health portfolio enables physicians to quickly diagnose a patient's infection and prescribe a targeted treatment regimen, reducing the need for multiple office visits. Now this is a great example of how bringing accurate, easy-to-use molecular testing closer to patients is improving health care outcomes and driving long-term growth at Cepheid.\nIn respiratory testing, global PCR testing volumes continued to moderate. But demand for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR testing remained robust. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter significantly exceeded our expectation of approximately $375 million. The respiratory season got off to an earlier-than-anticipated start with a high prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, notably COVID-19, flu and RSV, leading to both higher volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A and B and RSV.\nNow based on discussions with our customers, we believe COVID-19 will enter an endemic disease state in 2023, and as a result, expect to ship 30 million respiratory tests and generate $1.2 billion of revenue for the full year. As hospitals and health systems begin planning for their endemic testing needs, we're increasingly seeing customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms on to Cepheid's GeneXpert.\nOur customers' preference for the GeneXpert for both respiratory and nonrespiratory testing is a result of the significant value of the unique combination of fast, accurate, lab-quality results and a best-in-class workflow-provided clinicians. The combination of these advantages, the broadest molecular diagnostic test menu on the market and our leading global installed base create significant opportunities ahead for Cepheid's point-of-care solutions.\nMoving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 1% and core revenue was up 5.5%. Water quality core revenue growth was high single digits and product identification was flat. At product identification, marking and coding was up slightly while packaging and color management was down low single digits. Core revenue at Videojet was up slightly due in part to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q4 last year.\nIn December, Pantone announced Viva Magenta as the 2023 Color of the Year. The Color of the Year and the billions of media impressions it generates solidifies Pantone's iconic brand and was one of the drivers of high single-digit full year core revenue growth in X-Rite's color standards business in 2022.\nIn water quality, Hach delivered their third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. ChemTreat was also up double digits in the fourth quarter, capping its 54th consecutive year of growth, a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class execution and their commitment to continuous improvement. During the quarter, demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remained strong across municipal and industrial end markets. But we did see a slight moderation of larger project activity at Trojan.\nThroughout the year, our teams in EAS did a great job leveraging the Danaher Business System to overcome supply chain challenges and manage inflationary pressures. They were at the forefront of identifying potential constraints and quickly deployed DBS tools, like daily management, to work with suppliers and ensure production parts availability. They also used visual project management to rapidly reengineer products and to reduce our reliance on hard-to-source electronic components.\nAlso, strong price performance helped the team expand operating profit margins by more than 80 basis points in 2022 while continuing their cadence of growth investments. We believe this outstanding execution, paired with our proactive growth investments, drove market share gains and enhanced our long-term competitive advantage in both product identification and water quality.\nSo with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and the full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we are updating our base business core revenue growth definition to exclude the impact of COVID-19-related testing and the impact of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue.\nIn the first quarter, we expect core revenue growth in our base business to be up mid-single digits. We also expect total core revenue growth to decline mid-single digits as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the first quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%.\nNow for the full year 2023. We expect high single-digit core growth in our base business. And we also expect total core revenue growth to decline mid-single digits for the year as a result of lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics. Additionally, we expect the full year adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 31%.\nSo to wrap up, 2022 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to reliably support our customers and deliver outstanding financial results, all while investing for the future. As we look ahead, we believe the combination of our talented team, the differentiated portfolio of businesses and strong balance sheet, all powered by the Danaher Business System, position Danaher to outperform well into the future.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of IR, Envista Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Todd, we're now ready to open up the line for questions.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Danaher Corporation's Third Quarter 2022 Earning Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. John Bedford, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Bedford, you may begin your conference.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of IR, Envista Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Shelby. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call. With us today are Rainer Blair, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt McGrew, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to point out that our earnings release, the slide presentation supplementing today's call, our third quarter Form 10-Q, the reconciliations and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call and additional materials are all available on the Investors section of our website, www.danaher.com, under the heading Quarterly Earnings.\nThe audio portion of this call will be archived on the Investors section of our website later today under the heading Events & Presentations and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until November 3, 2022.\nDuring the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings, and actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rainer.\n\nRainer M. Blair\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let's jump right in.\nOur positive momentum continued in the third quarter with 10% core revenue growth and solid earnings and cash flow performance. This strength was based across the portfolio with high single-digit or better core growth in all 3 reporting segments.\nWe're particularly pleased with the consistent performance of our base business, which has grown high single digits or better for 9 consecutive quarters. Now these well-rounded results were driven by our team's outstanding execution through a challenging operating environment. They've done a terrific job running the Danaher playbook to proactively reduce structural costs while continuing to accelerate high-impact growth investments. We believe our ability to deliver meaningful innovation and reliably serve customers has contributed to market share gains in many of our businesses.\nNow during the quarter, we also announced our intention to separate our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment to create a publicly-traded company. This new company, which we'll refer to as EAS for now, will be well positioned in the most attractive areas of the water quality and product identification market. EAS will be comprised of outstanding businesses with strong ESG fundamentals, durable business models and a very attractive financial profile, averaging mid-single-digit core revenue growth over the last 5 years with 55% recurring revenue today and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 25%.\nNow as a stand-alone company, EAS will have greater opportunities to meaningfully deploy capital towards M&A. And of course, EAS will have the Danaher Business System as its foundation, along with the commitment to continuous improvement that will support the same outstanding results EAS as a part of Danaher today. Of course, we look forward to sharing more details here in the coming months.\nAs for Danaher, this separation will establish us as a more focused science and technology leader committed to innovation and making a profound impact on human health. We've got a great lineup of leading franchises positioned in highly attractive life sciences and diagnostics end markets, all united by a common set of durable, high recurring revenue business models. We remain focused on strengthening our portfolio and competitive advantage in these areas, and we see tremendous opportunities to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance.\nSo with that, let's turn to our third quarter results in more detail. Sales were $7.7 billion, and we delivered 10% core revenue growth, including 8.5% core growth in our base business. Respiratory testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter.\nGeographically, we continue to see strong demand across the developed markets despite current macroeconomic and geopolitical events. North America's core revenue was up high teens with all 3 segments delivering double-digit or better core revenue growth. Core revenue in Western Europe grew high single digits with customer activity and funding levels remaining healthy.\nHigh-growth markets core revenues were up mid-single digits. In China, our teams effectively managed through ongoing COVID-19 headwinds to deliver high single-digit growth in the quarter.\nOur gross profit margin for the third quarter was 59.8%, and our operating margin was 26.3%. We had 50 basis points of core operating margin expansion, driven in part by disciplined cost management, productivity measures and price actions. The operating environment remains dynamic across our businesses globally, but we experienced fewer supply chain disruptions in the third quarter. Logistics improved as freight costs began to stabilize. We also saw modest improvements in material availability, though certain electronic components remained difficult to procure.\nDespite these challenges, our teams have done an outstanding job taking proactive measures and leveraging the DBS tool set to minimize the impact of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.50 were up 7% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $5.2 billion year-to-date.\nSo now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today.\nIn our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 4% and core revenue was up 8%. Strength was broad-based with most businesses achieving high single-digit or better core revenue growth.\nIn bioprocessing, robust activity levels drove over 20% growth in our non-COVID business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech.\nAs expected, our customers continue to transition away from COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic program and into programs for other modalities. We expect these trends to continue through the fourth quarter, resulting in high single-digit core revenue growth in our bioprocessing business for the full year.\nIn September, we hosted an Investor Day at Cytiva to showcase our bioprocessing business and highlighted the tremendous long-term growth opportunities we're positioned for in biologics and genomic medicine.\nWe also announced that we're bringing together Cytiva and Pall Life Sciences as the biotechnology group. The combined portfolio has the broadest offering in the industry with end-to-end solutions across all major therapeutic modalities, from monoclonal antibodies to emerging cell, gene and mRNA-based therapies. The biotechnology group will have unmatched global scale with the industry's largest commercial team, allowing us to further extend the reach of our best-in-class customer service.\nWe also believe focused innovation across the joint portfolio will ensure our products and solutions are aligned to best meet customers' needs around quality, yield and cost. With Pall Life Sciences and Cytiva joining forces, the biotechnology group is uniquely positioned to help our customers become more efficient and bring more life-saving therapies to market faster.\nMoving to our Life Sciences instrument businesses. They collectively delivered double-digit base business core revenue growth, led by SCIEX, Leica Microsystems and Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Funding levels remain strong globally, and we saw solid customer demand across most major end markets.\nWe continued our strong pace of innovation in life sciences with the introduction of Beckman Coulter's Biomek NGeniuS. NGeniuS is a cost-effective, easy-to-use sample preparation system that reduces manual transfers and hands-on time and next-gen sequencing library construction. This is a great example of how our investments in innovation are delivering impactful solutions to our customers.\nOur genomics businesses had another quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, led by strong demand for plasmid, RNA and next-generation sequencing solutions. This quarter marked Aldevron's first anniversary as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance.\nFinancially, the results speak for themselves, with more than 30% year-over-year revenue growth since acquisition. The team has done a tremendous job embracing DBS tools and processes to meaningfully reduce lead times and increase capacity. Now this capacity is certainly supporting customers' needs today, but it's equally important to support Aldevron's long-term growth outlook.\nWith a view towards the future, we're excited about the opportunities to collaborate across our genomics businesses and create unique solutions to help our customers accelerate the development and commercialization of mRNA and other nucleic acid-based therapies.\nMoving to our Diagnostics segment. Reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 13.5%, led by nearly 30% core revenue growth at Cepheid.\nLeica Biosystems grew mid-teens in the quarter, driven by strength in core histology and advanced staining. As customers seek to improve productivity within their labs, we're seeing strong early momentum for Leica's recent innovation, BOND-PRIME, a fully automated advanced staining platform. Beckman Coulter Diagnostics delivered solid results with mid-single-digit core growth despite ongoing COVID-19 headwinds in China.\nIn molecular diagnostics, core revenue across Cepheid's nonrespiratory test menu grew approximately 10%, led by double-digit growth in virology and infectious disease testing. In respiratory testing, global PCR volumes have moderated, but demand is still elevated for symptomatic testing at the point of care where Cepheid is the gold standard. Cepheid's respiratory testing revenue of approximately $875 million exceeded our expectations of approximately $325 million. Higher prevalence of circulating respiratory viruses, combined with advanced purchases by customers in anticipation of a more severe respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, led to both higher volumes and a preference for our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV.\nNow we're starting to see our customers consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platforms onto Cepheid's GeneXpert. The GeneXpert provides significant value to clinicians with a unique combination of fast, accurate lab quality results and the best-in-class workflow. Customers are also increasingly interested in opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading test menu. Our opportunity funnel for nonrespiratory tests has increased significantly this year and we see opportunities to continue gaining market share moving forward.\nMoving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue grew 5% and core revenue was up 10.5%. Water quality was up mid-teens, and product identification grew low single digits. At product identification, marking and coding was up low single digits and packaging and color management grew mid-single digits. Videojet was up low single digits, in part due to a difficult year-over-year comparison as the business grew low double digits in Q3 last year.\nNow during the quarter, we saw strength in food and beverage as well as the consumer end markets. In Water Quality, ChemTreat and Hach each grew high teens during the third quarter. Demand for analytical chemistries and consumables remain solid across our major end markets. Municipal and industrial project activity was broadly consistent with the first half of the year, driving solid equipment growth.\nNow last week at WEFTEC, the annual wastewater trade show, the Water Quality team highlighted several solutions that are improving the efficiency and sustainability of the water treatment process. Hach's Ultra Low Range Chlorine Analyzer raises the industry standard to parts per billion chemical detection levels, helping customers extend the membrane life of their treatment systems and reduce maintenance costs.\nAt Trojan, innovative solutions such as TrojanUVSigna and TrojanUV3000Plus reduce environmental impact by treating water with ultraviolet light instead of traditional chemical disinfection method. Every day, over 1 billion people benefit from water treated by Trojan.\nSo these are just a few examples of how our Water Quality platform is supporting customers day-to-day, mission-critical water operations and making a positive impact on the world.\nSo with that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a high single to low double-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing, resulting in a core revenue growth being flat to down low single digits in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit margin of approximately 30%.\nNow for the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We now expect high single-digit overall core revenue growth, which is up from our prior expectation of mid-single digits as a result of our strong COVID-19 testing performance in the third quarter. We continue to expect operating profit fall-through of approximately 25% for the full year.\nSo to wrap up, we're very pleased with our third quarter results. Our well-rounded performance really is a testament to our team's commitment to innovating and executing in support of our customers. These results also reinforce Danaher's strength and durability. Our differentiated portfolio is well positioned in attractive end markets with long-term secular growth drivers, and our business models are resilient with nearly 75% of our revenue today being recurring.\nSo putting it all together, the strength of our portfolio and balance sheet, combined with our talented team and the power of the proactive application of the Danaher Business System, provides an outstanding foundation for delivering sustainable long-term results.\nSo with that, I'll turn it back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of IR, Envista Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Rainer. Shelby, that concludes formal comments, and we're now ready for questions here.",

Blair\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, John, and good morning to all of you. We really appreciate you joining us on the call today. So let me start with we had a great quarter. In fact, our strong second quarter results rounded out a terrific first half of the year. Broad-based strength across the portfolio drove better-than-expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. And we were particularly pleased with the performance of our base business, which grew high single digits and believe we gained market share in many of our businesses.\nNow these results are a testament to our team's strong commitment to executing in a challenging operating environment. They've done an incredible job leveraging the Danaher Business System to help mitigate supply chain constraints, manage inflationary pressures and improve our competitive positioning with impactful new innovation.\nOur second quarter results also highlights the strength and resilience of the businesses that make up Danaher today. Our portfolio is comprised of leading franchises positioned in attractive end markets with strong secular growth drivers, all united by a common set of durable business models. In fact, nearly 75% of our revenues today are recurring, the majority of which are consumables that are specified into highly regulated manufacturing processes or specific to the equipment that we supply. On top of that, our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation positions us well to further enhance our portfolio going forward.\nWe believe this powerful combination of our talented team and the strength of our portfolio all powered by the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable long-term competitive advantage.\nSo with that, let's turn to our second quarter results in a little more detail. Sales were $7.8 billion, and we delivered 9.5% core revenue growth, including 8% growth in our base business with strong contributions from all 4 of our operating platforms. COVID-19 testing contributed an additional 150 basis points to core revenue growth in the quarter.\nGeographically, core revenue in developed markets grew low double digits with broad-based strength across North America and Western Europe. High-growth markets were up mid-single digits, including impressive high single-digit growth in China.\nOur results in China significantly exceeded our expectations, which is particularly notable as lockdowns continued for longer than we anticipated. So now I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our associates in China for their extraordinary efforts and commitment during such a challenging time. To the teams that managed the approvals necessary to reopen our facilities, the supply chain and logistics teams that kept parts moving and the manufacturing associates who spent several weeks away from their families, thank you. Thank you for supporting the reopening effort, and most importantly, thank you for supporting our customers. This is such a great example of one of our core values. The best team wins in action.\nAs we move through the rest of the year, we're keeping an eye out for further outbreaks and regional lockdowns, but we're currently seeing more normalized business operations in China and expect this positive trend to continue for the balance of the year.\nGross profit margin for the second quarter was 60.9%, and our operating margin of 28.4% was up 60 basis points, including 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion. Our strong margin performance was a result of disciplined cost management and the proactive measures our teams have taken to address the inflationary pressures we've seen over the last several quarters. We're also using DBS tools to execute price actions, and we achieved approximately 400 basis points of price increases in the quarter, a significant acceleration from our historical price realization.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 12% versus last year. We also generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $3.4 billion year-to-date.\nNow let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. In our Life Sciences segment, reported revenue grew 6% and core revenue was up 7%. Strength was broad-based across the segment with high single-digit or better base business core revenue growth at each of our largest operating companies.\nIn our Bioprocessing business, we continue to see record activity levels from early-stage research to later-stage development and production which drove a combined core revenue growth rate of high single digits at Cytiva and Pall Biotech. Our backlog and our order levels remain very healthy, and as always we're working closely with customers to ensure they have the right inventory levels to support their planned activity.\nWe are seeing our customers continue the healthy transition away from COVID-19 vaccines and therapies and into previously paused and new programs for other modalities. As a result, we now expect COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic revenue of approximately $1 billion in 2022 down from approximately $2 billion in 2021. Now that said, there's no change to our high single to low double-digit core revenue growth outlook in our bioprocessing business for the year as customers are accelerating their investments across all other major therapeutic modalities. This acceleration, paired with improving price realization, is driving more than 20% core revenue growth in our non-COVID business, up from the low double-digit growth we've seen historically.\nThe biologics market remains very healthy as evidenced by the increasing number of treatments in development and production. Today, there are over 1,500 monoclonal antibody-based therapies in development globally, which is up more than 50% from just 5 years ago. This is being driven by both novel molecules in development and the proliferation of biosimilars, which are helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets as patents on higher-volume therapies expire.\nThere are also over 2,000 cell and gene therapy candidates in development today, a more than tenfold increase over the last several years. And given this backdrop of such a significant and sustained increase in activity, we expect the growth rate in this market to remain very strong for many years to come.\nNow as the complexity required to manufacture these life-saving treatment increases, customers are looking to collaborate with us to help them solve their most challenging problems and assist them as they move from lab to production scale. Cytiva recently announced a collaboration with Bayer to develop the industry's first modular end-to-end manufacturing platform for allogeneic cell therapies which will help to improve the treatment of a broad array of diseases including cancer. This collaboration is just another great example of how our scientific expertise and leading positions in upstream and downstream applications are helping these cutting-edge therapies advance from the laboratory to the clinic.\nOur more instrument-oriented Life Science businesses collectively delivered high single-digit base business core revenue growth. We're seeing a healthy funding environment and solid demand across most major end markets. SCIEX core revenue was up more than 10% in the second quarter, driven by an acceleration of new projects at our biopharma, CRO and academic research customers. We continued our cadence of innovation with the introduction of several new solutions that improve the accuracy and efficiency of genomics and proteomics research. Notably, SCIEX introduced the Zeno SWATH DIA, an innovative software solution, which doubles the number of proteins that can be discovered versus previous swath approaches, helping researchers discover more potential biomarkers and better understand the cause and treatment of diseases.\nOn our Genomics businesses, customers are making significant investments in the development and production of cell and gene therapies, DNA and RNA vaccines and the gene editing. IDT had its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit core revenue growth, led by robust activity and next-gen sequencing and gene writing and editing. Aldevron to more than 20% while also making significant progress on the capacity expansion projects needed to support their long-term growth outlook.\nNow moving to our Diagnostics segment, reported revenue was up 9.5% and core revenue grew 12.5% led by nearly 30% growth at Cepheid. Our other diagnostics businesses, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer and Leica Biosystems collectively delivered mid-single-digit core revenue growth despite headwinds from the COVID-19-related shutdowns in China.\nIn China, our Diagnostics core revenue was flat year-over-year. Site access and patient volumes slowly improved as the quarter progressed with a more pronounced recovery in June. Patient volumes remained slightly below normal levels, but we expect continued recovery as we progress through the remainder of the year.\nNow outside of China, patient volumes across hospital and reference labs held up well during the quarter and remained at or above pre-pandemic levels despite recent outbreaks of emerging COVID variants.\nOur diagnostics customers continue to face skilled labor shortages and are increasingly seeking to improve automation and productivity within their labs. This quarter, Leica Biosystems introduced its next-generation, fully automated advanced staining platform, BOND-PRIME, to help address these needs in the pathology lab. BOND-PRIME facilitates a continuous pathology lab workflow and delivers the high-resolution stains needed for a definitive diagnosis with an industry-leading average turnaround time of only 90 minutes.\nNow as I mentioned earlier, core revenue growth at Cepheid was up nearly 30% in the quarter. Low teens growth across our nonrespiratory test menu was led by sexual health, hospital-acquired infections and [virology]. In respiratory testing, strong global demand persisted for Cepheid's point-of-care assay, and we believe we continue to gain market share. Respiratory testing revenue of approximately $750 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations of approximately $400 million. The spread of highly transmissible COVID variants and greater incidence of other respiratory infections, such as RSV and flu led to both higher testing volume and a preference for our 4-in-1 combination test. As a result, our 4-in-1 test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented about 50% of the 16 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID-only tests accounting for the remaining 50%.\nNow as COVID-19 shifts to an endemic disease state, we're seeing more customers begin to consolidate their point-of-care PCR testing platform onto the Cepheid GeneXpert. This preference for the GeneXpert both within hospitals and across health care networks is evidence of the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab-quality results and an easy-to-use best-in-class workflow provide clinicians. In addition, as our customers begin freeing capacity from respiratory testing, they are increasingly interested in discussing opportunities for broader utilization of Cepheid's leading point-of-care molecular testing menu.\nNow moving to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 6.5% and core revenue was up 10% with double-digit core growth at Water Quality and mid-single-digit core revenue growth at Product Identification. In Water Quality, ChemTreat, Trojan and how each grew double digits during the second quarter. Robust growth in our analytical chemistries and consumables was broad-based across all major end markets. Equipment sales remained strong with healthy levels of project activity at both industrial and municipal customers.\nAt product identification, marking and coding was up high single digits and packaging and color management grew mid-single digits. Videojet was up high single digits, led by North America, where food and beverage sales were particularly strong.\nOur EAS team is leading the charge and writing the newest chapter in the DBS playbook to counter the supply chain and inflationary pressures we're seeing every day. They have been reengineering products to reduce our reliance on hard to source electronic components and using daily management to work closely with suppliers to ensure production parts availability. These efforts, along with our accelerated price actions, are also helping improve our margin position. We saw the impact on our results this quarter with more than 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion at EAS. Our strong performance also highlights the resiliency and the durability of the high-margin recurring revenue business models that make up our EAS portfolio.\nWith that color on what we're seeing in our businesses and end markets, let's now briefly look ahead at expectations for the third quarter and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect to deliver high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business. We expect a mid-single-digit core revenue growth headwind from COVID-19 testing, resulting in low single-digit core revenue growth overall.\nFor the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business and mid-single-digit core revenue growth overall. Given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect operating fall-through at the high end of our previously communicated range of 20% to 25% for the full year.\nSo to wrap up, we're really pleased with our strong second quarter and first half performance. Our results are a testament to the team's consistent execution in a dynamic operating environment and to the durable balanced position of our portfolio today.\nLooking ahead, our team's commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System, our differentiated portfolio of businesses serving attractive end markets and our strong balance sheet all position Danaher to continue delivering sustainable long-term performance.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Bedford\n\nVP of IR, Envista Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Gretchen, we're now ready for questions.",

Blair\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today.\nWe're off to a good start in 2022 with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectation. The team navigated a challenging operating environment to deliver strong revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. And our performance was broad-based with high single-digit or better core revenue growth in each of our 3 segments. Now during the first quarter, we continued to strengthen our competitive advantage through high-impact growth investments in innovation and bioprocessing production capacity, both of which we believe are contributing to market share gain.\nNow clearly, our well-rounded results are really a testament to our team's commitment to continuous improvement and to the unique positioning of our portfolio. We just have an exceptional collection of businesses, all powered by the Danaher Business System that serve attractive end markets with durable secular growth drivers. And it's this combination that differentiates Danaher today and provide a strong foundation for the future.\nSo with that, let's turn to our first quarter results. Sales were $7.7 billion in the first quarter, and we delivered 12% of core revenue growth. Our base business was up 8% and with broad-based strength across the portfolio and COVID-19 testing contributing 4%. Geographically, Revenue in both the U.S. and Western Europe grew mid-teens, while high-growth markets were up low single digits. China declined low single digits but was up high single digits, excluding the impact of a previously called out significant bioprocessing project delivered in the prior year. The COVID-19 driven lockdowns that began in late March had a very modest impact on our first quarter results in China. However, as these lockdowns extend further into April, we're seeing more of an impact in our businesses. And we anticipate the situation will begin to ease in the coming weeks with an eventual return to normalized activity levels by the end of June.\nOur gross profit margin for the first quarter was 61.2%. The -- the operating margin decline of 80 basis points to 28.3% is largely due to year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates and product mix, primarily within our Life Sciences segment. Now adjusted diluted net earnings per common share of $2.76 were up 9.5% versus last year, and we generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter.\nSo now let's take a look at our results across the portfolio and give you some color on what we're seeing in our end markets today. Let's start with Life Sciences where reported revenue grew 9.5% and core revenue was up 7.5% with broad-based strength across the segment. In bioprocessing, we're seeing very robust activity levels, customers are accelerating their investments in research and production across all major therapeutic modalities. Core revenue in our bioprocessing business at Cytiva and Pall Biotech grew high single digits and was up low double digits, excluding the impact of that significant onetime project in China last year. The orders remain very healthy, and we continue to build backlog across both businesses during the quarter.\nNow over the last 2 years, our customers prioritize the development of COVID-19 vaccine and therapies to rapidly accelerate their time to market. Today, these programs require less investment in manufacturing capacity as they mature and become a part of our customers' core business. And as a result, our customers are starting to reallocate resources back to previously paused and new programs for other modalities. Notably, monoclonal antibody-based therapies or MABT, cell and gene therapy and mRNA-based technology. In bioprocessing today, monoclonal antibodies are the largest investment area for our customers as they're becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many diseases. Customers are adding manufacturing capacity to support both novel MABT in clinical trials and the rapid growth of approved treatment. Biosimilar development and production are also increasing as patents on higher volume therapies expire. This trend is making life-saving treatments more accessible and helping to accelerate adoption in underserved markets.\nNow we continue to make substantial investments in manufacturing capacity to help meet our customers accelerating demand in bioprocessing. An important focus area of our expansion has been with single-use technology, which are key enablers to scale the development and manufacturing of biologics and genomic-based medicines. In this first quarter, our newest plan dedicated to the manufacturing of single-use technology came online in Cardiff, Wales. Now this plant, along with recently opened facilities in South Carolina and Beijing are critical to support our customers' demand today. Long term, they provide additional capacity for one of the fastest-growing product categories within bioprocessing.\nSo turning to our Life Sciences Instrument businesses, we're seeing strong levels of activity in all major end markets. Demand is particularly robust at our pharmaceutical CRO, and academic research customers where a healthy funding environment is accelerating the initiation of new projects. In the first quarter, Leica Microsystems IDT and SCIEX each grew over 10%. At SCIEX, the ZenoTOF 7600 and Triple Quad 7500 continue to perform well and are great examples of how our investments in innovation are driving market share gains and enhancing our growth trajectory. At Leica Microsystems, Mika is another example of impactful innovation for our customers. Mika integrates wide field and confocal imaging in a single instrument while leveraging machine learning and automation to dramatically simplify the imaging workflow for our researchers. So clearly, across the life sciences portfolio, we're investing in innovation to bring meaningful solutions to our customers and to strengthen our competitive position.\nAldevron continued its great start as a part of Danaher, delivering over 40% growth in the first quarter. Since joining Danaher in late August, the team has embraced the Danaher Business System and putting DBS tools to work. Recently completed Kaizen event which focused on increasing throughput further reducing lead times are already generating terrific results. So we're excited about the early progress at Aldevron and thrilled with the great work the team is doing.\nSo now let's move to Diagnostics, where reported revenue was up 21.5% and core revenue grew 22.5% led by over 50% growth at Cepheid. Our non-COVID clinical diagnostics businesses collectively grew mid-single digits. Notably, Leica Biosystems delivered their seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by strength in core histology, advanced staining and digital pathology. The clinical diagnostic market volumes remain at healthy levels in most geographies as patients are returning for wellness checks, routine screening and other elective procedures. Our customers are effectively managing through periodic outbreaks by adapting their protocols and procedures, allowing them to continue providing critical health care services. Now in China, we're currently seeing regional lockdowns impact patient volumes and expect our Diagnostics business to be the most effective in the second quarter.\nIn Molecular Diagnostics, respiratory testing volumes have moderated globally as the Omicron outbreak has subsided in most regions. However, demand for Cepheid testing at the point of care remains very strong, and we believe we're taking market share. Our continued growth and share gains are a testament to the significant value the unique combination of fast, accurate lab results and a best-in-class workflow is providing to clinicians at the point of care. So as COVID-19 moves towards an endemic disease state, we're seeing increased demand for Cepheid's broader test menu. In the first quarter, non-respiratory testing revenue grew double digits, led by hospital-acquired infection, urology and infectious disease testing. Customers, including several who initially purchased our GeneXpert system for COVID-19 testing, are expressing increased interest in expanding their menu utilization. As our customers free capacity from respiratory testing, we believe there are significant opportunities to leverage our market-leading installed base and testing menu to drive broader utilization and demand for Cepheid's point-of-care molecular testing solutions.\nNow respiratory testing revenue of $900 million in the quarter exceeded our expectations as customers showed an increased preference for Cepheid's 4-in-1 combination test during the respiratory season. Our combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV represented approximately 65% of the 17 million respiratory cartridges shipped in the quarter with COVID-only tests accounting for approximately 35%.\nSo now let's move to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, where reported revenue grew 2.5% with core revenue up 6.5%, including HACH water quality and mid-single-digit growth at product identification. At water quality, ChemTreat delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, accelerating demand for our analytical chemistries and consumables was driven by activity across municipal, chemical, food and beverage end market. Equipment order rate also remains strong as customers are continuing to invest in larger municipal projects.\nNow Product Identification, our marking and coding business was up high single digits, partially offset by a slight decline in our packaging and color management business. Videojet was up high single digits with strong demand in food, beverage and industrial end markets.\nSo stepping back, our water quality and product identification platforms have done an exceptional job of leveraging the Danaher Business System to improve their positioning both from a cost and growth perspective. While supply chain pressures have been modestly more pronounced than EAS, our teams are using DBS tools such as daily management to work with suppliers and ensure production component availability. We're also using visual project management to help us reengineer our products faster with a focus on moving from difficult to source electronic component to newer, more cost-effective next-generation chipsets. Now we believe DBS enables us to deliver faster and more reliably than many of our competitors.\nNow our teams are also using DBS growth tools to accelerate innovation and deliver more impactful solutions to the market, innovations such as Videojet, CIJ 1880 printer and HACH's HQ series portable meters, are helping our customers solve the many challenges they face from increasing regulatory requirements to skilled labor shortages. And we're seeing the impact in our core growth, which has averaged mid-single digits annually over the past 10 years at EAS.\nSo we believe this combination of the rigorous application of DBS tools, paired with our proactive growth investment is driving meaningful market share gains and enhancing our long-term competitive advantage.\nSo now let's briefly look ahead to our expectations for the second quarter and the full year. In the second quarter, we expect to deliver mid-single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, which includes a headwind of approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the ongoing COVID-19-related shutdowns in China. For the full year 2022, there is no change to our previous guidance of high single-digit core revenue growth in our base business as we expect the shutdowns in China to normalize as we move through the remainder of the year. We continue to expect both a low single-digit core growth headwind from COVID-19 testing and overall mid-single-digit core revenue growth.\nSo to wrap up, we had a good start to the year and look forward to building on this foundation as we move through 2022. Our first quarter results are a testament to the dedication of our outstanding team and their commitment to executing with the Danaher Business System. And these results also reflect the unique positioning of our portfolio and the exceptional collection of high-quality franchises that comprise Danaher today. We believe the durability of our businesses where consumables now represent 75% of revenue, positions us exceptionally well in today's dynamic operating environment. So this powerful combination of our talented team, the strength of our portfolio and the Danaher Business System differentiates Danaher and reinforces our sustainable, long-term competitive advantage.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, John.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Leo, we're now ready for questions.",

Blair\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Danaher Corporation\n\nWell, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. 2021 was a tremendous year for Danaher capped off by a very strong finish to the fourth quarter. Our well-rounded performance throughout the year was highlighted by outstanding core revenue and earnings growth as well as strong free cash flow generation. We're particularly pleased with the strength of our base business across the portfolio, which was up low double digits for the year. And we believe our accelerated innovation and capacity expansion initiatives has helped us capture market share at a number of our businesses.\nNow these results are a testament to our team of 80,000 associates and their outstanding execution in what has been a challenging operating environment. Despite the uncertainty that has come to characterize life for all of us throughout the pandemic, our associates are showing up big every day, working longer shifts, launching breakthrough products in record time and going above and beyond to support our customers, and they remain committed as ever to executing with the Danaher Business System. Really, their dedication to serving our customers and the global community is as humbling as it is inspiring, and we're grateful for their invaluable contribution.\nThe circumstances over the last several years have also shined a light on the high-quality, market-leading franchises and technologies that now comprise Danaher. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action today through higher growth in margins, stronger cash flow and a higher percentage of recurring revenue. We're exceptionally well positioned to continue this trajectory going forward, and we see a very bright future ahead.\nSo with that, let's take a closer look at our full year 2021 financial results. We delivered 25% core revenue growth, 560 basis points of core operating margin expansion, nearly 60% adjusted earnings per share growth and over $7 billion of free cash flow. We deployed $11 billion of capital towards acquisitions, closing 14 deals across all 4 of our platforms. The largest acquisition, Aldevron, joined our Life Sciences segment in August, providing a fantastic beachhead for us in the important frontier of genomic medicine. It's just a great example of how we're using strategic M&A to enhance our capability and bring greater value to our customers.\nNow throughout the year, we also made significant organic investments to accelerate innovation across our businesses. Our R&D spend was up approximately 30% year-over-year and is now more than $1.7 billion annually. New products, which as the SCIEX XenoToS7600 and triple-quad 7500 and Leica Biosystems Aperio GT 450 digital pathology slide scanner are driving share gains in their respective markets through proprietary innovation while further enhancing our growth trajectory.\nNow total capital expenditures were $1.3 billion for the year, which reflects substantial investments to expand production capacity across our businesses, particularly at Cepheid, Pall and Cytiva. In bioprocessing, I'm really happy to report that our new single-use technology plants in South Carolina and Beijing and our cell culture media expansion in Utah all came online in the fourth quarter. And at Cepheid, we more than doubled our production capacity for respiratory tests in 2021. For near term, we believe these investments have been critical to support customer demand, and it helped us achieve meaningful market share gains. And they're equally important in the long term to support the significant growth opportunities we see ahead in these very attractive end markets.\nAnd now let's spend some time on the fourth quarter results. Our sales were $8.1 billion, and we delivered 19.5% core revenue growth with strong contributions from all 3 segments. We saw broad-based strength across our base business, which was up approximately 10% in the quarter. And geographically, both have developed and high-growth markets were up approximately 20% led by nearly 25% growth in North America and high teens growth in China. Gross profit margin was 60.7%, and our operating profit margin of 26.4% was up 270 basis points, including 240 basis points of core margin expansion.\nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.69 were up approximately 30%. And now for the full year, we generated more than $7 billion of free cash flow, up 30% year-over-year. In fact, our free cash flow to net income conversion was 112% from the full year and it marks the 30th consecutive year this figure has exceeded 100% for Danaher.\nSo now let's go into more detail on our quarterly results across the segment. Life Sciences reported revenue increased 20.5% with core revenue up 17%. Now these strong results were broad-based with most major operating companies achieving low double-digit or better core growth. In fact, Aldevron delivered over 30% revenue growth in the quarter and finished the year with approximately $400 million in total revenue. That business is off to a great start as part of Danaher, and we couldn't be more pleased with the team's performance out of the gate.\nOur core revenue growth in our processing businesses continued to outpace segment level results with Cytiva and Pall Biotech, both up more than 25%. Non-COVID related bioprocessing trends remained strong with our businesses growing low double digits again this quarter. We continue to support significant customer activity across the development and production of COVID vaccines and therapeutics, which drove $2 billion of revenue in 2021.\nMoving to Diagnostics. Reported revenue was up 29.5% and core revenue grew 29% led by greater than 75% core growth at Cepheid. Non-COVID clinical diagnostic activity across all our operating companies, including Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, Radiometer, and Leica Biosystems collectively drove high single-digit core growth as patient and testing volumes largely remained at or near prepandemic levels. And we also saw an acceleration in demand that crosses nonrespiratory menu, led by telehealth, hospital-acquired infections and urology testing.\nCepheid produced and shipped approximately $19 million of respiratory test cartridges during the quarter. This dropped the total number of respiratory tests shipped in 2021 to approximately [16 million] cartridges, more than 10x the number of tests produced and shipped in 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic. In fact, our 4-in-1 combination test for COVID-19, Flu A, Flu B and RSV and approximately 50% of Q4 respiratory test shipments, while our COVID-only test accounted for the remainder.\nNow let's move on to our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment. Reported revenue was up 4%, with 7.5% core revenue growth. Our water quality and product identification platforms both delivered high single-digit core growth for the quarter. Now across our water quality businesses, strength was broad-based globally across industrial and municipal end markets. Customer activity accelerated with the support of a strong funding environment and many projects that were put on hold during the pandemic have now resumed. Country delivered low double-digit core revenue growth in the quarter to close out its 53rd consecutive year of growth. This is a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team's best-in-class commercial execution and commitment to continuous improvement, with truly a differentiating combination, which has driven consistent market outperformance.\nIn Product Identification, our packaging and color management businesses were up mid-single digits and marking and coding was up approximately 10%. Videojet had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit core growth, led by strong demand in industrial and food and beverage end markets. So with that as a backdrop for what we saw in the quarter, let me highlight the trends we're seeing, both geographically and in our end markets.\nSo a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity is driving healthy customer demand across most major geographies. This is reflected in the strong results we've seen throughout both the developed and growth markets and our strong order book growth, which continues to trend above revenue growth. While certain regions have implemented targeted lockdowns to address recent COVID-19 outbreaks, we're not seeing any widespread decline in our customer activity.\nNow given the size and scope of our business, we're certainly not immune to ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, but we're proactively addressing these challenges across Danaher, leveraging the Danaher Business System and tools such as daily management and working closely with our customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact. We're also using DBS to accelerate price action and manage cost pressures. In fact, we've achieved nearly 150 basis points of price each of the last 3 quarters, which is approximately double our historical price realization.\nNow in Life Sciences. We're seeing robust demand across all major end markets. Lab and customer site access is holding at prepandemic levels, evidenced by more normalized customer productivity, equipment installations and project initiation supported by a strong funding environment. Biopharma continues to be our strongest performing end market within the Life Sciences business, while shifts in treatment towards biologics as the standard of care and the accelerating focus on genomic therapies are driving significant investments in research, development and production capacity across the sector. And we believe we're well positioned to support this work across our $7.5 billion bioprocessing franchise.\nNow in addition, we continue see significant demand related to development and production of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, and we expect this activity to persist longer term. Our customers are planning for ongoing production with the assumption that there will be an enduring need for effective treatment and prevention as the world transitions to approaching COVID-19 as an endemic virus. And more broadly, our customers increasingly view the potential applications of new mRNA modalities, including vaccines and other therapeutics as an important area for future investments.\nIn the clinical diagnostics market, patient volumes remain at or near prepandemic levels. Our customers have largely adapted their protocols and procedures to manage through recurring outbreaks, allowing them to continue wellness checks, routine screening and other diagnostic procedures. While selective lockdowns are causing modest disruptions in certain regions like pockets of China and Europe, we're not experiencing any material widespread negative impact from these measures. Molecular diagnostics global demand persists for Cepheid's point-of-care PCR respiratory test further heightened as a result of the recent global surge of the Omicron variant. Additionally, we're seeing a more active respiratory season in the Northern Hemisphere, driving customers' preference for our 4-in-1 combination test, and we expect both of these trends to continue into the first quarter.\nNow in light of these dynamics and conversations we're having with our customers about their expectations for the upcoming year, we anticipate shipping the same number of respiratory tests in the first quarter as we did in the fourth quarter and approximately 50 million sets for all of 2020.\nIn 2021, Cepheid record 10,000 new experts, with total (inaudible) to more than 40,000 systems worldwide. The team's thoughtful approach to placing systems throughout the pandemic is focused on both the near and long-term value this technology can bring to our customers. More recently, we've seen several existing health care system and integrated delivery network customers adding new instruments at sites further out in their networks and closer to their patients, facilitating faster diagnostics and treatment decisions. The scalability and unique architecture of the GeneXpert where the same test cartridges are used on higher and lower throughput instruments with the broadest test menu in the mobile market provides our customers with the safety and consistent quality results whether they're at urgent care in the clinic or at the hospital.\nLooking ahead, with the assumption that COVID-19 will be in an endemic disease, we believe that the point-of-care molecular respiratory testing market will expand significantly from where it was prior to the pandemic. Given Cepheid's leading test menu and solid base, combined with an advantaged positioning around speed, accuracy and workflow, we believe Cepheid will continue to be there in an endemic.\nSo moving on to the applied markets. Customer activity is largely back to pre-pandemic levels, which we see a robust order rates for both consumables and equipment. In fact, project-oriented activity is accelerating with an improving funding environment and more normalized site access has prompted the resumption of many projects that were put on hold in the throes of the pandemic.\nSo now let's look ahead to our expectations for the first quarter and full year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, we will now include the impact of COVID vaccine and therapeutic-related revenue as part of our base business core revenue growth. This change is driven by our greater confidence in the durability of our COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic revenue as the virus turns endemic. So now for the first quarter and full year 2022, we expect our base business core revenue growth to be in the high single-digit percent range. Additionally, we expect to generate operating profit fall-through of 35% to 40% in the first quarter and for the full year 2022, up from historical and prepandemic rate between 30% and 35%.\nSo now to wrap up, 2021 was another terrific year for Danaher. Our team successfully executed through a challenging environment to deliver outstanding financial performance, all while supporting our customers and directly contributing to the global fight against COVID-19. We're seeing the results of our purpose-driven portfolio transformation in action through faster growth, expanded margins, stronger cash flow and higher recurring revenue. We're a better, stronger company today and there is tremendous runway ahead for us to continue building upon this foundation. With the Danaher Business System as our driving force, our talented team and resilient portfolio of businesses, we believe Danaher will continue generating sustainable long term shareholder value for years to come.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Matt. Thank you.\n\nMatthew E. Gugino\n\nVP of IR and FP&A, Danaher Corporation\n\nThanks, Rainer. That concludes our formal comments. Ashley, we're now ready to take questions.",

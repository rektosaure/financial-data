Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal 2026 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2025, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release.\nUnless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nThanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We delivered an outstanding quarter with Q1 revenue growth of 18%, reflecting the exceptional momentum we have across the company. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is fueling strong growth by helping businesses manage from lead to Kash, and consumers from credit building to wealth building, all in one place. We're becoming the System of Intelligence, Leveraging Data, Data Services, AI, and Human Intelligence, which we will refer to as HI, that everyone depends on to power their prosperity and fuel growth. We're doubling down on the three big bets we shared at Investor Day, which represent our largest future growth opportunities. First, we're delivering Done-for-you experiences with AI and HI, where customers never lift a finger but are always in control. Second, we're excited by putting money at the center.\nLast month at Intuit Connect, our flagship event that reaches the leading accounting firms and mid-market businesses, we brought to life the power of our AI-driven expert platform strategy. We showcased our All-in-one business platform, where a team of AI agents and AI-enabled human experts automate tasks, workflows, business functions, and provide a single pane of glass for customers' KPIs and dashboards, all in one place. We also shared the strong early impact of our AI agents delivering just after four months in market. We marked the one-year anniversary of Intuit Enterprise Suite, our AI-native ERP platform that is disrupting the mid-market. We're proud of the massive advancements we've made, including serving industry-specific needs and building more sophisticated Go-to-market motions, including partnering with accounting firms to add new customers to our platform. We introduced Intuit Intelligence, a Revolutionary System of Intelligence where customers can ask anything.\nFor example, customers can ask questions like, how can I accelerate revenue in the next six months? How can I improve margins? Can you show me how to lower my cost of goods sold? Can you add the performance of my top sales reps to my dashboard? Using customers' data and any external data they wish to upload, Intuit Intelligence delivers accurate, personalized, and actionable answers, and will execute on a customer's behalf or hand off to a human expert. We have thousands of customers in beta and plan to be a GA soon. Finally, we unveiled Intuit Accounting Suite, an AI-native offering that will transform accounting firms' efficiency and effectiveness in managing their clients, firm, and workforce, all to fuel their success. The suite provides client management and collaboration, multi-service delivery, business planning, and team management, all in one place.\nSoon, we'll be launching more advanced capacity planning, productivity, and collaboration capabilities, and over time, firms can integrate to other functions. This is a game changer and significantly deepens our partnership with accountants, fueling faster mid-market penetration. For accountants, it drives tech stack consolidation and efficiency for their firm, and encourages them to migrate clients to QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite. Attendees walked away from Intuit Connect blown away by the amount of innovation in the last year, and a clear message that we are well-positioned to fuel their growth. We're continuing to see momentum with our Virtual Team of AI agents, with 2.8 million customers leveraging these agents to do the work for them. Our Accounting Agent is saving customers up to 12 hours a month, and our Payments Agent helps customers get paid on average five days faster.\nWe recently launched a payroll agent that automates tasks that typically take mid-market businesses two to three hours to complete each month, such as collecting hours directly from employees, spotting anomalies, generating insights, and sending customers a Ready-to-approve draft of their payroll via text. We also launched a Sales Tax Agent, which automatically helps businesses stay compliant. The combination of AI and HI is resonating, with QuickBooks Live customer growth of 61% in Q1. Zooming out, it's now clear we are delivering Done-for-you experiences with AI and HI that will eventually do everything for our customers, powering their growth, saving them time and money, and consolidating their tech stack. We're making strong progress across our All-in-one platform, which includes accelerating money benefits by putting more money at the center of everything we do.\nWe saw total online payment volume for our payments and Bill Pay customers grow 29%, reflecting continued momentum helping our customers get paid faster and better manage their Kash Flow. Turning to mid-market, we continue to make strong progress serving larger and more complex customers, with approximately 40% growth for Online Ecosystem Revenue for QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite in Q1. Mid-market customers are over-digitized, with their data trapped in a number of applications that take too much time and money to manage. Our offerings help businesses achieve their growth goals by automating complex tasks, workflows, and functions, and delivering insights and recommendations, all in one place. Our AI-native ERP platform is disrupting the legacy way of managing their business, and the ROI is clear, with a Forrester study estimating that customers can see nearly 300% return on investment over three years when using Intuit Enterprise Suite.\nThis value proposition is resonating. For example, a large customer with over 200 entities that we signed in Q4 quickly realized the value of our platform and expanded their contract to include an additional 46 entities in Q1. In aggregate, the total number of IES contracts at the end of the quarter was nearly 50% higher than it was at the end of Q4. We're also seeing early momentum with our Accountant Partnership Strategy to bring new customers to Intuit Enterprise Suite. As a result of our partnership with Aprio, a top 25 business advisory and accounting firm, we've already signed several new customers in multiple verticals.\nEarlier this month, we also signed accountant partnerships with Cherry Bekaert, a top 25 advisory tax and assurance firm with clients across 14 industries, Rehmann, a top 40 professional advisory firm that provides accounting, assurance, and other business services to clients across 11 industries, and Hogan Taylor, a top 100 advisory tax, accounting, assurance, and technology firm with clients across seven industries. We have many other opportunities of similar scale in the pipeline. Turning to our consumer platform, our AI-driven expert platform is delivering Done-for-you experiences for consumers from credit building to wealth building to make smarter financial decisions year-round with confidence. We're seeing strong momentum in the areas that matter most, with TurboTax Live revenue growth of 51% in Q1, reflecting continued strength as we concluded the 2024 tax season. Credit Karma had a strong quarter.\nIn fiscal year 2025, we saw a several-point increase in share of member originations for Personal Loans and Credit Cards, and we believe share gains continued in Q1 as members and partners find value in our platform. These strong results, and the introduction of significant innovation with Done-for-you experiences, AI-powered local expertise, and faster access to money, show the power of one consumer platform. Our Done-for-you innovations include CreditSpark, where everyday payments build your Credit Score, as well as several Agentic AI assistants. For example, our Debt Assistant will craft and deliver personalized debt paydown plans. Our Refund Assistant will give a personalized recommendation when the customer receives their tax refund to pay down debt, build an emergency fund, build credit, or invest for the future.\nWith our Tax Assistant, consumers who answer easy, quick questions in Credit Karma year-round can have up to 80% of their taxes ready to go at tax time. We're also expanding our AI-powered local presence, making local expertise more accessible than ever with a larger service footprint, as customers are five times more likely to book up with a pro within 50mi. This local presence will also help us further scale business tax, which grew 3x last year. With our Virtual or In-person filing and consultation options, we're offering the best experience, price, and speed to money. This is data, AI, and HI powering prosperity for consumers and businesses. One of our superpowers is experimenting and learning from our customers and then scaling what works. The results from more than 300 tests we ran in Q1 bolster our confidence in our strategy to win.\nWe're excited about the growth potential for our All-in-one consumer platform, with an untapped opportunity to penetrate $142 billion consumer TAM. We have significant momentum across the company, and are obsessively focused on execution with high velocity, and fueling the success of our customers. Intuit's brightest days are ahead of us. Let me now hand it over to Sandeep.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nThanks, Sasan. We delivered a strong First Quarter of Fiscal 2026 across the company. Our Q1 results include revenue of $3.9 billion, up 18%, GAAP Operating Income of $534 million versus $271 million last year, non-GAAP Operating Income of $1.3 billion versus $953 million last year, GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $1.59 versus $0.70 a year ago, and non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $3.34 versus $2.50 last year, reflecting our overall disciplined approach to managing the business, including continued AI efficiencies. Turning to the business segment, starting with the Global Business Solutions Group, we continue to make progress serving businesses with our All-in-one platform, and delivering Done-for-you experiences with expertise. Global Business Solutions Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, or 20% excluding Mailchimp, while online ecosystem revenue grew 21% in Q1, or 25% excluding Mailchimp.\nThis includes approximately 40% growth for Online Ecosystem Revenue for QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite that serve mid-market. Online Ecosystem Revenue for small businesses and the rest of the base grew a strong 18%. We saw robust growth in both online accounting and online services in Q1. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 25% from higher effective prices, customer growth, and mix shift. Online services revenue grew 17% in Q1, or 26% excluding Mailchimp. This growth was driven by money, which includes payments, capital, and bill pay, as well as payroll. Within money, revenue growth in the quarter reflects payments revenue growth, which was driven by customer growth, an increase in total payment volume per customer, and higher effective pricing, as well as QuickBooks Capital revenue growth.\nTotal online payments volume, including Bill Pay, grew 29% in Q1, reflecting our continued momentum in payments and adoption of our Bill Pay offering. Online payment volume growth, excluding Bill Pay, was 18%, relatively consistent with the range we've seen over the last several quarters. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects mix shift, customer growth, and higher effective prices. Within Mailchimp, revenue was down slightly versus a year ago, in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to target double-digit growth for Mailchimp exiting fiscal 2026. We are seeing strong results from our mid-market sales team within Mailchimp, with several recent larger customer wins, as well as increasing retention rates in the mid-market segment. We are continuing to invest more in go-to-market for these higher-value customers, and beginning to increase broader go-to-market spend to drive acquisition of smaller customers.\nTurning to desktop, Desktop Ecosystem Revenue grew 6% in Q1, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low double digits in Q1. We expect Desktop Ecosystem Revenue to grow low single digits in fiscal 2026. Turning to our consumer platform, we are pleased with our strong momentum. Q1 revenue grew 21%, driven by Credit Karma revenue, which grew 27%, TurboTax revenue grew 6%, and ProTax revenue grew 15%. Within Credit Karma, revenue growth reflects continued momentum with our members and partners. On a product basis, personal loans accounted for 13 points of growth, credit cards accounted for 10 points, and auto insurance for 3 points. Looking ahead, the results from more than 300 Go-to-market and product experience tests run during Q1 bolster our confidence in our strategy to win this upcoming tax season.\nWe are excited about the opportunity ahead for our All-in-one consumer platform powered by AI, human intelligence, and data to empower customers to take year-round control of their finances, from credit building to wealth building, while driving monetization for Intuit. Shifting to a Balance Sheet and capital allocation, our financial principles guide our decisions that remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with $3.7 billion in Kash and investments and $6.1 billion in debt on our Balance Sheet. We repurchased $851 million of stock during the Q1. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share payable on 16 January 2026. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Moving on to guidance, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2026 guidance.\nThis includes total company revenue of $20.997 billion to 21.186 billion, growth of 12% to 13. Our guidance includes Global Business Solutions Group revenue growth of 14% to 15, of 15.5% to 16.5 revenue growth, excluding Mailchimp. Our guidance also includes overall Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 9, including TurboTax growth of 8%, Credit Karma growth of 10% to 13, and ProTax growth of 2% to 3. gaap-Diluted Earnings Per Share of $15.49 to 15.69, growth of 13% to 15, and non-gaap-Diluted Earnings Per Share of $22.98 to 23.18, growth of 14% to 15. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2026. Our guidance for the Q2 of fiscal 2026 includes total company revenue growth of 14% to 15, GAAP earnings per share of $1.76 to 1.81, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.63 to 3.68.\nYou can find our full fiscal 2026 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our Fact sheet. Before I turn it over to Sasan, I want to share that Kim Watkins had made the decision to leave Intuit to pursue a new opportunity outside the company, and this will be her last earnings call. I want to take a moment to thank her for her tremendous contributions and partnership over the years. She's built a strong, highly respected investor relations team, and has strengthened our relationships with the investment community in meaningful ways. Geoff Koegler, who has been a key part of the team, will step in as acting head of IR. We're deeply grateful for all that Kim has done, and wish her the very best in the next chapter. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nGreat. Thank you, Sandeep. We are well on our way to becoming the System of Intelligence enabling financial success for consumers, businesses, and accountants. Given our early bets on AI, our low penetration of our large $300 billion TAM, the significant investments we've made in the last decade, and our momentum, we are well positioned to power the prosperity of our customers and win in the era of AI. Let's now open it up to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press Star two. Please limit yourself to one question. We'd like to get to as many people as we can. Thank you. We'll take our 1st question from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nYeah, thanks very much for taking the question, guys, and congrats on a nice start to the year. Kim, congrats on your next venture. Sasan, the question for you, a lot of questions from clients this week on the OpenAI arrangement and deal you announced. Can you just give us a little bit more color on if there's any sort of Revenue Share as part of this deal? I think there's also some questions about sort of how data, obviously, you guys have always been very protective of customer data. How does that stay with Intuit as people are now using Intuit solutions within OpenAI? Just give us maybe a little bit more color on those aspects of the partnership. Thanks.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah, thank you for your question. First of all, I'll just start by saying it's an absolutely Game-Changing partnership. Everything starts with people and the relationships to make any long-term partnership work. The relationship with OpenAI is really magnificent. With that said, the way to think about this before I get to the specifics of your question is this is a huge opportunity for us to accelerate new customer growth. You have 800 million weekly active users that are engaging within the platform, and we have an opportunity to power their prosperity. Now, to answer your question, I'll just break it very quickly into three buckets: Experience, Data and Models, and Economics.\nOn the experience front, what happens today is when customers are asking questions about getting access to financial products like cards, loans, building their credit score, how do I grow my business, they get good, yet generic answers. That will change tomorrow. The way it's going to change is that our Intuit apps will be deeply integrated within ChatGPT, which means tomorrow you get the power of all of the Intuit platform and apps within ChatGPT. The experience, which I can get into a lot more detail if you all wish, will be Game-Changing because we'll know who you are, and we will be able to leverage the power of our data and all of our models to be able to deliver experiences that are very personalized to you, just like the experiences you get when you're within an Intuit app today.\nThe experience will be absolutely Game-Changing for consumers and businesses and truly power their actions, their insights within ChatGPT. The second on data and models, nothing changes from what we do today. Customers will be engaging within the Intuit app. They'll be within the Intuit four walls. We will continue to train our Intuit Large Language Models with the customer's data. Our data privacy, security, and privacy principles are unchanged. That's very important because one of the Game-Changing elements that OpenAI is excited about is the fact that customers will be able to get accurate, secure answers that are personalized all within ChatGPT. On the data and models, nothing is unchanged from the way we operate today. On the economics, it is as the economics are today. There's no Revenue Share.\nThe economics that we enjoy today when we directly work with customers, we will enjoy tomorrow. I'll just end with we're really excited about the partnership by having access and working side by side with the OpenAI team to have access to their frontier models. As you know, our Intuit Large Language Models are what gets trained by the customer's data. It does not leave our four walls. It also has the agency and authority to deliver the experiences and use other models. We're excited about acceleration of the use of some of their models that our LLMs will put in place. I think those would be the headlines, Kirk, that I would share.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's great. Thanks very much. Congrats on the quarter.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYep, very welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you. Congrats again and a great start to this year. I wanted to dig into the mid-market, Sasan, which is one of your drivers for the aspirational goal to accelerate growth. First on the IES side, it's been a year and you had 250 sales rep. How has the productivity been going on? Any plan to add more headcounts to this mid-market? Also, the partnership you announced, when should we start seeing that translate to revenue?\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Siti. I'll break it down into three things: Awareness, our Platform Innovation, and Accountants. First and foremost, we're just starting to press on the gas with awareness in terms of showing up to conferences. We were just at the FACE conference in New York. We were everywhere to raise awareness because as much success as we've had, very few people still know about Intuit Enterprise Suite and what a disruptive AI-driven and AI-native ERP platform that it is. We're doing a lot around awareness. One element is conferences, webinars to really get the word out there. The second is the platform innovation is just accelerating and is having a dramatic impact with customers now across many verticals starting to refer us to customers like them, whether it's Wealth Management, whether it's dentists, whether it's construction.\nThe impact from our innovation and now beginning to customize and launch vertical-specific KPIs and dashboards is incredibly important, and incredibly powerful. More than ever, we win on experience, price, and total cost of ownership. The third is around accountants. We're just getting that Flywheel going. In fact, we redirected a number of our Internal Sales folks above and beyond the 250 that you refer to, which I'll get to in a moment, that really are providing coverage account across our large accounting firms. What you should look at is these are really best to come. We expect acceleration from these large partnerships that we've announced, and many that are in the works, to contribute to the back half of the year and into next year.\nWe're actually not counting on that, but it's an important point to put out there, which is this is where the network effect comes in because we had the largest firms at Intuit Connect. I personally have been meeting with these large firms, and they're blown away by our innovation and how they can use our platform to be able to drive accelerated growth. Our productivity is significantly improving when we look at the last several quarters, and we would expect to start adding more headcounts in the coming quarters. Those would be the way I would break down the answer to your question. We're really excited and bullish about what's possible.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks so much, and my congrats. Kim, congrats on a fantastic run. It's been great, and look forward to your next chapter. Maybe for you, can you talk us through any of the learnings that came out of this extension season on tax and how those might apply to the season ahead? Maybe for Sandeep, we saw the announcements around the TurboTax office footprint expanding, which seems to clearly reflect leaning in on local search. How are you thinking about the investments necessary to sustain 15% to 20 assisted growth this year? How do they compare to last year? Thanks so much.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nI'll get us started, and then I'll let Sandeep take over on your question. First of all, Brad, I've been with the company 20+ years. I've never been more bullish than the season we're about to step into. The reason is all of the innovation across the platform. We ran, as we talked about earlier, 300 significant experiments from platform innovation to Go-to-market tests, inclusive of a lot of what we're doing to show up locally, which is the question you asked a moment ago for Sandeep. Just across what's possible for Consumer tax and Business tax, we are incredibly bullish. The bullishness comes from really three fronts. One, a lot of the work that we've done around data and AI that makes us far simpler and easier for folks to get their taxes done and get early access to their money.\nTwo, the innovation End-to-end to deliver a great experience at a great price for those that use the prior-year assisted method, from how we're leveraging data and AI Concierge to greet customers, to get them immediately connected to a Live Expert where most of the work is done already by the time they get to the expert, to doing a lot of the work for the expert where the expert really becomes sort of a concierge that you would walk up to at a Four Seasons. That's really about the service that they provide, how they make you feel, while we ultimately deliver excellent service. The power of going from 400 locations that we showed up to 600, and then the 20 stores that we talked about with one flagship store that's going to be in New York, is about showing up locally.\nIt's also about shaping the market around the fact that we truly have AI plus HI. Once the one opens up in New York, I'd encourage you all to go into it because I think you'll want to sit there and have some coffee. It's tech-forward, it's friendly, it's warm, and by the way, money in your pocket quickly. I'll end with where I started before Sandeep takes over, which is I have not been this bullish going into a tax season given the amazing work of the team.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nHey, Brad, it's Sandeep. Local is key to winning in assistance. We have shared that we see that customers convert five times better when there's a local expert within a 50mi radius of their location. We are planning 600 expert locations, up from 400 last year. As Sasan mentioned, a unique flagship store in New York City. This is all part of our strategy of ensuring that we are showing up in key high-density areas and covering a majority of the tax filing population in the United States. This showing up local, we know, really extends the trust people have in the brand. It drives adoption. Our tests also show that 39% of full-service customers prefer zero-touch approach to engagement. It's really more about driving that trust.\nIn terms of our investments, our approach to showing up local is truly asset-light and is scalable without long-term commitments. The rent, the OpEx costs here are relatively small, and they're all included in part in our guidance that we gave earlier today.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you both.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nVery welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Congratulations on a really strong start to the fiscal year. I'll also make my congratulations to Kim Watkins. Truly, you have been a great partner to the financial community at Intuit. Congratulations and best of luck on the new endeavors. You guys had a really solid quarter. We saw it in the global business solutions. There's a lot of concern out there about the health of the overall US consumer. I know you guys get a lot of signal. Can you help us walk through if any of your signal turned or if this was more so Intuit just doing very well in what could be a shaky environment? Help us get a little bit more confidence about the durability of these types of results throughout the year.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah, Keith, thank you for that question. I'll actually tag team this with Sandeep. I would say two things. One, what we see in our data across 100 million consumers and 10 million+ businesses that we serve is stability. To provide more specifics, profits and Kash Flows are stable and up. One of the things Sandeep and I and the team looked a lot at is payroll hours worked. Payroll hours worked are actually up. As you can imagine, we're not concentrated in any particular industry, so we see a lot of industries. If you double-click, you see things like IT services, construction, manufacturing that are actually up quite nicely compared to the year prior. You see places like Real Estate and lending that are down compared to the prior year. Not significantly, but down.\nIt's industry-specific, but when you look at the aggregate of what we serve, they're quite successful. That's from what we see in the data. I think the second thing that I'll just end with is a lot of it is also our platform and really what the platform is doing to fuel the success of businesses of all types. If you remember, one of the things that we shared at Investor Day was that businesses that are on our platform are nearly 20 points more successful in terms of how they thrive their profits versus those that are not on our platform. Our platform is having a real impact on the livelihood of businesses.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nHey, Keith, let me build a little bit on Sasan's point. One thing, as you know, of course, we keep a keen eye on the macro environment, but what also gives us confidence, in addition to the stability that we're seeing in the broader environment, is the resilience of the Intuit business. Our offerings are not just nice to have; they are a must-have. In the 40 years that we've been around, we've historically seen that when the economy's tougher, our products become more critical. Just also add on and highlight the stats from within our platform, you saw that our charge volume was up 29% with Bill Pay, up 18% excluding Bill Pay. On our credit comments side, we continue to see strong engagement with our partners.\nBoth the macro data within the platform and also just how the business performing continues to give us confidence in the stability and the opportunity that lays ahead.\n\nKeith Weiss\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Sandeep. Thanks so much, guys.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Mark Murphy of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you so much. Congrats on the great results, and also to Kim in your future endeavors. Sasan, the Credit Karma market share gains of several points in loan originations and credit card issuance are pretty staggering because the size of those markets is just utterly vast. Could you speak to whether you see ongoing runway to continue that type of motion where you're chipping away a couple few points of share every year, maybe by leveraging the TurboTax customer base and that data, maybe by leveraging QuickBooks? The Kash Flow data has to be of interest to lenders. At the end of the day, did you think you could create a more holistic financial health score than the traditional providers have?\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah, Mark, thank you for your question. I actually love the nature of your question. I would lead with the following. I think now you're seeing the TurboTax Credit Karma platform coming together at work. The thing that I would just also add to everything that you just shared around the market share increases is that Credit Karma contributed to an entire point of growth in TurboTax last season, and that's just over time only going to get larger. It's because of what we are doing customer back to help them with problems like getting access to financial products that are right for them, helping them with how to manage their debt, and with our debt assistant actually helping them what they should pay down 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, what they should do with their refund, and just being in their life on an ongoing basis.\nThat's how you take market share. The 1st point I would make. The 2nd point, which is a more specific point, is this is data, AI, and all of our Credit Models at work. As you all know, one element of our AI capabilities is Lightbox, where financial institutions have put their Credit Models, their proprietary Credit Models, as part of Lightbox, and we are able to leverage their Credit Models to be able to deliver personalized experiences. That's a Game Changer. Now we have more and more financial institutions that are now putting their Credit Models as part of Lightbox. They don't do that with anybody else. They trust Intuit. It helps drive growth for them, and it delivers personalized experiences for us. I'll end with sort of the essence of the question that you asked. We're just getting started.\nWe have runway, and we're just getting started in terms of what's possible to do as a platform. Even access to money and how we can monetize money offerings is yet to come. We're excited about what's possible.\n\nMark Murphy\n\nExecutive Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Daniel Jester of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nDaniel Jester\n\nUS Software Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question, and also pass along my congrats to Kim. Best of luck. On Mailchimp, appreciate the additional color on the progress that has been made there, specifically in the middle market. As we think about the Re-acceleration to Double Digits by year-end, is that something that could be accomplished solely through middle market improvement, or does this have to broaden out and also include some of the smaller customers coming back to the fold as well? Thank you.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nThank you.\nHey, Daniel. On Mailchimp, we've taken a number of strategic steps that I feel really confident about. As you mentioned, we've scaled the mid-market sales team to build upon the momentum we have in that segment. We've improved the product experience and the onboarding flow across all customer segments. Now we're scaling up the Go-to-market efforts. Those efforts, in addition to adding to the mid-market sales team, are dialing up the marketing on the platform, which we had dialed down while we were working on the product fix. In terms of getting to Double Digit, it takes a mix of both customers across the smaller customers as well as the mid-market customers. We have good momentum, and it's really going to be around early calendar year and springtime that we'll have a solid read on the Mailchimp progress.\n\nDaniel Jester\n\nUS Software Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nOkay, thank you very much.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nAbsolutely.\nWelcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, and I apologize for the background noise. I guess maybe can you speak to some of the margin leverage and efficiencies that we're seeing from deploying some increasing AI leverage, and just any other efficiencies that you're seeing that are durable given continued outperformance and margins that we're seeing now for, I think, like the 3rd or 4th straight quarter? Anything you can add there would be super helpful.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nHey, Alex. We continue to feel really super confident about the ability as an organization to continue to scale margin. That comes not just from efficiency, but just the way we run the business, leaning on economies of scale, being disciplined about when, how, and where we are allocating our capital to maximize the ROI on it, and of course, complementing our workforce with AI technology to truly unleash their productivity. Areas that we continue to see strong improvement are across our Technology Organization using AI to improve the productivity of the Salesforce, our time to market with how we are rolling out code, across our customer success organization, as you know, a lot of that work is Rules-based, super applicable for the AI to help complement those areas.\nAcross our entire organization, whether it's in finance, whether it's in Legal, HR, you name it, using AI to unleash the productivity of our employee base. What you should continue to hold us accountable to is the discipline that we have demonstrated over the past multiple years. That same discipline continues. It's not just about the AI efficiencies, but it's all about the learning, the culture of seeing what worked and where we lean in. Marketing, we did marketing last year. There are many tests that worked, and we scaled them. There are other things that didn't work, and we shut them off. That's the discipline you should all continue to hold us accountable to.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nExcellent. I just want to give a big shout-out to Kim. It's been a true pleasure working with you, and can't wait to see where your next adventure takes you. Thank you so much.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nThank you, Alex.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHard to follow Alex Zukin, but I'm going to try my best. I'd like to congrats to Kim, but also to Jeff incoming. He's been waiting for a while, so well-deserved promotion. The question for you, Sasan, is the Delta in Growth Rates between accounting, which certainly is very, very strong, and online services. It's a little bit of a wider delta than what I would think. Maybe some of it has to do with Mailchimp in there. I remember the good old days Intuit online services would typically grow faster than accounting because of the payroll, payment, that sort of thing. Is there a break in the pattern that explains this performance and that since you're getting going with IES, maybe there's a bit of a heavy accounting finance emphasis, and maybe these services will follow suit in the future?\nIf you can just help me understand the cycle of what you're going through, that would be great. Since it's my last Intuit call, I wish you many successes in your journeys ahead. Thank you.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nHey, Kash. Just let me take this one. We continue to see tremendous opportunity across money and payroll offerings on our platform. It's a key part of our addressable market, and it's a key part of the $90 billion addressable market that we have on mid-market as well. The deceleration that you are referring to is really due to pricing. That was a contribution in the last four quarters, and now we are lapping that across both payments and payroll. We continue to see strong momentum in our core business. I would point you to the charge volumes, 18% overall, 29% bill pay, and we're seeing improved adoption of services across both small and mid-sized businesses. As you pointed out, with some of these things, it takes a while for those volumes to ramp up as they're shifting their service providers.\nFurthermore, the innovation that we're rolling out, whether it's our agents or whether it's the new QuickBooks user interface, they provide us more opportunities to build upon the strength we have in platform adoption and services over time. I will not read too much into that deceleration. We are quite excited about the opportunity that lays ahead.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nKash, we wish you an amazing retirement.\n\nKash Rangan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much. Much appreciated. Here's to the growth ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks. Following, Kash is always an honor. Kim, all the best for you as well. Quick question from me was on Credit Karma. You talked about Credit Card Loan as driving it, auto insurance a little bit. How do you think about it in terms of the health of the consumer, Sasan? You talked a little bit about it earlier, but Credit Karma has been kind of performing a lot better than you guided for several quarters now. How confident are you about what you're seeing there? Thank you.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah. Let me start with one element, I'll tag team this with Sandeep. Actually, this is really important to leverage this opportunity for everyone to make really a broader point. Credit Karma is working because of all the innovation that we've done, customer back, and the integration with TurboTax.\nIf you really think about the 45 million monthly active users, the fact that they engage more than five times a month, and the fact that we now can help them with so many things more compared to when we first bought Credit Karma, when the member has the opportunity to understand what to do with their debt, to get access to financial products like Credit Cards, Personal Loans, Insurance, and where they can get their taxes done, get help with what they can do with their money, get early access to that money, that customer then engages more and engages more because of the trusted benefits, the insights that they're getting, and also the fact that things are personalized and we're doing it for them. That is what helps us then be able to accelerate taking market share that Sandeep and I talked about earlier.\nThat's a really important element to think about. It's not just about the health of the consumer. It's actually about what we are now doing for the consumer that is so far more advantageous for the consumer versus where we were just even a year ago to two years ago. From just a Health perspective, credit scores and balances are generally stable. Credit scores over the last several years for the near Prime customers and Subprime customers have gone down 10+ points, but they've sort of stabilized. Credit balances and Credit Card balances, although higher for Gen Z by 20% to 30 now versus a couple of years ago, have generally stabilized. That's what we see from a consumer health perspective, but I think the most important is the innovation that I talked about earlier.\nLet me just also invite Sandeep to add a few thoughts.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nThe only thing in addition I would double down on is for the innovation that we're driving across the platform. It is that innovation that's helping our partners see better ROI of their spend on our platform, which is why we continue to take share. That's a tailwind into the business driven by innovation. Also, from a consumer point of view, if the economy does get to a place where the consumer is under pressure, they'll be looking to a trusted platform to understand where they can consolidate debt on personal loans. Keep in mind, some of these near prime customers, if they apply for a credit card where they get dinged, they could become subprime. This is where our innovation, such as Lightbox, gives the customer the utmost confidence of their art of getting approved.\nThese are all innovations that are key to driving confidence and allowing us to continue to take share regardless of the macro environment.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay. Very clear. Thank you. Well done.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Michael Turin of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, great. Thanks so much. Appreciate you taking the questions. Just a quick two-parter on the numbers, if I may. In terms of the QBO strength, you mentioned price is a leading factor there. Just any commentary you can add on how we should think about the shape of pricing contribution on that line throughout the rest of the fiscal year. On margin, fiscal Q1 was very strong. Q2 was a touch lower than we were maybe modeling. Can you just also speak to expense timing and whether there are marketing-specific impacts to consider between those quarters as we're updating our forecast? Thank you.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nYeah, absolutely. Hey, Michael, Sandeep, on the QBO side, we continue to see our innovation resonate with the customer. Even after we did the price changes and the lineup innovation this last July, we saw that our customer attrition again came in below our expectations, just highlighting how the pricing power we have, as well as how well the innovation truly is resonating with our customers. When we see some of this innovation, such as 45% of our customers telling us that they're saving up to 12 hours a month, that's a meaningful increase in their productivity. You're getting paid five days faster. That's a meaningful increase to the networking capital. I would highlight these as areas where we're driving innovation and it's resonating. Pricing contribution is relatively consistent throughout the Q4.\nThe other thing I'd point out on QBO is the momentum we have as a point with the 40% revenue growth in IES as well as in QBO Advanced, that is a contributor to the Accounting Line on the Online Ecosystem. The second part of your question was around margin. A couple of things I would point out there. If you look across the 1st half, we are actually ahead of what the street expectations were on our margin. What we saw is for the full year, and I continue to feel really confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments for the full year. There's always things any one quarter, for example, we learned from our consumer marketing this past year that allowed us to really hone in the timing of the spend between Q1 and Q2 to really maximize that ROI.\nIt's really our continued discipline and spend management, making sure we're maximizing the money that we're driving with our spend, that drove some of that shift. Look across the 1st half, and you'll see that we are nicely ahead of consensus on both revenue, as well as EBIT.\n\nMichael Turrin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Software Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nAppreciate all the details there. Thank you.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Steve Enders of Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Enders\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nOkay, great. Thanks for taking the question here, and congrats to Kim as well. I guess I want to ask on the In-person, I guess, TurboTax experience that you're rolling out here. I guess what's the, I guess, hope or what's the kind of view of maybe how that changes, I guess, the types of customers or could change the dynamics going through tax season here?\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah, thanks for your question. A couple of things I would say. This is really the strategy, which is very consistent with what we've been talking about for several years, is to show up where the eyeballs are. The notion of being in 600 locations/addresses and 20 stores, one of them being a flagship in New York, is actually to be seen when you do search, whether it's through an AI app, Google, or any other platform, that we show up locally. That's a huge part of the strategy in terms of the type of customers, the same customers that we serve today. This is about reach, and it's about access.\nWhat we have found is when we engage a customer and a customer finds us, and we find the customer, and we are where the customer is, we win hands down based on experience, price, and then access to money. This is just based on our incredible progress last year, the incredible results last year. What you're seeing is we're just doubling down on winning in the assisted segment, and this is one key how to do just that.\n\nSteve Enders\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nPerfect, thanks for the question.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYep, you're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nBrent Thill",
    "content2": "Tech Sector Leader and Software/Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you. This is Brent Thill. Just kind of one question. One of the advantages of Intuit's platform is the ability to consolidate the dozens of apps for small businesses. I just wanted to see if you could talk about the progress there, and then maybe compare between the small businesses versus the mid-market, how you're reaching the potential. Thank you.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah, thank you for your question. It is really the essence of why we are winning. When you look at smaller businesses, they could have between three to 10 apps. When you look at larger businesses, they can have between 25 to 30 apps. There's a real issue with that now more than ever, where customers are spending more time trying to figure out what's going on in their business across all of these apps. They're actually spending more money than they did before, and they're getting less value because they may have fallen in love with three, four apps, but then when they zoom out, they don't know what's going on in their business. That's really been our strategy of a platform that helps customers from lead to Kash, but also a platform that does everything for customers.\nThis is the power of data, AI, and HI, and ultimately being able to do everything for our customers. The acceleration that we are seeing across the board, particularly in mid-market, and when you look at the results that we just talked about, which is online growing 20%, you've got mid-market growing at 40%. This is actually more and more customers, particularly the larger ones, that see the value of having everything in one place. One, because we can do the work for them, they get a better experience. Two, they may pay us more, and more than likely they actually do, but they're actually spending a lot less. That's a game changer for customers.\nI think we're just, based on all of our capabilities at the beginning of that cycle, it's another reason why you are seeing an accelerated set of partnership announcements with accountants, because they actually see not only us being able to partner with them to help digitize their firm through the Intuit Accounting Suite, which is a Revolutionary platform we've launched, but also what we can do together to really digitize the clients that they serve, because when clients use a lot of apps, it drives accountants crazy. This really is where the network effect comes in.\nThank you very much.\nYep, you're very welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nBrad Sills\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. I'll echo the congratulations to Kim on your next move. So many great agents in QuickBooks: there's Accounting Agent, Payments, Customer, Finance. The list just keeps going. Have you seen anyone in particular or any use cases that you're seeing traction? What would customers say as to kind of the ROI, some of the savings here? Are there any that have surprised you, that, gosh, these are actually more effective than we thought and driving more value? What would that say about your kind of confidence in your ability to monetize these? Obviously, now it's through premium mix, but eventually through separate SKUs. Thank you.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah, thank you for the question. I actually love the nature of the question. Let me start with just a zoom out first, then I'll answer your specific question. The biggest thing that we continue to learn from customers is, I need help for you to do it for me and with me. Because if you think about businesses of any size, unless they're an enterprise, they do not have all the resources that come with an Enterprise to do Data Analytics, to help. They don't have a large marketing team sitting around, a large finance team sitting around, a large data analytics team sitting around. They need help in terms of how to run their business.\nThat's where the power of our platform comes in, which is an assistant that is right by their side, that can help them with making decisions, can do the work for them, can do the work with them. By the way, when technology runs out of capacity, which it always will, that's where our human intelligence comes into play. Fundamentally, customer back, this is really, really important for customers, which is, help me get things done. It's, by the way, why they are always seeking for advice in these AI apps. To get more specific, I'll just remind us, with all of the AI agents, we've been in market for about four months, which means there is a lot more improvements, enhancements, and adoption. What we've seen in four months is, one, the discovery and repeat engagement since we've launched is over 80%.\nThe two areas that are having the largest traction are the payments AI agent and it's the Accounting AI Agent. That's why we've cited the stats where, with the use of Accounting Agents, folks are saving 12 hours a month, which is significant. It's not just the time savings, it's actually the accuracy and the insights that they get. The second is the customers that are getting paid five days earlier. Four months in market, that's actually quite remarkable because we're learning literally every day in terms of how to make these more effective. Customers don't care about AI agents. They care about, get the work done for me. That's really where I think the best is yet to come.\n\nKim Watkins\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Intuit\n\nVery exciting. Thank you, Sasan.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYep, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Taylor McGinnis of UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nTaylor McGinnis\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. Kim, appreciate all the help these last couple of years, and wishing you all the best. I'd like to unpack the strength of the Q2 revenue guide. With the later start to the tax season this year and also a tougher credit comp, I think it would be helpful if you could just offer some additional color on the drivers of growth. Are there any segments where you're expecting growth to be more durable with the levels that we saw in Q1 or higher than implied in the full year guide? Thanks so much.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nHey, Taylor. In terms of the Q2 guide, it's a continuation of us continuing to execute on our strategy. The momentum that we saw in fiscal 2025 paired into fiscal 2026, you saw that Q1 results, and you're seeing this in our Q2 guidance. We expect the momentum to continue with strength in GBSG online. We continue to expect strength in mid-market, continue to expect a CK offering to resonate with both partners and consumers. On the TurboTax side, we're expecting, similar to last several years, that the IRS opens up towards the end of January. That's our expectation going in. A couple of things that I would point out: we do expect desktop to start decelerating in the 2nd half as we go from the 6% we saw in Q1. Likely, we'll be near the mid-single digits for Q2, but then decelerate in the 2nd half.\nOn a CK, in the 2nd half of the fiscal year, the comps do get harder as we lap the prior year strong performance. In the areas that are the key growth vectors for the company, you should expect us to continue to execute and continue to build upon the momentum.\n\nTaylor McGinnis\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you guys so much.\n\nSandeep Aujla\n\nCFO, Intuit\n\nSo, Taylor.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Arjun Bhatia of William Blair & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nArjun Bhatia\n\nCo-Group Head of Technology, Media, and Communications, William Blair & Company\n\nPerfect. Thank you so much. Sasan, if I can just go back to the OpenAI partnership for a second. I know this is just about to come Live, but I'm curious if you would just venture to take a guess on when you think customers would use Intuit apps inside ChatGPT versus when they would use kind of core or use Intuit within your own applications and use your Intuit Intelligence capabilities, which also have sort of Natural Language answers. I'm wondering if, in your perspective, that makes a difference at all, or if your goal is kind of just to drive increased engagement, and maybe that drives more attach of services, agentic adoption, and all the other good things that come with increased usage.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYeah, thank you for your question. You know, I'll start by saying companies that win will be companies that have platforms and that they are where the eyeballs are. That's really what we're doing with this partnership with ChatGPT. It's really, for us, it doesn't matter whether a customer comes directly to using our platform or we are where they are within an AI app, in this case, ChatGPT. Because, as I mentioned earlier, one, they get personalized experiences right within ChatGPT. Two, they're in using our apps, and so the accuracy, safety, privacy is all protected. It's unchanged. We get to enjoy the economics that we enjoy today. What we care about is actually being where the customer is and making it easy for the customer to have the experiences that they need to have.\nIn terms of, you know, only time will tell, we're going to, we being OpenAI and Intuit, absolutely nail this experience. It's going to be an amazing experience. Only time will tell relative to how much customers are, you know, at the end of the day, they're using an Intuit app. Whether they're using it within ChatGPT or they're directly coming to us, it really doesn't matter. I think only time will tell what the customer behaviors are. The good news is we're positioned for wherever the customers are, and that's what's exciting about this partnership.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nPerfect. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\n\nSasan Goodarzi\n\nCEO, Intuit\n\nYep, you're very welcome. All right, I think that's all of the questions. Hey, before we end, I also want to thank Kim. She has been an amazing partner for all of us internally, and she's made us better. We are so fortunate to have had the opportunity, Kim, to work with you. The best of luck in your next chapter. You're going to miss all of our amazing earnings call going forward, but we'll see you on the other side. For everybody that joined, thank you for your time. We'll talk to you next quarter. Bye, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call."

We look forward to unpacking why intuit continues to have a very bright future with the best years, yet to come at our Investor Day next month.\n\nWith that let's open it up to your questions.\n\nCertainly thank you Mr. Xie, ladies and gentlemen at this time, if you would like to ask a question. Please press Star then the number one on your telephone if you would like to withdraw your question. Please press star to please limit yourself to one question as we'd like to get to as many people as we can we will go first this afternoon to city panic Rohit at Mizzou Ho.\n\nThank you.\n\n.\n\nThat's a great end to fiscal 'twenty 5 million I don't know focus on the small business.\n\nbusiness group.\n\nThe 18% growth ex smells him, but as you look at fiscal 'twenty six what are the areas you are more excited about and what have you learned.\n\nFiscal 'twenty, five education, and if I could.\n\nAdd one more to this there is concern about this lead generation with the slowdown in issue of search or would love to hear your views in terms of what you are seeing.\n\nAnd your Quickbooks business.\n\nYes sure. Thank you for the question.\n\nFirst of all there's three things I would point out that gives us confidence as we for the business group as we head into the.\n\nThe fiscal year that were at one .\n\nThe customer growth that we saw in U S. of 8% the customer growth that we saw in mid market of 23% is quite strong and we're excited about what that will mean moving forward.\n\nAs we address some of the headwinds that you heard sandeep talk about around melanoma International's. So thats one area that we're very excited about I would say the second is just the.\n\nThe fact that we now have an all in one platform. We have all the pieces in really in one place to help a customer from lead the cash.\n\nAnd when you look at the fact that we just launched our.\n\nNew business feeds with a virtual team of AI agents and AI enabled human agents and.\n\nThe fact that we have several million customers that are already engaging that gives us a lot of confidence as we look ahead durably relative to the growth that we can drive particularly penetration.\n\nServices.\n\nAnd the third is mid market I mean, when you look at mid market Holistically.\n\n40% growth in context of the overall, 20% growth that we had in online for the year.\n\nAnd the acceleration that we have with our product launches and our go to market capability that gives us not only confidence for 'twenty, six but really beyond durably in terms of what's what's possible.\n\nSo that's on.\n\nThe business group upfront in terms of AI search it actually plays into our favor and let me just share a couple of stats one and this is across by the way.\n\nOur platform not just black box, our traffic is actually up quite significantly this year and AI search is 1% of our overall traffic.\n\nAnd in the top 25% brands actually have a tenex visibility NII search so which is when you look at brands like Quickbooks and credit Karma and .\n\nTurbotax, a melt shop, it actually plays into our favor.\n\nIn the last couple of things I would say is credit Karma is not at all reliant on at all because.\n\nWe have 100 million folks that are in it.\n\nSo less than 1% is Seo search so thats not really impact that at all and last but not least the thing and final thought I would leave you with is the essence of us being an AI driven expert platform company at an AI company, we've actually been all over this in terms of thinking through.\n\nHow we think about tagging our content, how we show up so that not only do we show up in the AI apps, but over time when it becomes a bigger part of our search today, it's only 1% that we play a far bigger role and maybe highlight let me make one last point.\n\nThe majority of our growth comes from our recommendation and search overall is actually less than sort of .\n\n15% of our overall portfolio as a whole so I just wanted to make sure that that point landed as well.\n\nThank you thanks for that color.\n\nYep. Thank you said it.\n\nThank you. We'll go next now to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.\n\nExcellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really strong.\n\nOverall, FY 'twenty five a lot of the pieces coming together.\n\nLooking forward into FY 'twenty six.\n\nOne question, but in two parts.\n\nOn one side of equation you guys released a lot of really interesting functionality with new agents a couple of weeks back what should our expectations be for monetization around those agents is it still too early or what should the timeframe, we should be thinking about those ramping up into into into the revenue base and then on the other side of the equation.\n\nNeil Trent .\n\ndropped by 25 that was the one that part of the equation, but you guys sound really confident we're going to come back to double digit growth any inklings you could give us on what's driving that confidence in getting that business back to a double digit growth rates. So it's no longer a drag on the overall GBS revenues anymore.\n\nYes, Keith.\n\nSo let me let me take your.\n\nOur first question, which is just around our launch of our all in one platform with the virtual team of AI agent.\n\nAnd human experts.\n\nA couple of things I would say, we have high expectations around monetization in the future. We have not assumed anything really in our guidance for this year.\n\nSo that's the first and foremost second.\n\nIt's actually thus far above our expectations in terms of engagement.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we just launched this in July and we have a couple of million customers that have been engaging with the AI agents, which is actually quite significant after one month of launch and the repeat engagement. The discovery of our of our App is actually above our expectations. What we're really focused on right now.\n\nIt's just making the experience and.\n\nThe adoption of our services hub and we are giving our teams time to make that home because that's the first step as you want engagement and repeat engagement and discovery, which is above our expectations. The second is monetization. So we think it's going to play a very big role because when you look at the billions of dollars that are actually spend by our customers on our platform.\n\nOn services that are not ours, we are quite confident that we can consolidate not only the tech stack, but the tech spend which is where the monetization comes in so I would have expectations for.\n\nThe future not this year, we didn't count on it in our guidance just to be prudent at the second thing is you're absolutely right is a drag on our growth and we expect to.\n\nthis fiscal year fourth quarter and double digits and what you should expect by the way is a slow ramp throughout the year and.\n\nAnd there are two things that we see today that give.\n\nUS confidence one is our sales playbook and the number of sales folks that we've added is starting to really pay off going after larger customers mid market and that's a that will be a big driver of growth in the future to the product improvements that we've already made but a lot more that are coming we're actually seeing a green shoots we have the highest.\n\nCustomer satisfaction that we've had.\n\nSince we've acquired the business based on the launches that we've had so those things are green shoots that give us confidence that as we look into our trajectory that we would exit double digits in the fourth quarter.\n\nAwesome. Thank you guys.\n\nYes, Thank you Heath.\n\nThank you and ladies and gentlemen, just a quick reminder against Star one. Please for questions. If you did previously press star one we ask that you. Please press star one again well go next now to Kirk at Evercore ISI.\n\nYes, I guess Karl for you that Theres, a lot of things going positively right now with extend or some of the partners contributing.\n\nKind of wondering are there any cross currents out there that are sort of offsetting that relative to what you would've thought maybe at the beginning of the year, obviously tariffs with Europe.\n\nJust anything you could give us some context on because it seems like you have some really nice momentum in some of your early stage.\n\nHey, Kirk.\n\nIs that question for for Us.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe can be opened his line.\n\nOkay.\n\nWe can come back to Kirk.\n\nWe will circle back around to Mr. Return, we'll go next now to Alex Mcgrath of Keybanc capital markets.\n\nThanks for taking my question.\n\nCan you maybe talk about or just sort of outlined in the product and go to market priorities around Ias in 'twenty six.\n\nJust thinking about some of them at momentum behind the business and the potential acceleration in 'twenty six.\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nThere's really I would say threefold one we are very focused on the.\n\nSeveral hundred thousands of customers that are in our base up to about 800000 folks in our base that are eligible for either advanced Intuit enterprise suite and so we are very focused on continuing to.\n\nThose customers and that's a big part of what's driving the growth that we're experiencing now.\n\nTwo we've really most recently started creating a flywheel effect.\n\nHaving discussions with our accountants partners that is those are sort of more longer term opportunities, but that's a really big opportunity for us not just in FY 'twenty picks up but I would say beyond now that we're getting traction with with Intuit enterprise suite, and advanced, but particularly Intuit enterprise suite across.\n\nAll verticals.\n\nAnd I would say last but not least.\n\nIt's an important reminder, for all of US that we're one year and with Intuit Enterprise suite and we just had our largest.\n\nLaunch in July because we do quarterly product releases and really our focus is to do two things one ought to be able to accelerate penetrating our existing addressable market, but to actually start opening up our total addressable market and and we are of course very excited about actually being onboard and .\n\nour progress, but those are the key I would say product and go to market priorities.\n\nThank you.\n\nYep very welcome.\n\nThank you. We'll go next now to Arjun Bhatia of William Blair.\n\nYes, perfect. Thank you so much.\n\nThis is on for you on the some of the agenda capabilities.\n\nSharon it's seems very interesting I'm curious, how you're thinking about.\n\nAI readiness amongst your base clearly you're getting game engagement already but already are your customers to kind of implement these atms and does that require some work.\n\nOn your own or is it sort of leaves sort of plug and play kind of getting to what we might expect in 2027. Thank you.\n\nYes, actually I Love your question.\n\nIt's sort of very customer back end and I think it's important as we think about serving whether it's consumer or smaller or large businesses.\n\nFirst thing I would say.\n\nPeople are using AI apps in their lives, but they don't really care about AI, but they care about is.\n\nHelp me grow my business helped me get customers helped me understand why should focus my marketing dollars to help me understand with financial decisions and.\n\nAnd that's what's most important and so it really let me bring that to life by just sharing an experience that is part of what we've launched with you. So for instance, one of the things you can see in our in our business feed is it will show the customer that they had.\n\n10, unpaid invoices and that we in essence based on their past permission and executed a follow up to go get that money for the customer and then we actually when they click on it they see how their cash flow has improved or in the flow.\n\nThe customer will send them, a notification and let them know that hey, they're eligible for a line of credit based on the sales growth that they're seeing and we'll show them that sales growth. So really what the AI agents are giving us the ability to do is to help customers make decisions.\n\nAnd I think.\n\nThat's really what customers care about it's less about is it an AI agents, but the fact that in moments of truth, we're actually helping them get paid a pay others get access to a line of credit.\n\nUnderstand what decisions they can make to drive our growth, which really I'll end with.\n\nThe last point and that is the Forrester study that we very intentionally shared.\n\nAnd in our script and that is that what we're really after is.\n\nHelping customers consolidate their data their tech stack and our spend all in one place and when we do that.\n\nA 300% ROI over a three year period, because in essence, when the customer's data is all in one place with our AI agents, we have the ability to help them make better decisions to drive revenue growth or profitability through our business feed and AI agents doing the work and or when whenever when everything is in one.\n\nPlace, we can drive more automating tasks, we're automating workflows and it delivers efficiency and last but not least when we consolidate their tech stack, they actually spend more with us, but overall they spend less and so.\n\nThat's the way I would think about it relative to our customers and what we're experiencing as well as we're engaging our customers with these new experiences.\n\nAnd one other thing over to add to it. This is where we were super deliberate in how we introduce the identic experiences we incorporate them into the lineup. So we exposed our customers to them as opposed to having the customers go to.\n\nPick a separate offering to add on so bad deliberate decisions also what is helping customers see the productivity see the better business outcomes and therefore, leading to conversations around what's the next set of expenses. The bulk of the customers are showing high receptivity to it is as I mentioned significantly high repeat usage than even our own internal expert.\n\nPatients.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay Thats very helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you well go next now to Kirk.\n\nEvercore ISI.\n\nYes, thanks, and sorry about earlier.\n\nI was wondering if you could actually just talk a little bit about credit Karma, obviously, a fantastic year for that business. I think there is some concern obviously with that business that it can be potentially more cyclical than other parts of your business, but the double digit guide for next year against a very tough comps seems to give some indication that you guys feel good about how that's so.\n\nOur operating just curious if you had a little bit more color to serve the confidence in the guide and maybe serves some of the new product lines that are coming about to make that perhaps a little bit less cyclical than it was perhaps before you bought it in the early days.\n\nYeah sure Kirk first let me, let me just start with the .\n\nThe strategic nature of why we again acquired credit Karma, because it's just it's important to re ground there and that is.\n\nWhat we're really ultimately after is to create one consumer platform. So we can help customers with benefit delivery on an ongoing basis and by the time. It's tax time, we have really an opportunity to to people's taxes for them right through the credit Karma platform. So.\n\nThat's an important element because a lot of.\n\nThe innovation this year and a lot of what we already talked about which is the contribution that had the tax is a very important part.\n\nThe go forward, which is engaging customers year round. So one element is just tax.\n\nConfidence and gives us overall in the consumer platform. The other is because of all of our data and AI investments, we're actually taking share because.\n\nWhen you look at our credit card and personal loan performance. The majority of those actually great execution, and where our share is increasing and the primary reason why the share is increasing is because of all of our data data and AI investments, because we engage customers and app and we engage them at the right moment of truth, knowing when they are.\n\nLooking at financial product and we put choice in front of them and they are able to interact with us to better understand what is right for them.\n\nThat's an important element, which is share gains that gives us confidence and it's been several quarters in a row, where our execution is really outpacing what we even anticipated which leads to the last thing that you asked about logistic locality I mean, we've been investing heavily and things that are as cyclical one is tax that I talked about.\n\nWhich is all reasons why we acquired.\n\nThe platform, but two as insurance.\n\nThree as prime customers that really when you look at the cyclicality of credit Karma. The primary driver in the last several years was personal loans.\n\nThose that are actually sub prime or near Prime which is why we've been really focused on prime customers because they have a different set of needs and so a lot of innovation around prime customers and insurance as I mentioned, a moment ago, and then last but not least is just around money.\n\nWe are investing heavily to not only provide immediate and instant access to people's money when its refund time, but how do we then engage those customers year round when it comes to their money and so it's a holistic set of those areas of innovation that gives us confidence.\n\nNot distinct credit Karma, but just across our consumer platform as we look ahead.\n\nSuper Thanks Hassan Congrats on a great deal.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. We'll go next now to tailor mcginnis of UBS.\n\nYeah, Hi, thanks, so much for taking my question. So if I look at the global solution business performance, Excluding mail chimp. It was really strong in and it looks like that was driven by an acceleration in online. So first can you maybe talk through the drivers of that performance and how durable you think some of those trends could be as we go into 2026.\n\nAnd then secondly, as we look ahead into the guidance, excluding mail chimp implies a little bit of a default. So maybe you could just walk us through how we should think about.\n\nThe implied what that implies for desktop versus online and some of the assumptions there. Thank you.\n\nYeah, Hey, Taylor Sandeep in terms of the Q4, the acceleration that you correctly pointed out was across both accounting on services on the accounting side as we continue to scale and the mid market that aided as well as us introducing a new lineup in early July. So those are the two factors that drove the on that.\n\nCounting side and on the services side it was driven by our investments in innovation we've been.\n\nDriving across our money portfolio.\n\nIncluding.\n\nInnovations such as making all invoices payable, which is something we rolled out in Q4 and that is .\n\nTo see good momentum.\n\nAgain. These are things that are very durable and they will continue to pay off into the into the new fiscal year.\n\nIn terms of your question on how to think about the guidance ex mill chip the area I would point to that.\n\nThe key factor there between what we delivered in fiscal 'twenty, five and our guidance for fiscal 'twenty six is less pricing business something that.\n\nDiscussed in Q4 as well if you remember is that once you look outside of our accounting platform.\n\nDesktop and in services, we had less pricing heading into fiscal 'twenty six.\n\nTook in 25, so the core momentum in the business remains strong and the Delta is.\n\nDriven by less pricing actions.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nThank you. We'll go next now to Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.\n\nI was on mute you would think you'd.\n\nI figure that out by now thanks, a lot for taking the question.\n\nCan you, maybe just help expand a little bit on improvements that underpin the confidence in the 15% to 20%.\n\nTTM growth next year after such a fantastic year. Thanks.\n\nYes, Hey, Brad let me maybe.\n\nUS off it's really I would say comes down to two big things one is mid market.\n\n$90 billion Tam.\n\nJust scratching the service at the surface with our penetration in.\n\nIn that addressable market custom.\n\nCustomers grew 23%.\n\nThat when you look at overall online growth, which was 20% and often our $8 billion over 8 billion, 40% growth in mid market. So that gives us a lot of confidence for years to come not just FY 'twenty six I think the other one is with the launch that we had which.\n\nSort of our all in one launch with a virtual team of AI agents and an AI.\n\nEnabled human experts, we now have all of our apps in one place to help customers manage from lead to cash in fact, one of the reasons I mentioned earlier that we like where we are on a couple of million customers engaging discovery and repeat engagement is actually higher than what we had anticipated for only a month and.\n\nIs that customers are actually surprised that we have all the apps that we have today because now it's all in one place a visibly see it in one place when we're actually continuing to do more and more of the work for them and there is a significant services adoption opportunity within that Brad and so.\n\nThose are the two big things that give us a lot of confidence looking ahead, because large tam low penetration.\n\nJust think of our product launches are positioned well for durable growth for years to come to something that was really helpful and shame on me I didn't speak very clearly I actually meant to say turbotax live and I, abbreviated at TTL, but that was still very helpful. Thank you.\n\nThere's nothing like answering questions that did not get at no let.\n\nLet me let me at least in the Labor thing, let me, let him answer that question Brian.\n\nCut off for the first part so we were actually debating the 15 to 20.\n\nSo.\n\nTurbotax live look we had a phenomenal year in fiscal 'twenty, five and made tremendous progress across.\n\nlocal.\n\nCost of making sure we extended our brand equity towards the assisted category and that showed up in the timing of our brand spend and delivering it better to get experience with credit Karma with many of those customers coming over and picking the assisted method and across all of those we had outstanding outcomes, but we also had tremendous learnings would you give us gives us the confidence that as we exit.\n\nThat playbook in the year ahead, and execute even better that would continue to draw drive strong momentum and assisted tax category and thats, where the confidence in the 15% to 20% comes.\n\nThank you both were really helpful.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you. We'll go next now to Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs.\n\nYes, I'm with the Brad Guy, So I thought I heard turbotax live and so but I loved your explanation for the Quickbooks online, though but that's the fun of it.\n\nSomewhat of a mundane topic, maybe back to the essentials of how Intuit goes to market with its quickbooks business I think people have been a little apprehensive about.\n\nAI searches overviews, taking over from regular paid search that sort of thing.\n\nCan you give us a framework how is the go to market engine.\n\nLike books and other products that do depend upon.\n\nAds Internet ads works in this new era, and how do you take advantage of.\n\nOr how do you make sure that youre not first of all disadvantage and how do you take advantage of it.\n\nYes, Serge take them over relative to normal page search. Thank you so much.\n\nYes. Thanks for the question first of all I will just start with the fundamental premise that as an AI company. We're all over all things AI inclusive.\n\nSearch and how you show up in search whether its across any platform. So thats a really important in terms of just clarity visibility and focus on search.\n\nThe second thing I would say it's generally.\n\nWe have not been overly reliant on search.\n\nSpecifically in the business group, our traffic was actually up double digits. This past year.\n\nAnd less than 15% of that traffic was actually driven by search so thats just important context to understand.\n\nThe element of where our traffic comes from because we we've intentionally over the years actually have invested in many different channels to drive search down because of where customers are.\n\nAgain.\n\nTo understand with all of that said as I mentioned earlier, our AI search today is 1% of our overall search.\n\nBut we have been doing a lot of work to ensure that over time, we actually show up with where customers are no matter what platform. They are on whether it's social weather, whether its search and last but not least the way to think about our business is almost in simplistic terms sort of three dimensions. One dimension is one , which is .\n\nHow we drive campaigns to help customers that are solar printers that just started their business to be aware that we are at all on one platform and we can help them grow and the other is much more one to one off our mid market and the one to one.\n\nOur accountant channel, which is a large driver of growth and then a one to one with businesses and third this is the power of our platform. We don't have to spend money on payments, we don't have to spend money on payroll, we don't have to spend money on.\n\nS. Because we're a platform where it's all in one place.\n\nAnd when we draw a customer in with one benefit. We can then our AI agents can do the work to help customers, whether it's to get paid whether it's to help them with payroll and as you heard sandeep talked about earlier, we're very intentional about what we make available in our skus to provide the capability and availability to our customers, but that's really the way to think about.\n\nHow we go to market the way to think about.\n\nSearch how important it is to our business and last but not least we benefit because we are a top brand from AI searches as they grow over time.\n\nOne thing also.\n\nCash to keep it.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that cash and I think I'd say.\n\nImportant consideration that search and AI traffic is not apples to apples the AI traffic tends to be much higher concentration consideration in commercial auto magnitude better through the funnel. So thats a very important area that we are very cognizant off and making sure. We are investing to get more of that air traffic because it just makes it from a order of magnitude Murphy.\n\nYeah.\n\nAwesome. Thank you somebody from Stefan I'm, so glad that I stuck my neck out a few weeks ago investors asked me about anybody working puts us on will have figured this out otherwise they will not have a job. So I'm. So glad you are on top of it. Thank you so much.\n\nWell, thank you for your confidence my friend.\n\nI'll pass it onto the team.\n\nThank you we'll go next.\n\nNow to Steve Enders of Citi.\n\nOkay, great. Thanks, Rob and thanks for taking the questions here.\n\nI guess I just want to ask on just maybe F&B health and maybe what you're seeing out there from a macro perspective have you seen any change in terms of how.\n\nWhat youre seeing from from that perspective, either in your underlying data from the .\n\nCustomers coming through just maybe what are you seeing from a deal environment perspective.\n\nYes sure.\n\nThe thing that I would say when you talk about businesses you got to do it while I'm talking about consumers right because businesses spend with businesses the consumer spend with businesses. So I'll just start with consumers first in .\n\nGenerally what we see across our well over $100 million customers is.\n\nBalances on things like credit cards is up 4% year over year, but please understand that.\n\nOver the last several years, it's been up double digits and credit scores.\n\nEnding on your credit band could be down about 10 points and so consumers are good job market, but they are very intentional about where they spend money.\n\nAnd they are stretched when it comes to the businesses.\n\nThat we see on our platform revenues are generally.\n\nFlat, but our profits and cash flows are actually up year over year now.\n\n10 million customers.\n\nThere are sectors that are performing far better and then there are sectors that aren't performing well and as you know we're not concentrated in any particular.\n\nSector, but sectors like real estate advertising manufacturing, depending on what you manufacture are down whereas other sectors are up so net net profits or cash flows are up across the millions of customers that we serve.\n\nOkay perfect. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nYou're very welcome.\n\nThank you the next now to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats.\n\nSo Tom maybe for you kind of.\n\nThe following up on the prior question about just the general kind of macro picture for your customer base. If you think about.\n\n.\n\nOver the course of the next 12 to 18 months, you think about all of the functionality in the product and as well as in the functionality is starting to mix shift your.\n\ncustomers with a more kind of simplistic holistic offering into higher tiers of service.\n\nHow much is it.\n\nHow how much pushes that versus pull how does how does the functionality unlock that opportunity for you and it seems like there is an opportunity at least seemingly with AI search yielding better and in apps selling and cross selling also driving more.\n\nC. In the go to market process to also do that in a more margin positive way. So maybe just comment on both of those aspects as you can.\n\nYeah actually I Love your your question so.\n\nSo a couple of things I would say one.\n\nEvery customer that we talk to and I personally talk to.\n\nAnd accountants.\n\nThey are overwhelmed with the number of apps that they have.\n\nThey are over spending money on a bunch of different apps.\n\nThat is requiring them to spend more time than ever trying to figure out what is going on in their business.\n\nAnd I and even more important than all of that is their data is trapped in a bunch of different apps and so they really are.\n\nOur opportunity and our biggest impact that we're having right now is with our all in one platform and that's why that for society was so important that we shared in the script is to consolidate data consolidate the tech stack and consolidate spend.\n\nBecause by doing that that 300% return on investment is driven by when you consolidate data on our platform.\n\nAI agents can do far better work to help customers with revenue growth and profitability growth.\n\nWhen we consolidate the tech stack, we can automate tasks and workflows to drive a lot more efficiency all in one place versus a bunch of different apps and last but not least when you sort of add up what a customer pays to have a bunch of different apps versus.\n\nWhat they would pay us and by the way pay us and paying us more.\n\nThey end up saving money. So we have proof substantial proof that that works and I think to your question.\n\nPush annabelle.\n\nAs an element of with our AI agents and AI enabled human expert.\n\nUltimately, what we are seeing and what we're looking to accelerate is how customers.\n\nStart doing more of their work on our platform versus using different apps, but we will also be working on how do you create a push.\n\nUltimately you are working against human inertia, and although you have a lot of different apps, although youre spending a lot of money the hema inertia that has changed.\n\nAnd so one of the things that we'll continue to look at is what we include in our lineup.\n\nAnd what we need to do to motivate and inspire and drive .\n\nbecause now we have everything in one place. So it is a push of a poll.\n\nAnd.\n\nAnd that's really how we're thinking about our ongoing execution of our lineup and evolution of our lineup as we look ahead.\n\nIt sounds like ERP for the SMB and it's working.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you Alex.\n\nThank you. We'll go next now to Brad Sills of Bank of America.\n\nOh, great. Thank you so much I wanted to ask a question around the AI platform, maybe a little different angle.\n\nYou've had the invoice generator out for quite some time, but would love to hear.\n\nThe traction Youre seeing there.\n\nAnd.\n\nHow thats performing and could that be a leading indicator perhaps for other agents that might be coming over time.\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nI will tell you what we saw very early on which is .\n\nOne customers that are using our invoice reminder, which I think is what you were asking about.\n\nWe actually see 10% higher payments volume and conversion by those that are using the invoice reminder, and theyre getting paid five days early and that I'm glad you asked about it the way you did because that's just a tangible example.\n\nHow are payments AI agent would that sliver of focus which is invoice reminder, can have a substantial impact on our customers and and really then if you expand that what we're really focused on with our payments AI agent is.",
    "content2": "How do we pay to the customers build on their behalf how do we help them with line of credit how do we help them with instant deposit how do we actually help create an estimate that's let's payment enabled upfront and they don't have to lift a finger because they have a handwritten note does it take a picture of it and we just create everything for them. So those are all the .\n\nSpanning beyond your question the opportunities that we have with launching a virtual team of AI agents.\n\nThank you Suzanne.\n\nYes, very welcome.\n\nThank you we'll go next now to Brent Thill of Jefferies.\n\nSo on the playbook to get back to growth how do you how do you think about the splits.\n\nWhat's the most important thing I know you mentioned the user interface is a little too complicated for smbs to use.\n\nHow much longer is this going to take to get back to growth in that business.\n\nHey, Brent SMB why don't I take this one so a couple of things, let's start with areas, where we are seeing really good progress on the merchant side, which is in the mid market as I mentioned, we are scaling the sales force the account management team, there and getting really good ROI on that head count and seeing really good progress there.\n\nThe area, where we continue to iterate fast and I feel really good about the progress the team is making and it's showing up in the customer satisfaction scores going up and being some of the highest in recent history is on the small businesses. The small businesses are the bread and butter and the angle. There is to make sure that small business can get to as first and second.\n\nBenefit on our platform within the first 30 days or thereabouts, and Thats, where the team is helping make sure. The offering is resonating they're able to navigate it able to see that benefit and we are making good progress and feel good about it which is why we are confident in this business exiting double digit since fiscal year .\n\nOne thing to keep in mind. It is a subscription business. So there is it till the sixth month.\n\nIn terms of these actions due to implementing and I am showing up in the revenue.\n\nSelling up so that's why we think it will be.\n\nA couple of quarters at least before we start seeing the scaling up in revenue, but the momentum and the progress that we feel good about and Milton.\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nThank you and ladies and gentlemen that is all the time, we have for questions. This afternoon. Mr. I would like to turn things back to user for any closing comments.\n\nYeah, Hey, Thank you everyone for attending thank you for all your great questions and we look forward to seeing everybody at Investor day until then be safe bye everybody.\n\nThank you again, ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today's conference call, we'd like to thank you all so much for joining us today and wish you all a great remainder of your day."

We are making early progress with product improvements, but continue to expect it to take several quarters to deliver improved outcomes at scale.\n\nAs a reminder, in Q2, we began lapping the price changes we made in Q2 of last year, which drove a deceleration in growth this quarter versus Q1, we remain confident in and are executing on our vision of an .\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nGot it.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll in one place.\n\nThird we are executing our international strategy, which includes leading with our connected platform in our established markets and Lee with merchants and all of the markets as we can continue to execute on a localized product and lineup.\n\nConstant currency basis.\n\nInternational online ecosystem revenue grew 9% in Q2 or 19%.\n\nIncluding merchant.\n\nAs we have previously shared we've been as a platform company our online ecosystem revenue growth reflect the progress, we're making with our strategy of serving both small and mid sized businesses with more complex needs.

We recently entered into a $4 5 billion revolving credit facility that we are using to fund our five early refund offering this facility expires on April 32025.\n\nWe repurchased $721 million of stock during the second quarter, depending on market conditions and other factors.

Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com.\nWe assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period. and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter with solid momentum across the company as we executed our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Third quarter revenue grew 12%. Small Business & Self-Employed group revenue grew 18% despite an uncertain macro environment, demonstrating the importance of our platform and fueling success for small businesses and our momentum serving the mid-market.\nConsumer group revenue grew 9% and Credit Karma revenue grew 8%, driven by the impact of innovation from members and the benefits of TurboTax and Credit Karma product integration. I'm proud of our performance and the momentum we're seeing across the company.\nTurning to tax. We continue to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses. Tax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM in the U.S. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories. We're well positioned to penetrate the assisted TAM by leveraging data, AI and our virtual expert platform.\nLet me share several proof points. This season, we made good progress against our multiyear strategy to transform the assisted experience for customers. TurboTax Live, our assisted offering, including our do-it-with-me and full-service tax offerings for both consumers and businesses is the largest durable growth opportunity.\nWe expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 12% and revenue to grow 17% in fiscal year 2024. TurboTax Live revenue is expected to be $1.4 billion, representing approximately 30% of total consumer group revenue growing at a significant scale. This gives us confidence that we can digitize a very manual, disaggregated and high-priced assisted category.\nNow let me spend a few minutes going deeper in several areas. First, TurboTax Live Full Service is resonating with consumers as we continue to innovate and making it simpler for customers to get their taxes done virtually. We expect TurboTax Live Full Service customers to double this fiscal year, with those new to TurboTax to triple. Our full service offering has a product recommendation score of 85, one of the highest at Intuit. Our learnings and insights from this season bolster our confidence in the continued opportunity we have to disrupt the assisted category.\nSecond, we expect TurboTax to gain share with higher ARPR filers, as we strategically prioritize focusing on the assisted tax segment and higher value customers over pay nothing and lower ARPR segment.\nThird, Intuit Assist, our GenAI-powered financial assistant, played a big role in our TurboTax experience this year. With Intuit Assist, we're creating a future of done-for-you, where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. More than 24 million customers used Intuit Assist to explain their refund, answer questions and help deliver confidence that their return was completed accurately this year. This is data and GenAI working at scale, for both our customers and our AI-powered experts, helping customers virtually. I'm excited about what we're working on for next season to accelerate innovation and deliver even more customer benefits.\nAnd fourth, we delivered solid results with the product integration across Credit Karma and TurboTax. We grew the number of customers that filed with TurboTax from the embedded Credit Karma experience by 76% and tax refunds deposited in a Credit Karma money account by 28%.\nWe also delivered strong growth in Credit Karma Money revenue this quarter. This product integration also drove new members to Credit Karma, consistent with our goal of driving higher engagement and monetization for Credit Karma over time.\nGiven these results, we see big opportunities ahead to deliver on our vision to help consumers make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save more money, pay off debt and take steps to improve their financial health. To significantly accelerate creating seamless end-to-end consumer experiences that customers benefit from year round, we are more closely aligning TurboTax and Credit Karma under Mark Notarainni, General Manager of the Consumer Group, who will oversee both segments.\nI'm excited to share that Joe Koffman, currently President of Credit Karma and part of the leadership team for the last 9 years, will be leading Credit Karma as of August 1, reporting to Mark. Additionally, Ken Lin will retire from Intuit around the end of this calendar year. I can't thank Ken enough for his friendship, leadership and impact across the company. In summary, we made strong progress this tax season that sets us up for continued success in the future.\nNow let's take a look ahead. The era of AI is one of the most significant technology shifts of our lifetime. It is reinventing customer experiences, creating new monetization possibilities and structurally changing how we work with an Intuit to deliver for customers. We're very well positioned to take advantage of this era with our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets to pursue the largest customer problems and growth drivers for Intuit.\nAs part of our financial planning process, we have identified key areas within our Big Bets, where we plan to accelerate investments to deliver greater impact. These include Big Bets 1, GenAI to deliver done-for-you experiences with Intuit Assist. Big Bets 2, go-to-market investments for TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, embedding AI-powered experts across our small business offerings, Big Bets 4, our money solutions to digitize the experience end to end for consumers and small businesses from estimates to invoicing to getting paid and paying bills. Big Bets 5, doubling down on mid-market with additional investments in platform and go-to-market motions and finally, accelerating international growth with Mailchimp and QuickBooks.\nTo increase our investments in the outline focus areas given the green shoots we're observing, we are taking a hard look at what we can stop doing and where we can reallocate investments. to accelerate top line growth while remaining committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Wrapping up, we're excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to power prosperity for customers.\nNow let me hand it over to Sandeep.\n\nSandeep Singh Aujla\n\nSVP of Finance for SBSEG & Technology Organization, Executive VP and CFO\n\nThanks, Sasan. We delivered a solid third quarter of fiscal 2024 across the company. Our third quarter results include revenue of $6.7 billion, up 12%; GAAP operating income of $3.1 billion versus $2.8 billion last year, up 12%; non-GAAP operating income of $3.7 billion versus $3.4 billion last year, up 11%; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.42 versus $7.38 a year ago, up 14%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $9.88 versus $8.92 last year, up 11%.\nNow turning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue of $3.7 billion grew 9% in Q3, reflecting the progress we made transforming the assisted experience for consumers and small businesses this season. Our strategy is working. We expect TurboTax Live revenue to grow 17% to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2024, representing approximately 30% of overall consumer group revenue, driving total average revenue per return up approximately 10%.\nI am pleased with the sustained growth we are seeing in our TurboTax Live business.\nOverall retention is expected to be up 3 points year-over-year in fiscal 2024, close to pre-COVID levels, demonstrating the strength of our offerings and highlighting the benefit we are delivering to our customers. As Sasan shared earlier, we expect TurboTax to gain share with higher ARPR filers as we strategically prioritized focusing on the assisted tax and the higher ARPR customers over to-pay-nothing and lower ARPR segment. As a result, we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 12% and total online paying units to grow approximately 2% in fiscal 2024, versus total returns growth of 1%.\nDue to yielding shares with pay-nothing and lower ARPR customers, we expect our share of total consumer returns to decline approximately 80 basis points this year and total TurboTax units to decline 1%.\nWe are raising our full year Consumer Group revenue growth guidance to $4.44 billion to $4.45 billion, which is at the top end of our previously provided guidance. I am proud of the progress we made the season. And the learnings we had reinforce our confidence in the future. We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long term given the size and trajectory of TurboTax Live.\nTurning to the ProTax group. Revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect ProTax group revenue growth of 6% to 7%.\nTurning to the Small Business & Self-Employed. Revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue, which grew 19%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonates with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment, with the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, a strategic focus within the small business and self-employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.\nFirst, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 19% in Q3, driven by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. As I shared last quarter, we continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market through continued focus on go-to-market motions and product innovations. Mid-market customers drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services on our platform, although they are a smaller subset of our total customer TAM. This, coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem offerings to existing customers, shift the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time.\nSecond, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q3 driven by payments, payroll and Mailchimp. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects higher consecutive prices, ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Total online payment volume growth in Q3 was 22%. With payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions, higher effective prices and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings.\nMailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth. Revenue growth in Mailchimp decelerated this quarter as we were lapping a larger benefit from price and lineup changes that we made last year.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3.\nShifting to the Desktop Ecosystem. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the third quarter and QuickBooks Desktop enterprise revenue grew in the high teens. At the end of this fiscal year, we will complete the 3-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model.\nAs I shared last quarter, starting next fiscal year, we expect our desktop enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining desktop subscription customers who tend to be more complex and higher value to migrate seamlessly to either QuickBooks Online or to our desktop enterprise offering when they are waiting. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the products for value. The online ecosystem remains a growth catalyst longer term.\nAs a result of the strong growth we are seeing in the Small Business & Self-Employed group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 18%, up from the prior guidance of 16% to 17%. We continue to expect small business and self-employed group revenue growth of 15% to 20% long term.\nMoving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $443 million in Q3, up 8%. On a product basis, Credit Karma Money accounted for 3 points of growth, credit cards and auto insurance each accounted for 2 points and personal loans accounted for 1 point. We saw strength in Credit Karma Money from TurboTax customers choosing to deposit their refund in a Credit Karma Money account, and we have seen a return to growth in the insurance segment. However, the overall picture remains mixed, reflecting uncertain macro trends as we continue to see select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loan and credit cards in Q3.\nWe are updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a growth of 2% versus our prior guidance range of plus or minus 3% growth. In summary, I am pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year and opportunities ahead.\nShifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain on long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.7 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $584 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on July 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nMoving on to guidance. We are increasing our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 13%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 12% growth. GAAP operating income growth of 21% to 22%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 18% growth, non-GAAP operating income growth of 16%, up from prior guidance of 12% to 16% growth, GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 28% to 29%, up from prior guidance of 11% to 15% growth and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 17%, up from prior guidance of 12% to 14% growth.\nOur guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 13% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.30 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.85. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nFinally, as Sasan shared earlier, we have made strong progress on a 5 Big Bets and see opportunities to invest further in select focused areas to accelerate our pace of progress and deliver greater impact. Therefore, as part of our annual financial planning process, we are taking a hard look at reallocating investments. We remain committed to our financial principle, growing revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster slower than revenue, leading to expanding operating margins in fiscal 2025 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Sandeep. Let me close with 3 points. First, we're very well positioned to take advantage of the largest technological shifts of our era given Intuit strategy and 5 Big Bets with AI at the center as all we do.\nSecond, given the green shoots we're observing, we are doubling down in key areas of our bets to accelerate growth.\nThird, we continue to recruit great technical and leadership count across the company to accelerate our progress. In that context, I'd like to share that Greg Johnson recently returned as Executive Vice President, Intuit, Chief Commercial Officer and Global Small Business & Self-Employed Group Chief Revenue Officer. Greg is a world-class leader with nearly 10 years of experience at Intuit, leading TurboTax as the Head of Marketing and then as General Manager. I'm thrilled to have Greg back head into it.\nNow let's open it up to your questions.",

Ms. Watkins?\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nThanks, Angela. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call.

Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had another strong quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform. We're executing on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. .\nSecond quarter revenue grew by 11%, and we're on track to achieve our fiscal year 2024 full year guidance of 11% to 12% revenue growth while expanding operating margins. Let's start with tax. We're confident in our innovation and game plan to win and are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance of 7% to 8% revenue growth for the Consumer Group.\nTax preparation represents a $35 billion TAM. This includes $31 billion within the assisted consumer and business tax categories, which we have barely started to penetrate. We're well positioned to disrupt the assisted category by leveraging data, AI and our virtual expert platform to revolutionize how taxes get done for consumers and small businesses.\nBy leveraging the power of our platform and ecosystem, we're also extending TurboTax to our Credit Karma members and QuickBooks online small business customers by enabling them to complete their taxes and access expertise directly within these products.\nLet me share more about the areas of focus this season. First, we can serve consumers however they want to file virtually or in person while providing confidence their taxes are being done accurately and they are getting their maximum refund. More than 80% of U.S. filers live within 10-mile radius of the TurboTax expert. These experts use Intuit's virtual expert platform that's powered by data and AI to deliver best-in-class service.\nWhile it's early in the season, TurboTax Live Full Service is resonating with customers. We're seeing strong growth, and the offering has a product recommendation score of 88 season to date, 1 of the highest at Intuit.\nSecond, small businesses can file their taxes with TurboTax. And if a small business is a QuickBooks Online customer they can file their taxes with an expert. With these offerings, they can maximize their refund and get advice from experts when they need it. Our campaigns and easy-to-use experience are driving strong early interest.\nBusiness tax returns at a much higher average revenue per return because they are more complex, and we expect them to contribute to average revenue per return expansion over time.\nThird, we're more deeply integrating Credit Karma and TurboTax, making it even more seamless for Credit Karma members to file with TurboTax directly in the Credit Karma app with exclusive offers for members whether they want to find themselves or with an expert.\nWe're also unlocking the benefits of the Credit Karma platform for tax filers to make smart money decisions. This includes earlier access to the refund or for those that qualify, access to an industry refund advance loan in as little as 30 seconds after IRS acceptance when depositing the refund into a Credit Karma money account. This is designed to lead to higher engagement and monetization in Credit Karma over time.\nFourth, Intuit Assist, our Gen AI-powered financial assistant is live in TurboTax this season. With Intuit Assist, we are creating a future of done for you where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success.\nFor example, Customers are using Intuit just to better understand their refund. In early results, Intuitive's helpfulness rating is 1.5x greater than our legacy explanation, indicating Intuit Assist is helping deliver confidence to TurboTax customers.\nOur focus this tax season further showcases how our big bets have accelerated innovation and growth for the future. We're leveraging the power of data and AI with Intuit Assist to revolutionize speed to benefit for customers disrupting the assisted consumer and business tax categories by connecting people with experts virtually and bringing the TurboTax and Credit Karma experience together to unlock smart money decisions. We're off to a great start in tax.\nLet me now highlight progress across 2 of our big bets. As a reminder, our 5 big bets are revolutionize speak to benefit, connect people to experts unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.\nOur first big bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our big bets. 5 years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI fueling innovation across the platform.\nAt the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer, which fuels what's possible with AI.\nAnd with our GenAI operating system, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough Gene experiences across our platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way.\nAs I mentioned earlier, with Intuit Assist, we're creating a future of done for you where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway human expertise fueling their success. Intuit Assist is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade and is in the hands of select customers now.\nWe believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform, driving customer growth, accelerated adoption of services and live offerings. I'm really excited about the rapid pace at which we're innovating, testing, learning and adapting to deliver our core benefits of more money, no work and complete confidence for customers.\nLet me share a few updates. First, TurboTax. As I shared earlier, Intuit Assist is live in the product this season and is delivering increased confidence to our customers. Second, Mailchimp. To help small businesses grow revenue and save them time, we're providing AI-powered automation and content generation using Intuit Assist.\nThird, QuickBooks. Intuit Assist is in beta and is designed to help solve businesses optimize cash flow and make confident decisions to grow their business. New customers who were previously running their business manually will be able to get started quickly by sharing their e-mail, website and bank account information. Their unstructured data will be translated into benefits for them, such as generating customized pay-enabled invoices that save time and enable customers to get paid faster, experiencing the benefits of switching to a digital platform.\nAnd for existing customers, we will translate their data and analyze their money in and money out transactions into insights and recommendations. Intuit Assist, we'll do the work for our customers in the background with suggested automated actions that increases customer productivity by saving time and leading to better outcomes such as getting paid faster and obtaining capital.\nFurthermore, we intend to provide an option to connect and interact with an expert to help provide insight and make decisions specific to their financial situation and fuel their success at the moments that matter most, such as closing their books.\nFourth, Credit Karma. Intuit Assist for Credit Karma is in beta, and we're excited about the rapid innovation and the progress we're making to help connect members to financial products that are right for them, saving them time and money. We're focused on using GenAI to interact with members to help answer their questions in a highly personalized way when shopping for financial products.\nCustomers can interact, learn more and ask questions to help make confident decisions. Intuit Assist will engage more members with a wide range of financial needs beyond credit. We recently expanded by 6x the number of topics we can provide help on and now address items like major purchases, home buying, savings and more. We believe this can drive increased member engagement and conversion and drive higher revenue per monthly active user.\nWe remain excited with our early progress with Intuit Assist across the company. It's changing our relationship with customers as we move from being a transactional workflow platform is a trusted assistant that customers can rely on daily to power their prosperity.\nOur fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business.\nIn Mailchimp, we're focused on better serving mid-market customers across different stages of their life cycle to drive higher engagement and retention. After we have successfully onboarded them, we're pairing larger customers with an account manager to help them understand and adopt the breadth of Mailchimp's capabilities. We're seeing green shoots from account management, which gives us confidence in the future. Customers who have engaged with an account manager have higher monthly revenue retention. We believe this will also drive higher ARPC over time.\nIntuit Assist is live in Mailchimp's higher-end offerings and is designed to help customers develop personalized marketing campaigns and drive their revenue growth. We're offering customers 3 AI-powered automations today, including new customer welcome, abandoned shopping cart and recovering lost customers. Automations are time consuming the setup, but can drive higher revenue.\nIntuit Assist personalized automations are 50% more likely to be activated by customers. Intuit Assist is also reducing work by generating new content and editing existing content for marketing campaigns. Recent improvements have driven GenAI text generation adoption rates by more than 70% over the past several months, reducing work for our customers.\nGetting paid fast remains a big challenge for small businesses. We're uniquely positioned to help customers with our end-to-end money platform and innovations such as easy discovery, auto enabled payments payment-enabled invoices, instant deposits and get paid up front, which are all helping our customers get paid faster and drive adoption of payments.\nTotal online payment volume growth was 20% in the quarter. We're beginning to roll out a new payment-enabled invoicing experience that will provide more benefits to customers, including more ways to get paid. While early, we're seeing that customers who use the new invoicing experience are engaging more driving increase in customer adoption of our payment rails to get their invoices paid.\nWe're also making progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. The number of connections in our QuickBooks business network has doubled since August, and we're pleased with the initial adoption of our bill pay offering.\nTo better serve small businesses, during the quarter, we began rolling out faster payment time lines for qualified customers that reduce payment time by 40%, including a paid next-day ACH option and batch payments, allowing customers to hold on to their cash longer and save time.\nWe're wrapping up with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with Gen AI across our platform, we're more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We're honored to be recognized by Bloomberg as 1 of the top 50 companies to watch in 2024, and to be ranked 22 on this year's Just 100, and the highest ranked customer or software company on the list.\nNow let me hand it over to Sandeep.\n\nSandeep Singh Aujla\n\nSVP of Finance for SBSEG & Technology Organization, Executive VP and CFO\n\nThanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered another strong quarter despite the IRS opening approximately 1 week later this year. We achieved healthy operating margin and are on track to achieve our full year guidance as we continue to deliver operating leverage across the business.\nOur Q2 results include revenue of $3.4 billion, up 11% and that's operating income of $369 million versus $270 million last year, up 37%. Non-GAAP operating income of $1 billion versus $856 million last year, up 17%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.25 versus $0.60 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.63 versus $2.20 last year, up 20%.\nTurning to our business segments. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem revenue, which grew 21%. Our results continue to demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which resonates with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow in any economic environment.\nWith the goal of being the source of crude for small businesses, our strategic focus within the small business and self-employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core.\nGood Books Online accounting revenue grew 19% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. We continue to prioritize disrupting the small business mid-market through continued focus on both go-to-market and product innovations.\nWhile mid-market customers are a smaller subset of the total small business TAM that drive a higher ARPC over time given their more complex needs and higher usage of services across our platform. This, coupled with our strategy to sell more of our ecosystem services to existing customers shift the emphasis in our growth formula towards ARPC over time.\nSecond, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 24% in Q2, driven by payroll, payments, Mailchimps, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our Pro solutions, higher effective prices and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings.\nWithin payments, the revenue growth for the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow, higher effective prices and an increase in total payment volume for our customer. Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paid customer growth.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16% in Q2.\nNow moving to our desktop ecosystem. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the mid-teens. We are more than 2 years into a 3-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model.\nIn fiscal 2025, the tailwinds from the 3-year transition will be behind us, but we expect our Desktop Enterprise offering, which accounts for over half of desktop accounting revenue to grow in the high single-digit range. We also will continue to encourage remaining desktops subscription customers who tend to be more complex and higher value to migrate seamlessly to either QuickBooks Online or our desktop enterprise offering when they are ready. Additionally, we see opportunities to continue to price the product for value. The online ecosystem remains a growth catalyst longer term.\nShifting to our consumer and ProTax groups. Our full year outlook remains unchanged, even though Consumer Group revenue declined 5% in the quarter, reflecting an approximately 1 week later I opened this year. We are confident in our game plan to winter season and are reiterating our guidance for Consumer group of 7% to 8% revenue growth in fiscal 2024.\nTurning to the Protax Group. Revenue grew 8% to $274 million in Q2, reflecting the timing of when tax forms were delivered, which is a driver for revenue recognition.\nMoving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, flat to a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in credit card money, credit cards and auto loans offset by decline in home loans, personal loans and auto insurance. We saw select partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards in Q2, reflecting expected macro trends.\nAnd as a reminder, Q2 is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 to benefit from additional Credit Karma money revenue during tax season. In summary, I am pleased with our continued momentum this fiscal year.\nNow shifting to our balance sheet and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet.\nWe repurchased $536 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on our market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on April 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nMoving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12% and GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18%; non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%. GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%.\nOur guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11% and GAAP earnings per share of $7.77 to $7.84, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $9.31 to $9.38. As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full year fiscal 2024 and Q3 guidance detailed in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Sandeep. And just to quickly wrap up, we're very confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy, our progress with our 5 big bets, and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe that this will change our relationship with our customers, becoming their trusted advisers, leading to higher engagement and monetization.\nThe combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM.\nWith that, let's open it up to your questions.",

My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nThanks, Chelsea. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and our CFO, Sandeep Aujla.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com.\nWe assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. Some of the numbers in each remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconcile the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong first quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform across the company. Total revenue grew 15%, driven by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 18% and -- and Consumer Group revenue growth of 25%. This was partially offset by Credit Karma revenue decline of 5%, in line with our expectations for Q1 given the macroeconomic environment. .\nWith the strong start to the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance for fiscal year 2024. Consumer Group revenue growth reflects a strong finish to the tax extension season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted consumer and business tax categories with TurboTax Live. Our innovation and tax has accelerated in several areas.\nFirst, the Credit Karma platform is leveraging data and AI to deliver personalized experiences and compelling tax offers. Second is the innovation with TurboTax Live to deliver speed and confidence to prior year assisted customers, particularly with full service. where we can get taxes done in as little as an hour using data, AI and our expert platform at scale. And third, Intuit Assist, our Gen AI-powered financial assistance, helping customers in key areas where confidence matters most. For example, understanding their refund or getting answers to their questions as if they're talking to an expert.\nWe ran many experiments during the extension season, and the learnings give us confidence in our game plan to win this tax season. We believe this is Intuit's the -- most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our platform. We're delivering experiences where the hard work is done for you with a gateway to human expertise, powering our customers' prosperity and accelerating penetration of our $300 billion in TAM.\nThe launch of Intuit Assist is the result of years of investment in data and AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform. And with our Gen AI operating system, GenOS, we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough AI experiences across the platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in Gen AI which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way.\nWe are creating a future of done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise, fueling their financial success. Intuit Assist powered by Gen AI is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade. Let me share a few updates on Intuit Assist across our offerings.\nFirst, Mailchimp. We're rolling out 2 new Gen AI experience design to help our customers grow their revenue and save time. These include AI-driven audience segmentation and marketing automation. I'll share more on those in just a moment.\nSecond, TurboTax. As I shared earlier, during the extension season, we tested new Gen AI experiences to deliver higher confidence for our DIY customers. This includes in topic accuracy check and personalized explanations throughout the filing process that help explain a customer's tax outcome. We're excited about rolling out these experiences this season.\nThird, QuickBooks. We are testing Gen AI to help customers save time and run their business with complete confidence, including a digital expert that can surface business insights and allow customers to dig deeper or connect them to a human expert. For example, we're serving our proactive business insights to customers with an actionable business summary. These customers are using the business summary as a launching point to learn, create reports directly using Intuit Assist and take actions to drive their business success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months and in the future, we plan to automate these actions and do the work for our customers.\nFourth, Credit Karma. We're testing Gen AI to help our customers find the products that are right for them in a highly personalized way. For example, based on our research, prime members spend an average of 5 hours online comparing credit card benefits. With our members' credit data and spending history from accounts they choose to link to Credit Karma, we can use Gen AI to help members select the right credit card for them optimized based on their personal spending history. This is designed to increase engagement with our members and help them improve their financial health and drive financial success.\nThese experiences will be rolled out in the coming months. We are excited by Intuit Assist's early progress. It will change our relationship with customers as we move from a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that our customers rely on daily to power their prosperity. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform.\nLet me now highlight progress across 2 of our 5 big bets. As a reminder, our 5 big bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.\nOur fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid to paying a supplier.\nToday, easier discovery, auto-enable payments, instant deposit and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. Total online payment volume growth was strong in the quarter at 21%. The -- We're also making good progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We made our bill pay offering widely available to customers during the quarter.\nWhile it's early, we are seeing mid-market customers choosing the paid subscription offering at approximately 2x the rate of non mid-market customers, indicating this paid offering is resonating with larger customers.\nTurning to Mailchimp. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. As I shared earlier, we're rolling out several features powered by Intuit Assist in time for peak holiday season for many of our customers. Let me highlight 2 of these impactful benefits designed to help our customers grow their revenue while saving time.\nFirst, AI-driven audience segmentation, which allows small businesses to target specific audiences. Many customers don't use audience segmentation today despite the fact that it can drive up to 60% lift in average order revenue or average order value over 12 months. With Intuit, a customer can use conversational language to more quickly build segments and use them as a part of a marketing campaign.\nSecond, AI-powered marketing automation, which are automated workflows that help small businesses reach their customers in uniquely tailored way. Today, many of our customers don't use marketing automation because they are time consuming the setup even though they can help them drive higher revenue. With Intuit Assist, Mailchimp creates marketing automation, which can easily be turned on and e-mail content can be generated and edited.\nOur fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, 800,000 of which are already in our franchise, but using a core QBO or desktop product. Online mid-market customer and revenue growth remained strong and we are driving increased adoption of QuickBooks Advanced, payments and payroll, resulting in ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers with a full ecosystem of services.\nWe are proud of our innovation and the impact that we're making on our customers' lives. We also continue to make an impact on the communities that we serve. This quarter, we launched Intuit for education, a new financial literacy program to provide Gen Z and Gen of students access to Intuit products and teach some personal and small business finance skills. We also announced the first set of winners of our coal field solar phone, providing grants in Seven-Eye solar energy projects in coal mining communities to help build a sustainable future.\nWrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with Gen AI across our platform, we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We are also delighted to be 1 of the only 8 Fortune 500 companies named to Fortune's inaugural top 50 AI Innovators list. With that, let me now hand it over to Sandeep.\n\nSandeep Singh Aujla\n\nSVP of Finance for SBSEG & Technology Organization, Executive VP and CFO\n\nThank you, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we delivered very strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $3 billion, up 15%. GAAP operating income of $307 million versus $76 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $960 million versus $662 million last year, up 45% and -- GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 versus $0.14 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.47 versus $1.66 last year, up 49%. The -- I am pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year.\nTurning to the business segment. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter, driven by online ecosystem, which grew 20%. And -- Our results demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings, which continue to resonate with customers as they look to grow their businesses and improve cash flow in any economic environment. with the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, a strategic focus within a Small Business and Self-employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.\nFirst, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 19% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q1, driven primarily by Payroll, Mailchimp, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking.\nWithin Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting the payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. In Mailchimp, revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. And within Payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup approach. On a constant currency basis, total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16%.\nThe Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the first quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high single digits. We are more than 2/3 of the way through a 3-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. In conjunction with our business model transition, we also raised prices across multiple desktop products in October, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem to revenue growth this year as we complete the remaining part of the 3-year transition.\nOur focus is to continue innovating across our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term.\nMoving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $405 million in Q1, down 5% year-over-year. We saw partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards during Q1. We -- This performance was consistent with our expectations and a prudent approach to guidance given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a product basis, the decline in Q1 was driven primarily by macroeconomic trends across personal loan, auto insurance, home loans and alone, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma money.\nShifting to the consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $187 million and grew 25% in the quarter and ProTax revenue was $42 million and grew 24%. The -- During the quarter, we saw stronger-than-expected TurboTax return volume from states, both with and without extended tax deadlines and strong performance in share of total returns during extension season.\nAs Sasan shared earlier, we are excited about our innovation across TurboTax. The multiple experiments we ran during the extension season, bolster our confidence in our game plan to win this coming tax season.\nNow let me briefly touch on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions that remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and $5.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. In September, we raised $4 billion in secured -- sorry, in senior notes to repay the outstanding balance on an unsecured term loan. These notes carry a weighted average coupon of 5.29%, approximately 1 point lower than the term loan rate at the end of Q4.\nAs a reminder, during Q1, we made tax payments of approximately $710 million that were deferred from fiscal 2023 due to the IRS disaster area tax release. We also repurchased $603 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors our aim is to be in the market each quarter. And lastly, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on January 18, 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nAs I stated earlier, I'm pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in fiscal 2024, highlighting the strength of our platform within the uncertain macroeconomic environment that is consistent with our expectations. We have a proven playbook and a track record of managing for the short and the long term, including controlling discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in an even greater position of strength.\nMoving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12%; GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18% and non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14%, GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. We -- Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 11% to 12%. GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.31. The -- As a reminder, we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nAll right. Well, thank you, Sandeep. And to wrap it up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress across our 5 big bets. and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe this will change our relationship with customers, becoming their trusted adviser, leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in town.

Kim, thank you, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We grew full year revenue 13%, delivered strong operating margin expansion and exited the year with momentum. Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our platform and diversity of our portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times.\nThis past year, we expanded our operating margin again while investing in the most important areas to drive durable long-term growth. We're guiding to another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2024, even with a macroeconomic environment that is uncertain.\nWe're entering Intuit's most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core feeling innovation across our 5 big bets. We've made strong progress transforming from a tax and accounting platform where consumers and small businesses have to [indiscernible] to achieve the benefit that they are seeking to a global financial platform where we do the hard work for them.\nNow we're creating a future of done for you, the future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers to fuel their financial success. This future is only possible because of our history of significant investments in our platform, talent, data and AI and now our accelerated investments in genereative AI.\nAt the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data, intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal transactional and behavioral data for 100 million customers. For small businesses, we have a 360-degree view of their business and customers.

We are using our data to fine-tune our own financial large language models that specialize in solving tax accounting, cash flow, marketing and personal finance challenges.\nThe investments that we've made in data and AI over the years allow us to introduce innovation at an accelerated rate. Intuit's rich data platform is a powerful foundation that allows us to create innovative AI-assisted experiences for all of our customers powering their prosperity.\nIn June, we introduced our generative AI operating system called GenOS to ignite innovation at scale for the benefit of millions of consumers and small businesses. GenOS empowers Intuit technologies to create breakthrough generative AI experiences. We are using a platform approach, giving our teams across intuitive resources and the tools they need to design, build, test and deploy these new experiences with unparalleled speed.\nThis includes our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers in a cost-effective way. We are entering Intuit's most exciting era yet and believe the next several years will be game changing. On September 6, we'll be hosting Intuit's Innovation Day, a virtual event where we will unveil exciting GenAI innovation across our platform and how it will drive business growth in the years ahead.\nWe look forward to sharing more with you then. Now let me turn to our big bets, which are driving growth and benefits for our customers today. I'd like to highlight some examples of recent progress in one of our big bets. And as a reminder, our 5 big bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be at the center of small [indiscernible] and disrupt the small business mid-market.\nOur fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continue to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid.\nToday, easy discovery auto-enabled payments, instant deposits and getting paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 22% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We're making significant progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow.\nWe see tremendous opportunity of 80% of businesses still pay other firms via paper checks. We recently expanded the availability of the beta of our native bill-pay solution by 10x. Turning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business.\nWe have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end QuickBooks and Mailchimp customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach.\nThis last quarter, we implemented our first generative AI capability in Mailchimp, the e-mail content generator, enabling customers to create faster e-mail campaign based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice.

This will help us with more money in our customers' pocket, save them time and ensure complete confidence in every financial decision they make.\nAs we lead this next technological shift, we are well positioned to power prosperity for our customers and communities that we serve with the leadership team that is built for the era of AI. Now let me turn it over to Sandeep. It's great to have you on the call, my friend.\n\nSandeep Singh Aujla\n\nSVP of Finance for SBSEG & Technology Organization, Executive VP and CFO\n\nThank you, Sasan. I'm excited to be here, and I look forward to meeting many of you in the future. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2023, including total revenue growth of 13%, strong margin expansion and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 16% and 22%, respectively. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we delivered results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $2.7 billion, up 12%, GAAP operating income of $17 million versus a loss of $75 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $627 million versus $433 million last year, up 45%.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.32 versus a loss of $0.20 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.65 versus $1.10 last year, up 50%. Now turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 24% for the full year, which included 4 points of benefit from the full year of Mailchimp's revenue this year versus 3 quarters last year.\nOnline Ecosystem revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 30% for the full year. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group Is threefold: growth at core, connected ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks online Accounting revenue grew 22% in Q4 and 26% in fiscal '23.\nGrowth for the quarter and fiscal year were driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services grew 20% in Q4, driven by payroll, meals, payments, capital and time tracking. For the full fiscal year '23, QuickBooks Online Services grew 34%, driven by Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time pricing.\nWithin payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting [indiscernible] solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue grew mid-teens in Q4. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offering to manage their cash flows as well as an increase in total payment volume for our customers.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally. By executing our fresh international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets, and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and minor.

Our platform remains critical to our customer success, and we continue to see them adopt multiple offerings across the platform to manage their business.\nDesktop ecosystem revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low 20s. We have approximately 2/3 of the way through a 3-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. We also raised our desktop prices across multiple products last September, consistent with our principle to price for value.\nLooking ahead, we expect continued strong Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth next year as we complete the remaining part of the 3-year transition. Our focus is to continue building out our Online Ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth of 15% to 20% per year long term.\nNow shifting to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $424 million in Q4, down 11%. On a product basis, the decline in Q4 was driven primarily by macroeconomic headwinds in personal loans, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma money.\nFull year revenue was $1.6 billion, down 9%. Credit Karma represented 11% of Intuit's total revenue in fiscal '23. We have seen continued stability across our core verticals which led to the improvement in year-over-year performance during Q4 versus Q3. For context, Credit cards and personal loans represented nearly 60% and nearly 30% of Credit Karma's revenue in fiscal '23, respectively.\nLooking ahead, we continue to anticipate Credit Karma annual revenue growth of 20% to 25% per year long term. Now shifting to Consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $4.1 billion in fiscal '23, up 6%. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began 4 years ago, introducing volatility into consumer group results. However, average annual plans over this 4-year period are more in line with the long-term trend.\nOver the past 4 years, Consumer Group revenue increased by an average of 10% annually, which aligns with our long-term growth expectations of 8% to 12%. While this was a unique tax season, I am proud of the progress the team made with transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live, which grew revenue 17% this year, while customers grew 12%.\nLooking ahead, we are confident in multiple growth drivers. First, we see large runway ahead of us with TurboTax Live, given our ability to use both GenAI and human experts covered by AI to deliver confidence for our customers. We are investing in scaling our full-service offering, which has good product market fit based on the highest product recommendation scores of any product at Intuit this year.\nSecond, we are planning to scale our business tax offering following the successful [indiscernible] this year; and third, we see significant opportunities ahead, driving Credit Karma members to TurboTax and giving TurboTax filers faster access to their money with Credit Karma money. Given the growth opportunities I just shared, we continue to expect annual Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% per year over the long term.\nTurning to the ProTax group. Revenue was $561 million in fiscal '23, up 3%. Now let me share more on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions remains our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments and $6.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet.\nApproximately $4.2 billion of this debt is maturing over the next 15 months, and we are evaluating refinancing opportunities subject to market and other conditions. We repurchased 465 million of stock during the fourth quarter and 2 billion during fiscal '23. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter.\nThe Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on October 17, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We recently finalized our 3- and 1-year strategic plan. I feel confident in the investments we are making to drive durable growth, including executing across our Big Bets and continuing to accelerated pace of innovation, particularly with GenAI.\nWe have a proven playbook for operating in both goods and difficult economic times. We manage for the short and the long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in a position of strength.\nMoving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2024 guidance includes total company revenue of $15.89 billion to $ 16.105 billion, a growth of 12%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group and a decline of 3% to a growth of 3% for Credit Karma.\nGAAP earnings per share of $9.37 to $9.67, growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $16.17 to $16.47, growth of 12% to 14%. We expect GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2024. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '24 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.21 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94 to $2.\nWe are taking a prudent approach with guidance, given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '24, we expect to pay approximately $700 million in cash debt payments related to fiscal '23, which were deferred due to the IRS disaster area tax relief. You can find a full fiscal 2024 and Q1 guidance details in our press release as well as on a fat sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you. Well, in wrapping up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress with our 5 Big Bets. The investments that we're making in GenAI and our leadership team driving our platform innovation. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in town.\nIn today's uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and mission-critical than ever to our customers. I look forward to your attendance at our Intuit Innovation Day on September 6 and Investor Day on September 28. With that, let's open it up to your questions.",

My name is Abby, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nThanks, Abby. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in our press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nSome of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Third quarter revenue grew 7%, lower than our expectations, reflecting a unique tax season, while we exceeded operating income and earnings per share guidance. We continue to see strong growth in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which grew 21% in the quarter. Our overall performance this year demonstrates the strength of our platform and portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times, while investing in the most important areas to drive long-term durable growth. We are raising our total company fiscal year revenue, operating income, earnings per share guidance. I'm very proud of our team as we now expect revenue and operating income to grow double digits and margins to expand even more than previously guided.\nLet's turn to tax. While this was a unique tax season, we're making good progress transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live. This year, we expect overall IRS returns to decline 2% through July 31, below our original expectations for total returns to grow 1%, which was more in line with historical trends. We also expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to decline nearly 3/4 of a point, also below our expectations. We believe the IRS and DIY category declines are driven by those who filed in order to receive pandemic aero stimulus and tax credit during the past several years but did not file taxes this season.\nAs a reminder, every point of IRS returns growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth and every point of DIY category share growth equals about 2.5 points of TurboTax revenue growth. The expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to approximately $200 million of negative impact to revenue for TurboTax versus our original expectations. We expect our share of total IRS returns to be down approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic aero stimulus filers who did not file taxes this season.\nEach tax season has been unique since the pandemic began 4 years ago, although average annual trends over this period are far more in line with longer-term trends. Over this 4-year period, we expect total IRS returns to be up approximately 1%, the DIY category share of total returns to be up 0.25 point and our share of total returns to be up approximately 20 basis points and average revenue per return to be up 9 points. These trends exclude users of the TurboTax Free File offering in prior year periods.\nOur strategy to transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live is working given the growth we've experienced in an environment where IRS returns are declining. We expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13% this year with TurboTax Live revenue up 19% and total average revenue per return to grow 12%. While TurboTax Live has driven strong growth over the last 6 tax season, we still have an immense opportunity to penetrate and transform the assisted tax segment at an accelerated rate. This remains our top priority as we prepare for next year.\nTurning to Small Business. While we're not immune to the macro environment, our platform is resilient. Total online payment volume growth moderated 5 points from Q2, growing 20%. Despite this, the shift to digitization and the power of our Small Business platform resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow.\nWe continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC. In Q3, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remained strong. Our Small Business platform, including QuickBooks and Mailchimp, remain critical to our customers' success.\nLet me now step back and talk about our company game plan to win. 4 years ago, we declared our strategy to become the global AI-driven expert platform and 5 Big Bets as the primary areas of focus to drive durable growth. We invested heavily in our data and AI capabilities to deliver accelerated innovation. Today, we have over 100 million customers on our platform and use 400,000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 55,000 tax and financial attributes per consumer to power 58 billion machine learning predictions per day.\nThe acquisitions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp each contributed a rich and additive data set, which helped deliver a 360-degree view of our customers. The scale of our data is an important competitive advantage and building block for our existing and future innovation with AI. We are accelerating reimagining our customer experiences with generative AI capabilities, which we believe will be the driver of our long-term growth. Our platform capabilities are key to continued acceleration across all of our 5 Big Bets.\nI'd like to highlight some examples of recent progress across these Big Bets. As a reminder, our Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock SMART Money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.\nOur first Big Bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. This data and technology that is foundational to everything that we do. We began investing in generative AI 2 years ago to accelerate our ability to fuel the success of consumers and small businesses. We implemented generative AI in Mailchimp, powering the e-mail content generator, enabling customers to create faster e-mail campaigns based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. We deployed large language models which recognize, summarize and generate text in our virtual expert platform to automatically summarize calls, reduce call times by hundreds of thousands of hours per year and reduce work for experts while improving efficiency. Our strategic investment in data and AI over the last 4 years positions us to lead through this technological shift, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months.\nWith our third Big Bet, our vision is for Credit Karma to become a comprehensive self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey. We are focused on growing Credit Karma Money, increasing member confidence to access financial products with Karma Guarantee, building out a richer experience for prime members and becoming the financial platform of choice for consumers. With the seamless integration of Credit Karma and TurboTax, we're innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25% despite near-term headwinds.\nI'll share a few examples. This season, we further streamlined the TurboTax filing experience into the Credit Karma app and the number of customers using the experience to file their taxes was over 5x higher. With Credit Karma Money, we're innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress. This year, we saw over 45% growth in the number of TurboTax Online customers who received the refund advance in a Credit Karma Money account. This integration allowed approved members to get money in their hands in as little as 1 minute after the IRS accepted their return and drove increased debit card purchase activity, contributing to more than 100% increase in Credit Karma Money revenue during the quarter. Members who use this offering show higher engagement on Credit Karma, which creates additional monetization opportunities over time. And with the [ Mailchimp ] now part of Credit Karma, we're building a new experience for members with [ trim ] credit scores, where Credit Karma is underpenetrated today.\nDuring the quarter, we began rolling out network, which helps Prime members better understand their wealth. Our fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In Payroll, our U.S. QBO Payroll customers grew double digits this quarter and the mix of online customers choosing our high-end offerings increased by over 1 point, driving higher ARPC. And in payments, we continue to innovate to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid. Today, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposits and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 20% total online payments volume growth this quarter.\nWe're making significant progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow. We see a tremendous opportunity at 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. And following our launch of the QuickBooks business network to millions of our QBO customers in January, we're piloting our own native bill pay solution and launched the initial beta of this functionality in QuickBooks earlier this month.\nTurning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with holistic go-to-market approach.\nThis quarter, we made great progress against these priorities. We're continuing to see better paid conversion, improving retention versus last quarter and stronger paid customer growth. This, along with higher revenue per customer, drove several point acceleration in revenue growth versus last quarter.\nLet me share some details around our progress. To help introduce new customers to Mailchimp and drive customer growth over time, we introduced 3 trials similar to what we offer in QBO. In early testing, this is already driving higher-pace conversion and a mix shift into our higher-end offerings. To drive stronger retention of mid-market customers, we continue to leverage our virtual expert platform to offer assisted onboarding with the goal of guiding these customers to more advanced features and increasing awareness and usage.\nThis quarter, we saw more than a 7-point increase in high-value customers going through this onboarding process versus last quarter, which we expect to help drive stronger retention over time. To drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages. Early results indicate this translation work is driving increased activation and ultimately can drive revenue growth.\nAnd our fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers, of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. Online mid-market customer growth remains strong, and we're driving ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers across our full ecosystem of services.\nWrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy, we're innovating at a high velocity, using the power of our platform, modern technology capabilities, data sets and artificial intelligence to deliver new offerings at scale. This is helping us put more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. We're well positioned to power prosperity for the people and communities that we serve as we enter this next technological shift.\nNow let me hand it over to Michelle.\n\nMichelle M. Clatterbuck\n\nChief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President\n\nThanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $6 billion, GAAP operating income of $2.8 billion versus $2.4 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $3.4 billion versus $2.9 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.38 versus $6.28 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $8.92 versus $7.65 last year.\nTurning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue of $3.3 billion grew 3% in Q3. There are 4 primary drivers of our consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2023, versus the prior year through July 31, 2022. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We expect total returns to decline 2% this year. This is below our original expectations of up 1% as overall industry growth continues to reflect the multiyear impact from the pandemic.\nThe second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category of total IRS returns to be down nearly 0.75 point by the end of the fiscal year, below our original expectations.\nThe third is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to decline by approximately 80 basis points this fiscal year, primarily reflecting pandemic ARO stimulus filers who did not file this season. As a result of these same industry dynamics, we expect our retention to decline this year.\nThe fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase 12% this year, as we expect TurboTax Live customers to grow 13% with TurboTax Live revenue up 19%. Historically, each point of total IRS returns growth corresponds to approximately 1 point of revenue growth for the Consumer Group and each point of DIY category share growth corresponds to approximately 2.5 points of revenue growth for the Consumer Group.\nUsing these historical sensitivities, the expected decline in total IRS returns and DIY category share equates to an approximate $200 million negative impact to revenue for the Consumer Group versus our original expectations.\nAs a result of this expected decline in IRS returns, we anticipate total customers to decline 5% this year. We expect TurboTax Online paying customers to decline 1% this year and a total of over 11 million customers who pay us nothing, down from 13 million last year. We now expect full year Consumer Group revenue growth of 5% to 6% versus our prior guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the expected declines in IRS returns and DIY category share I mentioned earlier.\nLooking back over the last 4 years, including our updated guidance for this fiscal year. We expect our revenue to have grown over 10% on average annually, in line with our long-term expectations. We continue to anticipate Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long term.\nTurning to the ProTax group. Revenue declined 5% in Q3. For the full year, we now expect ProTax revenue growth of 2% to 3%. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 21% during the quarter and Online Ecosystem revenue grew 23%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.\nFirst, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 25% in Q3 driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 21% in Q3. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter accelerated several points from low teens growth last quarter. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and customer growth.\nWithin Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in Payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payment offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q3. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 16% in the third quarter, and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew approximately 20%.\nWe're just over halfway through a 3-year transition to a subscription model for our desktop accounting solutions, making this revenue more predictable. We also raised our desktop prices for several products last September to price for value.\nLooking ahead, we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem revenue growth next quarter and as we complete the remaining part of the 3-year transition. We will continue to build out our Online Ecosystem and help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings when they're ready. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst longer term.\nAs a result of the strong growth we're seeing in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we are raising our full year segment revenue growth guidance to 24% from 19% to 20%.\nCredit Karma delivered revenue of $410 million in Q3, down 12%. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022. On a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto loans and auto insurance, partially offset by growth in Credit Karma Money and credit cards. We're seeing more stability across our core verticals.\nIn both credit cards and personal loans, we continue to see some partners tighten eligibility, while some expanded eligibility during the quarter. In personal loans, we continue to see partners facing funding constraints. We added more partners to the platform to help diversify our partner base. However, we continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after a very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We're updating our full year Credit Karma revenue growth guidance to a decline of 11% from a decline of 15% to 10%.\nOur financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $483 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter.\nThe Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable July 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nAs I shared consistently in the past, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly.\nI'm proud of the team for how effectively we have used our playbook to invest in the most important growth drivers to position Intuit for the future while maintaining earnings power this year despite the macro impact we are experiencing. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength.\nMoving on to guidance. We are increasing our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 12% to 13%, up from prior guidance of 10% to 12% growth; GAAP operating income growth of 19% to 20%, up from prior guidance of 9% to 13% growth; non-GAAP operating income growth of 21%, up from prior guidance of 17% to 19% growth; GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 7% to 8%, up from prior guidance of a decline of approximately 5% to 1%; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 20%, up from prior guidance of 15% to 17% growth.\nOur guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 9% to 10%, GAAP loss per share of $0.34 to $0.29 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.43 to $1.48. We expect a significant increase in our cash tax payments related to fiscal 2023 as a result of the tax law changes that require capitalization of certain R&D costs. With the recent IRS disaster area tax relief, we expect to pay approximately $700 million related to fiscal 2023 in Q1 of fiscal 2024. You can find our full fiscal 2023 and Q4 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Intuit, Inc.\n\nExcellent. Thank you, Michelle. I know you'll be with us for another couple of months. But since this is your last earnings call, I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for all that you've contributed to Intuit over the last 20 years. You have made me, my leadership team and the entire company better, and I am forever grateful.\nWrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and our 5 Big Bets and in an uncertain macro mission-critical than ever to our customers.\nLet's now open it up to your questions.",

My name is Abby, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Intuit Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nVP of IR, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Abby. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings.\nAll of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com.

A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As you read in our press release, we announced that Michelle will step down from the CFO role and plans to retire from Intuit. I'm pleased to share that Sandeep Aujla will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer on August 1, 2023. It is a well-crafted succession plan that will cover more in a few minutes, but let's first get started with the business.\nWe had another strong quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. Second quarter revenue grew 14%, fueled by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 20% and Consumer revenue growth of 26%.\nThis year, we are celebrating Intuit's 40th anniversary. We're incredibly proud of our history of reimagining the company and reinventing ourselves, which has enabled us to thrive during various technological shifts and economic cycles.\nHaving successfully navigated multiple platform shifts over the years, including our largest transformation to artificial intelligence in the era of digitization, we continue to be confident in our ability to fuel growth given our large TAM, low penetration, proven strategy and 5 Big Bets. We are proud to be the global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for the people and communities that we serve.\nI will first start with some thoughts about the tax season and our business in the current macro environment. As you know, the scale of our platform and rich data gives us unique insights into the lives and spending habits of 100 million-plus customers.\nOur small business performance continues to be very strong despite uncertainty in the broader macro environment. We continue to see strength in the areas that have the greatest impact, including the growth of our online mid-market customers, contributing to strong subscription revenue and higher ARPC.\nIn Q2, growth in both the number of companies running online payroll and the number of employees paid on our platform remains strong. Total online payments volume grew 25%, moderating some from the first quarter. We are seeing strong growth in the number of payment-enabled invoices sent by our small business customers, a good sign that our innovation is continuing to drive digitization.\nThe shift to digitization and the power of our small business platform, including QuickBooks and Mailchimp, resonate with customers as they grow their business and improve cash flow. We continue to observe that our AI-driven expert platform is critical to our customers' success.\nNow turning to tax. We're confident in our strategy to both extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category. Following a highly successful extension season last year, we doubled down on our learnings to further accelerate innovation to better serve our customers.\nFirst, we're evolving our TurboTax brand to increase awareness that we are the best alternative in the assisted tax segment for consumers and small businesses, a combined $30 billion TAM. Our new campaign, Come to TurboTax and Don't Do Your Taxes is resonating with our customers and is the key to our strategy as we focus on attracting customers from the assisted segment.\nSecond, we launched a number of high-impact TurboTax Live innovation. As part of our second Big Bet, we are solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. Building on our learnings from last season, we're continuing to use AI to bring in our customers' data and match them to the right experts to help customers get the maximum refund they deserve with confidence.\nTo help customers finish their taxes even more quickly. We've created a new gamified experience focused on efficiency backed by our lifetime guarantee. We evolved our Full Service offerings so filers can have their return completed in a single virtual session. We are off to a great start in tax, and we continue to be confident in our game plan to win.\nNow shifting to our 5 Big Bets, I would like to highlight some examples of recent progress. As a reminder, our Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.\nOur second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. In addition to what I've shared about TurboTax Live, we've achieved product market fit with QuickBooks Live, which we expect could help us penetrate non-consumption and drive breakthrough adoption. We're evolving our QuickBooks Live into a portfolio of expert services and are embedding these services as part of our lineup, similar to TurboTax Live.\nIn the second quarter, we launched a 3 expert-guided setup available for all new QBO customers leveraging our virtual expert platform. Early results indicate that customers using this offering have more confidence in and awareness of our full ecosystem of services, which translate into better retention and higher adoption of our service offerings.\nWith our third Big Bet, our vision for Credit Karma is to become the comprehensive self-driving financial platform that propels our members forward wherever they are on their financial journey. We are innovating across all verticals and continue to have confidence in our long-term growth expectations of 20% to 25% despite near-term headwinds.\nI'll share a few examples. We're innovating to help members get faster access to cash and make financial progress, including improving their credit score with the help of Credit Karma Money. For example, with the integration of TurboTax and Credit Karma, approved members can get money in their hands in as little as one minute after the IRS accepts their return.\nAs this is the largest paycheck of the year for many, this enables them to take care of immediate expenses, pay down debt or build savings. Members also receive recommendations for how to achieve their financial goals, such as creating an emergency savings fund with our high-yield savings account or building credit with credit builder. Members who activate credit builders see an average score increase of 21 points in as little as 30 to 45 days. Members who use Credit Karma Money show higher engagement on the Credit Karma platform.\nWe are driving more confidence for members with Karma Guarantee. As a reminder, Karma Guarantee offers indicate that members will either be approved or they'll receive $50. At the end of the quarter, 59% of members were eligible for at least one Karma Guarantee offer.\nWith Mint now part of the Credit Karma platform, we're beginning to build a new experience for members with prime credit scores, which Credit Karma is underpenetrated in today. Leveraging Mint, we see the opportunity to develop personalized product recommendations, leveraging net worth, transaction and spend data to highlight the product benefits that matter most to these members.\nOur fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. We continue to innovate to digitize money movement from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid.\nToday, easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, and we are making meaningful progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improve their cash flow.\nWe see a tremendous opportunity as 70% of B2B transactions are still completed with checks. This quarter, we launched a QuickBooks business network to millions of QuickBooks customers to further digitize B2B payments in the U.S. We're also building our bill pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future.\nNow turning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach.\nThis quarter, we made some great progress against these priorities. To help our small business customers run and grow their business in one place, we launched a real-time data sync that brings QBO data such as invoices, sales receipts, items, customers and addresses into Mailchimp. This puts customer and purchase data together all in one place to power our customers' success.\nTo help our customers plan, execute and track their marketing campaigns across multiple channels in one place, we launched a new capability called Campaign Manager. This reduces the number of tools needed to manage marketing and assess performance across channels. And to drive accelerated global growth and execute our refreshed international strategy, we're translating the product into multiple languages, including Spanish and Portuguese.\nAnd beyond the progress we've made on these priorities, the product lineup innovation, assisted onboarding and improved first-time use we shared last quarter is driving green shoots in paid conversion, which was up 2 points year-over-year in the second quarter.\nOur fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers of which 700,000 are already in our franchise today. As I mentioned earlier, online mid-market customer growth remains strong, and we are seeing increased adoption of QBO Advanced payments and payroll driving ARPC expansion as we serve these customers across our full ecosystem of services.\nWrapping up, we feel confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and 5 Big Bets. And in an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever to our customers. Now let me hand it over to Michelle.\n\nMichelle M. Clatterbuck\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Sasan. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $3 billion; GAAP operating income of $270 million versus $56 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $856 million versus $612 million last year; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.60 versus $0.35 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.20 versus $1.55 last year.\nTurning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 20% during the quarter, and Online Ecosystem revenue grew 24%. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.\nFirst, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 27% in Q2, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking, grew 21% in Q2.\nWithin payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue growth in the quarter was up low teens. Growth was driven by higher effective prices, aligning with our pricing for value philosophy and improving conversion.\nWe will continue to provide regular updates on the business so you can track our performance over time, including a deeper dive at Investor Day, similar to what we do for the rest of the business. Within payments, revenue growth reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow and an increase in total payment volume per customer.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 17% in Q2. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 10% in the second quarter.\nThe subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable, and we raised our desktop prices for several products in September to more closely align with pricing for value. We're about halfway through the 3-year transition to a subscription model for desktop.\nQuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew high teens during the quarter. We expect continued strong Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth as we progress through the back half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward.\nWe remain confident in our guidance for total Small Business and Self-Employed Group of 19% to 20% revenue growth this year. Consumer Group revenue of $516 million grew 26% in Q2, reflecting a faster forming season this year. We remain confident in our guidance for Consumer Group of 9% to 10% revenue growth for fiscal 2023.\nTurning to the ProTax Group. Revenue grew 7% in Q2, in line with our expectations. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $375 million in Q2, down 16%. This was slightly ahead of our expectations in its seasonally smaller quarter. As a reminder, Credit Karma represented 14% of our total revenue in fiscal 2022.\nOn a product basis, the decline was driven primarily by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. We continue to see an impact across all verticals in this uncertain macro environment.\nIn credit cards, we continue to see partners tighten eligibility in riskier cohorts. In personal loans, we continue to see pressure as partners further tighten eligibility, and we expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after a very strong growth in fiscal 2022. We remain confident in our guidance of a decline of 15% to 10% in fiscal 2023.\nOur financial principles guide our decisions, remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and investments and $7.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $500 million of stock during the second quarter.\nDepending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable April 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nAs I shared consistently in the past several quarters, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth.\nThe scale of our platform, along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play off it. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength.\nMoving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%, GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%.\nOur guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.82 to $6.89, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $8.42 to $8.49. You can also find our full fiscal 2023 and Q3 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nOn a personal note, as we announced today, I will be stepping down as CFO on July 31, and made it a priority over the last several years to focus on our long-term strategy for driving growth, and that includes ensuring I have a high-performing finance team with strong succession plans in place.\nSandeep has been an integral part of the finance leadership team for over 7 years, and I have no doubt he will be a terrific leader and CFO. He has shown his ability to drive key strategic priorities to create value for our business time and time again, and I look forward to working with him over the next 5 months to ensure a seamless transition. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Michelle. Well, while the CFO transition isn't official until August, I wanted to just take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for all that Michelle has contributed over the past 20 years at Intuit, including the last 5 years as CFO. She has been an amazing partner and will leave Intuit better than what she found it, and during Michelle's tenure as CFO, Intuit's market cap and revenue more than doubled.\nMichelle's commitment to developing top and diverse talent has created a deep bench of strong leaders, making for a very seamless transition. Sandeep will be an exceptional CFO, with his track record of leading outstanding performance across our Small Business and Self-Employed Group and our technology organizations.\nSo with that, let me go ahead and summarize. We are seeing continued momentum as we execute on our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform and growing Intuit revenue double digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation and the additions of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities.\nWe're proud that Intuit has been named #5 on Fortune's Most Admired Company in the software category, one of Glassdoor's 2023 Best Places to Work, and honored to be included among JUST Capital's Just 100 ranking for 2023. With that, let's now open it up to your questions.",

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nVP of IR, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Regina. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2022 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nSome of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong first quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to feel bullish about our momentum and execution across small business and tax. We're innovating at a high velocity using the power of our platform and modern technology capabilities to deliver new offerings at scale focusing on breakthrough adoption.\nWe continue to be focused on putting more money in our customers' pockets, saving them time and ensuring complete confidence in every financial decision they make. This is more important than ever in the current uncertain economic environment and helps us penetrate our large total addressable market of over $300 billion.\nNow let's turn to our first quarter results. Revenue grew 29%, including 13 points from the addition of Mailchimp. Total revenue growth was fueled by the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 38% or 19% excluding Mailchimp and 25% revenue growth in the Consumer Group driven by a strong October peak with new customers and extension filers.\nThe scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see charge volume growth, the number of employees paid, the hours worked per small business and cash reserves. These measures remain strong for those on our platform and inform our perspective on the health of small businesses.\nTurboTax had a robust finish to the tax season with a record number of innovations launched and tested in the October peak. I'm excited about this coming -- upcoming season, particularly our strategy to transform the assisted category, including the launch of Business Tax and TurboTax and Credit Karma platform integrations.\nNow turning to Credit Karma. At Investor Day and on our fourth quarter call earnings call, we shared that all Credit Karma verticals had been negatively impacted by the macro uncertainty. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into November, we saw further deterioration in all verticals.\nConsumer default rates remain relatively low by historical standards, reflecting strong consumer cash balances coming out of the pandemic. However, we continue to see partners pull back from extending credit, reflecting the uncertainty in the economic environment and the risk of deterioration in credit performance.\nGiven this context, Credit Karma revenue came in lower than expected for the quarter. We are lowering our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for Credit Karma to a decline of 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance of 10% to 15% growth. At the same time, we are reiterating our fiscal year 2023 revenue guidance for all other segments and reiterating our fiscal 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance.\nOur ability to maintain earnings power despite the lower Credit Karma revenue guidance shows the power of our diversified platform and our ability to balance platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our commitments.\nRegardless of the near-term macro volatility, we remain confident in our long-term revenue growth expectations of 20% to 25% for Credit Karma driven by our vision and innovation to become the self-driving financial platform fueling prosperity for all consumers.\nAt Investor Day, we shared how our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating our innovation and how our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate our success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future.\nAs a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Today, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets.\nOur first Big Bet is to revolutionize speed to benefit. Our platform enables us to innovate for our customers with speed and at scale, which is foundational to all of our Big Bets. Our evolution from a siloed technology stack to a platform leveraging shared capabilities is well underway. Our development environment enables speed and innovation. Engineers now have 6x the velocity of deploying code, resulting in accelerated innovation compared to fiscal year 2020.\nOur AI and fintech capabilities are well positioned to solve our customers' biggest problems, such as our money innovations across payments and payroll, advancements in TurboTax Live, QuickBooks Live and QuickBooks Advance, just to name a few. And we're doing that today with over 730 million AI-driven customer interactions per year, 2 million AI models in production, 58 billion machine learning predictions per day and over $465 billion in money moved during fiscal year 2022.\nOur second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customer face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually. During the October tax peak, our team launched a record 50 innovations to test and learn. Our learnings can help us transform our go-to-market campaign for the assisted segment; revamp the end-to-end TurboTax Live platform experiences with faster access to money via Credit Karma; and better serve the investor, Latino and self-employed segments. We are looking forward to the upcoming tax season.\nOur fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. With Mailchimp, we're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business.\nWe have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach.\nThis quarter, we launched a new brand campaign, refreshed our website, and launched an improved first-time use experience for new customers that help them more quickly find and use the feature that aligns with their unique business needs. We also launched a 1-hour assisted onboarding process for our high-value Mailchimp customers with the goal of guiding them to more advanced features to increase awareness and usage.\nThis program was launched in a record 4 weeks by leveraging components of our virtual expert platform, another example of the power of the Intuit platform capabilities. As a result of these enhancements and others, we're seeing a positive impact on customer growth and expansion and a lift in customers converting to pay.\nTurning to our money portfolio. We've made a tremendous investment over the last few years to expand our suite of money offerings to help small businesses get paid, pay others and access capital and manage their money. We continue to see strength in our charge volume driven by easier discovery, auto-enabled payments, instant deposit and getting paid upfront. This quarter, we made it even easier for more customers to access their cash quickly by removing friction and opening the funnel to more customers. We're also rolling out a new invoicing experience with a more streamlined workflow and improved design, which is driving an increase in the percentage of companies that send payment-enabled invoices.\nLooking ahead, we're tackling another big challenge for our small business customers, B2B payments. More than $2 trillion of invoices were managed in QuickBooks in fiscal year 2022. As we shared at Investor Day, we are launching the QuickBooks Business Network, which connects small business customers to each other, making it easier for them to do business. It's currently in beta testing, and we expect to launch more broadly later this fiscal year.\nWe're also building our own bill pay functionality in QuickBooks and plan to launch this capability in the future. We're excited about our opportunities for growth with Mailchimp and payments becoming the center of small business growth.\nWrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy and the power of our platform. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and more mission-critical than ever for our customers.\nWe have a large TAM with low penetration, secular shifts working in our favor, a diversified large-scale platform where we continue to invest heavily in innovation across our 5 Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers, resulting in top line growth and margin expansion. We're proud to be an employer of choice as well as the financial technology platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper.\nNow let me hand it over to Michelle.\n\nMichelle M. Clatterbuck\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we delivered revenue of $2.6 billion, GAAP operating income of $76 million versus $195 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $662 million versus $555 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.14 versus $0.82 a year ago, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.66 versus $1.53 last year.\nTurning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 38% during the quarter and 19% on an organic basis, excluding $264 million in Mailchimp revenue. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 60% in Q1 or 28% excluding Mailchimp.\nWith the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.\nFirst, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 29% in Q1, driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift.\nSecond, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 109% in Q1. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 28%. Mailchimp revenue included in online services was $264 million, up low teens versus a year ago, in line with our expectations. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offerings. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally, and we began to execute our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with Mailchimp. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 172% in Q1 and 19% on an organic basis excluding Mailchimp.\nDesktop Ecosystem revenue grew 7% in the first quarter. As a reminder, the subscription model for our desktop accounting solution makes this revenue more predictable, and we raised our desktop prices for several products in September to more closely align with QBO pricing. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-single digits during the quarter. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be our growth catalyst going forward.\nMoving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 2% to $425 million in Q1. This was below our expectations of mid-single-digit growth we shared at Investor Day due to further deterioration in all verticals the last few weeks of the quarter. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards, offset by headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans. As the macro environment continues to remain uncertain, we're seeing an impact across all verticals. Sasan touched on this briefly earlier, but let me unpack what we're seeing.\nIn credit cards, many financial institution partners have tightened eligibility, particularly in riskier segments. In personal loans, we saw continued pressure with many partners tightening eligibility further while increasing APRs. We continue to expect personal loan revenue to decline this year after very strong growth in fiscal 2022. As a result, we are reducing our fiscal 2023 Credit Karma revenue guidance to a decline of 15% to 10%. This embeds the current trends we're seeing and additional conservatism in the remainder of the year despite the expected continued rollout of several new innovations.\nConsumer Group revenue was $150 million, reflecting a strong finish to the tax season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted category in the tax prep market as we head into the next tax season. We're focused on making TurboTax a compelling destination for filers who prefer assistance to complete their taxes accurately and quickly.\nTurning to the ProTax Group. Revenue of $34 million was in line with our expectations. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash and investments and $7 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable January 18, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nAs I shared last quarter, we have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth.\nThe scale of our platform, along with our rich data, gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators that allow us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly. As Sasan shared earlier, we are reiterating our operating income and earnings per share expectation for fiscal year 2023 despite our lower revenue expectations for Credit Karma. We're able to do this by reducing spend in areas where we expect to see lower returns near term.\nLast quarter, I mentioned we identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios, and the adjustments we have made are an example. Given the breadth of our offerings and the power of our diversified platform, we have the ability to maintain earnings power despite our expectation for lower Credit Karma revenue. At the same time, we have the ability to make the necessary platform and product investments for the future while delivering on our short- and long-term commitments. We also have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense. We will continue to accelerate our innovation, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macro uncertainty in a position of strength.\nMoving on to guidance. For fiscal 2023, we are lowering our revenue guidance for Credit Karma as trends in all verticals further deteriorated in the last few weeks of the quarter and into November. We now expect revenue to decline 15% to 10% versus our previous guidance range of 10% to 15% revenue growth. We are reiterating our revenue expectations for all other segments and now expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12% versus the previous range of 14% to 16%.\nFor the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, we continue to expect 19% to 20% revenue growth. And for the Consumer Group, we continue to expect 9% to 10% revenue growth. In both businesses, we expect the majority of our growth this year to come from customer growth and mix.\nWe are reiterating our GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2023. This demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified platform and business model.\nSo to recap, for fiscal year 2023, we expect total company revenue growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income growth of 9% to 13%, non-GAAP operating income growth of 17% to 19%, GAAP diluted earnings per share to decline approximately 5% to 1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 15% to 17%.\nOur guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 8% to 9%, GAAP loss per share of $0.29 to $0.23, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.41 to $1.45. You can also find our full fiscal 2023 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Michelle. As you all heard from Michelle and I, we're seeing continued momentum as a result of our strategy of being a global AI-driven expert platform, growing Intuit double digits with margin expansion. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to your questions.",

I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021, and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nSome of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.\nWe had a very strong fourth quarter, ending the year with momentum as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We continue to be focused on solving our customers' biggest problems by putting more money in their pockets, eliminating work and saving people time and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make.\nFull year revenue reached $12.7 billion, up 32%, including the addition of Mailchimp and a full year of Credit Karma. Excluding Mailchimp, revenue grew 24%. Total revenue growth was fueled by 38% growth for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, which includes 16 points from Mailchimp. Consumer Group revenue grew 10%, and Credit Karma had an outstanding year with revenue of $1.8 billion, up 58% on a pro forma basis year-over-year.\nI'm very proud of the team's performance, delivering strong growth and strong margins, which very few companies at our scale are able to achieve. I'm optimistic about our strategy and opportunities for growth, especially considering an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. The Intuit platform remains mission-critical for powering our customers' prosperity. I'm pleased we are guiding to another year of strong revenue growth and strong margins in fiscal year 2023.\nOur global AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation, and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future.\nAs a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize key benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth, and disrupt the small business mid-market. We will share more on our vision and the outcomes we're driving across each of these Big Bets next month at our Investor Day.\nNow let me turn to a topic that I know is top of mind for many of you, the resiliency of our business and the slowing macroeconomic environment. Our company is in a significantly different position than it was during the last recession more than a decade ago. Our platform and cloud-based offerings have significantly expanded to become the platform of choice for consumers and small businesses. Therefore, Intuit is even more mission-critical for our customers we serve. We have highly predictable reoccurring revenue, and much of our business is subscription-based.\nAdditionally, the scale of our platform along with our rich data gives us the unique ability to see leading indicators, such as growth in charge volume, number of hours employees are working and number of workers paid, bank account balances of our small business customers, credit card utilization and delinquency rates for members. This allows us to be forward-looking and adjust quickly.\nLet me share how we think about our business in context of a mild recession. To start, in fiscal year 2022, 51% of our revenue came from the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 35% from our Consumer and ProTax businesses, and 14% from Credit Karma.\nFirst on tax. Our tax businesses are very resilient, and we do not expect a mild recession to have any significant impact.\nNext, with Small Business and Self-Employed Group, QuickBooks and Mailchimp are mission-critical for our customers whose livelihood depends on our platform. In fiscal year 2022, approximately 80% of the Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue was subscription-based. As a reminder, Mailchimp is also primarily subscription-based, which adds to the scale of our subscription volume.\nThe approximately 20% is transactional-based and includes revenue from QuickBooks payments, capital and per employee pricing for time tracking and payroll. In a mild recessionary environment, we may see an impact on these transactional businesses. In Q4, we did not see any impact. This demonstrates how mission-critical our platform is, especially in this environment.\nFinally, turning to Credit Karma. This is the business that could be most impacted by weakening economic environment. As a reminder, this business represents 14% of Intuit's revenue in fiscal year 2022. While we expect member engagement to be strong in any economic environment, our financial institution partners could tighten access to credit.\nIn Q4, we experienced increased volatility in personal loans. Many partners that securitized loans are facing a more challenging funding environment as interest rates rise. For context, personal loans represent just over 1/3 of Credit Karma's revenue in fiscal year 2022. Although several personal loan partners tightened underwriting during the quarter, we were able to offset some of this with volume from other partners. This demonstrates the power of the platform.\nIn credit cards, we've not seen any significant impact. We continue to monitor delinquency rates, which we view as a leading indicator for future credit card origination trends. While delinquency rates have increased slightly, they remain near historical lows. We expect credit cards to be less negatively impacted by a mild recession than personal loans. In the mild recession of '01-'02, credit card originations declined only a few points. And for context, credit cards represent nearly half of credit cards revenue in fiscal year 2022.\nWe do expect Lightbox to continue to be a differentiator for Credit Karma as this technology allows lenders to deploy their targeting models in an encrypted environment and leverage thousands of anonymized financial attributes related to Credit Karma members and TurboTax customers. This provides more certainty to members and partners on the platform as recommendations are personalized.\nCurrently, no one else can replicate this. Partners usage of Lightbox at the end of fiscal year 2022 was at an all-time high, representing nearly 70% of credit card and personal loan transactions on a combined basis. This was up nearly 15 points from the prior year. We expect Lightbox to help make Credit Karma's business more resilient in a recessionary environment. Now with that as context, the guidance we are providing today assumes current demand trends continue.\nWrapping up, we feel more confident than ever in our long-term business strategy. In an uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our platform are more important and mission-critical than ever. As part of our 3- and 1-year plan that the Board just approved, we are investing heavily in innovation within each of our Big Bets to deliver benefits for our customers while delivering top line growth and margin expansion given the strength of our operational playbook.\nCombined with our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, Intuit remains in a position of strength. We're proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper.\nNow let me hand it over to Michelle.\n\nMichelle M. Clatterbuck\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Sasan. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2.4 billion, down 6%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year, partially offset by the addition of Mailchimp; GAAP operating loss of $75 million versus operating income of $402 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $433 million versus $715 million last year; GAAP loss per share of $0.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.37 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.10 versus $1.97 last year. You can find our full fiscal 2022 results in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nTurning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 41% during the quarter and 20% on an organic basis, excluding $265 million in Mailchimp revenue. In fiscal 2022, revenue grew 38% and 22% on an organic basis. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 66% in Q4 or 32% excluding Mailchimp, and 61% for the full year or 34% excluding Mailchimp.\nWith the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.\nFirst, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 34% in fiscal Q4 driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. In fiscal 2022, QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 33%.\nSecond, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time Tracking, grew 116% in fiscal Q4. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 29%. In fiscal 2022, QuickBooks Online Services revenue grew 107%. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 34%. Mailchimp revenue included in Online Services was $265 million.\nAlthough we're making progress with this business as we accelerated our year-over-year revenue growth several points in fiscal Q4 versus when we closed the acquisition in fiscal Q2, revenue was slightly below our expectations. During the quarter, we focused on product innovation to improve conversion ahead of peak season, which starts in September, and therefore, pulled back on marketing investments. I'm confident that these are the right steps to position us well as we head into Mailchimp peak season. We expect to ramp up marketing in September after these enhancements are complete. We continue to have confidence in our game plan and acceleration priorities for Mailchimp.\nWithin Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in Payroll customers and a mix shift to higher-end offering. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 193% in fiscal Q4 and 23% on an organic basis excluding Mailchimp. Desktop Ecosystem revenue grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew low double digits in fiscal 2022 driven by price increases and customer growth. Nearly all of our desktop accounting revenue is now subscription-based, similar to our online accounting offerings.\nMoving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 17% to $475 million in Q4, another record revenue quarter, driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. Full year revenue was $1.8 billion. We've had 2 exceptional years for this business, growing 37% in fiscal 2021 and 58% in fiscal 2022 on a pro forma basis, well above our longer-term expectations of 20% to 25%. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by credit cards and personal loans. This was partially offset by headwinds in auto insurance and home loans. As Sasan shared earlier, we're seeing increased volatility in personal loans.\nWe continue developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead. Consumer Group revenue was $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022, up 10%. I'm proud of our execution this season as we grew share and average revenue per return.\nTurning to the ProConnect Group. We reported $546 million in revenue for fiscal 2022, up 6%. Our financial principles guide our decisions remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments and $6.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $508 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $1.9 billion during fiscal 2022. The Board approved a new $2 billion repurchase authorization, giving the company a total authorization of $3.5 billion to repurchase shares. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share payable October 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nWe have an operating system we use to run the company, and this includes a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. As a nearly 40-year-old company, we've been through many economic cycles. Our first priority is to do the right thing for customers, giving them access to the tools and offerings they need most. We manage for the short and long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. The economic environment was a consideration as we look ahead.\nWe've identified several levers we can pull to deliver against our financial principles in a variety of scenarios based on where we see opportunities across our platform. Many of these can be pulled in real time should the need arise in areas like marketing spend, travel, hiring and others as we progress through the year in order to maintain earnings power while positioning the company for a stronger future.\nWe have a strong balance sheet that enables us to play offense in any macro environment. These principles are intended to accelerate our innovation in the future, and our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from any downturn in a position of strength.\nMoving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2023 guidance includes revenue of $14.5 billion to $14.7 billion, growth of 14% to 16%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 19% to 20% for Small Business and Self-employed, 9% to 10% for the Consumer segment and 10% to 15% for Credit Karma. As a reminder, Credit Karma grew 58% on a pro forma basis year-over-year in fiscal 2022, well ahead of our long-term expectation of 20% to 25%. Our overall guidance assumes recent demand trends continue.\nOur guidance also includes GAAP earnings per share of $6.92 to $7.22, non-GAAP earnings per share of $13.59 to $13.89. We expect a GAAP tax rate of 25% in fiscal 2023. Our fiscal 2023 guidance includes stock-based compensation of $1.8 billion, an increase of 39% over fiscal 2022. Approximately 25% of this total is equity granted as part of the Credit Karma and Mailchimp transactions, and approximately 75% of this total is related to our broad-based equity program designed to attract, retain and incentivize employees. Looking ahead, we expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to flatten over the next few years.\nOur guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 includes revenue growth of 23% to 25%, GAAP loss per share of $0.43 to $0.37, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.20. You can find our full Q1 and fiscal 2023 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nGoing forward, we're bringing Mint and Credit Karma together under a unified personal finance strategy. Starting in fiscal Q1, we will be reporting Mint as part of the Credit Karma segment. This is reflected in the guidance I shared today but is not material to the growth rate.\nI also want to share an important change regarding our long-term expectations for Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth going forward. In the past, we shared with you our aspiration to achieve Online Ecosystem revenue growth of better than 30% organically over time. We first provided this expectation in fiscal 2017 when our Online Ecosystem revenue was $850 million. It comprised less than 1/3 of our small business ecosystem, and we were early in our journey building our online presence. Today, the Online Ecosystem is over 5x larger at $4.4 billion, and it comprised more than 2/3 of total small business revenue in fiscal 2022.\nThis, along with the fact that the majority of the business is now subscription-based given the shift to subscription in desktop. We believe the right measure moving forward is to look at the performance of our overall business rather than just the Online Ecosystem. We now expect total Small Business and Self-Employed long-term revenue growth of 15% to 20%, up from 10% to 15% previously. While the Online Ecosystem will continue to be our growth catalyst, we will no longer provide specific Online Ecosystem goals.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nStewart Kirk Materne\n\nSenior MD & Fundamental Research Analyst, Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\n\nGreat. Michelle, thank you. As you have now heard from Michelle and I, we are seeing continued momentum across the company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform. With our accelerated organic innovation and the addition of Credit Karma and Mailchimp, we are the leading global financial technology platform that powers prosperity for people and communities. We have a large TAM, secular shifts working in our favor, and a highly predictable set of revenue streams. Our innovation is unlocking new opportunities for our platform and delivering truly game-changing benefits for our customers. Intuit remains a best place to work around the world, and I'm proud of the team and what we've accomplished this year.\nNow let me turn it over to you for any questions that you may have.\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nVP of IR, Intuit Inc.\n\nChelsea, I think we're ready to take questions.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) With that, I will now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nVP of IR, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Latif. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO.\nBefore we start, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nSome of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm proud of our continued momentum as we execute on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses.\nWe have a nearly $300 billion addressable market driven by tailwinds that included a shift to virtual solutions, acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team's execution, is contributing to the strength of our performance.\nThird quarter revenue grew 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp. It was another strong quarter for our Small Business and Self-Employed Group, with revenue up 42%, 20% organically. Credit Karma posted another quarter, with revenue at an all-time high, up 48%. And I'm proud of how the team executed in the Consumer Group in an another unusual tax season.\nWe are confident in our business trajectory and are raising our total Intuit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2022. We expect to grow total company revenue 31% to 32% as our platform is in demand now more than ever.\nLet me now turn to tax. Our multiyear strategy is to extend our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transform the assisted category with TurboTax Live. This strategy is working. This fiscal year, we expect our share of total IRS returns to be up approximately 1 point and our share of the do-it-yourself category to increase 2 points. We're also growing average revenue per return once again.\nWe expect customers in underpenetrated segments, including Latinx, self-employed and investors, to grow double digits in total. Within transforming the assisted category, we continue to make progress connecting people to experts with TurboTax Live. We anticipate achieving a significant milestone with TurboTax Live revenue reaching $1 billion in fiscal year 2022, growing approximately 30% and customers growing 20%. Note that, last year, TurboTax Live customer growth significantly benefited from the introduction of the free basic offer.\nWe're proud of the progress against our strategy. However, slower total IRS returns growth is resulting in an expected Consumer Group revenue growth of 10% this fiscal year. We now expect overall IRS returns to decline 3% through July 31 compared to IRS returns growth of 3% to 4% in the last 2 seasons.\nThis was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season and overall IRS extensions up significantly year-over-year, with the number of TurboTax customers filing extensions nearly doubling. As a reminder, every point of IRS return growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth.\nWe now expect the do-it-yourself category share of total IRS returns to be flat this year, below our expectations after growing an average of approximately 1 point per year over the last 2 years. Our hypothesis is that the do-it-yourself category performance was weaker than we expected due to the onetime stimulus filers, approximately 30% of whom were paid customers for us last season.\nWhile the last 3 years were anything but normal, over the period, IRS returns grew on average 1 percentage per year and the do-it-yourself category gained an average of just over 0.5 point of share per year, consistent with long-term trends. Looking ahead, we expect more normal total IRS returns growth.\nMore broadly, our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are revolutionize speed to benefit, continue -- connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.\nToday, I would like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our third Big Bet is to unlock smart money decisions. We continue to see strong momentum with Credit Karma, a data platform where a powerful network effects solving a 2-sided problem. Our vision is to unlock smart money decisions by creating an autonomous financial platform that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and connect them to insights and advice.\nIn Credit Karma, we continue to innovate across all verticals, all proprietary Lightbox technology allows us to better personalize and connect members to the products that are right for them, providing more certainty to members and partners on the platform. We continue to see strength in credit cards and personal loans, with combined Lightbox penetration remaining very high.\nLightbox approximately doubles the average approval rate of members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma, making it a competitive differentiator for both our members and partners.\nWe continue to make progress combining our capabilities to fuel the success of both TurboTax and Credit Karma. We integrated Credit Karma Money into TurboTax filing experience, more than tripling the number of TurboTax Online customers who deposited their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year.\nThis gave them the ability to receive the refund up to 5 days earlier with direct deposits. These TurboTax customers drive Credit Karma member growth and like other Credit Karma members, get access to personalized products across the platform, which accelerates engagement over time.\nOur fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we continue to innovate to help customers overcome this challenge. In payments, we offer a single place where small businesses can get paid, pay others, manage money and access capital.\nWe are seeing more customers accessing loans through QuickBooks Capital, with loan volume at record level, more than tripling year-over-year in April. We have increased discoverability and expanded eligibility in the product. This is driven by our rich data and proprietary risk models, which allows us to use our customers' data on their behalf and with their permission to offer access to loans.\nIn addition to cash flow, getting and engaging customers remain a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. With Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers, to help them grow and run their business.\nWe have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. We continue moving with speed as we focus on product innovation, marketing and improving conversion.\nFirst, we launched a customers and leads tab within QuickBooks Online, which allows new and existing customers to send revenue and customer data from QBO to MailChimp in real time, where small businesses can segment customers and automate marketing campaigns based on QuickBooks data. We're also saving customers time by bringing in their contact list into Mailchimp from other partners and platforms.\nSecond, we continue to invest in marketing. We are seeing early signs that the recent investments in paid media are driving growth in customer sign-ups across large markets like the U.S. We expect this to take time for it to translate into financial results, but we're excited about the potential.\nAnd third, we're focused on opportunities to improve conversion as we look at top-of-the-funnel traffic to how we deliver benefits in the product for our customers. This includes highlighting product benefits as soon as customers enter the product, improving the checkout page experience and streamlining in-product navigation.\nOur fifth Big Bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced. During the quarter, we launched in Canada, the first market outside of the U.S., expanding the geographic reach of this offering.\nAccelerating innovation and executing our strategy starts with our employees. I'm proud to share that we were Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For list for the 21st year in a row, this year proudly ranking #11. We remain focused on creating an environment where our employees can bring their whole selves to work and do the best work of their lives, which is reflected in our employee retention rate that is above our peers.\nWrapping up, we feel confident in our long-term business strategy. Our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, our speed of innovation and the demand for our platform continues to put Intuit in a position of strength. In the current macro environment, the benefits of our platform are more important than ever. We're proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world, who rely on Intuit to prosper.\nNow let me hand it over to Michelle.\n\nMichelle M. Clatterbuck\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Sasan. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, up 35%, including 6 points from the addition of Mailchimp, GAAP operating income of $2.4 billion versus $1.9 billion last year, non-GAAP operating income of $2.9 billion versus $2.2 billion last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.28 versus $5.30 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $7.65 versus $6.07 last year.\nOn May 4, we entered into a settlement agreement with the state attorneys general regarding our advertising practices related to free tax preparation. This resulted in a $141 million onetime charge in our fiscal third quarter. Under the terms of the settlement, we admitted no wrongdoing. We are pleased to put this issue behind us so we can continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions for our customers.\nExcluding the settlement charge, our fiscal third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would have been 250 basis points higher and GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively.\nTurning to the business segments. Consumer Group revenue was $3.2 billion, up 32%, reflecting the earlier IRS tax filing deadline this year. I'm proud of our execution this season as we expect to gain share and grow our average revenue per return.\nThere are 4 primary drivers of our Consumer business. This data reflects our expectations through July 31, 2022 versus the prior year through July 31, 2021. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. We now expect total returns to decline 3% this year, below our original expectation. Every point of IRS returns growth equals about 1 point of TurboTax revenue growth.\nThe second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. We expect the DIY category share of total IRS returns to be flat by the end of the year, also below our expectation.\nThe third driver is our share. We expect our share of total IRS returns to expand approximately 1 point this year, and our share of the DIY category to be up 2 points, excluding users of the TurboTax Free File offering in prior year periods.\nThe fourth is average revenue per return, which we expect to increase this year driven by a mix shift to TurboTax Live and our premier offering used by investors as well as fewer free customers.\nAs a result of the weaker IRS returns, we now expect total customer growth of 1%, including TurboTax Online paying customer growth of 8% this year. We expect the base of customers paying us nothing in our commercial-free offering to decline 11% this year to just over 13 million, from over 14 million last year. This was driven by onetime stimulus filers that did not return this season, approximately 30% of whom were paying customers.\nWe now expect Consumer Group revenue growth of approximately 10% in fiscal 2022 versus our prior guidance of 10% to 11%, reflecting the decline of total IRS returns I mentioned earlier. We continue to expect Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% long term.\nTurning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 10% in Q3, reflecting a shift in the timing of the IRS tax filing window year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect ProConnect Group revenue growth of 4% to 5%.\nIn the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 42% during the quarter or 20% on an organic basis, excluding $257 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 67% or 31%, excluding Mailchimp.\nWith the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core; connect the ecosystem; and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue grew 32% in fiscal Q3 driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift.\nSecond, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online Services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, Payroll, Payments, Capital and Time tracking, grew 121% in fiscal Q3. Excluding Mailchimp, Online Services revenue grew 28%.\nMailchimp revenue recorded in Online Services was $257 million in the quarter, and this was in line with our expectations. Within Payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects growth in Payroll customers and a mix shift to our Full Service offering. Within Payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 221% in fiscal Q3 on a constant currency basis and 29% on an organic basis, excluding Mailchimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC.\nDesktop Ecosystem revenue grew 3% in the third quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew mid-teens driven by strong customer growth and price increases. Longer-term, we don't expect the Desktop business to be a growth driver for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group.\nMoving on to Credit Karma. Revenue grew 48% to $468 million in Q3, another record revenue quarter driven primarily by growth in average revenue per monthly active user. On a product basis, revenue growth was driven primarily by personal loans and credit cards and to a lesser extent, auto loans.\nWe are developing the emerging verticals by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. As Sasan shared earlier, we saw a more than tripling in the number of TurboTax Online customers who deposit their refund into their Credit Karma Money account this year. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead.\nTurning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As we've shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time.\nWe take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities, with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment.\nOur first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We return excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends.\nWe finished the quarter with approximately $3.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $489 million of stock during the third quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable July 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nMoving on to guidance. We are raising our full year fiscal 2022 revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to reflect the momentum we've seen throughout the year in the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and Credit Karma.\nOur updated fiscal 2022 guidance includes revenue of $12.633 billion to $12.674 billion, a growth of 31% to 32%, including Mailchimp as of November 1 and a full year of Credit Karma, up from prior guidance of 26% to 28% growth. Excluding $765 million to $770 million in Mailchimp revenue, growth of 23% to 24%, up from prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth. GAAP earnings per share of $6.95 to $7.01, down from prior guidance of $7 to $7.17 -- excuse me, $7.16.\nWe now expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% this year, up from 18% previously. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.68 to $11.74, up from prior guidance of $11.48 to $11.64. Our fiscal 2022 guidance includes the impact of the $141 million onetime charge related to the state attorneys general settlement. Excluding this charge, our expected GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin would be approximately 110 basis points higher in fiscal 2022, above our prior guidance.\nExpected fiscal 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share would be approximately $0.37 and $0.38 higher, respectively. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 includes a revenue decline of 8% to 9%, reflecting the earlier tax filing deadline this year versus last year, GAAP loss per share of $0.53 to $0.47 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.94 to $1. You can find our full Q4 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Michelle. And before closing, I wanted to mention the leadership changes in our Consumer Group that we shared in our earnings release today. Effective May 31, Greg Johnson, General Manager of the Consumer Group, will step down as the leader of Intuit's Consumer business to become CEO of McAfee. Varun Krishna, Senior Vice President and General Manager of TurboTax Growth Products, will succeed Greg as the General Manager of the Consumer Group.\nGreg has done a tremendous job driving growth for our Consumer business, and I couldn't be happier for this next chapter for him. Intuit is well known for developing world-class leaders and Greg is no exception. McAfee is lucky to have him. At the same time, I couldn't be more excited to welcome Varun as the Consumer Group's next General Manager. With over 7 years of experience leading commercial and product innovation for TurboTax, Varun is perfectly suited for leading Consumer Group's next phase of growth.\nWe are seeing continued momentum across the entire company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of the team and how we've delivered for our customers so far this year.\nAnd with that, let's now -- let's go now to your questions.",

My name is Latif, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kim Watkins, Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nVP of IR, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Latif. Good afternoon, and welcome to Intuit's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Conference Call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO, Sasan Goodarzi; and Michelle Clatterbuck, our CFO. Unfortunately, Michelle has lost her voice, so I will be reading her prepared remarks today. Sasan and I will take your questions during Q&A.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nSome of the numbers in these prepared remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nThank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.\nSecond quarter results reflect continued strong momentum across the company as we execute on our strategy to be a global AI-driven expert platform, powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses. We have a nearly $300 billion addressable market, driven by tailwinds that include a shift to virtual solutions and acceleration to online and omnichannel capabilities and digital money offerings. This, combined with the team's excellence and execution is contributing to the strength of our performance.\nSecond quarter revenue of $2.7 billion was driven by strong results from our Small Business and Self-Employed Group, credit Karma and reflects an earlier start to the tax season compared to last year in the Consumer group. Since tax season is now underway, let me start there. We are confident in our strategy of extending our lead in the do-it-yourself category and transforming the assisted segment. Based on our analysis, we are on track to gain share overall again this season.\nThis and other early indicators gives us reason to be excited about our innovation and go-to-market decisions. Our focus this season is threefold. First, we continue to aggressively transform the assisted category by reshaping how 88 million filers get their maximum refund with confidence virtually. This opens up the $20 billion assisted tax prep category for Intuit. Second, we're serving the underpenetrated segments of Latinx, Self-Employed and investor segments, which are growing faster than the overall tax filing. And third, we're serving millions of members on the Credit Karma platform with personalized experiences.\nOur team has developed a strong game plan to win this season, and we are on track to achieve our full year consumer group guidance of 10% to 11% revenue growth. Our AI-driven expert platform strategy is accelerating innovation and our 5 Big Bets are solving the largest problems our customers face. We continue to deliver strong proof points that demonstrate the success and are well positioned for durable growth in the future. As a reminder, these Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock SMART Money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.\nToday, I'd like to highlight examples of our recent progress across 3 of these Big Bets. Our second Big Bet is to connect people to experts. We're solving one of the largest problems our customers face, lack of confidence, by connecting people to experts virtually with TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. With TurboTax Live, we're transforming the $20 billion assisted category by providing the 88 million filers who have previously relied on an in-person assistant the opportunity to access expert help or have an expert to file their taxes for them.\nWe have improved the experience for customers by applying artificial intelligence to match them with an expert who is right for their specific situation and to deliver insights to experts so they can provide excellent service. These capabilities are also now available in the Credit Karma app for members that use an assisted method to file their taxes last year.\nWe are off to a strong start in our busy season with QuickBooks Live. We're now giving customers earlier visibility as to how their business is performing, getting their books cleaned up faster and connecting them with an expert easier. We've seen some of our strongest weeks of new customer acquisition in January and retention rates in our target customer segment increased several points versus a year ago. We believe QuickBooks Live will enable us to reach small and mid-market businesses that have not used financial management software. And we are eager to continue accelerating our momentum for this offering.\nOur third Big Bet is to unlock SMART Money decisions. Credit Karma is a data platform with powerful network effects solving a 2-sided problem. Our vision is to unlock SMART Money decisions by creating an autonomous financial platform that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and connects them to insights and advice.\nIn Credit Karma, we are innovating across all verticals. Our proprietary Lightbox technology allows us to better personalize and connect members to the products that are right for them, providing more certainty. Credit Karma's data platform and engagement model creates powerful network effects. We continue to see strength in credit cards and personal loans. Lightbox approximately doubles the average approval rate for members who apply for credit cards on Credit Karma versus outside of Credit Karma, making it a competitive differentiator for both our members and partners.\nWe are solving a larger set of financial challenges for consumers in the auto and home verticals. And in auto insurance, we'll continue to strengthen the Karma Drive program. We launched new features and experiences this tax season designed to help the majority of Credit Karma members filed easily with TurboTax and gain deeper insights into their finances.\nWe're also offering tax filers early access to their refunds through direct deposit and refund advance program. First, Credit Karma launched a capability for members who previously filed with TurboTax to provide them with insights about their finances and taxes. Second, most Credit Karma members are able to file with TurboTax within the Credit Karma app and are eligible for special offers. And third, tax filers who choose to deposit their refund into a Credit Karma Money account will receive the refund up to 5 days early with direct deposit or get a portion of their refund in as little as 1 hour after the return is accepted through the TurboTax Refund Advance program. These TurboTax customers drive Credit Karma member growth and get access to personalized products across the platform, which accelerates engagement over time.\nBig picture, we continue to grow members by delivering personalized financial products, helping members save money, pay down debt and get faster access to their money while providing insights and advice. Over time, we are creating a virtuous cycle, which we expect to increase the frequency of engagement, transactions and monetization across our ecosystem.\nOur fourth Big Bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get customers, get paid fast, manage capital, pay employees with confidence and grow in an omnichannel world. 60% of small businesses struggle with cash flow, and we continue to innovate to help customers overcome this challenge.\nIn payments, we continue to improve discoverability, increased usage of features like instant deposit and roll out new innovations like Get Paid Upfront to help qualified customers get paid soon after the invoice is set. All of this innovation is driving strength in our charge volume. And in payroll, we continue to focus on making it easier for small businesses to pay their employees and provide them with expanded benefits. Nearly 40% of Americans say that they would struggle to pay an unexpected $400 emergency expense. We recently announced QuickBooks Early Pay, which will allow eligible employees pay through QuickBooks Online payroll to access money between paydays.\nGetting and engaging customers remains a significant pain point for small and mid-market businesses. With Mailchimp, we are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp. First is to deliver on our vision of an end-to-end customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach.\nSince the acquisition closed in November, we've been moving with speed to deliver for our customers. We're aggressively building a seamless integration between QuickBooks and Mailchimp to create a growth platform, investing in marketing and introducing the Intuit leadership playbook and operating system to execute at scale. Together, we are uniquely positioned to enable small and mid-market businesses combine their customer data from Mailchimp and purchase data from QuickBooks to deliver actionable insights they need to grow and run their businesses with confidence. And this is where the real magic happens.\nNow shifting to the long term. We're also looking far ahead to anticipate our customers' future needs through our 6-year planning process, a part of Intuit's operating system, which we use to run the company. In December, our top leaders studied our customer problems and industry trends, the progress we've made since declaring our Big Bets 3 years ago and where we can have the largest impact in the future. This led to refreshing our 5 Big Bets to accelerate innovation, powering the prosperity of those that we serve.\nWhile our strategy remains durable and the essence of our big bets are the same, we have expanded the customer problems we want to solve and our vision for each Big Bet. For instance, as part of first Big Bet, revolutionize speed to benefit, we are accelerating investments in decentralized technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, enabling us to help customers put more money in their pockets faster.\nAs part of our second Big Bet, connecting people to experts, we're reframing how we think about virtual experiences by exploring metaverse technologies and expanding the segments we serve beyond tax and accounting to play a more meaningful role in our customers' lives. We'll unpack this evolution in more detail at our Investor Day in the fall.\nWe remain focused on our role as a strong corporate citizen and the impact we are making on the communities where we live and work to further our mission. Intuit was recently recognized by JUST Capital on its JUST 100 top-performing companies list for 2022 for our progress on DEI, along with our focus on climate change, worker wellness, job creation and customer privacy.\nWrapping up, our strong business fundamentals, including our balance sheet, our speed of innovation and demand for our platform, continue to put Intuit in a position of strength. Despite macro conditions such as rising inflation, supply chain issues, the great reshuffling and geopolitical conflicts, our platform continues to thrive as digitization is more important now than ever, supporting our customers' needs to put more money in their pockets and helping them run and grow their businesses.\nWe are proud to be the platform of choice for over 100 million customers around the world who rely on Intuit to prosper. Now let me turn it over to Kim.\n\nKimberly Anderson Watkins\n\nVP of IR, Intuit Inc.\n\nThanks, Sasan.\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we delivered revenue of $2.7 billion, up 70%, including 31 points from the addition of Mailchimp and Credit Karma. GAAP operating income of $56 million versus an operating loss of $25 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $612 million versus $235 million last year, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 versus $0.07 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.55 versus $0.68 last year.\nAfter the quarter ended, we entered into an agreement that will resolve the majority of pending arbitration claims related to the free file litigation without admitting any wrongdoing. This resulted in an immaterial charge reflected in our fiscal Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nTurning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 47% during the quarter or 27% on an organic basis, excluding $240 million in revenue from Mailchimp. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 74% or 37% excluding Mailchimp. With the aim of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: grow the core, connect the ecosystem and expand globally.\nFirst, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 35% in fiscal Q2, driven mainly by higher effective prices, customer growth and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue, which includes Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking grew 139% in fiscal Q2. Excluding Mailchimp, online services revenue grew 39%.\nMailchimp revenue recorded in online services was $240 million in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations. Within payroll, we continue to see revenue tailwinds during the quarter from growth in payroll customers and a mix shift to our full-service offering. Within payments, revenue growth reflects an increase in charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth.\nThird, we continue to make progress expanding globally. Total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 226% in fiscal Q2 on a constant currency basis and 33% on an organic basis, excluding Mailchimp. We believe the best measure of the health and success of our strategy is Online Ecosystem revenue growth, which we expect to grow better than 30% organically over time. This is driven by 10% to 20% expected growth in both customers and ARPC.\nDesktop Ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the second quarter. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew low double digits, driven by strong customer growth and price increases. As a reminder, this fall, we transitioned to a subscription model for this year's desktop offering, which we expect to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of the year. Longer term, we expect the desktop business to decline.\nConsumer Group revenue of $411 million grew 180% in Q2, reflecting the earlier IRS opening this year. We are seeing a slower forming tax season taking into consideration both the earlier IRS open date this year and the latest IRS data. While still early in the season, our analysis shows we are on track to gain share overall, excluding users with the TurboTax free file offering in prior year periods.\nWe remain confident in our plans and guidance of 10% to 11% revenue growth for fiscal 2022. We continue to focus on our strategy to extend our lead in DIY and transform the assisted segment with TurboTax Live.\nAs a reminder, there are 4 key drivers of our Consumer Tax business. The first is the total number of returns filed with the IRS. The second is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. The third is our share and the fourth is average revenue per return. Turning to the ProConnect Group. Revenue grew 14% in Q2, also reflecting the earlier IRS opening this year.\nMoving on to Credit Karma. Revenue was $444 million in Q2, another record revenue quarter, driven by high levels of monthly active users and revenue per monthly active user. Within the quarter, we saw another record quarter driven by the combined strength in personal loans and credit cards. The growth verticals reflected momentum year-over-year in auto loans and home loans. And we are developing the emerging vertical by focusing on innovation with Credit Karma Money, which we believe is key to growing the frequency of visits over time. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead.\nTurning to our financial principles. We remain committed to growing organic revenue double digits and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue. As we shared before, as we lean into our platform strategy, we see the opportunity for margin expansion over time. We take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. We continue to reallocate resources to top priorities with an emphasis on being an AI-driven expert platform. These principles guide our decisions and remain our long-term commitment.\nOur first priority for the cash we generate is investing in the business to drive customer and revenue growth. We consider acquisitions to accelerate our growth and fill out our product road map. We returned excess cash that we can't invest profitably in the business to shareholders via both share repurchases and dividends.\nWe finished the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. We repurchased $519 million of stock during the second quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on April 18, 2022. This represents a 15% increase versus last year.\nNow turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2022 guidance, including 26% to 28% revenue growth or 18% to 20% growth excluding Mailchimp. Our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 includes revenue growth of 32% to 33%, GAAP earnings per share of $6.18 to $6.24 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.51 to $7.57. You can find our full Q3 and fiscal 2022 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet.\nAs you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Mailchimp, the largest transaction in Intuit's history during the second quarter. We are working to finalize the purchase price accounting process, which could result in a onetime impact to our second quarter GAAP-only results and full year fiscal 2022 GAAP-only guidance we issued today. This process will not result in a change to the total consideration of the transaction. We expect to complete this process before we file our 10-Q.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to Sasan.\n\nSasan K. Goodarzi\n\nCEO, President & Director, Intuit Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Kim.\nDuring our busiest season of the year, we are seeing continued momentum across the company given our strategy of being an AI-driven expert platform that is powering the prosperities for consumers and small businesses. I'm proud of what the team has accomplished this quarter, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to find new innovative ways to serve our more than 100 million customers.\nNow let's open it up to your questions.",

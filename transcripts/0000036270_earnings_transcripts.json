[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Steven Wendelboe, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteven Wendelboe\n\nThank you, Katie, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating M&T Bank's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables, and schedules, by going to our Investor Relations website at ir.mtb.com.\nAlso, before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information are included in today's earnings release materials and in the investor presentation, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. Presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the earnings release and investor presentation. The appropriate reconciliations to GAAP are included in the appendix.\nJoining me on the call this morning is M&T's Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, Daryl Bible. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daryl.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, BB&T Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. M&T continues to serve as a trusted partner for our customers and communities, bringing together people, capital and ideas to make a difference. Earlier this quarter, we released our 2024 sustainability report, which highlights our community impact and the progress we've made towards meeting our sustainability goals.\nHighlights include $5 billion in sustainable lending and investments, and over $58 million contributed to nonprofits through corporate giving and the M&T Charitable Foundation. We are also proud to share that M&T is now the top SBA lender across our footprint by total volume, as of the end of the SBA fiscal year September 30. Our small business enterprise continues to be an important component of our support for entrepreneurs and local economy.\nTurning to Slide 4. Our businesses and leaders, notably our women in leadership, continue to receive accolades from the industry, including recognition of our [ Wilmington ] Trust team and individual recognition for leaders across the bank.\nTurning to Slide 6, which shows the results for the third quarter. Our third quarter results reflect M&T's continued momentum with several successes to highlight. We produced strong returns with operating [ ROTA ] and ROTCE of 1.56% and 17.13%. Our net interest margin expanded to 3.68%, demonstrating our relatively neutral asset sensitivity, well-controlled deposit and funding costs, and the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing.\nStrong fee income performance we have seen throughout the year continued with fee income, excluding notable items, reaching a record level. Revenues grew more than expenses, resulting in our third quarter efficiency ratio of 53.6%. Asset quality continues to improve with a $584 million, or 7%, reduction in commercialized criticized balances, and $61 million or 4% reduction in nonaccrual loans. We increased our quarterly dividend per share by 11% to $1.50 and executed a $409 million in share repurchases are also growing tangible book value per share by 3%.\nNow let's look at the specifics for the third quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $4.82, up from $4.24 in the prior quarter. Net income was $792 million compared to $716 million in the linked quarter. M&T's third quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.49% and 11.45%, respectively. The third quarter included a notable fee item of $28 million related to the distribution of an earn-out payment to M&T associated with the 2023 sale of our CIT business, adding $0.14 to EPS.\nSlide 7 includes supplemental reporting of M&T's results on a net operating or tangible basis. M&T's net operating income was $798 million, compared to $724 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $4.87, up from $4.28 in the prior quarter. Next, we look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our third quarter results.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.77 billion, an increase of $51 million, or 3%, from the linked quarter. The net interest margin was 3.68%, an increase of 6 basis points from the prior quarter. This improvement was driven by a positive 4 basis points related to the prior quarter catch-up premium amortization on certain securities, positive 3 basis points from higher asset liability spread mostly from continued fixed asset repricing, partially offset by lower contribution of net free funds.\nTurning to Slide 10 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased $1.1 billion to $136.5 billion. Higher commercial, residential mortgage and consumer loans were partially offset by a decline in CRE balances. Commercial loans increased $0.7 billion to $61.7 billion, aided by growth in our corporate and institutional fund banking and loans to REITs. CRE loans declined 4% to $24.3 billion, reflecting the full quarter impact of last quarter's loan sale and continued payoffs and pay downs. Residential mortgage loans increased 3% to $24.4 billion. Consumer loans grew 3% to $26.1 billion, reflecting increases in recreational finance and [ HELOC ], where our auto loans were largely stable from the second quarter. Loan yields increased 3 basis points to 6.14%, aided by continued fixed rate loan repricing, including a reduction in the negative carry on our interest rate swaps at sequentially higher nonaccrual interest.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the third quarter, investment securities and cash held at the Fed totaled $53.6 billion, representing 25% in total assets. Average investment securities increased $1.3 billion to $36.6 billion. In the third quarter, we purchased a total of $3.1 billion in securities with an average yield of 5.2%. The yield on the investment securities increased to 4.13%, reflecting the prior quarter catch-up premium amortization on certain securities and continued fixed rate securities repricing benefit. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was 3.5 years, and the unrealized pretax gain on available-for-sale portfolio was $163 million, or 8 basis points CET1 benefit, if included in regulatory capital.\nWhile not subject to the LCR requirements, M&T estimates that its LCR on September 30 was 108%, exceeding the regulatory minimum standards that would be applicable if we were a Category 3 institution.\nTurning to Slide 12. Average total deposits declined $0.7 billion to $162.7 [ billion ]. Noninterest-bearing deposits declined $1.1 billion to $44 billion, mostly from lower commercial noninterest-bearing deposits related to a single customer client. We continue to consider the entirety of the customer relationships as we assess our overall deposit funding mix.\nInterest-bearing deposits increased $0.4 billion to $118.7 billion driven by growth in commercial and business banking, offset by the decline in consumer and institutional deposits. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 2 basis points to 2.36%, aided by lower retail prime time deposit costs and lower interest checking costs across other business lines.\nContinuing on Slide 13. Noninterest income was $752 million compared to $683 million in the linked quarter. We saw continued strength across all fee income categories. Mortgage banking revenues were $147 million, up from $130 million in the second quarter. Residential mortgage revenues increased $11 million sequentially to [ $108 million ] from higher servicing fee income. Commercial mortgage banking increased $6 million to $39 million. Trust income was related -- was relatively unchanged at $181 million as the prior quarter seasonal tax preparation fees were largely offset by growth in wealth management and fee income. Trading and FX increased $6 million to $18 million from higher commercial customer swap activity. Other revenues from operations increased $39 million to $230 million, reflecting $28 million distribution of an earn-out payment, $20 million Bayview distribution and the gain on the sale of equipment leases. These items were partially offset by $25 million in notable items in the prior quarter.\nTurning to Slide 14. Noninterest expenses for the quarter were $1.36 billion, increase of $27 million from the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased $20 million to $833 million, reflecting 1 additional working day and higher severance-related expense, which increased $17 million sequentially. FDIC expense decreased $9 million to $13 million, mostly related to the reduction and estimated special assessment expense.\nOther costs of operations increased $23 million to $136 million, reflecting higher expense associated with the supplemental executive retirement savings plan due to market performance and the impairment of renewable energy tax credit investment. The energy -- the efficiency ratio was 53.6%, compared to 55.2% in the linked quarter.\nNext, on Slide 15 for credit. Net charge-offs for the quarter were $146 million, or 42 basis points, increasing from 32 basis points in the linked quarter. The increase in net charge-offs reflects the resolution of several previously identified C&I credits, the largest -- the two largest of which totaled $49 million. CRE losses remain muted in the third quarter. Nonaccrual loans decreased by $61 million. The nonaccrual ratio decreased 6 basis points to 1.1% driven largely by payoffs, paydowns, charge-offs of commercial and CRE nonaccrual loans.\nIn the third quarter, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $125 million compared to net charge-offs of $146 million. Included in the provision expense is a $15 million provision for unfunded commitments related to the letter of credit to a commercial customer. The allowance for loan loss as a percent of total loans decreased 3 basis points to 1.58%, reflecting lower criticized loans.\nPlease turn to Slide 16. The level of criticized loans was $7.8 billion, compared to $8.4 billion at the end of June. Improvement from the linked quarter was largely driven by $671 million decline in CRE criticized balances. The decline in CRE criticized balances was broadly based with lower criticized balances across nearly all property types.\nTurning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio was an estimated 10.99%, unchanged from the second quarter. The stable CET1 ratio reflects capital distributions including $409 million in share repurchases, offset by continued strong capital generation. In the third quarter, we also increased our quarterly dividend by 11% to $1.15. The AOCI impact on the CET1 ratio from available-for-sale securities and pension-related components combined would be approximately 13 basis points if included in regulatory capital.\nNow turning to the slide for the outlook. First, let's begin with the economic backdrop. The economy continues to hold up well despite ongoing concerns and uncertainty regarding tariffs and other policies. The passage and signing has of The One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law removed one source of uncertainty and also gave businesses more incentive to invest in new capital. The economy bounced back in the second quarter after having contracted in the first. Consumer spending proved resilient despite tariff impacts. Businesses continued engaging in CapEx, though it was heavily in tech, software and transportation and equipment, while spending on new buildings remained in decline.\nAlthough overall economic activity was resilient, we remain attuned to the risk of the slowdown in coming quarters due to the weakening labor market. The possibility of declining jobs, or the rise in the unemployment rate, would likely cause weaknesses in consumer spending and possibly business CapEx, too. We continue to monitor the possibility of a prolonged government shutdown and the potential impact on our customers, communities and broader economy. We remain well positioned for a dynamic economic environment with a strong liquidity, strong capital generation and a CET1 ratio of nearly 11%.\nNow turning to outlook. We have 3 quarters of the year complete, we will focus on the outlook on the fourth quarter. We expect taxable equivalent NII of approximately $1.8 billion, which implies full year NII excluding notable items to be at the low end of the $7 billion to $7.15 billion range, in line with the outlook we discussed in September. Fourth quarter net interest margin is expected to be approximately 3.7%. Our forecast reflects two additional rate cuts in the fourth quarter. We expect continued loan growth and average total loans of $137 million to $138 million with growth in C&I, residential mortgage and consumer, and a moderating pace in CRE decline.\nAverage deposits are expected to be $163 billion to $164 billion. Our outlook for the fourth quarter noninterest income was $670 million to $690 million, reflecting continued strength in mortgage, trust, service charges and commercial services. We expect other revenues from operations to revert toward more normalized levels. This would imply full year noninterest income, excluding notable items, well above the top end of our prior range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.\nFourth quarter expenses, including intangible amortization, are expected to be $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion. This would imply full year expense in the top half of our prior outlook of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. This is being driven by an increase in professional services. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter are expected to be 40 to 50 basis points, with a full year net charge-offs of less than 40 basis points. Our outlook for the fourth quarter tax rate is 23.5% to 24%. We offer -- we plan to operate with a CET1 ratio in the 10.75% to 11% range for the remainder of the year. We will be opportunistic with share repurchases, are also continuing to monitor the economic backdrop and asset quality trends.\nAs shown on Slide 21, we remain committed through our four priorities, including growing our New England and Long Island markets, optimizing our resources through simplification, making our systems resilient and scalable, and continuing to scale and develop our risk management capabilities.\nTo conclude on Slide 22, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles while growing within the markets we serve. We remain focused on share order returns and consistent dividend growth. Finally, we are a disciplined acquirer and a prudent steward for shareholder capital.\nNow let's open the call up to questions before which Katie will briefly review the instructions."

Welcome to the M&T Bank Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Steve Wendelboe, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteven Wendelboe\n\nThank you, Bo, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. If you've not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules by going to our new and improved Investor Relations website at ir.mtb.com.\nAlso, before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information are included in today's earnings release materials and in the investor presentation as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. The presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the earnings release and investor presentation, the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP are included in the appendix.\nJoining me on the call this morning is M&T's Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, Daryl Bible. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daryl.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, BB&T Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our purpose continues to drive M&T's bank's success. We strive to make a difference in people's lives, serving our communities with dedication and intake. This quarter, we continued to deliver on our purpose as we supported entrepreneurs with our small business accelerator labs invested in our New England and Long Island communities through our third and final round of our amplified fund and announced several high-visibility sponsorships. We remain optimistic about the ability to deliver shareholder value and continue serving our communities with excellence.\nTurning to Slide 4. We continue to enjoy notable recognition from our customers and the industry. I want to thank our teams in commercial, business banking, corporate trust and wealth that made these recognitions possible.\nTurning to Slide 6, which shows the results for the second quarter. Our second quarter results reflect M&T's continued momentum with several successes to highlight. First, we are pleased with the recent stress test outcome. Our SCB declined from 3.8% to 2.7%, reflecting the resiliency and strength of our earnings power and continued risk management efforts.\nWe started this effort 5 years ago to reduce our on-balance sheet CRE exposure and still serve our customers. We are also focused on reducing our credit size loans. I want to thank both our commercial and credit teams for a great job that they have done to make this happen.\nWe executed $1.1 billion in share repurchases in the second quarter while also going growing tangible book value per share by 1%. We grew average residential mortgage and consumer loans by $1.1 billion combined, reflecting our diversified business model. Fee income continues to perform well. Excluding security gains and losses and other notable items, fee income grew 11% since the second quarter of 2024. Our expenses remain well controlled, reflected in our second quarter efficiency ratio of 55.2%. Asset quality continues to improve with a $1 billion or 11% reduction and commercial criticized balances. Net charge-offs of 32 basis points also remain below our full year expectations as we discussed in January.\nNow let's look at the specifics for the second quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $4.24, up from $3.32 in the prior quarter. Net income was $116 million compared to $584 million in the linked quarter. M&T's second quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.37% and 10.39%, respectively. There were 3 notable items in the second quarter, including $17 million in catch-up premium amortization on tax exempt bonds obtained from the People's United acquisition. The corresponding impact of that item on a taxable equivalent basis was $20 million. This item reduced EPS by $0.09. We also had 2 gains reported within fee income, which included a $15 million pretax gain on sale of our out-of-footprint CRE loan portfolio and a $10 million pretax gain on the sale of an ICS subsidiary. Those 2 gains impacted EPS by $0.07 and $0.04, respectively.\nSlide 7 includes supplemental reporting of M&T's results on a net operating or tangible basis, M&T's net operating income was $724 million compared to $594 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $4.28 up from $3.38 in the prior quarter. Net operating income yielded in ROTA and ROTCE of 1.44% and 15.54%. Next, we'll look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our second quarter results.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.72 billion, an increase of $15 million or 1% from the linked quarter. The net interest margin was 3.62%, a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior quarter. The net interest margin decline was primarily driven by a negative 4 basis points related to the premium amortization impact, negative 5 basis points related to higher costs and interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt, negative 2 basis points from lower net free funds contribution, partially offset by a 7 basis point benefit related to fixed asset repricing including reduction in negative carry on our interest rate swaps. Excluding the notable premium amortization, the net interest margin would be 3.66% unchanged from the first quarter.\nTurning to Slide 10 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased $0.6 billion to $135.4 billion. Higher consumer and residential mortgage loans were partially offset by a decline in CRE balances. Commercial loans were unchanged at $61 billion with continued growth in certain specialty segments such as C&I and mortgage warehouse, offset by a decline in dealer floor plan balances. However, at the end of the period, commercial loans increased $1.1 billion driven by growth in our specialty segments, including C&I, mortgage warehouse and fund banking.\nSimilarly, we saw strong growth in total commitments. The CRE loans declined 4% to $25.3 billion, reflecting continued payoffs and paydowns. However, we continue to see our CRE pipeline build. Residential mortgage loans increased 2% to $23.7 billion. Consumer loans grew 4% to $25.4 billion, reflecting increases in recreational finance and indirect auto loans.\nCombined average residential mortgage and consumer loans grew $1.5 billion or 3% sequentially, representing the strength of our diversified loan portfolio and business model. Loan yields increased 5 basis points to 6.11%, aided by the reduction in negative carrying on our interest rate swaps.\nRegarding commercial loan growth, earlier this year, we implemented enhancements to our commercial credit and sales processes to improve the ability to serve customers through market cycles, become more responsive to customer needs, scale our risk management and position ourselves for future growth. We have taken the time to assimilate both our employees and customers to this new process and we enter the second half of the year in a strong position to support our growing pipeline.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the second quarter, investment securities and cash out with the Fed totaled $54.9 billion, representing 26% of total assets. Average investment securities increased $0.9 billion to $35.3 billion. The yield on investment securities decreased 19 basis points to 3.81% primarily from the catch-up premium amortization on certain securities.\nExcluding that item, the securities yield would be 4.03%, reflecting continued fixed [indiscernible] repricing in the investment portfolio. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was 3.6 years and the unrealized pretax gain on [ available ] sale portfolio was $82 million or 4 basis points CET1 benefit, if included in regulatory capital.\nTurning to Slide 12. Average total deposits rose $2.2 billion or 1% to $163.4 billion. Deposit growth was across most segments, including commercial, business banking, consumer, mortgage and corporate trust, while average broker deposits declined $0.3 billion to $10.5 billion. Average noninterest-bearing deposits declined $0.3 billion to $45.1 billion, primarily from lower trust demand deposits. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 1 basis point to 2.38%. Growth in certain high-cost deposits, particularly within commercial mortgage and corporate trust contributed to the deposit cost increase. That was partially offset by time and broker deposits.\nContinuing on Slide 13. Noninterest income was $683 million compared to $611 million in the linked quarter. We saw continued strength across many fee income categories with increases in mortgage banking, service charges, trust and other revenues. Mortgage banking revenues were $130 million, up from $118 million in the first quarter. Residential mortgage banking revenues increased $15 million sequentially to $97 million from higher servicing fee income, aided by the full quarter benefit of subservicing, which started in February. Trust income increased $5 million to $182 million, largely driven by higher seasonal tax preparation fees. Other revenues from operations increased $49 million to $191 million, reflecting $25 million in notable items mentioned earlier, along with higher loan syndication fees and merchant and credit card revenue.\nTurning to Slide 14. We continue to execute our expense plan. Noninterest expenses for the quarter were $1.34 billion, a decrease of $79 million from the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits decreased $74 million to $813 million, mostly reflecting the seasonal decline from the first quarter, partially offset by the full quarter impact of annual merit increases. Other non-compensation expenses items changed relatively modestly from the first quarter. The efficiency ratio was 55.2% compared to 60.5% in the linked quarter.\nNow let's turn to Slide 15 for credit. Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $108 million or 32 basis points, decreasing from 34 basis points in the linked quarter. Net charge-offs were relatively granular with the 5 largest charges amounting to less than $35 million in total, representing both C&I and CRE credits. Nonaccrual loans increased $33 million or 2% to $1.6 billion. The nonaccrual ratio increased 2 basis points to 1.16%, driven largely by higher C&I non-accruals, concentrated and recreational finance dealers.\nIn the second quarter, we reported a provision for credit losses of $125 million. compared to the net charge-offs of $108 million. Included within the provision for credit losses is a $20 million provision for unfunded credit commitments related to credit recourse obligations for certain CRE loans sold by MT RCC under the Fannie Mae DUS program. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans decreased 2 basis points to 1.61%, reflecting lower levels of criticized loss.\nPlease turn to Slide 16. The level of criticized loans was $8.4 billion compared to $9.4 billion at the end of March. The improvement from the linked quarter was driven by an $813 million decline in CRE criticized balances and $226 million decline in commercial. The CRE decline was primarily within multifamily, office, health care and construction and was driven by payoffs, paydowns and upgrades to pass status.\nTurning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was an estimated 10.98% compared to 11.5% at the end of the first quarter. A decline in the CET1 ratio reflects increased capital distributions, including $1.1 billion in share repurchases, partially offset by continued strong capital generation. The AOCI impact on the CET1 ratio from AFS securities and pension-related components combined will be approximately a positive 10 basis points, if included in regulatory capital.\nNow turning to Slide 20 for the outlook. First, let's begin with the economic backdrop. The economy fared better than field given the market volatility and uncertainty regarding tariffs and other policies. The economy contracted in the first quarter as domestic production gave way to a surge of imports of consumer and business goods. We expect a positive figure in the second quarter, thanks in part to lower imports, but also do see slowing in domestic spending which is a risk worth watching. We see the impact of tariffs hitting categories that are most exposed to imports, but consumers are cutting back on service spending such as travel and recreation reducing price pressure on service side and is the counterweight to tariffs. We acknowledge the potential for a slowing in the economy and are tuned to downside risks and uncertainty.\nWe ended the second quarter well positioned for a dynamic economic environment with strong liquidity, strong capital generation and a CET1 ratio of nearly 11%. With that economic backdrop, let's review our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable equivalent net interest income, excluding notable items, to be $7 billion to $7.15 billion with net interest margin averaging in the mid- to high [ 360s ]. We lowered the range due to continued softness in commercial and CRE loan growth. We expect full year average loan growth to be $135 billion to $137 billion. Full year average deposit balances are expected to be $162 billion to $164 billion. We remain focused on growing customer deposits at a reasonable cost and reducing non-core funding.\nTurning to fee income. We continue to expect noninterest income, excluding notable items, to be at the high end of our $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion range. Our strong quarter provides increased confidence in achieving the high end of the range. Continuing with expenses. We anticipate total noninterest expenses, including intangible amortization to be $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion, trending towards the lower end of the range. Our business lines remain focused on closely managing our expenses, allowing the bank to continue to make targeted investments in projects and business opportunities that support our enterprise priorities and also achieve positive operating leverage.\nRegarding credit, net charge-offs for the first half of the year were below our initial expectations. With that positive start to the year, we now expect net charge-offs for the full year to be less than 40 basis points. We also expect criticized loans to continue to decline through 2025 though at a more moderate pace. As it relates to capital, we expect to operate in a 10.75% to 11% range for the remainder of the year. We will be opportunistic with share repurchases while also continuing to monitor the economic backdrop and asset quality trends.\nAs shown on Slide 21, we remain committed to our 4 priorities, including growing our New England and Long Island markets, optimizing our resources through simplification, making our systems resilient and scalable and continuing to scale and develop our risk management capabilities.\nTo conclude on Slide 22, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles are growing within the markets we serve. We remain focused on our shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth. Finally, we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital. Now let's open the call to questions before which Bo will briefly review the instructions."

First, I will begin with our purpose on Slide 3. Our purpose is to make a difference in people's lives. We are committed to serving not only our customers, but also supporting communities where we live and work, inspiring our 22,000 employees and delivering for our shareholders.\nIn Rene's annual shareholder letter, [indiscernible] that we operate in an environment in which change is the only constant. In these uncertain times, M&T starts from a position of strength with a strong liquidity, capital levels and capital generation. This position of strength reflects our consistent adherence to the fundamentals of liquidity management, capital allocation and transparency. The strength of this operating model allows M&T to continue to perform through the peaks and valleys of the macroeconomic cycles and support our customers and communities in the moments that matter most.\nAs highlighted on Slide 4, we continue to receive notable recognition, including 13 Greenwich Coalition awards for our small business and middle market segments. And we were included in Fortune's most admired and most innovative company list.\nTurning to Slide 6, which shows the results for the first quarter. Our first quarter results represent a strong start to the year with several successes to highlight. Net interest margin increased 8 basis points, reflecting our efficient balance sheet and the strength of our deposit franchise. We executed $662 million in share repurchases as we continue to an 11% CET1 ratio in 2025, while also growing tangible book value per share by 2%.\nFee income grew 5% since the first quarter of 24% or 10% if you exclude last year's BOG distribution. Asset quality continued to improve with $516 million reduction in commercial criticized balances and a $150 million reduction in nonaccrual loans. Our net charge-offs of 34 basis points were below our full year expectations of 40 basis points.\nNow let's look at the specifics for the first quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $3.32, down from $3.86 in the prior quarter. Net income was $584 million compared to $681 million in the linked quarter. M&T's first quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.14% and 8.36%, respectively.\nSlide 7 includes supplemental reporting of M&T's results on a net operating or tangible basis, M&T's net operating income was $594 million compared to $691 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $3.38 down from $3.92 in the prior quarter. Net operating income muted an ROTA and ROTCE of 1.21% and 12.53%.\nNext, let's look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 8. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.71 billion, a decrease of $33 million or 2% from linked quarter. The lower NII was primarily driven by 2 fewer days and lower returning assets, partially offset by favorable deposit costs.\nNet interest margin was 3.6%, an increase of 8 basis points from the prior quarter. The primary drivers of the increase in margin include continued securities growth and lower wholesale flooding and time deposits and favorable deposit pricing with interest-bearing deposit cost declining 27 basis points.\nTurning to Slide 10 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases decreased $0.9 million to $134.8 billion. Lower CRE balances were partially offset by the growth in C&I, consumer and residential mortgage. C&I loans grew 1% to $61 million, driven by continued strength in the corporate institutional and fund banking. CRE loans declined 6% to $26.3 billion, reflecting payoffs and paydowns and muted origination activity with increased market competition.\nResidential mortgage loans were relatively unchanged at $23.2 million. Consumer loans grew 1% to $24.3 billion, reflecting increases in recreational finance and indirect auto loans. Loan yields decreased 11 basis points to 6.06% as lower rates on variable loans and lower nonaccrual interest was partially offset by fixed rate loan repricing and a smaller drag on our cash flow hedges.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the first quarter, investment securities and cash, including cash held at the Fed totaled $57.9 billion, representing 28% of total assets. Average investment securities increased $0.8 billion. The yield on the investment securities increased 12 basis points to 4% as the yield for new purchases exceeded the yield on maturing securities.\nIn the first quarter, we purchased $2.6 billion in debt securities at an average yield of 4.9%. The duration of the portfolio at the end of the quarter was 3.6 years, and the unrealized pretax loss on the available-for-sale portfolio was $8 million or less than 1 basis point CET1 drag if included in regulatory capital.\nTurning to Slide 12. Average total deposits declined $3.4 billion or 2% to $161.2 million. A sequential decline included $0.7 billion decline in broker deposits, where the remainder of the decline was concentrated in commercial and business banking partially reflecting seasonal lower balances.\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits declined $1.1 billion to $45.4 million. Excluding broker deposits, average noninterest-bearing deposit mix in the first quarter was relatively unchanged at 30.2%. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 27 basis points to 2.37%. We sold favorable deposit declines across business lines, higher level of broker and retail time deposit maturities in the quarter also contributed to the deposit cost decline.\nContinuing on Slide 13. Noninterest income was $611 million compared to $657 million in the linked quarter. We saw continued strength across fee income categories with increases in mortgage banking, service charges, trust and brokerage fee income. Recall that the fourth quarter included an $18 million net gain from the sale of noncore securities and a $23 million BOG distribution. Excluding these items from the prior quarter, noninterest income declined by $5 million sequentially.\nMortgage banking revenues were $118 million compared to $117 million in the fourth quarter. Residential mortgage banking revenues increased $6 million sequentially to $82 million reflecting the partial quarter benefit from new subservicing. We expect to reach the full run rate on this subservicing in the second quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues decreased $5 million to $36 million, reflecting lower gains on the sale of commercial mortgage loans. Other revenues from operations decreased $34 million to $142 million mostly reflecting the fourth quarter $23 million BOG distribution.\nTurning to Slide 14. We continue to execute on our expense plans. Noninterest expenses were $1.42 billion, an increase of $52 million from the prior quarter. Last year's fourth quarter included $35 million in notable expenses related to the redemption of certain M&T trust preferred obligations, expenses associated with corporate real estate optimization, partially offset by pension-related credit.\nSalary and benefits increased $97 million to $887 million, mostly reflecting $110 million of seasonally higher compensation expense related to stock-based compensation, payroll-related taxes and other employee benefit expenses. As usual, we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter. Other cost of operations decreased $50 million to $118 million, primarily reflecting the previously mentioned fourth quarter notable items. The efficiency ratio was 60.5% compared to 56.8% in the linked quarter.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 15 for credit. Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $114 million or 34 basis points decreasing from 47 basis points in the linked quarter. Charge-offs were relatively granular in the first quarter, with the 5 largest charges amounting to less than $30 million in total, representing both C&I and CRE credits.\nNonaccrual loans decreased $150 million or 9% to $1.5 billion. The nonaccrual ratio decreased 11 basis points to 1.14% driven largely by payoffs, charge-offs and upgrades out of nonaccrual. In the fourth quarter, we reported a provision of $130 million compared to the net charge-offs of $114 million.\nThe allowance to loan ratio increased 2 basis points to 1.63%, reflecting growth in certain consumer loan portfolios as well as a modest deterioration in the macroeconomic forecast. The increase was not related to changes in the underlying credit performance, which is mostly in line with expectations.\nPlease turn to Slide 16. We estimate that the level of criticized loans will be $9.4 billion compared to $9.9 million at the end of December. The improvement from the linked quarter was driven by $667 million decline and CRE criticized balances, partially offset by a $150 million increase in C&I. Within C&I, the increase in criticized was concentrated in a motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers.\nThe CRE criticized decline was primarily within multifamily, office, health care, construction and was driven by payoffs, paydowns and upgrades to past status. Improved leasing, occupancy and cash flows and healthcare and multifamily helped drive the improvement in the CRE criticized.\nTurning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T CET1 ratio at the end of the first quarter was an estimated 11.5% compared to 11.66% at the end of the fourth quarter. The decline in the CET1 ratio reflects increased capital distributions, including $662 million in share repurchases, partially offset by continued strong capital generation. AOCI impact on the CET1 ratio from available-for-sale securities and pension-related components combined would be approximately a positive 6 basis points is included in regulatory capital.\nNow turning to Slide 20 for the outlook. First, let's begin with the economic backdrop. The economic backdrop remains dynamic in light of the developments over the past several weeks. Recent economic data is mixed with strong job gains of moderating wage growth. Our recent readings show weakening business and consumer sentiment and eating inflation. The ultimate impact on tariffs on the broader economy remains unknown at this point. That uncertainty is reflected in recent equity market and rate volatility. We ended the first quarter well positioned for a dynamic economic environment of strong liquidity, strong capital generation and a CT1 ratio at 11.5%.\nWith that economic backdrop, let's review our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable equivalent net interest income to be $7.05 billion to $7.15 billion, with net interest margin increasing through the year and averaging in the mid- to high 360s.\nWe expect the full year average loan and lease balances to be $135 million to $137 million. The lower loan outlook reflects lower CRE balances with related payoffs and pay downs and muted originations. Full year average deposit balances are expected to be $160 million to $164 billion. We remain focused on growing customer deposits at a reasonable cost while also considering loan growth.\nTurning to fee income. We expect noninterest income to be at the high end of the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion range. The environment remains dynamic. However, our diversified product set should help provide relative stability from our fee income businesses.\nContinuing with expenses, we anticipate total noninterest expense, including intangible amortization, to be $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. Our business lines remain focused on closely managing their expenses, allowing the bank to continue to target investments in projects and business opportunities that support our enterprise priorities.\nRegarding credit, we continue to expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near 40 basis points. We also expect criticized loans to continue to decline in 2025. As it relates to capital, we expect the CET1 ratio to reach 11% in 2025 but we'll monitor the economic backdrop and adjust as needed. The level of share repurchases will vary with RWA growth.\nAs shown on Slide 21, we remain committed to our 4 priorities, including growing our New England and Long Island markets, optimizing our resources through simplification, making our systems resilient and scalable and continuing to scale and develop our risk management capabilities.\nTo conclude on Slide 22, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles while growing within the markets we serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth. Finally, we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of our shareholder capital.\nNow let's open the call up to questions before which Margo will briefly review the instructions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nMD, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast.

Closed captioning has also been provided for webcast participants.\nAlso, before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information are included in today's earnings release materials and in the investor presentation as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. The presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the earnings release and investor presentation. The appropriate reconciliations to GAAP are included in the appendix.\nJoining me on the call this morning is M&T Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, Daryl Bible. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daryl.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, BB&T Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to begin with our purpose on Slide 3. M&T's success continues to be driven by our purpose: Making a difference in people's lives. We do this by not only empowering our customers to meet their financial needs, but by supporting the communities where we live and work.\nAs M&T continues to grow, we remain committed to a relationship-based model. We believe our unique knowledge of customers, capital and community allows us to deliver customized solutions that make an impact. In 2024, this impact was evident across the footprint.\nIn addition to the positive social, environmental and governance accomplishments highlighted on Slide 4, this December, M&T issued our first sustainability bond in conjunction with the publication of our sustainability financing framework which will guide future issuances.\nAs highlighted on Slide 5, M&T is to garner -- continues to garner awards for the work in 2024 including recognition from industry of our talent achievements and local charitable efforts.\nNow let's turn to Slides' 7 and 8. Before we get into the fourth quarter, I want to pause and reflect on some of the highlights for 2024. First, I want to take a moment to recognize the hard work and dedication of our 22,000 colleagues who allowed us to have such a successful year. In 2024, we focused on 4 priorities, including building our New England and Long Island markets, optimizing our resources through simplification, making our systems and processes resilient and scalable and continuing to develop and scale our risk management. The progress we made on these priorities related -- and related enterprise initiatives will allow the bank to continue to grow and scale in coming years.\nOur focus on fundamentals is reflected in several of our financial accomplishments in 2024. We executed our financial plan for the year and the results met or exceeded the outlook we discussed last January for NII, fee income, expenses and average loans and deposits. We made significant progress on our CRE concentration, reaching what we believe is a target level. Our capital levels continue to grow through the year and remain strong as we restarted our share repurchase program in the third quarter. We actively managed our interest rate sensitivity through our hedging program and securities portfolio to shift our balance sheet toward a lower rate neutral position. We manage credit risk, meaningfully reducing nonaccrual and commercial criticized balances and having net charge-offs come in largely in line with our expectations.\nLet's focus on the fundamentals positions M&T for 2025 and beyond and is reflected in our 2024 results with net operating earnings per share of $14.88, ROTA and ROTCE of 1.3% and 14.54% and 11% growth in tangible book value per share.\nTurning to Slide 9, which shows the results for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter results reflect a continuation of a strong performance we have through the year. There are several successes to highlight. NII was largely stable compared to the third quarter, even considering 100 basis points in rate cuts since the start of the easing cycle in September. Average total loans grew for the fifth consecutive quarter demonstrating our ability to more than offset the planned reduction in our CRE concentration. Average total deposits grew by over $3 billion sequentially, while interest-bearing deposit costs declined 24 basis points, reflecting the quality of our deposit franchise.\nWe excluded 200 -- we executed $200 million in share repurchases and grew CET1 ratio to 11.67%. Fee income, excluding notable items, reached another high point for the fourth quarter and by the strength in mortgage and trust. Asset quality continued to improve with a $1 billion reduction in commercial criticized loans and $236 million reduction in nonaccrual loans.\nNow let's look at the specifics for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share were $3.86, down from $4.02 in the prior quarter. Net income for the quarter was $681 million compared to $721 million in the linked quarter. M&T's fourth quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.28% and 9.75%, respectively. CET1 ratio remained strong, growing to 11.67% at the end of the fourth quarter and tangible book value per share grew 1%.\nThe fourth quarter included several notable items: A securities gain of $18 million or $0.08 per share related to the sale of noncore investments, expense associated with the redemption of certain M&T trust preferred obligations amounting to $20 million or $0.09 per share. This action has a 3-year earn back. Corporate real estate optimization related to expenses amounting to $27 million or $0.12 per share and a pension-related credit within expenses amounting to $12 million or $0.05 per share benefit.\nSlide 10 includes supplemental reporting of M&T's results on an operating or tangible basis. M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter was $691 million or $731 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $3.92 for the recent quarter, down from $4.08 in the prior quarter. Net operating income yield in ROTA and ROTCE and 1.35% and 14.66% for the recent quarter.\nNext, we look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.74 billion, largely unchanged from the linked quarter. NII for the fourth quarter was $25 million and nonaccrual interest compared to $12 million in the third quarter. The net interest margin was 3.58%, a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior quarter. And the primary drivers of a decrease to the margin were a negative 10 basis points related to lower contribution of free funds, partially offset by a positive 3 basis points from the fixed asset -- fixed rate asset repricing and a positive 3 basis points from higher nonaccrual interest.\nTurning to Slide 13 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased $1 billion to $135.7 billion. C&I and consumer growth continued to outpace the decline in CRE similar to the trend in the past several quarters. C&I loans grew 2% to $60.7 billion, driven by strength in dealer commercial services, fund banking and corporate and institutional. CRE loans declined 4% to $27.9 billion. CRE, as a percent of Tier 1 capital and the allowance, is estimated to be 136% at the end of the fourth quarter. Residential mortgage loans were relatively unchanged at $23.1 billion. Consumer loans grew 5% to $24 billion, reflecting increases in recreational finance and indirect auto loans. Loan yields decreased 21 basis points to 6.17% as lower rates [ variable ] loans were partially offset by fixed rate loan repricing, a smaller drag related to cash flow hedges and higher nonaccrual interest.\nTurning to Slide 14. Our liquidity remained strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, investment securities and cash, including cash -- Fed totaled $54.8 billion, representing 26% of total assets. Average investment securities increased $2.7 billion. The yield on investment securities increased 18 basis points to 3.88% as the yield on new purchases exceeded the yield on maturing securities. In the fourth quarter, we purchased over $3.3 billion in securities at an average rate of 4.96%. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was 3.7 years. And the unrealized pretax loss on the available-for-sale portfolio was $205 million or 10 basis points CET1 drag if included in regulatory capital.\nTurning to Slide 15. We remain focused on growing customer deposits and saw a solid deposit growth in the fourth quarter. Average total deposits rose $3.1 billion or 2% to $164.6 billion, reflecting $2.6 billion increase in non-broker deposits. Deposit growth was concentrated in commercial, business banking and institutional services, while consumer deposits declined, reflecting lower time deposit balance sheet. Average noninterest-bearing deposits rose $0.4 billion to $46.5 billion, primarily related to trust demand deposits within our institutional services segment. Noninterest-bearing deposits were largely stable in our other segments. Excluding broker deposits, the average noninterest-bearing deposit mix in the fourth quarter was 30.4%. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 24 basis points to 2.64%.\nContinuing on Slide 16. Noninterest income was $657 million compared to $606 million in the linked quarter. Trust income increased $5 million to $175 million from higher sales and fees in corporate trust and agency services. Mortgage banking revenues were $117 million compared to $109 million in the third quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were the main driver, increasing $7 million from the linked quarter to $41 million, reflecting higher gains on the sale of commercial mortgage loans. Other revenues from operations increased $24 million to $176 million from a $23 million distribution from M&T's investment in DLG and strong syndication and other loan and letter of credit fees, which increased $5 million. Security gains of $18 million, mostly reflect the realized gains on the sale of noncore investments.\nTurning to Slide 17. Noninterest expenses were $1.36 billion, an increase of $60 million from the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased $15 million to $790 million, inclusive of higher incentive compensation. Equipment and occupancy increased $8 million to $133 million from our new data center starting to come online. Other costs from operations increased $40 million to $168 million, reflecting the redemption of certain M&T trust preferred obligations, and expenses associated with corporate real estate optimization, partially offset by pension-related credit. The efficiency ratio was 56.8% compared to 55% in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, when excluding notable items, the efficiency ratio was 55.3%.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 18 for credit. Net interest charge-offs for the quarter totaled $160 million or 47 basis points, up from 35 basis points in the linked quarter. The 2 largest charge-offs totaled $34 million and more C&I loans in unrelated industries. One, a marine dealer and the other in manufacturing. Overall, CRE-related charge-offs remain modest. Net charge-offs for the full year were 41 basis points, which is in line with our expectations. Nonaccrual loans decreased $236 million or 12% to $1.7 billion. Nonaccrual ratio decreased 17 basis points to 1.25% driven largely by upgrades out of nonaccrual as well as payoffs and charge-offs. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a provision of $140 million compared to net charge-offs of $160 million. The allowance to loan ratio decreased 1 basis point to 1.61%, partially related to the reduction in criticized loans, including those in nonaccrual status.\nPlease turn to Slide 19. When we file our 10-K in February, we estimate that the level of criticized loans to be -- to $9.9 billion compared to $10.9 million at the end of September. Improvement from the linked quarter was driven by a $302 million decline in C&I and $691 million decline in CRE criticized balances. Within C&I, the decline in credit size was concentrated in services, health services and dealer segments. At CRE, criticized decline was primarily within office, retail, health care, hotel and construction. Improved cash flows in many of the portfolios were impacted by COVID, namely health care, hotel and retail, and active refinance market helped drive the improvement in CRE criticized.\nTurning to Slide 22 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was an estimated 11.67% compared to 11.54% at the end of the third quarter. The increase was due to continued strong earnings, net of $200 million in share repurchases. At the end of the year, the negative AOCI impact in the CET1 ratio from the available super sale portfolio and the pension-related components, combined, would be approximately 4 basis points.\nNow let's -- turning to Slide 24 for outlook. Let's begin with the economic backdrop. The economy again remained resilient to the end of the year and we estimate GDP growth will come in at 2.8% for 2024, what the fourth quarter data is published. Consumer spending remains solid. There'll be no challenges for some segments reflected by increasing credit delinquency. The labor market remained sturdy in the fourth quarter while job growth and wage growth, supportive of consumer spending and continued economic expansion. We continue to see a soft landing as the most likely outcome for the U.S. economy. Inflation ticked up a bit in the fourth quarter, but we expect it will deaccelerate going forward.\nWith the economic backdrop, let's review our net interest income outlook. We expect tangible equivalent net interest income to be $7.1 billion to $7.2 billion with a net interest margin increasing through the year and in the mid-360s. Our interest rate sensitivity remains relatively neutral, aided by the balance sheet actions we took in 2024, including adding forward sorting hedges and building our securities portfolio. However, shifts in the shape of the yield curve will drive variability in the NII outlook. We expect full year average loan and lease balances to be $137 billion to $139 billion. This reflects continued growth in C&I and consumer with more modest growth in residential mortgages.\nFull year average commercial real estate balances are expected to decline in 2024 but we expect the balances to grow modestly in the second half of the year as we build the pipeline and begin to offset payoffs and paydowns with new originations. Full year average deposit balances are expected to be $164 billion to $166 billion. We remain focused on growing customer deposits at a reasonable cost and expect to reduce our reliance on noncustomer funding sources.\nTurning to fee income. We expect noninterest income to be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, a continued growth in noninterest income is driven by growth in our core businesses, which we expect will drive higher revenues in mortgage banking, merchant trust and [ surcharges ]. Additional mortgage subservicing, which is included in our outlook adds to our ongoing growth. The interest environment remains dynamic. However, our diversified product set should help provide relative stability from our fee income businesses.\nContinuing with expenses. We anticipate total noninterest expense, including intangible amortization to be $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. The outlook includes our first quarter seasonal salary and benefit increase, which is estimated to be $110 million. Also included in the outlook is approximately $43 million for intangible amortization. Our business lines remain focused on closely managing our expenses, allowing the bank to make targeted investments in projects and business opportunities that support our enterprise priorities.\nRegarding credit, we expect net charge-offs for the full year to again be near 40 basis points with continued normalization in the consumer portfolio and improvement of commercial credit costs. We expect taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 24.5%.\nAs it relates to capital, we expect to reach 11% CET1 ratio in 2025. With our 11.67% CET1 ratio at the end of 2024 and the expectation for continued strong capital generation, quarterly share repurchases are expected to be higher than the third and fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn 2025, we remain committed to our 4 priorities, including growing our New England and Long Island markets, optimizing resources through simplification, making our systems resilient and scalable continuing to scale and develop our risk management capabilities. Continued progress and completion of these priorities will enable the bank to continue to grow in the future, both organically and inorganically.\nTo conclude on Slide 25, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles while growing within the markets we serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth. And finally, we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital.\nNow let's open the call to questions before which, Todd will briefly review the instructions."

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daryl.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, BB&T Corp.\n\nGood morning, everyone. As you will hear on today's call, the second quarter results continue M&T's strong momentum for 2024. Turning to Slide 4. This April, we released our fourth annual sustainability report. We are proud of our continued progress towards our sustainability goals. Our efforts are creating positive outcomes for our businesses, our customers and our communities. Of note, in 2023, our total sustainability finance loans and investments totaled $3.1 billion.\nTurning to Slide 5. We continue to garner awards for our businesses, products and employees, including the highest customer satisfaction for mobile banking apps among regional banks according to J.D. Power and the securitization trustee of the year were willing to trust from Global Capital.\nTurning to Slide 7, which shows the results for the second quarter. As noted in this morning's press release, we are pleased with the second quarter results and the performance through the first half of the year. We continue to grow loans while also shifting the composition of our loan portfolio and reducing CRE. Customer deposits increased sequentially, while total deposit costs have leveled off. Net interest income and net interest margin, both inflected off the first quarter cyclical loan.\nAsset quality trends are performing as expected with reductions in nonaccrual and criticized balances and net charge-offs in line with our full year outlook. Capital continues to build with a CET1 ratio increasing to over 11.4%.\nWe continue to make progress on our capital return considerations, and our stress capital buffer decreased 20 basis points to 3.8% and reflecting the strength of our core earnings power and ongoing risk management work. Now let's look at the specifics for the second quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $3.73 for the second quarter, improved from $3.02 in the first quarter.\nNet income for the quarter was $655 million compared to $531 million in the linked quarter, an increase of 23%. M&T's second quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.24% and 9.95%, respectively. The CET1 ratio remains strong, growing to 11.44% at the end of the second quarter and tangible book value per share grew 3%. Included in our GAAP results for the recent quarter were pretax expenses of $5 million related to the FDIC special assessment, this amounts to $4 billion after tax or $0.02 per share.\nAs a reminder, results for this year's first quarter included $29 million related to the FDIC special assessment, amounting to $22 million after-tax effect or $0.13 per share. Slide 8 includes supplemental reporting of M&T's results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. M&T's net operating income for the second quarter was $660 million compared to $543 million in the linked quarter.\nDiluted net operating earnings per share were $3.79 for the recent quarter, up from $3.09 in the first quarter. Net operating income muted and ROTA and an ROTCE of 1.31% and 15.27% for the recent quarter.\nNext, let's look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 9. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.73 billion in the second quarter an increase of $39 million or 2% from the linked quarter. Net interest margin was 3.59%, an increase of 7 basis points from the first quarter. The primary drivers for the increase to the margin were a positive 6 basis points from fixed rate asset repricing, primarily within the investment and consumer loan portfolios, positive 5 basis points from sequentially higher nonaccrual interest. Positive 1 basis point from lower interest-bearing deposit costs, partially offset by a negative 3 basis points from the impact of swaps and a negative 2 basis points from higher borrowing costs and balances.\nThe second quarter included nonaccrual interest of $30 million compared to an average of $14 million in the prior 5 quarters. If nonaccrual interest was at the average run rate. The second quarter NIM would have been 3.56%. In total, swaps reduced NIM by 23 basis points in the second quarter.\nTurning to Slide 11 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased 1% to $134.6 million compared to the linked quarter. As has been the trend for the last several quarters, C&I and consumer growth outpaced the decline in CRE. C&I loans grew 2% to $58.1 billion, driven by increases in the market. dealer commercial services, mortgage warehouse lending and fund banking. The C&I growth reflects an increase in line utilization and higher origination activity.\nCRE loans declined 4% to $31.5 billion, reflecting continued low originations and elevated pay downs as we continue to manage our CRE concentration. Residential mortgage loans were relatively unchanged at $23 billion. Consumer loans grew 4% to $22 billion, reflecting growth in recreational finance and indirect auto loans.\nLoan yields increased 6 basis points to 6.38% aided by sequentially higher nonaccrual interest and fixed rate loan repricing and partially offset by a higher drag on our cash flow hedges.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the second quarter, investment securities and cash, including cash held at the Fed, totaled $56.5 billion, representing 27% of total assets. Average investment securities increased by $1.1 billion. The yield on the investment securities increased 31 basis points to 3.61% and as the yield on new purchases exceeded the yield on maturing securities.\nDuring the second quarter, repurchased over $3 billion in securities with an average yield of 5.16%, and a duration of 2.9 years. Over the remainder of the year, we expect an additional $2.8 billion in security maturities with an average yield of 2.5%, which we intend to reinvest at higher yields. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was 3.7 years and the unrealized pretax loss on AFS portfolio was only $239 million or 12 basis point drag on CET1.\nTurning to Slide 13. We remain focused on growing customer deposits and are pleased with the stabilization of our yields. Average total deposits declined $0.6 billion or less than 0.5% to $163.5 billion, reflecting sequential growth in average customer deposits offset by a $1.2 billion decline in broker deposits.\nAverage broker deposits of $12 billion reflects the decision to shrink noncustomer funding sources. Consumer mortgage business banking and institutional finance had stable to growing average deposits compared to the first quarter, while commercial deposits declined. Average noninterest-bearing deposits declined $0.9 billion to $47.7 billion, with lower commercial and business banking balances as a result of seasonally and continued but moderating disintermediation.\nNoninterest-bearing deposits were relatively stable for all other business lines. Excluding broker deposits, the noninterest-bearing deposit mix in the second quarter was 31.5% compared to 32.2% in the first quarter. Interest-bearing deposit cost decreased 3 basis points to 2.9%, while the total deposit cost was unchanged at 2.06%. This reflects more rational pricing in our markets.\nContinuing on Slide 14. Noninterest income was $584 million compared to $580 million in the linked quarter. Recall that the first quarter included $25 million Bayview distribution. Trust income increased $10 million to $170 million, reflecting approximately $4 million in seasonally tax preparation fees typically earned in the second quarter and strong sales performance across our institutional services business. Second quarter mortgage fees were $106 million compared to $104 million in the first quarter.\nCommercial mortgage fees increased $4 million from the linked quarter to $30 million, reflecting an uptick in origination activity while our residential mortgage fees decreased $2 million to $76 million reflecting lower servicing fees. Service charges increased $3 million to $127 million from higher consumer debit interchange fees.\nOther revenues from operation were unchanged at $152 million, with increases in merchant discount, credit card, letter of credit and other credit-related fees offsetting the $25 million first quarter BLG distribution. Security losses of $8 million primarily reflect realized losses on the sale of non-agency securities as we derisked our portfolio.\nTurning to Slide 15. Noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion, a decrease of $99 million from the first quarter. As is typical for M&T's first quarter results, expenses in the quarter included approximately $99 million of seasonally higher compensation costs. Salaries and benefits decreased $69 million to $764 million, reflecting seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter, offset by the full quarter impact of annual merit increases.\nThe second quarter included $5 million related to the FDIC special assessment compared to $29 million in the prior quarter. Other costs of operations decreased $18 million to $116 million from lower supplemental executive retirement costs and lower losses on lease terminations. The adjusted efficiency ratio, excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment was 55.1% and compared to 59.6% in the first quarter.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 16 for credit. Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $137 million or 41 basis points down from 42 basis points in the linked quarter. The 3 largest charge-offs were $40 million combined and represent C&I loans that span industries, including services, manufacturing and retail. The CRE charge-offs, including charge-offs within the office portfolio remain at manageable levels through the first half of the year.\nNonaccrual loans decreased $278 million to $2 billion. The nonaccrual ratio decreased 21 basis points to 1.5%, driven largely by a decrease in CRE reflecting favorable resolutions with borrowers, including payoffs and paydowns. In the second quarter, we recorded a provision of $150 million compared to net charge-offs of $137 million. The allowance to loan ratio increased 1 basis point to 1.63%. The provision for credit losses decreased $50 million compared to the first quarter, reflecting lower CRE loans, including criticized loans and modest improvement in forecasted real estate prices, partially offset by growth in C&I and consumer portfolios.\nPlease turn to Slide 17. When we file our Form 10-Q in a few weeks, we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be $12.1 billion compared to $12.9 billion at the end of March. The improvement for the linked quarter was largely driven by $987 million decrease in CRE criticized loans. Slide 18 provides additional detail on C&I criticized balances. Total C&I criticized balances increased $98 million. The majority of the increase is concentrated within vehicle and recreational finance dealers and health care sectors, offset by declines in most other industries. We saw additional migration to criticized within non-auto dealer portfolio, continuation from trends we discussed in the first quarter. However, there has been limited incremental migration within the portfolio since early in the second quarter.\nTurning to Slide 19 includes the detail on CRE criticized balances. Total CRE criticized balances decreased $987 million from the last quarter, upgrades and payoffs of criticized loans outpaced downgrades into criticized. The decline was across multifamily, retail, health services, hotel and construction, but we did see modest increases in office and industrial. The decrease reflects the effects to work with borrowers to find favorable resolutions. We are actively working through our criticized population for favorable outcomes.\nTurning to Slide 20 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was an estimated 11.44% compared to 11.08% at the end of the first quarter. The increase was due in part to the continued pause in repurchasing shares and capital and strong capital generation. At the end of the second quarter, the negative AOCI impact on the CET1 ratio from AFS securities and pension-related components would be approximately 19 basis points.\nNow turning to Slide 20 for outlook. The economy is slowing a bit, but remains in good health, job growth, wage growth and spending have slowed to more sustainable levels. We see the so-called soft landing scenario as having the highest probability, but the possibility remains for a mild recession brought on by the lagged impact of rate hikes. Consumer spending has slowed to a pace consistent with job and wage growth, alleviating inflation pressure for many goods and services.\nThe labor market remains positive but has clearly slowed. In turn, keeping a lid on wage pressure and leading to longer spells of unemployment. We expect that to continue for the rest of 2024. We Inflation figures remain above the Fed's target of 2%, chiefly because of rent and home prices. We expect the weaknesses seen in rent listings to play through the official inflation data helping bring the headline inflation figures down.\nInflation in the second quarter slowed and encouraging development after higher ratings in the first quarter. Shifting to the 2024 outlook. We expect net interest income to be $6.85 billion to $6.9 billion. Our outlook incorporates the latest forward curve that has 1 rate cut in September and another in December. However, we expect the level of rates to have a limited direct effect on net interest income outlook, as we have taken steps to reduce our asset sensitivity and are now more neutral. [indiscernible] longer rates in the first half of the year allowed us to take additional actions to protect NII and from lower interest rate environment.\nFor example, in the first half of the year, we shifted $3 billion of cash into securities and added $5 billion in forward starting cash flow hedges which became active in 2025. During -- or further, we expect that the downside in interest-bearing deposit beta will be approximately 30% to 40% in the first couple of rate cuts.\nFor the remainder of the year, M&T's balance sheet will be smaller with total average assets closer to $208 billion. We expect average cash to be approximately $25 billion and securities to be $30 billion with modest growth in loans and deposits. Our outlook for fees and expenses is unchanged, with fees, excluding any security gains or losses of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, and expenses, excluding the amounts related to the FDIC special assessment are expected to be $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion.\nWe continue to expect charge-offs for the full year to be near 40 basis points. The allowance level will be dependent on many factors, including changes in the macroeconomic outlook, portfolio mix and underlying asset quality. Our outlook for the tax rate is 24% to 24.5% excludes the discrete tax benefit in the first quarter.\nPreferred dividends are expected to be approximately $47 million in the third quarter and $36 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting our Series J issuance in May and the upcoming Series E redemption in August. Finally, as it relates to capital. Last quarter, we laid out 5 factors for consideration as we assessed our capital return plans for the rest of the year. The macroeconomic environment remains healthy. M&T continues to generate significant capital of the bank growing tangible common equity by over $500 million in the second quarter.\nWe continue to manage our CRE concentration with CRE as a percent of Tier 1 capital and allowance of 151% as of the end of the second quarter. Asset quality continues to improve with declines in nonaccrual and criticized loans and net charge-offs in line with expectations we laid out in the first quarter. M&T's preliminary stress capital buffer declined 20 basis points to 3.8%, reflecting many of the factors just mentioned.\nGiven the improvements in these factors, we plan to begin our share repurchase in the third quarter at a pace of $200 million per quarter through the end of the year. We expect to maintain our capital ratios at least at the current levels for the remainder of the year. We will continue to monitor the previously discussed factors as well as the revised Basel III proposal once made public, and we'll adjust our capital return plans if necessary.\nOur capital will also be used to support organic growth and grow new customer relationships. Our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients, communities, regulators investors and rating agencies.\nTo conclude on Slide 22. Our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles while growing within the markets we serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth. Finally, we are a disciplined acquirer and [indiscernible] of shareholder capital.\nNow let's open up to questions. before which Ashley will briefly review the instructions."

And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Market and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nMD, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast.\nIf you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules by going to our website, www.mtb.com. Once there, you can click on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.\nAlso before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information are included in today's earnings release materials and in the investor presentation as well -- and as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials.\nThe presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the earnings release and investor presentation, the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP are included in the appendix.\nJoining me on the call this morning is M&T's Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, Daryl Bible. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daryl.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, BB&T Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you will hear today, our first quarter results were a strong start for M&T Bank.\nTurning to Slide 3. We start the year with a renewed and strength commitment to making a difference in people's lives. Along with helping our customers meet their financial goals, we've continued to launch programs to uplift our communities and partners.\nLet me share with you a few examples of how we put these words into action. Since the beginning of the year, M&T has provided $900,000 to 30 organizations across our footprint to address affordable housing and homelessness and underserved low- to middle-income communities.\nWe launched a new Spanish language Small Business Accelerator program in French Georgia County, Maryland, which will support many small business owners in the region. We continue to invest in New England and Long Island through the second phase of our amplified funds. We do this when our communities are successful, so is our business.\nTurning to Slide 4. We are excited to see how deeply we embedded sustainability across the bank, and into our products and services. We have included several sustainability accomplishments from our upcoming 2023 sustainability report and look forward to sharing more when we release the complete report this quarter.\nTurning to Slide 6, which shows the results for the first quarter. The quarter was highlighted by strong C&I and consumer loan growth. PPNR was a solid $891 million. Expense control remains a key focus and was evident as adjusted expenses increased only 0.6% compared to the first quarter of 2023. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $3.02 for the quarter. It excluded the additional FDIC special assessment, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.15.\nOn an adjusted basis, M&T's first quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.05% and 8.49% respectively. The CET1 ratio remained strong, growing to 11.07% at the end of the first quarter and tangible book value share grew 1% to $99.54.\nNext, we look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 8. [ Axle ] equivalent. Net interest income was $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 2% from linked quarter. The net interest margin was 3.52%, down 9 basis points from the linked quarter. The primary drivers for the decrease to the margin were a negative 6 basis points from more nonaccrual interest and the impact of interest rate swaps. A negative 3 basis points from higher liquidity and cash moving into securities, negative 3 basis points from a deposit mix and pricing and a positive 3 basis points from all other items including the benefit of asset repricing in the investment portfolio and consumer loans.\nTurning to Slide 9 to look at the average balance sheet trends. Average investment securities increased $1.1 billion to $28.6 billion, reflecting the reinvestment of maturing security balances and a measured shift of a portion of our cash balances into investment securities. Average interest-bearing deposits at the [ Fed ] increased approximately $0.5 billion to $30.7 billion as our decision to have more liquidity on the balance sheet was largely offset by the previously mentioned investment security purchases. Average loans increased $1 billion or 1% and to $133.8 billion. Average deposits decreased $648 million or less than 1.5% to $164.1 billion.\nTurn to Slide 10 to talk about average loans. Average loan leases increased 1% to $133.8 billion compared to the linked quarter. Solid growth in C&I and consumer loans outpaced declines in CRE and residential mortgages. The growth in C&I loans was driven by a combination of increased line utilization in our middle market and dealer business lines, combined with new origination activity in equipment finance, corporate and institutional and fund banking as we continue to grow existing and new clients.\nLoan yields decreased 1% to 6.32% but increased 2 basis points sequentially when excluding the impact of the cash flow hedges on interest income in our CRE portfolio. Within our consumer portfolio, we continue to see the benefit of higher rates on new originations compared to maturing balances, with the consumer loans yielding increased 12 basis points to 6.54%.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our liquidity remains strong. At the first quarter, investment securities and cash, including cash out at the [ Fed ] totaled $62.3 billion, representing 29% of total assets. Average investment securities grew $1.1 billion reflecting the reinvestment of maturing securities and a shift of a portion of our cash balances into securities. The yield on investment securities increased 17 basis points to 3.30% as the yield on new purchases exceeded the yield on maturing securities. The duration securities portfolio at the end of the quarter was 3.8 years and the unrealized pretax loss on the available-for-sale portfolio was only 260 million.\nTurning to Slide 12. We continue to focus on growing customer deposits and we're pleased with the stabilization of our deposit balances and pricing. Average total deposits declined $648 million, less than 0.5% to $164.1 billion, while the average customer deposits increased sequentially. We saw average deposit growth in institutional services and wealth management, relatively stable deposits within commercial and a modest decline in the retail bank.\nThis growth allowed us to roll off some of our brokerage [ CDs ]. Average demand deposits declined $1.5 billion partially impacted by seasonal deposit declines in commercial and business banking. The shift towards higher-yielding products continued during the quarter, but at a much slowed meaningfully.\nThe mix average of noninterest-bearing deposit was 30% of total deposits, largely unchanged from last quarter. Excluding broker deposits, noninterest-bearing deposit mix in the first quarter was 32%. Encouragingly, we saw the pace of deposit cost increases slow through the quarter both the cost of interest-bearing deposits increasing 3 basis points to 2.93%. This represents the smallest quarterly increase since the start of the tightening in early 2022. Our core nonmaturity deposit costs increased only 1 basis point sequentially.\nContinuing on Slide 13. Noninterest income was $580 million, up slightly from the linked quarter. M&T normally receives an annual distribution from [ Bayview ] Lending Group during the first quarter of the year. This distribution was $25 million in 2024 compared to $20 million last year. Excluding the [ Bayview ] distribution, noninterest income declined $23 million sequentially. The decrease was largely driven by lower commercial mortgage banking revenues and syndication fees reflected in our other revenues from operations. Both of these fee items posted strong fourth quarter results. We recall that last year's first quarter included $45 million of fee income from CIT prior to the sale in April.\nTurning to Slide 14. We continue to focus on controlling expenses. Noninterest expenses were $1.4 billion. This year's first quarter and last year's fourth quarter, each had incremental FDIC special assessments amounting to $29 million and $197 million, respectively. Excluding the special assessment, adjusted noninterest expense increased by $8 million or 0.6% compared to last year's first quarter.\nOn a similar basis, adjusted noninterest expense increased $114 million or 9% from the linked quarter. This increase was largely driven by an approximate $99 million of seasonal higher compensation costs included in the first quarter. This figure is unchanged from last year's first quarter. As usual, we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 59.6% compared to 53.6% in the fourth quarter.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 15 for credit. Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $138 million or 42 basis points, down from 44 basis points in the linked quarter. CRE net charge-offs declined meaningfully due to the resolution of 3 office-related credits in last year's fourth quarter. The 2 largest charge-offs were previously criticized C&I loans and amounted to approximately $31 million total. One credit was a nonautomotive dealer and the other was in the services industry.\nNonaccrual loans increased by $136 million to $3.2 billion. The nonaccrual ratio increased 9 basis points to 1.71%. This was largely driven by an increase in C&I and CRE health care nonaccrual loans. Loans 30 to 89 days [ past due ] declined sequentially across each portfolio.\nIn the first quarter, we recorded a provision of $200 million compared to the net charge-offs of $138 million. This resulted in an allowance build of $62 million and increased the allowance to loan ratio by 3 basis points to 1.62%. The current [ bill ] primarily reflects a deterioration in the performance of loans to certain commercial borrowers, including nonautomotive dealers and health care facilities as well as growth in some sectors of M&T C&I and consumer loan portfolios.\nPlease turn to Slide 16. When we file our Form 10-Q in a few weeks, we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be $12.9 [ billion ] compared to $12.6 [ million ] at the end of December. D&I criticized loans increased $641 million, while CRE criticized loans decreased $277 million with declines in both permanent and construction.\nSlide 17 provides additional detail on C&I criticized balances. Total C&I criticized balances increased $641 million. The majority of that increase is concentrated within dealer and manufacturing industries. We are seeing areas of pressure, particularly in certain businesses that may be more acutely impacted by the lag effects of higher rates or those impacted by reduced large ticket consumer discretionary spending or a shift in spending on goods to services. For example, we saw an uptick in criticized loans to our nonauto dealer industries as higher rates have impacted large ticket discretionary consumer spend and earlier COVID-driven buying saturated demand for these types of purchases.\nSlide 18 includes detail on CRE criticized balances. Total CRE criticized balances decreased 277 million from the last quarter. The decline is across most [indiscernible] types though we did not see an increase in office and health care criticized. We are seeing improvements in occupancy and staffing within health care, but reimbursement rate improvement has been uneven, resulting in modest net increase in criticized balances within the portfolio.\nLast quarter, we noted an upcoming review of the construction portfolio. Over 80% of that review has been completed, and I am pleased to note that their review resulted in limited incremental downgrades of construction loans into criticized. The remainder of the review generally consists of smaller balance loans, but we would not expect the outcome of the remainder of that review to be significantly different than the portion already completed.\nTurning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of the first quarter was an estimated 11.7% compared to 10.98% in the fourth quarter. The increase was due in part due to the continued pause and repurchasing shares, combined with continued strong capital generation. At the end of the quarter, the negative AOCI impact on CET1 ratio from the AFS security and pension-related components will be approximately 20 basis points.\nNow turning to Slide 20 for the outlook. The economy continues to perform well, and the labor market remains strong despite the challenges faced by firms and new consumers. The economic outlook that we discussed on the January earnings call remains unchanged.\nShifting to 2024 earnings, the outlook is largely unchanged from our update in March with an upward bias to our NII outlook. For NII, recall that the outlook we provided in January considered a range of rate cut scenarios from 6 cuts to 3. As the forward curve has settled closer to 2 cuts, we expect NII to be $6.8 billion with possible upside. Our outlook for fees and expenses is unchanged. The expense outlook excludes incremental special assessment incurred in the first quarter.\nWe continue to expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near to the 40 basis points. The allowance level will be dependent on many factors, including [ synergies ] in the macroeconomic outlook, portfolio mix and underlying asset quality. Our outlook for the tax rate of 24% to 24.5% excludes discrete tax benefit in the first quarter.\nFinally, as it relates to capital, our capital, coupled with our limited investment security marks has been a clear differentiator for M&T. We take our responsibility to manage our shareholders' capital very [indiscernible] and return more when it is appropriate to do that. Our businesses are performing well, and we are growing new relationships each and every day.\nWhile the economic uncertainty [indiscernible] share repurchases remain on hold. We plan to reassess repurchases after the second quarter and will consider a range of factors, including the macroeconomic environment, the bank's capital generation results from the 2024 stressed [indiscernible] level of commercial real estate loans and overall asset quality.\nThat said, we continue to use our capital for organic growth and growing new customer relationships. Buybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and will again in the future. In the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients, communities, regulators, investors and rating agencies.\nTo conclude on Slide 21, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. While economic uncertainty remains high, that is when M&T has historically outperformed its peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders including shareholder. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles while growing within the markets we serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth. Finally, we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent [indiscernible] of shareholder capital.\nNow let's open up the call."

[Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nAnd I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Market and Investor Relations.

Bible\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, BB&T Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you will hear today on the call, 2023 mark a banner year for M&T Bank. On Slide 3, I want to acknowledge that the keys to our success to what continues to drive performance remains our purpose, mission and operating principles. Our focus on making a difference in people's lives and creating a positive impact in the communities we serve is core to how we operate. It is evident in how we show up for our communities in the moments of need like in Vermont and Lewiston, Maine, where we continue to help those impacted by tragedies. .\nIt is why we are committed to supporting small businesses that are the backbone of local economies. And it dictates how our charitable foundation which celebrated its 30th anniversary last year, continues to uplift our partners. It is all done alongside our daily work of helping our customers achieve their financial goals.\nTurning to Slide 4. We're excited to see how deeply we've embedded sustainability across the bank and into our products and services. I look forward to sharing more information on the impact of our businesses when we release our 2023 sustainability report in the spring.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6. As we reflect on 2023, there are several successes to highlight. We continue to realize the benefits from the People's United franchise and are pleased with the growth in New England with M&T finishing as top SBA lender in Connecticut.\nC&I loans grew by over $5 billion or 11% in 2023, aided by the growth in several specialty businesses brought over by People's United. This C&I growth outpaced the reduction in CRE as we continue to optimize the way we serve these customers in the most capital-efficient manner possible. At the end CRE loans represented approximately 25% of total loans. Our capital remains strong with a CET1 ratio near 11%.\nWe continue to leverage our strong capital and liquidity levels to grow new customer accounts and relationships. We also reduced asset sensitivity in 2023 while protecting shareholder capital and value. However, our work is not done. We continue to recognize the value created by the merger with Peoples United, while also bringing more capital efficient [indiscernible] neutral balance sheet that will produce stable and predictable revenue and earnings over the long term.\nNow let's review the highlights for the full year. Results for the full year 2023 were strong. We generated positive operating leverage, solid loan growth, improved expense control through the year and growth in EPS and strong returns.\nOur pretax pre-provision revenue, or PPNR, was $4.2 billion, up 22% from 2022, and we generated 3.9% positive operating leverage. Net charge-offs were 33 basis points, in line with our expectations and long-term average.\nGAAP net income was $2.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $15.79, up 37% from the prior year. As a reminder, '22 results included merger charges, gain on sale of our insurance business and a sizable contribution to our charitable foundation. While 2023 included a gain on the sale of the CIT business and the FDIC special assessment.\nIf you exclude these items, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $15.72 during 2023, up 11% compared to 2022. Our adjusted returns were also very strong with return on assets of 1.33% and return on common equity of 11%.\nTurning to Slide 7, which shows the results of the fourth quarter were also strong. PPNR declined modestly from the linked quarter to just over $1 billion. C&I and consumer loan growth was strong.\nExpense control was evident as adjusted expenses declined 2% from the linked quarter and were down each consecutive quarter in 2023.\nDiluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.74 for the fourth quarter. If we exclude the FDIC special assessment, adjusted diluted earnings per common share were $3.62. On an adjusted basis, M&T's fourth quarter results produced an ROA and ROCE of 1.19% and 9.8%, respectively.\nNext, we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our fourth quarter results. Please turn to Slide 8.\nTaxable equivalent net interest income was $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter down 3% from linked quarter. This decline was driven by higher interest rates on customer deposit funding and changing deposit mix, partially offset by higher interest rates and earning assets.\nNet interest margin was 3.61%, down 18 basis points from the linked quarter. The primary drivers of the decrease to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift contributing a negative 7 basis points, the impact of higher rates on customer deposit funding, net of the benefit from higher rates on earning assets contributing a negative 5 basis points and a negative 6 basis points for carrying additional liquidity on the balance sheet.\nTurning to Slide 9 to look at the average balance sheet trends. Average investment securities were $27.5 billion, decreasing modestly during the fourth quarter. Average interest-bearing deposits at the Fed increased $3.5 billion to $30.2 billion. Due to our decision to have more liquidity on the balance sheet. This was mainly funded with strong deposit growth.\nAverage loans increased slightly to $132.8 billion and average deposits grew $2 billion to $164.7 billion.\nTurning to Slide 10 to talk about average loans. Average loans and leases increased slightly. Growth in C&I and consumer loans outpaced declines in CRE and residential mortgage loans. Growth in C&I loans were driven largely by dealer, fund banking and corporate and institutional businesses.\nLoan yields increased 14 basis points to 6.33% with higher yields across all loan categories. Of note, the consumer loan yield increased 26 basis points as we continue to benefit from higher yields on new originations compared to yields on runoff balances.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our liquidity remains strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, investment securities and cash, including cash out at the Fed totaled $56.7 billion, representing 27% of total assets. The duration of the investment securities portfolio at the end of 2023 was about 3.7 years and the unrealized pretax loss and available-for-sale portfolio was only $251 million.\nTurning to Slide 12. We continue to focus on growing customer deposits, and we're pleased with our growth in average deposits. Average deposits totaled grew $2 billion. Approximately 3/4 of that quarterly growth was from customer deposits.\nAverage demand deposits declined $3.8 billion, reflecting a continued shift toward higher-yielding products such as sweeps, on market savings and time to profits. The mix of average noninterest-bearing deposits was 30% of total deposits compared to 33% sequentially. Excluding broker deposits, the noninterest-bearing deposit mix in the fourth quarter was 33%. Encouragingly, we saw the pace of deposit cost increases slow through the quarter.\nContinue on Slide 13. Noninterest income was $578 million, up 3% sequentially. The increase was largely driven by a strong quarter for commercial mortgage banking revenues, growth and trust income and a small unrealized gain on certain equity securities. Other income also benefited from higher loan syndication fees. The decrease in rates towards the end of the quarter drove the increase in commercial mortgage banking revenues.\nTurning to Slide 14. We continue to focus on controlling expenses. Noninterest expenses were $1.45 billion. Excluding the $197 million FDIC special assessment, noninterest expense were $1.25 billion, down 2% from linked quarter, and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.6%, largely unchanged from the third quarter. The decrease was driven by reductions in other expenses as a result of losses associated with certain retail banking activities in the linked quarter and lower merchant discount and credit card fees.\nThe decrease in other expenses was partially offset by higher professional and other services. Salary and benefits decreased modestly from the third quarter as a result of lower average head count and seasonally lower benefit costs, partially offset by higher severance expenses.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 15 for credit. Full year net charge-offs totaled 33 basis points in line with our long-term historical average and expectations were set out earlier in 2023.\nNet charge-offs for the quarter totaled $148 million or 44 basis points. up 15 basis points over the linked quarter. This quarter's increase was largely driven by 3 office-related charge-offs located in New York City, Boston and Washington, D.C. and 2 C&I charge-offs related to an online retailer and to an RV dealer.\nNonaccrual loans have trended down each consecutive quarter since the first quarter of 2023. That trend continued in the fourth quarter with nonaccrual loans declining $176 million from linked quarter to $2.2 billion. The nonaccrual ratio declined 15 basis points from the third quarter to 1.62%. The decline was primarily driven by the transfer of certain loans to accrual, commercial payoffs and charge-offs on loans previously deemed nonaccrual.\nSince the end of 2022, we have increased the allowance over $200 million, and the allowance to loan ratio was 13 basis points, ending 2023 at 1.59%.\nIn the fourth quarter, we recorded a provision of $225 million compared to net charge-offs of $148 million. This resulted in an allowance build of $77 million this quarter and increased the allowance to loan ratio by 4 basis points. The current quarter build was primarily reflective of the commercial real estate values and higher interest rates contributing to modest deterioration in the performance of loans to commercial borrowers as well as loan growth in the C&I and consumer portfolios.\nTurning to Slide 16. When we file our Form 10-K in a few weeks, we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be $12.6 billion compared to $11.1 billion at the end of September. We completed thorough reviews, covering more than 60% of all CRB loans, including maturities in the next 12 months, construction loans, watch loans and all criticized loans.\nThe increase in criticized CRE loans was tied to these reviews and to 2024 maturities were the prospect of continued higher rates could negatively impact performance of the portfolios or create shortfalls in debt service coverage or require interest reserves for construction loans. The growth in criticized C&I loans was not tied to any specific review, but rather completion of an annual review cycle and our ongoing quarterly update upon receipt of interim financials.\nGenerally, our reviews do not incorporate any benefit of the forward curve at potentially lower interest rates. The 10 largest downgrades accounted for half of the total C&I downgrades and represented a range of industries. Common themes include pressures from higher interest rates and labor costs.\nDuring the fourth quarter, criticized non-owner-occupied C&I loans increased $663 million, accounting for 44% of the total increase in criticized loans. Criticized permanent CRE loans increased $441 million, representing 29% of the increase and criticized construction loans increased $375 million.\nTurn to Slide 17 and 18 for more details on the criticized loan portfolio. About 18% of the increase in criticized loans was driven by health care, 13% by multifamily and 9% are retail CRE loans.\nLoan to values remain strong for these loan types ranging from low 50% range for retail, mid-50% range for multifamily and high 50% range for health care. To date, modifications at maturity have had sponsors generally support their loans through replenishment of reserves, loan paydowns and enhanced recourse. That is why our credit size has not led to growth in nonaccruals. Our conservative underwriting and strong client selection has been supportive of these assets.\nReflective of the financial strength of the portfolio diversification of our CRE borrowers, 96% of criticized accrual loan balances and 53% of nonaccruals loans are paying as agreed.\nTurning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of 2023 was an estimated 10.98% compared to 10.95% at the end of the third quarter. The increase was due in part to continued pause in repurchase in shares, combined with continued strong capital generation. At the end of December, the negative AOCI impact on CET1 ratio for available-for-sale securities and pension-related components would be approximately 20 basis points.\nNow turning to Slide 20 for outlook. First, let's talk about the economic outlook. We see so-called soft landing scenario as having the highest probability, but the possibility remains for mild recession brought down by lagged impact of rate hikes from last year. We are encouraged to be continued strong performance by the consumer as continued drag gains as well as wage growth above inflation helped drive consumer spending.\nConsumer spending has slowed enough to alleviate inflation pressure for many goods and services. We expect that to continue in 2024.\nInflation figures remain above the Fed target of 2%, chiefly because of rents and home prices. While the prices of many consumer goods have fallen and inflation for consumer services has slowed.\nWe expect weakness seen in rent listings to play through to the official inflation data in 2024 and helping to bring the headline inflation figures down. Our outlook incorporates the forward curve that has multiple 25 basis point Fed cuts in 2024. With that backdrop, let's review our net interest income outlook.\nWe expect taxable net interest income to be in the $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion range and net interest margin in the 350. This outlook reflects the impact of higher deposit funding costs and the impact of different interest rate scenarios. As we have discussed, we continue to carry a high level of liquidity.\nOur current level of HQLA is about $46 billion, which is 2/3 in the cash and 1/3 in investment securities. In 2024, we started to shift some cash into securities. This, combined with other potential hedging actions can help protect the downside risk for NII from lower rates, but may reduce NII in 2024.\nWe expect full year average loan and lease balances to be in the $135 billion to $136 billion range. We expect growth in C&I and consumer but anticipate declines in CRE and residential mortgages.\nAverage deposits are expected to be in the $163 billion to $165 billion range. We are focused on growing customer deposits at a reasonable cost. The level of broker deposits is expected to decline through the year.\nTurning to fees. We expect noninterest income to be in the $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion range. We expect solid fee income across many business lines. Lower rates will help drive stronger residential and commercial mortgage banking revenue Trust income is expected to grow from current levels from higher valuations and increasing clients.\nTurning to expenses. We anticipate noninterest expenses, including intangible amortization to be in the $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion range. This outlook includes our typical first quarter seasonal salary and benefit increase, which is estimated to be $110 million. We also included the outlook to be approximately $53 million for intangible amortization.\nOur business lines are focused on holding their expenses flat while allowing us to continue to invest in the franchise and our key priorities. These priorities include growing the New England and Long Island markets, optimizing resources in both expense savings and revenue generation transferring our systems and processes, making them more resilient and scalable and continuing to build out our risk management.\nTurning to credit. We expect net charge-offs for the full year to be near 40 basis points due to the ongoing credit cost normalization in the loan portfolio and resolution of some stress credits. We expect that the taxable equivalent rate to be 24.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points.\nFinally, as it relates to capital, our capital, coupled with limited investment security works has been a clear differentiator for M&T. The strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary. We take our responsibility to manage our shareholders' capital very seriously and will return more when it is appropriate to do that. Our businesses are performing very well, and we are growing new relationships each and every day.\nWhile every economic uncertainty is improving, our share repurchase remains on hold. Our decision to resume share repurchases will consider the results of the 2024 internal and supervisory stress test, including the stress test capital buffer.\nAdditional clarity on Basel III end game regulations and continued stabilization and economic conditions as it relates to the probability of a mild recession. That said, we continue to use our capital for organic growth and growing new customer relationships.\nBuybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and well again in the future. In the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients, communities, regulators, investors and rating agencies.\nOn Slide 21, there is a summary of 3 enhancements we made to our financial reporting. First, we reclassified the substantial majority of owner-occupied loans and related interest income from CRE to C&I loans. This better aligns with the classification with the underlying management and repayment source of the loans. Second, in the upcoming 10-K we are changing our operating segments to reflect how management organizes its businesses to make operating decisions, allocate capital resources and assess performance. Third, as certain categories have started to attribute more or less to our expense base, we opted to include printing, postage and supplies and other costs and operations and break out professional and other services as a distinct line item in the income statement.\nTo conclude, on Slide 22, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. Why the economic uncertainty remains high, that is when M&T has historically outperformed peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperformance through all economic cycles while growing in the markets we serve. We remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth.\nFinally, we are disciplined, inquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital. Our integration of People's United is complete, and we are confident in the ability to realize our potential post merger.\nNow let's open up the call to questions before which Michael will briefly review the instructions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Market and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nMD, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\n\nThank you, Angela, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules by going to our website, www.mtb.com.\nOnce there, you can click on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link. Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information are included in today's earnings release materials and in the investor presentation as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials.\nPresentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the earnings release and in the investor presentation. The appropriate reconciliations to GAAP are included in the appendix. Joining me on the call this morning is M&T's Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, Daryl Bible. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daryl.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, BB&T Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our purpose, mission and operating principles on Slide 3. I would like to thank our more than 22,000 M&T colleagues for all their hard work, whether serving our customers or our communities, our employees continue to deliver on our purpose, making a difference in people's lives.\nThis purpose drives our operating principles. We believe in local scale, that is combining local knowledge and hands-on customer service of Community Bank with the resources of a large financial institution. Our 28 communities are led by on-the-ground regional presidents. Their knowledge allows us to better understand and meet the needs of our customers and communities. And importantly, this approach continues to produce strong results for our shareholders. Our local scale has led to superior credit performance, top deposit share and high operating and capital efficiency over the long term.\nMoving to Slide 4. Our seasoned talent and diverse board are keys to gaining in-depth understanding of our customers' needs and expectations. We have sound technology solutions, coupled with caring employees, which provide a differentiated client experience.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. This slide showcases how we activate our purpose through our operating principles. When our customers and communities succeed, we all succeed. Our investment in enhancing the customer experience and delivering impactful products have fueled organic growth. We also believe in supporting small business owners who play a vital role in our communities. Despite operating in only 12 states, we are ranked as #6 SBA lender in the country, the 15th consecutive year M&T is ranked in the nation's top 10 SBA lenders. And for the first time, we have finished as the top SBA lender in Connecticut, an important milestone following our acquisitions of Peoples United.\nOur commitment to supporting the communities we serve extends to affordable housing projects with almost $2.3 billion in financing and over 2,600 home loans for low and moderate income residence. Additionally, M&T Bank and our Charitable Foundation granted over $47 million in support of our communities in 2022 and approximately $30 million so far in 2023.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. Here, we highlight our ongoing commitment to the environment. Last year, we invested over $230 million in renewable energy sector, and have significantly reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since 2019. Our ESG report was published in July, but I encourage you to review this slide for some of the highlights. M&T's ESG ratings have improved at Moody's, MSCI and Sustainalytics.\nTurning to Slide 8. There are several successes to highlight this quarter. We continue to see growth in auto dealerships as well as specialty businesses. We continue to grow customer deposits despite increasing competition and building on the strong liquidity position and comparative strength of our financial position in the industry allows us to continue lending in support of communities and local businesses. We remain focused on diligently managing expenses. Our third quarter results continue to reflect the strength of our core earnings power.\nThird quarter revenues have grown 4% compared to last year's third quarter. Pre-provision net revenues have increased 4% to $1.1 billion. Credit remained stable. Net charge-offs decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date, we still remain below the historical long-term average. GAAP net income for the quarter was $690 million, up 7% versus like quarter in 2022. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $3.98 for the third quarter, up 13% from last year's similar quarter.\nNow let's review our net operating results for the quarter on Slide 9. M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $702 million and diluted net operating earnings per share was [ $4.05 ]. And Net operating return on tangible common equity was 17.41% and tangible book value per share increased 3% compared to the end of June.\nOn Slide 10, you will see that diluted GAAP earnings per share was down 21% from linked quarter. Recall the results from the second quarter of last year indicated an after-tax [ $157 ] gain from the sale of the CIT business in April. Excluding this gain, GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were down 3% compared to the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an ROA and ROE of 1.33% and 10.99%, respectively.\nNext, we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated the third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.79 billion in the third quarter, down $23 million from the linked quarter. This decline was driven largely by higher interest rates on consumer deposit funding. An unfavorable funding mix change, partially offset by higher interest rates on earning assets and one additional day. The net interest margin for the past quarter was 3.79%, down 12 basis points from linked quarter. The primary drivers of the decrease to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift, which reduced margin by 7 basis points. The net impact from higher interest rates on customer deposits, net benefit from higher rates on earning assets which we estimate reduced the margin by 6 basis points. The remaining 1 basis point was due to higher nonaccrual interest, net of the impact of 1 additional day.\nTurning to Slide 12. Average earning assets increased $1.5 billion from the linked quarter, due largely to the strong deposit growth that drove the $3 billion growth at the Fed. Average loans declined $928 million and average investment securities declined $630 million.\nTurning to Slide 13 to talk about average loans. Total loans and leases averaged $132.6 million for the third quarter of 2023, down 1% compared to the linked quarter. Looking at loans by category, on average basis compared to the second quarter, C&I loans increased slightly to $44.6 billion. We continue to see growth in dealer and specialty businesses. During the third quarter, average CRE loans decreased by 2% to $44.2 billion. This decline was driven largely by our continued strategy to reduce on-balance sheet exposure to this asset class.\nWe have chosen to modernize our suite of products and services to offer more alternatives to better serve customers and to do so in a more capital-efficient manner possible. Average residential real estate was $23.6 billion, down 1%, largely due to portfolio paydowns. Average customer loans were down slightly to $20.2 billion. The decline was driven by lower auto loan and HELOC balances, partially offset by the growth in recreational finance and credit card loans.\nTurning to Slide 14. Average investment securities decreased to $28 billion during the third quarter. The duration of the investment securities book at the end of September was 3.9 years and the unrealized pretax available-for-sale portfolio was only $447 million. At the end of the third quarter, cash held at the Fed and investment securities totaled $59.2 billion, representing 28% of total assets.\nTurning to Slide 15. We continue to focus on growing deposits with our customers, and we're pleased with the growth in both average and end-of-period customer deposits. Average total deposits grew $3.3 billion. However, consistent with our experience in prior rising rate environments, increased competition for deposits and customer behavior continues to mix shift within the deposit base to higher cost deposits. Average customer deposits increased $1 billion. The customer deposit mix to migrate to average demand deposits declined $2.3 billion in favor of commercial sweeps and customer money market savings and time deposits.\nAverage broker deposits increased $3.2 billion, while a federal home loan bank advances decreased $2.2 billion. On average, brokered money market and now increased $800 million Broker time increased $1.5 billion. Broker deposits represent just one of the several funding vehicles that we can employ in our management of the balance sheet. At September 30 of this year, broker deposits represented 8% of our outstanding deposits and short-term borrowings. The pace and reduction in demand deposits seem to have decreased during the quarter. Our determined focus on retaining and growing customer deposits yielded positive results during the quarter.\nNext, let's discuss noninterest income. Please turn to Slide 16. Noninterest income totaled $560 million in the third quarter compared to $803 million in the linked quarter. As noted earlier, the second quarter included $225 million from the sale of the CIT business. Excluding this gain, third quarter noninterest income decreased $18 million compared to the second quarter driven predominantly by $15 million related to one month of the CIT trust revenues included in the previous quarter. Other revenues categories were largely unchanged from the linked quarter.\nTurning to Slide 17 for expenses. Noninterest expenses were $1.28 billion in the third quarter of this year, down $15 million from the linked quarter. That decrease in expense was due to $11 million in lower compensation and benefit costs, reflecting lower average headcount, lower expenses for contracted resources and over time. Million lower in other cost of operations, largely reflecting lower sub-advisory fees as a result of the sale of the CIT business, lower legal-related expenses, partially offset by losses associated with certain retail banking activities. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and security gains or losses from a denominator was 53.7% in the recent quarter compared to 53.4% in the linked quarter after excluding the gain from the sale of the CIT business.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 18 for credit. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $54 million from the end of the linked quarter. In the third quarter, we recorded a $150 million provision in credit losses which was equal to the second quarter. Net charge-offs were $96 million in the third quarter compared to $127 million in the linked quarter. The reserve build was primarily reflective of softening CRE values and the variability in the timing and the amount of CRE charge-offs. At the end of the third quarter, nonaccrual loans were $2.3 billion, a decrease of $94 million compared to the prior quarter and represent 1.77% of loans, down 6 basis points sequentially.\nAs noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $96 million, significant charge-offs were tied in 4 large credits, 3 large office buildings in Washington, D.C., Boston and Connecticut, and one large health care provider operating in multiple properties in Western New York and Pennsylvania. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 29 basis points for the third quarter compared to 38 basis points in the second quarter. This brings our year-to-date net charge-off rate to 30 basis points, which is below our long-term average of 33 basis points.\nWe continue to assess the impact on future maturities and our investor real estate portfolio due to the level of interest rates, the impact of value declines and emerging tenancy issues. Continued targeted deep portfolio dies in office, health care and multifamily portfolios are being done to identify any new emerging issues. When we file our upcoming Form 10-Q in the few weeks, we will estimate the level of criticized loans will be up to mid- to high single-digit percent as compared to the end of June, largely due to increases in investor real estate.\nReflective of the financial strength and portfolio diversification of the CRE borrowers, almost 90% of the criticized loans are paying as agreed. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, were $354 million at the end of this quarter compared to $38 million -- $380 million sequentially and total 76% of these 90 days past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities.\nTurning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T's CIT ratio at the end of September was an estimated 10.94% compared to 10.59% at the end of the second quarter. The increase was due in part to the continuation of the pause of repurchasing shares. At the end of September, based upon the proposed capital rules, the negative AOCI impact on the CET1 ratio from variable for sale securities and pension-related components would be approximately 36 basis points.\nNow turning to Slide 20 for outlook. With 3 quarters in the books, we will focus on the outlook for the fourth quarter. First, let's talk about the economic outlook. The economic environment was supportive in the third quarter, and we were cautiously optimistic heading into the last quarter of this year. In the third quarter, the overall economy continued to expand, thanks to the strong consumer spending and steady capital expenditures by businesses, though the housing market continues to struggle in the high rate environment.\nEncouragingly, inflation continued to slow in label markets, while still tight improved substantially with steady hiring while age pressures dissipated. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic that the economy will continue to grow, but at a slower rate. We expect that, that slower growth will continue reducing inflation pressures. The Federal Reserve has probably reached the end of its hike cycle, given slower inflation and recent run-up in long-term rates.\nWith that economic backdrop, let's review our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable equivalent net interest income to be in the $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion range. As we noted on the previous calls, a key driver to net interest income continues to be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth. We expect the continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows. We remain focused on growing customer deposits. For the fourth quarter, we expect average deposits to be about the same level with growth of interest-bearing customer deposits but continue to decline in demand deposit balances. This is expected to translate into a through-the-cycle interest-bearing customer deposit beta through the fourth quarter this year to be in the mid-40% range. This deposit beta excludes broker deposits, including broker deposits, would add 6% to the beta. While the percent of the cumulative beta is slowing, we anticipate it will continue rising into the first half of next year.\nNext, let's discuss the outlook for the average loan growth, which should be the main driver of earning asset growth. We expect average loans and lease balances to be slightly higher than the third quarter of $1.33 billion level. We expect the growth in C&I, but anticipate declines in CRE and residential mortgages for our consumer loan balances should be relatively flat.\nTurning to fees. We expect noninterest income to be essentially flat compared to the third quarter. Turning to expenses. We anticipate expenses, excluding intangible amortization and the FDIC special assessment to be in the $1.245 billion to the $1.265 billion range in the fourth quarter. Intangible amortization is expected to be in the $15 million range and the FDIC special assessment is anticipated to be $183 million. Given the prospects of slowing revenue growth we remain focused on diligently managing expenses. Turning to credit. We continue to expect loan losses for the full year to be near M&T's long-term average of 33 basis points. which implies fourth quarter charge-offs could be higher than the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect tax flow equipment tax rate to be in the 25% range.\nFinally, as it relates to capital, our capital, coupled with limited investment security marks have been a clear differentiator for M&T. M&T has proven to be a safe haven for clients and communities. The strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary. We take our responsibility to manage our shareholders' capital very seriously and return capital loan it is appropriate to do that. Our businesses are performing very well, and we are growing new relationships each and every day. We are still evaluating the proposed capital rules so that we believe that now is not the time to be purchasing shares. That said, we are positioned to use our capital for organic growth. Buybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and will again in the future. In the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us from our clients, communities, regulators, investors and rating agencies.\nTo conclude on Slide 21, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. While economic uncertainty remains high, that is when M&T has historically outperformed its peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles with growth about 2x that of peers. Our strong shareholder returns include 15% to 20% return on tangible common equity and robust dividend growth.\nFinally, our disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of capital -- shareholder capital and our integrated -- our integration of Peoples merger is completed. We are confident in our ability to realize our potential post merger. Now with that, I'll turn it back to our caller briefly review the instructions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Market and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nMD, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\n\nThank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules by going to our website, www.mtb.com. Once there, you can click on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link. Also before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information are included in today's earnings release materials and in the investor presentation, as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. The presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures as identified in the earnings release and investor presentation. The appropriate reconciliations to GAAP are included in the appendix.\nJoining me on the call this morning are M&T's Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, Daryl Bible, and Senior Executive Vice President and Former CFO, Darren King. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Daryl Bible.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, BB&T Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking Darren for his help with my transition. I'm very appreciative of his guidance and support. I'm also grateful for everyone across the bank that is welcoming and help me get up to speed quickly, including my incredibly talented finance case. Like me, I'm sure all of you are extremely happy that we now have an earnings presentation. So thank you to Investor Relations, corporate communications and corporate reporting teams for making this a reality. I'm very excited about the work we are doing and the transition has gone even smoother than I could have anticipated.\nI'm proud to be part of M&T's strong financial history, consistent operating philosophy and conservative, community-focused banking principles. I'm even prouder to be part of a company that is tied to its purpose, to make a difference in people's lives. I would like to thank our over 22,000 M&T colleagues for all their hard work each and every day. You are driven by the idea of delivering on our purpose and guided by pursuit of core values. It is because of you that M&T continues to make a difference in our customers' lives and continue to produce strong results for our shareholders.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. Let's start with our purpose, mission and operating principles. Our purpose is to make a difference in people's lives by focusing on communities we serve. Our purpose drives our operating principles. We believe in local scale, with 28 community-led regional presidents who make decisions about loans and community activities. This local scale has led us to superior credit performance, top deposit share and higher operating and capital efficiency. Our performance is fueled by a relentless focus on customers, talent and communities.\nMoving to Slide 4. We deliver our customers, we have seasoned, solid, diverse Board and new capabilities that provide solutions that make a meaningful difference to our customers. Please let's turn to Slide 5. This slide showcases how we activate our purpose through our operating principles. When our customers and communities succeed, we also see our investment in enhancing customer experience and delivering impactful products have fueled organic growth. A significant milestone this year was a designation of over 119 multicultural banking branches across our footprint with more to come in our expanded communities.\nThese branches are community assets dedicated to the cultural fluency for our customers. We also believe in supporting small business owners who play a vital role in our communities. Despite operating only in 12 states, we rank as the #6 SBA lender in the country and ranked highly in 10 of our 16 markets. Our commitment to supporting the communities we serve extends to affordable housing projects with over $2.3 billion in financing and over 2,600 home loans for low and moderate income residents. Additionally, M&T Bank and our Charitable Foundation granted over $47 million to support our communities and [ '22 ] allowance. Please turn to Slide 6. Here, we highlight our commitment to the environment. We have invested over $230 million in renewable energy sector and significantly reduced our electricity consumption since 2019. Our ESG report will be published soon, and I encourage you to review this slide for some of the highlights.\nTurning to Slide 8. Our second quarter results reflect the strength of our core earnings power, balance sheet and liquidity position. Adjusted to exclude the $225 million pretax gain from the sale of the Collective Investment Trust or CIT business in April. Second quarter revenues have grown $395 million or 20% compared to last year's similar quarter. This translates to a 10% positive operating leverage year-over-year. On the same basis, pre-provision net revenues have increased 35% since last year's second quarter to $1.1 billion. Credit remained stable. Net charge-offs increased in the second quarter, but year-to-date still remain below our historical long-term average. Net income for the quarter was $867 million, up 24% from linked quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share was $5.05 for the second quarter, up 26% sequentially.\nNow let's review our net operating results for the quarter on Slide 9. We M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $879 million, up 23% from linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share common share or $5.12 for the recent quarter compared to $4.09 in this year's first quarter. Tangible book value per share increased 3% to $91.58. On Slide 10, you will see that on a GAAP basis, M&T's second quarter results produced an annualized return on average assets and return on average common equity of 1.7% and 14.27%, respectively. Results for the second quarter of this year included an after-tax $170 million gain on the sale of the CIT business in April.\nExcluding this gain, adjusted GAAP earnings per share was $4.11, and adjusted return on average assets and average common shareholder equity was 1.39% and 11.6%. Next, let's look a little bit deeper into the underlying trends that generated our second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.81 billion in the second quarter, slightly below linked quarter. This decline was driven by higher volumes of noncore funding and unfavorable mix change. caused by disintermediation, partially offset by higher interest rates and one additional day. Net interest margin for the past quarter was 3.91%, down 13 basis points from linked quarter. The primary driver was the decrease due to the margin was partially impacted from the mix change to the higher cost funding, which we estimate reduced the margin by 18 basis points. Higher yields on earning assets net of rates on deposit funding benefited the margin by 4 basis points.\nTurning to Slide 12. Capital levels remained strong with a CET1 ratio to the end of the second quarter at 10.58%. Average earning assets increased $1.9 billion or 1% from the first quarter to the second quarter due largely to the $1.5 billion growth in average loans and $1 billion increase in average investment securities. Turning to Slide 13. We talk about the drivers on the loan growth. The total average loans and leases were $133.5 billion during the second quarter, up $1.5 billion compared to the linked quarter. Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared to the first quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased 5% to $44.5 billion. We continue to see in our dealer and specialty businesses. Plus we are adding new customers as we grow market share in legacy and new markets.\nDuring the second quarter, average commercial real estate loans decreased 1% to $44.9 billion, the decline was driven largely by lower construction loan balances. Average residential real estate loans were $23.8 billion, essentially flat compared to the first quarter of this year. Average consumer loans were down 1% to $20.3 billion, driven by lower activity due to rising interest rates. Turning to Slide 14. Average investment securities increased to $28.6 billion during the second quarter due to the large part to purchases linked at the end of the first quarter. The duration of the investment securities book at the end of June is 3.9 years and the unrealized pretax loss on the available for sale was only $441 million. At the end of June, cash and interest bearing deposits at banks and the investment securities totaled $56.9 billion.\nTurning to Slide 15. Deposit outflows during the second quarter on an average basis accounted to $2.1 billion or 1.3%, in line with industry trends. Consistent with our experience prior to rising rates, the increased competition for deposits and customer behavior is leading to a mix shift with the deposit base to higher cost deposits. Comparing the second to first quarter average demand deposits declined $5.7 billion. Savings and interest-bearing checking deposits decreased $843 million, while time deposits increased $4.4 billion. Decline in average demand deposits resulted predominantly from a $1.1 billion decline in the corporate trust balances due in part to a large to lower capital markets activities.\nThe movement to sweep products as customers seeking higher yields with $1.8 billion on balance sheet and $2.4 billion shifted off-balance sheet sweep accounts during the second quarter. Average time deposit growth was driven by $2.3 billion in broker CDs and $2.1 billion growth consumer time deposits. We remain focused on growing the REIT and retaining deposits. End-of-period deposits grew $3 billion or 1.9% from the end of the first quarter. The growth was largely driven by broker CD balances, which increased $4.1 billion compared to the end of linked quarter. However, since the end of May, our customer base or wholesale deposit balances have stabilized and started to grow with an increase of $523 million, driven largely by growth in commercial and consumer deposits.\nNow let's discuss noninterest income. Please turn to Slide 16. Noninterest income totaled $803 million in the second quarter compared to $587 million linked quarter. As noted earlier, the second quarter included a $225 million gain from the sale of our CIT business. Recall that M&T normally receives an annual distribution from BayView Lending Group during the first quarter of the year. This distribution was $20 million in this year's first quarter. Excluding these 2 items, second quarter noninterest income increased $11 million compared to the first quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $107 million in the recent quarter, up 26% from linked quarter, driven by $18 million in additional servicing revenues, representing the full quarter impact of the bulk of the MSR purchase completed at the end of March.\nService charges on deposits were $119 million or up 5% compared to the first quarter. Trust income of $172 million in the recent quarter declined from $194 million in the first quarter, due largely to the $31 million in lower fee income resulting from the sale of the CIT business partially offset by the impact of the seasonal tax preparation fees. Our revenue from operations adjusting from the gain from the CIT sale and the distribution of BayView Lending Group in this year's first quarter for $137 million, down $2 million sequentially.\nTurning to Slide 17 for expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, or $1.28 billion in the second quarter of this year, down $64 million from the linked quarter. As is typical for M&T's first quarter results, operating expenses in the first quarter included approximately $99 million of seasonally higher compensation costs. Excluding the seasonally higher compensation in the first quarter, operating expenses increased $35 million sequentially. That increase was due to a $31 million in higher compensation and benefit costs, reflecting higher average headcount, the full impact of the annual merit increases and severance costs.\n$20 million and higher other operating expenses related to the bulk of the MSR purchase. These increases were partially offset by lower CIT related expenses, including $22 million of lower sub-adviser expenses and lower advertising and marketing and deposit insurance expenses. Given the prospect of slowing revenue growth, we remain focused on diligently managing expenses. The efficiency ratio which excludes the intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and the security gains and losses from the denominator was 48.9% in the recent quarter compared to 55.5% in 2023's first quarter. Excluding the gain from the sale of the CIT business, the second quarter, the efficiency ratio was 53.4%.\nNext, let's turn to Slide 18 for credit. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $2 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $23 million from the end of linked quarter. In the second quarter, we recorded a $150 million provision in credit losses compared to $120 million in the first quarter. Net charge-offs were $127 million in the second quarter to $70 million in this year's first quarter. The reserve build was largely due to anticipation of declining commercial real estate values and loan growth. At the end of the second quarter, nonaccrual loans were $2.4 million. A decrease of $122 million compared to the prior quarter and represent a 1.83% of loans, down 9 basis points sequentially. As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $127 million. The increase in net charge-offs was driven by 4 large credits, 3 office buildings, New York City and Washington, D.C. and 1 large health care company operating in New York State.\nAnnualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 38 basis points for the second quarter compared to 22 basis points in the first quarter. This brings our year-to-date net charge-offs to 30 basis points, which is below our long-term average of 33 basis points. As we have noted previously, we expect net charge-offs to be lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis. This is the result of unique nature of each property and borrower. In order to identify emerging issues that could lead to loan grade adjustments, we continue to perform ongoing rate risk, resizing risk, tenant sensitivities and commercial real estate portfolios on a quarterly basis. This work is reflected in our criticized loan portfolio. Loan's 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest for $380 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $407 million sequentially and totaled 43% of these loans 90 days past due loans were guaranteed by the government or government-related entities.\nTurning to Slide 19 for capital. M&T's CET1 ratio at the end of June was an estimated 10.58% and compared to 10.16% at the end of the first quarter. The increase was due in part to higher net income and repurchasing shares in the second quarter. In June, tangible common shareholder equity totaled $15.2 billion, up 3% from the end of the prior quarter. Tangible book value per share accounted at $91.58, up 3% from the end of the first quarter. In late June, the Federal Reserve released results from the Annual Bank stress tests. While this was an off year for Category 4 banks, given the timing of the Peoples United acquisition, M&T participated in the stress test this year. Our preliminary stress test capital buffer, or SCB, is estimated to be 4%, and giving the SCB, which is in effect from October 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024, where we'll be subject to 8.5% CET1 ratio.\nNow turning to Slide 20 for the outlook. As we look forward to the second quarter of this year, we believe we are well positioned to navigate through a challenging economic conditions. However, the rapidly changing interest rate expectations, combined with continued pressure on funding affect our outlook for the full year 2023. The 2023 outlook reflects the impact of the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency that closed in October of last year and the sale of the CIT business that closed in April of this year. First, let's talk about net interest income outlook. We expect taxable equivalent net interest income to trend towards the lower end of the $7 billion to $7.2 billion range, which reflects a flat to modestly higher loan and deposit growth and incorporates 125 basis point hike in August of this year.\nWe noted on the first quarter call, a key driver of net interest income in 2023 will be the ability to efficiently fund earning assets. We expect continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows. Full year average deposit balances are expected to be up low single digits compared to 2022. We continue to expect the deposit mix, the shift towards higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time deposits and on balance sheet sweeps. This is expected to translate to through-the-cycle interest-bearing deposit beta through the fourth quarter of this year to the low to mid-40% range. This deposit beta excludes broker deposits.\nNext, let's discuss the outlook for average loan growth, which should be the main driver of earning asset growth. We expect the full year average loans and lease balances during 2023 to be relatively stable. The mix of C&I, CRE and consumer loans, inclusive of consumer real estate loans is almost 1/3 each as of the end of June. We expect this trend to shift slightly to C&I growth outpacing CRE. As we have seen over the past 4 quarters, higher levels of interest rates are expected to slow down the growth of our consumer loan book over the remainder of 2023. Turning to fees. We expect noninterest income to be in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.3 billion range. This outlook for noninterest-bearing reflects lower trust revenues resulting from the sale of the CIT business in April as well as the incremental income from the bulk purchase of residential mortgage servicing rights at the end of this year's first quarter.\nRemember, the outlook does not include the $225 million gain from the sale of the CIT business. Turning to expenses. We anticipate expenses excluding intangible amortization to trend near the higher end of $5 billion to $5.1 billion. In addition, this outlook for net operating expenses includes the impact of the previously mentioned sale of the CIT business and the bulk mortgage servicing purchase. Intangible amortization is expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range. Turning to credit. We expect loan losses to be near M&T's long-term average of 33 basis points. Although the quarterly cadence could be lumpy, provision expense over the year will follow the CECL methodology and be affected by changes in the macro outlook and loan balances.\nFor 2023, we expect taxable equivalent rate to be in the 25% range. Finally, as it relates to capital, this is a very clear differentiator for M&T. Our capital, coupled with our limited investment security market has been a clear strength during these turbulent times. M&T has proven to be a safe haven for our clients and communities. The strength of our balance sheet is extraordinary. We take our responsibilities to manage our shareholders' capital very seriously and will return more when it's appropriate to do that. Our businesses are performing very well, and we are growing new relationships each and every day. Given the uncertainties related to the new capital rules that are coming out, we believe now is not the time to be repurchasing shares. That said, we are best positioned to use our capital for both organic and inorganic growth along with buybacks in the future, which will always be part of our core capital distribution strategy.\nIn the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients, communities, regulators, investors and rating agencies. To conclude on Slide 21. Our results underscore and optimistic investment thesis. Our economic uncertainty remains high, and that is when M&T has historically outperformed its peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders. We have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles with more than 2x growth relative to peers. Our strong shareholder returns include 15% to 20% return on average tangible common equity and robust dividend growth. Finally, we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital.\nOur integration of People's United is complete, and we are confident in our ability to realize our potential post merger. Now let's open up the call to questions before which Todd will briefly review the instructions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nMD, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division\n\nThank you, Shelby, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules by going to our website, www.mtb.com. Once there, you can click on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.\nAlso, before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are available on our Investor Relations web page, and we encourage participants to refer to them for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements and risk factors. These statements speak only as of the date made, and M&T undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.\n\nDarren J. King\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity position as well as the impact of our merger with People's United Bank. Compared to last year's first quarter, revenues have grown over $970 million or 67%, translating into 24% positive operating leverage year-over-year. Pre-provision net revenues have more than doubled since last year to $1.1 billion. Credit remained solid with net charge-offs still below our long-term average. Capital levels remained strong with the CET1 ratio estimated to end the first quarter at 10.15%.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $600 million in common shares which represented 2% of our outstanding common stock, and the Board approved an 8% or $0.10 per share increase in the quarterly common dividend to $1.30 per share. Tangible common equity per share increased 3% to $88.81 per share.\nIn addition, April 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of the closing of the People's United acquisition. We're pleased with the results of the largest acquisition in our company's history. The tangible book value dilution was only 4% and has been earned back already. Merger costs were less than anticipated at the time of announcement. Targeted expense synergies have largely been realized and are now in the run rate. As a result of these -- the above, the return on investment and EPS accretion have exceeded those expected at the time the deal was announced.\nLet's take a look at the first quarter results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $4.01 for the first quarter of 2023, down 7% compared with $4.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income for the quarter was $702 million, 8% lower than the $765 million in the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.4% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 11.74%. This compares with rates of 1.53% and 12.59%, respectively, in the previous quarter.\nIncluded in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $13 million in the first quarter and $14 million in the sequential quarter, representing $0.08 per common share in both quarters. Pretax merger-related expenses of $45 million related to the People's United acquisition were included in the fourth quarter's GAAP results. These merger-related charges translate to $33 million after tax or $0.20 per common share. There were no merger-related expenses in this year's first quarter.\nIn accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets in equity. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. We believe this information provides investors with a better picture of the long-term earnings power of the institution.\nM&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $715 million, down 12% from the $812 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $4.09 for the recent quarter compared with $4.57 in 2022's fourth quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.49% and 19% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.7% and 21.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs a reminder, GAAP and net operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 were impacted by certain noteworthy events. This included a $136 million gain related to the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency as well as a $135 million contribution to M&T's Charitable Foundation. These items collectively netted and did not materially impact net income.\nNext, we'll take a deeper dive into the underlying trends that generated our first quarter results. Taxable net interest income was $1.83 billion for the first quarter of 2023, slightly below the linked quarter. The $9 million decrease was driven largely by a $30 million in lower net interest income, reflecting the 2-day shorter calendar quarter, partially offset by a $13 million positive impact from our hedging program and $8 million from higher average earning asset volumes net of higher average interest-bearing liability volumes. The net interest margin for the past quarter was 4.04%, down 2 basis points from the 4.06% in the linked quarter. The primary driver of the decrease to the margin was the impact from a higher level of borrowing, which we estimate reduced the margin by 19 basis points. This was partially offset by the impact from higher rates on earning assets, net of deposit funding, which we estimate added 18 basis points. All other factors had a negligible impact on the margin.\nTotal average loans and leases were $132 billion during the quarter, up $2.6 billion or 2% compared to the linked quarter. Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared to the fourth quarter, commercial and industrial loans and leases increased $2.4 billion or 6% to $42.4 billion with $1.9 billion being broadly based and $453 million of growth in average dealer Floor Plan balances.\nDuring the first quarter, average commercial real estate loans decreased by $363 million or 1% to $45.3 billion. The decline was driven largely by lower permanent mortgages as average construction loan balances were essentially flat.\nResidential real estate loans increased by $435 million or about 2% to $23.8 billion due largely to the timing of the retention of originations throughout the prior quarter. End-of-period balances were essentially flat sequentially. Average consumer loans were up $144 million or about 1% to $20.5 billion. Recreational finance loan growth continues to be the main driver of increased balances and these average loans grew $178 million or 2%. Average earning assets, excluding interest-bearing cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve increased $4.9 billion or 3% and due to the $2.6 billion growth in average loans and $2.3 billion increase in average investment securities.\nAlthough average interest-bearing cash balances have decreased $777 million to $24.3 billion during the first quarter of this year, they came in higher than our initial projections. The sequential quarterly decline in cash reflects loan growth and the drop in deposit balances, partially offset by the proceeds from long-term borrowings issued during the quarter. Consistent with our expectations and normal seasonal outflows, deposits declined sequentially. However, the $1.9 billion or 1% sequential average decline was slightly better than our expectations at the January earnings call. We remain focused on growing and retaining deposits. Our experience in prior rising rate environments reminds us to expect increased competition for deposits and changing customer behavior, leading to a mix shift within the deposit base.\nDuring the first quarter, average demand deposits declined $8.4 billion. Savings and interest-bearing checking deposits increased $1 billion and time deposits increased $5.4 billion. Average commercial deposits declined a net $2.4 billion as business owners shifted $6.3 billion out of operating demand deposit accounts and into both on and off balance sheet sweep accounts to earn a higher return on their excess balances as well as to make distributions. Almost 2/3 of the decline in noninterest-bearing deposits was offset by movement into on-balance sheet sweep accounts where those average balances increased $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023.\nTurning to consumer deposits. They declined a net $758 million in the first quarter as $2.5 billion in outflows were partially offset by a $1.7 billion increase in average time deposits. Lower levels of activity in the capital markets and seasonal factors also impacted average balances for the following lines of business. Trust fund demand balances declined $1.2 billion. Municipal deposits declined $789 million and escrow deposits declined $684 million. Average brokered CDs increased $3.8 billion sequentially due almost entirely from growth during the previous quarter.\nTurning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $587 million in the first quarter compared with $682 million in the linked quarter. M&T normally receives an annual distribution from the Bayview Lending Group during the first quarter of the year. This distribution was $20 million in 2023 and $30 million in last year's first quarter. As noted earlier, the fourth quarter of last year included a $136 million gain from the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency. Excluding these 2 items, noninterest income was up $21 million or 4% sequentially. Trust income of $194 million in the recent quarter was flat sequentially. Service charges on deposit accounts were $114 million compared with $106 million in the fourth quarter. The increase primarily reflects a full quarter of service charges on acquired customer deposit accounts after these fees were waived in October and November of last year.\nMortgage banking revenues were $85 million in the recent quarter, up 4% from the linked quarter. Revenues from our residential mortgage business were $55 million in the first quarter compared with $54 million in the prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $30 million in the first quarter compared to $28 million in the final quarter of 2022. Other revenue from operations excluding the distribution from Bayview Lending Group in this year's first quarter and the gain from the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency in the sequential quarter were $140 million, up $9 million sequentially.\nTurning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $134 billion in the first quarter of this year, little changed from the fourth quarter of last year. As is typical for M&T's first quarter results, operating expenses for the recent quarter included approximately [indiscernible] of seasonally higher compensation costs relating to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees. The HSA contribution, the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401(k) match and FICA payments as well as the annual reset in FICA payments and unemployment insurance. Those same items amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately $74 million in last year's first quarter.\nAs usual, we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter. Excluding the charitable donation in the fourth quarter of last year and the seasonally higher compensation in the first quarter, operating expenses increased $32 million sequentially. The increase was due largely to $15 million in higher compensation and benefits costs, largely related to higher headcount in the first quarter, $6 million in higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting a higher assessment rate for the industry, $4 million in higher advertising and marketing expenses and $5 million in professional services expenses directly attributable to the pending sale of M&T's collective investment trust business.\nGiven the prospect for slowing revenue growth, we remain focused on diligently managing expenses and continuing to generate positive operating leverage. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was 55.5% in the recent quarter, compared with 53.3% in 2022's fourth quarter and 64.9% in the first quarter of last year.\nNext, let's turn to credit. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $1.98 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $50 million from the end of the linked quarter. In the first quarter, we recorded a $120 million provision for credit losses compared to $90 million in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs were $70 million in the first quarter compared to $40 million in last year's fourth quarter. The reserve build was largely due to a combination of loan growth and the anticipation of declining values for office and health care properties partially offset by improved expectations for hotel, retail and multifamily property prices.\nAt the end of the first quarter, nonaccrual loans were $2.6 billion, an increase of $118 million compared to the prior quarter and that represented 1.92% of loans, up 7 basis points sequentially.\nAs noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $70 million including amounts that reflect updated appraisals of nonaccrual office loans. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 22 basis points for the first quarter compared to 12 basis points in the fourth quarter. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, were $407 million at the end of the recent quarter compared to $491 million sequentially. In total, 75% of these 90-day past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities.\nTurning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.15% compared with 10.4% at the end of the fourth quarter. The decrease was due in part to growth in risk-weighted assets and the impact of the repurchase of $600 million in common shares, which represented 2% of our outstanding common stock. Tangible common equity totaled $14.7 billion, up slightly from the end of the prior quarter. Tangible common equity per share amounted to $88.81 per share, up 3% from the end of the year.\nTurning to the outlook. As we look forward to the rest of this year, we believe we are well positioned to navigate through the challenging economic conditions. However, the rapidly changing interest rate expectations combined with continued pressure on funding affect our outlook for the full year of 2023.\nAs a reminder, the acquisition of People's United closed on April 1, 2022, and thus the outlook for 2023 includes 4 quarters of operations and balances from the acquired company compared to only 3 quarters during 2022. Our 2023 outlook also reflects the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency that closed in October of last year. And even though the sale of the Collective Investment Trust business is expected to close in the first half of this year, our outlook includes the full year of operations from this business.\nFirst, let's talk about net interest income outlook. The outlook for interest rates in the economy continues to change frequently. Since March 8, the 10-year U.S. government bond yield has dropped 46 basis points and the forward curve has changed meaningfully as well. We expect taxable net interest income to grow in the 20% to 23% range when compared to the $5.86 billion during 2022. This range reflects different rates of deposit balance growth, deposit pricing and loan growth. Consistent with the current forward curve, our forecast incorporates [ 2 25 ] basis point cuts in the final quarter of this year.\nAs we noted on the first quarter call, a key driver of net interest income in 2023 will be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth. We expect continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows. Full year average total deposit balances are expected to be down low single digits compared to the $158.5 billion average during 2022.\nDuring the first quarter, we issued $3.5 billion in senior debt and we'll utilize the combination of FHLB funding and senior debt over the course of this year as needed to ensure that we can continue to meet the loan demands of our customers. We continue to expect the deposit mix to shift toward higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time and on balance sheet suite. This is expected to translate to a through-the-cycle interest-bearing deposit beta in the high 30% to low 40% range. Taking all of these factors into account, we anticipate the net interest margin to be slightly below 4% for the full year of 2023 and to continue to migrate towards the long-term range we have been discussing for the past couple of quarters. Next, let's discuss the drivers of earning asset growth. We currently plan to grow the securities portfolio by $2 billion compared to the $28 billion balance at the end of March of this year with the addition of longer duration mortgage-backed securities throughout the year.\nLooking at average loans, we expect average loan and lease balances during 2023 to grow in the 10% to 12% range when compared to the 2022 full year average of $119.3 billion. We anticipate growth to continue in the second quarter and then for average balances to be flat to slightly down over the second half of the year. This implies total average loan and lease balances in the fourth quarter of 2023 to be up 1% to 3% from the $129.4 billion average during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThe mix of C&I, CRE and consumer loans, inclusive of consumer real estate, is almost 1/3 each as of the end of March. We expect this trend to shift slightly as C&I growth outpaces CRE. As we have seen over the past 3 quarters, higher levels of interest rates are expected to slow down the growth in our consumer loan book in 2023. After these average loans grew 2% in the first quarter, we expect the indirect portfolio to be relatively flat over the remainder of the year.\nTurning to fees. Excluding the $136 million gain on the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as securities losses, net interest income -- sorry, noninterest income was $2.23 billion in 2022. We expect 2023 noninterest income growth to be in the 7% to 9% range compared to the $2.23 billion in 2022. This outlook for noninterest income includes the impact of a bulk purchase of residential mortgage servicing rights that we completed at the end of this year's first quarter.\nTurning to expenses. We anticipate expenses, excluding merger-related costs, the charitable contribution and intangible amortization to be up 11% to 13% when compared to the $4.52 billion during 2022. Recall that approximately half of this increase reflects an extra quarter of People's United expenses. In addition, this outlook for net operating expenses includes the impact of the previously noted mortgage servicing rights purchase. We do not anticipate incurring any material merger-related costs in 2023 and intangible amortization is expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range during 2023.\nTurning to credit. We expect credit losses to migrate towards M&T's long-term average of 33 basis points, although the quarterly cadence could be lumpy. Provision expense over the year will follow the CECL methodology and will be affected by changes in the macroeconomic outlook as well as loan balances.\nFor 2023, we expect the taxable equivalent tax rate to be in the 25% range. Finally, turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.15% at March 31, 2023, comfortably exceeds the required regulatory minimum threshold, which takes into account our stress capital buffer or SCB. We believe the current level of core capital exceeds that needed to safely run the company and to support lending in our communities. We plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace over the long term. However, in the near term, we plan to maintain a CET1 ratio slightly above the current level until the current economic uncertainty abates.\nWith that, let's open up the call to questions before which Shelby will briefly review the instructions."

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Market and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nSenior VP and Head of Markets & IR, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Gretchen, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules by going to our website www.mtb.com. Once there, you can click on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.\nAlso before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are also available on our Investor Relations web page and we encourage participants to refer to them for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements and risk factors. These statements speak only as of the date made, and M&T undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King?\n\nDarren J. King\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As we reflect on 2022, we want to start by taking a moment to recognize the hard work and dedication of our more than 22,000 colleagues, your tireless efforts to support our customers and communities during challenging times are the heartbeat of M&T. We also give a shout out to #3 and the early responders who saved his life. You remind us all about the bigger game of life. A year ago, we outlined 3 key objectives for 2022.\nWe complete our long-awaited merger with People's United; deploy excess liquidity to reduce asset sensitivity while protecting shareholder value, and to distribute capital that isn't required to support lending in our communities. Achieving those objectives, we believe, aligns with our goal to build a customer-focused bank and resultant balance sheet that produces consistent, predictable earnings over long periods of time.\nAgainst those objectives, here are a few key highlights of the work done in 2022. We closed the acquisition of People's United, the largest in our history. We also completed the systems conversion and continue the process of integrating this valuable franchise. The financial benefits of this combination are consistent to slightly better than our expectations at announcement. We repositioned the balance sheet to deploy excess liquidity, reducing our interest-bearing deposits held at banks from $41.9 billion at the end of 2021 to under $25 billion at the end of 2022.\nIn deploying that excess liquidity, we reduced costly wholesale funding. We organically, that is, excluding the impact of People's, grew loans by $4.1 billion and added $7 billion in net investment securities growth. These efforts, which also included the retention of most of the residential mortgage production as well as the acquired People's United $12 billion longer-duration securities portfolio have led to a reduction in asset sensitivity, helping to protect our net interest margin from future rate shocks. In terms of capital, we resumed common share repurchases in last year's second quarter. Now having repurchased $1.8 billion in common stock, representing 6% of outstanding shares, and our common dividend grew by 7% in 2022 and representing the sixth year of consecutive increases. And despite the impact from the acquisition and the rapid rise in long bond yields, our CET1 ratio remained strong at 10.4% which continues to exceed our median peer bank. Our hard work translated into strong full year financial results. GAAP-based diluted earnings per common share, which include merger-related charges, were $11.53 compared to $13.80 in 2021, down 16%.\nNet income was $1.99 billion compared with $1.86 billion in the prior year, improved by 7%. These results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.05% and 8.67% compared to 1.22% and 11.4%, respectively, in 2021.\nWe note that these results were impacted by merger-related expenses associated with the People's United transaction. Such expenses amounted to $580 million in 2022 or $2.63 per share. Those same expense were $44 million or $0.25 per share in 2021. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.\nWe believe this information provides investors with a better picture of the long-term earnings power of the combined institution. Net operating income which excludes the after-tax impact from the amortization of intangible assets as well as merger-related expenses, was $2.47 billion during 2022, up 30% compared to -- with $1.9 billion in the prior year.\nNet operating income per diluted common share was $14.42 compared with $14.11 in 2021, up 2%. Net operating income for 2022 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.35% and 16.7%. This compares with 1.28% and 16.8%, respectively, in the prior year. On a net operating basis, we generated 4% positive operating leverage and 43% growth in pretax pre-provision net revenue. This was due in large part to the $2 billion or 53% increase in taxable equivalent net interest income as the net interest margin increased some 63 basis points year-over-year.\nWe are pleased with the results we achieved in 2022 in the face of many challenges, not the least of which was a rapid shift in monetary policy. But our work is not done. We will continue to recognize the value created by our merger while building a more capital-efficient, less asset-sensitive balance sheet that will produce stable and predictable revenue and earnings over the long term.\nLet's take a look at the results for the fourth quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $4.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 22% compared to $3.53 in the third quarter of 2022. Net income for the quarter was $765 million, 18% higher than the $647 million in the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.53% and an annualized return on average common equity of 12.59%. This compares with rates of 1.28% and 10.43%, respectively, in the previous quarter. Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $14 million in each of the 2 most recent quarters, representing $0.08 per common share in both quarters.\nPretax merger-related expenses of $45 million related to the People's United acquisition, were included in the fourth quarter's GAAP results. These merger charges translate to $33 million after-tax or $0.20 per common share. M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $812 million, up 16% from the $700 million in the linked quarter.\nDiluted net operating earnings per common share were $4.57 for the recent quarter compared to $3.83 in 2022's third quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.7% and 21.3% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.44% and 17.89% in the third quarter of 2022. Both GAAP and net operating earnings for the fourth quarter of '22 were impacted by certain noteworthy items.\nFourth quarter results included a $136 million gain related to the sale of M&T Insurance Agency reported in other revenue from operations as well as a $135 million contribution to M&T Charitable Foundation reported in other costs of operations. These items collectively net and did not materially impact net income. Let's take a deeper dive into the balance sheet and the net interest margin. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1.84 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $150 million or 9% from the linked quarter.\nThe increase was driven largely by the $143 million impact from higher rates on interest-earning assets, inclusive of the effect from interest rate hedges. Incremental $19 million from volume and mix of earning assets, partially offset by a $12 million reduction in interest received on nonaccrual loans. Net interest margin for the past quarter was 4.06%, up 38 basis points from the 3.68% in the linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase to the margin was higher interest rates, which we estimate boosted the margin by 32 basis points.\nIn addition, the margin benefited from a reduced level of cash held on deposit at the Federal Reserve, which we estimate added 6 basis points. Total average loans and leases were $129.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2022, up 1.5% compared to the linked quarter. Looking at the loans by category.\nOn an average basis compared with the third quarter, commercial and industrial loans and leases increased by $1.7 billion or 4.5% to $40 billion, with $1.2 billion or 4% growth being broad-based across our core commercial banking clients and $542 million or 22% growth in average dealer Floor Plan balances. During the fourth quarter, average commercial real estate loans decreased by $592 million or 1% to $45.7 billion, driven largely by declines in average construction loans. On an end-of-period basis, construction balances increased slightly from the linked quarter. Permanent average commercial mortgage balances were nearly flat quarter-over-quarter. Residential real estate loans increased $372 million or about 2% to $23.3 billion due to the continued retention of new mortgage originations retained for investments partially offset by normal amortization. Average consumer loans were up $384 million or about 2% to $20.3 billion. Recreational finance loan growth continues to be the main driver.\nThese average loans grew $325 million or 4%. Average earning assets, excluding interest-bearing cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve increased by $3.2 billion or 2% due to the $1.9 billion growth in average loans and a $1.4 billion increase in average investment securities. Average interest-bearing cash balances decreased by $5.7 billion to $25.1 billion during the fourth quarter of this year, essentially in line with our projections. The sequential quarter decline was due to the drop in deposit balances and the cash deployed to fund loan growth and to purchase investment securities.\nAverage deposits decreased $3.8 billion or 2% compared with the third quarter. Our efforts to grow and retain deposits has helped reduce the rate of decline compared to recent quarters. However, due to the rapidly rising rate environment and increased competition for deposits, there has been a mix shift within the deposit base to higher cost deposits. Average demand deposits declined $2.6 billion. Savings and interest-bearing checking deposits declined by $2.3 billion, partially offset by a $1.1 billion increase in time deposits.\nAverage commercial deposits declined $4.8 billion as business owners shifted money into both off and on balance sheet sweep accounts paid down debt and main distributions. On balance sheet sweep, average balances increased $2.5 billion during the fourth quarter of 2022. Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income, excluding the $136 million gain from the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency, totaled $546 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $563 million in the linked quarter. Trust income was $195 million in the recent quarter, up 4% from the $187 million in the third quarter.\nThe increase was due largely to the impact of better market valuations and on assets under management and administration. Service charges on deposit accounts were $106 million compared with $115 million in the third quarter. The decline primarily reflects the waiver of service charges in October and November un-acquired customer deposit accounts. These service charges were also waived in September. Mortgage banking revenues were $82 million in the recent quarter, down 2% from the linked quarter. Revenues from our residential mortgage business were $54 million in the fourth quarter compared with $55 million in the prior quarter. Both figures reflect our decision to retain the substantial majority of the mortgage originations for investment on our balance sheet. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $28 million in both the third and fourth quarters.\nThat figure was $49 million in the year ago quarter. Other revenue from operations, excluding the gain from the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency were $131 million, down $22 million sequentially. The decrease was due to the impact of 2 fewer months of revenues related to the M&T Insurance Agency, which was sold in October. Lower commercial loan fees, reflecting lower capital markets activities and a write-down on the underlying assets in certain bank-owned life insurance contracts. Turning to expenses.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $1.35 billion or $138 million higher than the linked quarter. This increase was largely due to the $135 million charitable donation in the fourth quarter. Excluding merger-related expenses, salary and benefits expense decreased by $30 million due to 1 less business day, the realization of acquisition synergies and the impact of the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency. The quarter included $21 million in higher sequential advertising and outside data processing and software expenses. Both of these categories tend to show some degree of seasonality. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was 53.3% in the recent quarter compared with 53.6% in 2022's third quarter and 59.7% in the fourth quarter of last year.\nNext, let's turn to credit. Despite the challenges of labor shortages and persistent inflation, credit remained stable. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $1.93 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up $50 million from the end of the linked quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a $90 million provision for credit losses compared to the $115 million provision in the third quarter. Net charge-offs were $40 million in the fourth quarter compared to $63 million in last year's third quarter. The reserve build was largely due to growth in our C&I and consumer portfolios. The baseline macroeconomic forecast experienced nominal deterioration during the fourth quarter for those indicators that our reserve methodology is most sensitive to, including the unemployment rate, GDP growth and residential and commercial real estate values. At the end of the fourth quarter, nonaccrual loans were $2.4 billion and represented 1.9% of loans, essentially unchanged from the end of the linked quarter. As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $40 million. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 12 basis points for the fourth quarter compared to 20 basis points in the third quarter. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, were $491 million at the end of the recent quarter compared to $477 million sequentially.\nIn total, 74% of these 90 days past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities.\nTurning to capital. M&T Common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.4% compared with 10.7% at the end of the third quarter. The decrease was due in part to the impact of the repurchase of $600 million in common shares which represented 2% of our outstanding common stock as well as growth in risk-weighted assets. Tangible common equity totaled $14.7 billion, up slightly from the end of the period of the prior quarter. Tangible common equity per share amounted to $86.59, up 3% from the end of the third quarter.\nNow turning to the outlook. As we look forward into 2023, we expect that inflation and higher interest rates will continue to impact the bank and our customers. We believe we are well positioned to sustain a strong net interest margin and pretax pre-provision net revenue to risk-weighted assets with our goal to generate top quartile return on average tangible common equity. As a reminder, the acquisition of People's United closed on April 1, 2022. Thus, the outlook for 2023 includes 4 quarters of operations and balances from the acquired company compared to only 3 quarters during 2022.\nThis 2023 outlook also reflects the sale of M&T Insurance Agency that closed in October of 2022. During the first 9 months in 2022, this business recorded revenues of $31 million and the results of its operations were not material to M&T's net income. Additionally, in December, our subsidiary, Wilmington Trust, N.A. announced the sale of its Collective Investment Trust business. Trust income associated with this business totaled $165 million in 2022. And after considering expenses, the results of operations from this business were not material to M&T's net income.\nSale of this business is expected to close in the first half of 2023. Since the timing of the closing is uncertain, this outlook includes the full year of the Collective Investment Trust business. First, let's talk about our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable equivalent net interest income to grow in the 23% to 26% range. when compared to the $5.86 billion during 2022. This range reflects different rates of deposit balance growth, deposit pricing and loan growth. Consistent with the current forward curve, our forecast incorporates (inaudible) basis point federal -- fed funds hikes in the first quarter of 2023 and (inaudible) basis point cut in the fourth quarter. Key driver of net interest income in 2023 will be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth.\nWe expect continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows. Full year average total deposit balances are expected to be down low single digits compared to the [$158.5 billion] during 2022. In order to offset the positive declines and to ensure a stable liquidity profile, we plan to issue senior debt during 2023. We continue to expect deposit mix to shift toward higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time deposits as well as on balance sheet sweeps. This is expected to translate into a through-the-cycle deposit beta in the high 30% to low 40% range.\nNext, let's discuss the drivers of earning asset growth. We currently plan to grow the securities portfolio by $4 billion compared to the $25 billion balance at the end of 2022 with the addition of longer duration mortgage-backed securities throughout the year. Next, turning to the outlook for average loans. We expect average loan and lease balances during 2023 to grow in the 8% to 9% range when compared to the 2022 full year average of $119.3 billion. This implies total average loan and lease balances in the fourth quarter of 2023 to be flat to slightly up from the $129.4 billion average during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMix of C&I, CRE and consumer loans, inclusive of consumer real estate loans is almost 1/3 each at the end of 2022. We expect this trend to shift slightly as C&I growth outpaces CRE. As we've seen during the second half of 2022, higher levels of interest rates are expected to slow down the growth in our consumer loan book in 2023. Turning to fees. Excluding the $136 million gain on the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as securities losses, noninterest income was $2.23 billion in 2022. We expect 2023 noninterest income growth to be in the 5% to 7% range compared to 2022. The outlook for 2023 reflects approximately 10 months of foregone income from M&T Insurance Agency as a result of the sale. Overall, mortgage banking revenues are expected to be up 5% to 7% compared to 2022. Commercial mortgage banking revenues are expected to rebound in 2023, and we will return to a gain on sale residential mortgage banking model in 2023.\nHowever, with the high level of interest rates, we expect muted origination volumes and thus, anticipate total residential mortgage banking revenues to be relatively stable compared to 2022. We expect service charges on deposit accounts to be 3% to 6% higher than 2022 and anticipate trust income to be 8% to 10% higher in 2023. Turning to expenses. We anticipate expenses, excluding merger-related costs, the charitable contribution and intangible amortization to be up 10% to 12% when compared to the $4.52 billion we experienced during 2022. Approximately half of this increase reflects an extra quarter of People's United expenses. This outlook also incorporates the impact from the sale of the M&T Insurance Agency. We do not anticipate incurring any material merger-related costs in 2023 and intangible amortization is expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range during 2023.\nAs a reminder, first quarter expenses will be elevated as a result of our typical seasonal increase in compensation expense. For the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate an uptick in the range of $90 million to $95 million. That amount last year was approximately $74 million.\nTurning to credit. We expect credit losses to be higher and the strong results in 2022, but to remain below M&T's legacy long-term average of 33 basis points. Provision expense over the year will follow the CECL methodology and will be affected by changes in the macroeconomic outlook as well as changes in loan balances. For 2023, we expect taxable equivalent tax rate to be in the 25% range.\nFinally, turning to capital. We believe the current level of core capital exceeds that needed to safely run the company and to support lending in our communities. We plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.4% at December 31, 2022, comfortably exceeds the required regulatory minimum threshold which takes into account our stress capital buffer, or SCB, with a solid starting CET1 ratio and the potential to generate additional amounts of capital over the next few years, we don't expect to change our capital distribution plans. We anticipate continuing to repurchase common shares at a pace of $600 million per quarter under our current capital plan.\nBefore we go to Q&A, I wanted to take them on and reflect back on some comments made at the beginning of the call, where we reference number 3 and how he is winning the game of life. Sometimes numbers can be symbols with deeper meaning than what meets the eye like the divine proportion. I'd like to take a moment and share what I see with some of these numbers. The first game after #3 went to the hospital. Our team returned a kickoff, the first time it has done so in 3 years and 3 months. First playoff game was won by 3 points. Number 14 and 17 are key leaders on our team. The difference between 14 and 17 is 3. That number seems to come up quite often.\nIf you look at those key leaders and you drop the 1 in front of 14 and the 1 in front of 7, you're left with 47, 47 is an interesting number. I know you're all thinking about the periodic table of elements. 47 is the atomic number of silver. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is made out of silver. That interesting, but it gets even weirder. The symbol for silver is Ag. If you reverse those letters, you get GA which is the abbreviation for Georgia, the potential site of the AFC Championship and all of this is happening in 2023. There's that number again. Probably just a set of random coincidences or is it?\nWith that, let's open it up to questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nSenior VP and Head of Markets & IR, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Gretchen, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and to the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.\nAlso, before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our Investor Relations web page, and we encourage participants to refer to them for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements and risk factors. These statements speak only as of the date made, and M&T undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.\n\nDarren J. King\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As we reflect on the past quarter and the first half of the year, we're very pleased with our progress. The second quarter results include the impact of the People's United Financial acquisition, which closed on April 1. We're excited about the momentum we have as a combined organization especially the progress both franchises are making in preparation for the planned systems conversion later this quarter.\nWith strong NII growth and effective expense management, M&T generated positive operating leverage, as pretax pre-provision net revenue increased by more than $300 million versus last quarter. We repurchased $600 million of our common stock in the second quarter. And yesterday, the Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to $3 billion in M&T common stock.\nOur balance sheet management enabled us to benefit from the changing interest rate environment, boosting the net interest margin and allowing us to deploy excess cash into investment securities with higher yields. With more Fed hikes projected this year, we continue to add more fixed rate assets to our balance sheet and to continue expanding our interest rate hedging program.\nWhile we're just beginning to see the positive net interest income benefit from rising rates, those same higher rates have prompted headwinds in our mortgage banking business, both for origination volumes and for gain on sale margins. We expect these headwinds to persist. Despite the macro challenges, the unemployment rate remains low and credit quality remains strong. We're well positioned for the future and excited to continue the integration of the People's United franchise and to deploying our excess cash and excess capital.\nNow let's review the results for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.08 for the second quarter of 2022, compared with $2.62 in the first quarter of 2022. Net income for the quarter was $218 million compared with $362 million in the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's second quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 0.42% and an annualized return on average common equity of 3.21%, this compares with rates of 0.97% and 8.55%, respectively, in the previous quarter.\nIncluded in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $14 million or $0.08 per common share. That compares to $1 million or $0.01 per common share in the prior quarter. Pretax merger-related expenses of $465 million related to the People's United acquisition were also included in these GAAP results. These merger-related expenses are comprised of the so-called CECL day 2 double-count of $242 million, plus additional pretax merger-related expenses of $223 million.\nThe total merger-related charges translate to $346 million after tax or $1.94 per common share. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we only ever exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $578 million compared with $376 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.10 for the recent quarter compared with $2.73 in 2022's first quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.16% and 14.41% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.04% and 12.44% in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. As a reminder, included in the first quarter's GAAP and net operating results, with a $30 million distribution from our investment in Bayview Lending Group. This amounted to $23 million after-tax effect and $0.17 per common share. We did not receive any distributions in this year's second quarter.\nNext, let's take a little deeper dive into the underlying trends that generated these results. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.42 billion in the second quarter of 2022 an increase of $515 million or 57% from the linked quarter. The linked quarter increase was due largely to the $420 million net interest income contribution from People's United. This amount included $35 million for purchase accounting accretion.\nThe legacy M&T Bank net interest income increased $95 million sequentially, inclusive of the $138 million impact from higher rates on interest-earning assets, an $8 million increase from 1 additional day in the quarter, partially offset by a $22 million decline and the benefit from cash flow swaps and a $16 million decrease in interest received on nonaccrual loans and a $9 million decline in interest income and fees related to PPP loans.\nNet interest margin for the past quarter was 3.01%, up 36 basis points from 2.65% in the linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase to the margin was from higher interest rates, which we estimate boosted the margin by 26 basis points. The People's United Earning asset yields added 8 basis points to the net interest margin. And in addition, margin benefited from a reduced level of cash held on deposit with the Federal Reserve, which we estimate added 7 basis points. These items were partially offset by a 6 basis point decline resulting from the lower interest income recovered on nonaccrual loans.\nAll other factors, including the day count, had a negligible impact on the margin. Before we discuss the average loan balance trends for the quarter, we note there were reclassifications within the People's United Commercial loan portfolios. In order to be more consistent with M&T's reporting methodology, just over $2 billion in loans that People's United had classified as C&I were reclassified into CRE loans. Compared with the first quarter of 2022, average loans outstanding increased by $35.4 billion or 38% due primarily to the $35.5 billion average impact of the People's United loans.\nLooking at loans by category. On an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased by $14.5 billion or about 62%. The average impact from the acquired People's United loans was $13.8 billion. Legacy M&T C&I average loans increased by about $1.2 billion, with strong growth in middle market C&I loans and average dealer floor plan balance growth of $209 million. This growth was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $466 million in PPP loans.\nOn an end-of-period basis, for the combined bank, PPP loans amounted to $351 million. Average commercial real estate loans increased by $12.3 billion or 35% compared with the first quarter. The average impact from the acquired People's United loans was $13.1 billion. Legacy M&T CRE average balances declined $830 million during the second quarter due to almost equal reductions in construction and permanent loans. We continue to reduce our construction exposure as there is a lack of new activity to offset the conversion of construction loans into permanent mortgages. There was an uptick in permanent mortgage financing in the quarter. However, it was outpaced by an elevated level of paydowns.\nResidential real estate loans increased by $6.9 billion or 43% due almost entirely to the average impact of the People's United loans. The legacy M&T average loan balances were essentially flat as the retention of new originations retained for investment, were offset by normal runoff, combined with the sale of Ginnie Mae buyouts that became eligible for repooling into new RMBS.\nAverage consumer loans were up $1.8 billion or 10%, again due in large part to the $1.6 billion average impact from the People's United loans. For legacy M&T recreational finance loan growth continues to be a key driver of growth. Average investment securities increased by $14.7 billion due to the $11.2 billion average impact from the acquired People's United securities and a $3.5 billion increase in legacy M&T investment securities. Average earning assets excluding money market placements, which is inclusive of cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve, increased $50 billion or 50% due largely to the $46.7 billion average impact of People's United and growth in legacy M&T average investment securities.\nAfter closing the acquisition, we implemented various balance sheet restructuring actions to optimize the funding base of the combined bank. These actions utilize some of the cash available and resulted in a decrease in deposits. Many of these actions occurred during the quarter, so we thought it would be more informative to look at the change in end-of-period cash balances.\nCash balances decreased by $11.8 billion to $33.4 billion at the end of June, down from just over $45.2 billion on April 1. The decline was the result of several factors. These include a $2 billion increase in investment securities, a $1.5 billion restructuring of some People's United high-cost deposits notably broker deposits, a $3 billion decline in escrow and mortgage warehouse related deposits, reflecting lower levels of activity associated with the rising rate environment, a $500 million reduction in trust demand deposits resulting from lower levels of capital market activity compared with the first quarter and a $2 billion drop in municipal deposits. We continue to actively manage higher cost deposits and in many cases, retain the customer and are able to move their balances to an off-balance sheet alternative that provides the interest rate they desire.\nWith that background, average core customer deposits, which excludes CDs over $250,000 increased by $45 billion or 36% compared with the first quarter. The average impact from the People's United deposits was about $49 billion.\nTurning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $571 million in the second quarter compared with $541 million in the linked quarter. The People's United noninterest income contributed $79 million while legacy M&T declined by $49 million. As noted, M&T received a $30 million distribution from Bayview Lending Group in the first quarter and did not receive any distribution in the second quarter of this year.\nMortgage banking revenues were $83 million in the recent quarter compared with $109 million in the linked quarter. Revenues from our residential mortgage business were $50 million in the second quarter, compared with $76 million in the prior quarter. Residential loans originated for sale were $77 million in the recent quarter compared with $161 million in the first quarter. Both figures reflect our decision to retain a substantial majority of our mortgage originations for investment on our balance sheet.\nThe primary driver of the linked quarter decline in revenue is the higher interest rate environment, which has pressured gain on sale margins for loans previously purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing pools, and which became eligible for resale or repooling. With the rapid increase in yields for new mortgage originations over the past few months, these Ginnie Mae repooled loans have fallen below new origination yields, which has driven the negative gain on sale margin. During the quarter, residential mortgage loans were sold at a loss of $17 million compared to a $14 million gain on sale in the prior quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $33 million in the second quarter, essentially unchanged from the linked quarter. That figure was $35 million in the year ago quarter.\nTrust income was $190 million in the recent quarter and included about $14 million in income from People's United. Legacy M&T trust income increased about 4% due largely to about $10 million from the recapture of money market fee waivers and $4 million in seasonal tax preparation fees, partially offset by the impact of lower market valuations on assets under management and administration.\nService fees on deposit accounts were $124 million compared with $102 million in the first quarter. People's United contributed $33 million to this fee income line during the quarter. The decline in legacy M&T service charges primarily reflects the previously announced repricing of our consumer checking products. We expect foregone revenues from the program to reach a run rate of $15 million per quarter during the second half of the year.\nOperating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $1.16 billion, and included about $259 million in expenses from the operations of People's United. Legacy M&T operating expenses were about $903 million, compared to $941 million in the linked quarter and $859 million in the year ago quarter.\nRecall, operating expenses for the first quarter include approximately $74 million of seasonally higher compensation costs. Aside from those seasonal factors that flow through salaries and benefits, legacy M&T operating expenses increased by $36 million from the first quarter. This increase was due almost entirely to higher salaries and benefits costs resulting from 1 additional business day, a full quarter impact of merit increases and increased incentive accruals tied to improved bank performance. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator, was 58.3% in the recent quarter compared with 64.9% in 2022's first quarter and 58.4% in the second quarter of last year.\nNext, let's turn to credit. Despite the lingering challenges of the pandemic and its variance, supply chain disruption, labor shortages and persistent inflation, credit is stable to improving. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $1.82 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $352 million from the end of the linked quarter. The increase was due largely to the impact of the allowance related to the acquired People's United loan portfolio. We ran the acquired loan book through our allowance methodology and essentially confirmed their allowance at closing.\nApplying the provisions from the CECL accounting principle, we assigned $99 million of the People's United allowance to purchase credit deteriorated, or PCD loans and $242 million to non-PCD loans. In addition, we recorded a $60 million provision in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these increases were net charge-offs of $50 million in the second quarter compared to just $7 million in this year's first quarter.\nEconomic indicators continue to show improvement from the prior period, but inflation remains at a historically high levels. Aside from movements in forward interest rate curves, the second quarter's baseline macroeconomic forecast was relatively unchanged from the prior quarter for those indicators that have a significant impact on our CECL modeling results, including the unemployment rate, GDP growth and residential and commercial real estate values.\nNonaccrual loans increased to $2.6 billion compared to $2.1 billion sequentially. The increase was entirely the result of the acquired People's United loan portfolio as nonaccrual loans at legacy M&T decreased sequentially. At the end of the second quarter, nonaccrual loans represented 2.1% of loans, down from 2.3% at the end of the linked quarter.\nWhen we file our second quarter 10-Q in a few weeks, we expect to report an increase in criticized loans. However, the percentage of loans recognized as criticized will decrease. Similar to the trends in the nonaccrual portfolio, the increase in the dollar amount of criticized loans is due entirely to the acquired People's United portfolio. We expect a modest decline in criticized legacy M&T loans. As noted, charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $50 million. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 16 basis points for the quarter compared to 3 basis points in the first quarter. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were $524 million at the end of the quarter, down from $777 million sequentially. In total, 89% of these 90 days past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities.\nTurning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.9% compared with 11.7% at the end of the first quarter. The decrease was largely due to the impact of the People's United acquisition and the repurchase of $600 million in common shares, which represented 2% of our outstanding common stock. Tangible common equity totaled $15.3 billion, increased 33% from the end of the prior quarter due largely to the impact of the People's United merger. Tangible common equity per share amounted to $85.78 per share, down $3.55 or 4% from the end of the first quarter. As previously noted, the Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for up to $3 billion of common stock, which replaces the previous $800 million repurchase program, under which $600 million of M&T shares were purchased in the second quarter.\nNow let's turn to the outlook. Interest rate expectations continue to be volatile and can have a material impact on our outlook for full year 2022. Similar to last quarter, the outlook that follows reflects the combined balance sheet with 3 quarters of operations from People's United as well as a more recent forward curve and is on a full year basis.\nFirst, let's talk about our outlook for the balance sheet. We continue to expect to grow the investment securities portfolio by $2 billion per quarter for the remainder of the year. However, that cadence could accelerate or slow depending on market conditions as well as customer loan demand.\nNow turning to the outlook for average loans. When compared to stand-alone M&T full year 2021 average loan balances of $97 billion, we continue to expect average loan growth for our combined franchise to be in the 24% to 26% range. However, growth may come in near the lower end of that range. Note that the updated average growth rates for C&I and CRE loans reflect the reclassification of C&I loans into CRE loans in the former People's United loan book that we mentioned earlier.\nOn a combined and full year average basis, we expect average C&I growth in the 37% to 39% range. We expect average CRE growth in the 17% to 19% range, average residential mortgage growth in the 28% to 30% range and average consumer loan growth in the 10% to 12% range. As we look at the combined income statement compared to stand-alone M&T operations from 2021, we believe we're well positioned to benefit from higher rates and to manage through the macro challenges we noted earlier on this call.\nOur outlook for net interest income for the combined franchise is for 56% full year growth compared with the $3.8 billion in 2021. This reflects the forward yield curve from the beginning of the month. Given the speed of interest rate hikes by the Fed, the reactivity of deposit pricing and the deployment of excess liquidity and loan growth, the full year net interest income could be plus or minus 2%.\nTurning to the fee businesses. We still expect strong trust income growth driven by new business and the recapture of money market fee waivers but albeit lower than previous expectations as a result of the lower equity valuations from second quarter. In addition, higher interest rates are expected to continue to pressure mortgage originations and gain on sale margins. We have completed the sales of Ginnie Mae repooled mortgages, and we will continue with the retention of almost all originations for the rest of the year. With this in mind, we expect the gain on sale from residential mortgages to be minimal in the second half of the year. We, therefore, now expect noninterest income to grow in the 5% to 7% range for the full year compared to $2.2 billion in 2021.\nNext, our outlook for full year 2022 operating noninterest expense is impacted by the timing of the People's United systems conversion and subsequent realization of expense synergies. We continue to anticipate 24% to 26% growth in combined operating noninterest expenses when compared to the $3.6 billion in 2021. However, expenses are likely to be near the higher end of the range, reflecting inflationary pressures on wages and improved bank performance. As a reminder, these operating noninterest expenses do not include pretax merger-related charges. We do not expect these charges to be materially different than our initial estimates.\nTurning to credit. We continue to expect credit losses to remain well below M&T's long-term average of 33 basis points. For 2022, we conservatively estimate that net charge-offs for the combined company will be in the 20 basis point range.\nFinally, turning to capital. We believe the current level of core capital is higher than what is needed to safely run the combined organization and to support lending in our communities. We plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace. Late in June, the Federal Reserve released the results of its stress test, also known as the DFAS. Based on these DFAS results, M&T's preliminary stress capital buffer, or SCB, is estimated at 4.7%. As a result, we will be subject to a 9.2% common equity Tier 1 ratio threshold under the SCB regulation, which is in effect from October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023.\nM&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.9% at June 30, comfortably exceeds the threshold, although which capital distributions could be limited by that regulation. We continue to anticipate ending 2022 with a CET1 ratio in the 10.5% range. With a solid capital -- starting capital position and the potential to generate significant additional amounts of capital over the next few years, we don't anticipate a material change to our capital distribution plans. Our objective, as always, is to bring our CET1 ratio down gradually to a level that is near the high end of the lower quartile of our peer group. We anticipate continuing to repurchase common shares under the new $3 billion repurchase program.\nNow let's open up the call to questions before which Gretchen will briefly review the instructions."

I would now like to hand the conference over to Brian Klock, Head of Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nSenior VP and Head of Markets & IR, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Gretchen. And good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast.\nIf you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it, along with the financial tables and schedules, from our website, www.mtb.com, by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events and Presentations link.\nAlso, before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials.\nThese materials are all available on our Investor Relations web page, and we encourage the participants to refer to them for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements and risk factors. These statements speak only as of the date made, and M&T undertakes no obligation to update them. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.\n\nDarren J. King\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As we reflect on the past quarter, it was an eventful one. First off, we were pleased to have closed the acquisition of People's United Financial on April 1 and to welcome our new colleagues, customers and shareholders to the M&T family.\nWe're excited to turn our complete focus to successfully integrating People's United, of course, not losing sight of the tenets that define M&T, delivering superior customer service, offering rewarding careers for our colleagues, engaging in the communities we call home, and providing top quartile long-term returns to shareholders.\nWe plan on completing the systems conversion in the third quarter of this year. Subsequent to our January earnings call, the outlook for interest rates has changed materially, low levels of unemployment and continued supply chain disruptions exacerbated by the situation in Ukraine have pushed inflation to levels not seen since the early 1980s.\nInterest rates began to rise even before the Federal Reserve raised its Fed funds target in late March, and the forward curve anticipates additional hikes coming more quickly than we anticipated in January.\nThe changing rate environment created an opportunity for us to deploy excess cash into investment securities at a faster pace than we previously outlined and to restart our interest rate hedging program. While we're beginning to see the tailwinds from rising interest rates positively impacting our net interest income, those same higher rates have prompted headwinds to our mortgage banking business, both for origination volumes and for gain on sale margins.\nWe expect these headwinds to persist. Despite these macro challenges, credit quality remains strong and expense growth has been well managed. We're well positioned for the future and excited about the opportunity to integrate the People's United franchise as well as to deploy our excess cash and excess capital.\nNow let's review our results for the first quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.62 for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $3.37 in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNet income for the quarter was $362 million compared with $458 million in the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on assets just shy of 1% at 0.97% and an annualized return on average common equity of 8.55%. This compares with rates of 1.15% and 10.91%, respectively, in the previous quarter.\nIncluded in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $1 million or $0.01 per common share, down slightly from the prior quarter.\nAlso included in this quarter's results were merger-related expenses of $17 million related to the People's United acquisition. This amounted to $13 million after tax or $0.10 per common share. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.\nM&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $376 million compared with $475 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.73 for the recent quarter compared to $3.50 in 2021's fourth quarter.\nNet operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.04% and 12.44% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.23% and 15.98% in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nIn accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Included in the recent quarters, GAAP and net operating results was a $30 million distribution from Bayview Lending Group.\nThis amounted to $23 million after-tax effect and $0.17 per common share. We received a light distribution in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNext, we'll look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated these results. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $907 million in the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of $30 million or 3% from the linked quarter.\nThe primary drivers of the decline were $20 million in lower interest income and fees from PPP loans as well as a $16 million reduction of interest accrued on earning assets, reflecting the 2-day shorter calendar quarter.\nThose factors were partially offset by higher rates on interest-earning assets and cash interest received on nonaccrual loans. The net interest margin for the past quarter was 2.65%, up 7 basis points from 2.58% in the linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase to the margin was a reduced level of cash held on deposit at the Federal Reserve, which we estimate boosted the margin by 10 basis points.\nThat was partially offset by a 4 basis point decline resulting from the lower income from PPP loans. Rising interest rates had a modest 1 basis point benefit to the margin as the Fed action on the Fed funds target came relatively late in the quarter.\nAll other factors, including day count and interest received on nonaccrual loans had a negligible impact on the margin. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2021, average interest earning assets decreased by some 4% or $5.8 billion, reflecting a $5.6 billion decline in money market placements, including cash on deposit at the Fed, partially offset by a $920 million increase in investment securities.\nAverage loans outstanding decreased by about 1% compared with the previous quarter. Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased by $976 million or about 4%. That figure includes the decrease of approximately $780 million in PPP loans.\nThat decrease was more than offset by $361 million growth in dealer floor plan balances and a $1.4 billion increase in all other C&I loans. Commercial real estate loans declined by 5% compared with the fourth quarter. 3 factors contributed to that decline.\nElevated payoff activity was the primary driver, including several criticized and nonaccrual loans assumed by other lenders. The quarter also saw construction loans converted into permanent off-balance sheet financing, often facilitated by our M&T Realty Capital Corporation subsidiary.\nAnd finally, new origination activity remained subdued compared to prior years. Real estate loans declined by -- residential real estate loans, excuse me, declined by 3%, consistent with our expectations.\nThe change reflects new loans originated and retained for investment, which were more than offset by normal runoff, combined with the sale of Ginnie Mae buyouts as they became eligible for repooling into new RMBS.\nConsumer loans were up nearly 1%. Activity was consistent with recent quarters where growth in indirect auto and recreational finance loans has been outpacing declines in home equity lines and loans.\nOn an end-of-period basis, PPP loans amounted to just $592 million. Average core customer deposits, which excludes CDs over $250,000, decreased about 5% or some $6 billion compared with the fourth quarter. That figure was roughly evenly divided between noninterest-bearing and interest checking.\nTrust demand deposits drove the decline in demand deposits following lower levels of capital markets activity compared with the fourth quarter. The decline in interest checking reflects our ongoing program to manage deposit pricing downward, while our liquidity profile remains so strong.\nSome higher cost escrow deposits were moved off our balance sheet to other institutions willing to pay higher rates. Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $541 million in the first quarter compared with $579 million in the linked quarter. As noted, M&T received a $30 million distribution from Bayview Lending Group in each of the past 2 quarters.\nMortgage banking revenues were $109 million in the recent quarter compared with $139 million in the linked quarter. Revenues from our residential mortgage banking business were $76 million in the first quarter compared with $91 million in the prior quarter.\nResidential mortgage loans originated for sale were $161 million in the recent quarter compared with $191 million in the fourth quarter. Both figures reflect our decision to retain a substantial majority of mortgage originations for investment on our balance sheet.\nThe primary driver of the linked-quarter revenue decline is the higher interest rate environment has pressured gain on sale margins for loans previously purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing pools, and which have become eligible for resale or re pooling.\nAlthough these loans typically have higher rates than new originations, that difference has been narrowing. Residential gain on sale totaled $14 million in the recent quarter compared with $26 million in the prior quarter.\nCommercial Banking revenues were $33 million in the first quarter, reflecting a decline from $49 million in the linked quarter. That figure was $32 million in the year ago quarter. As a reminder, the commercial mortgage banking business tends to show seasonal swings.\nRevenues totaled $66 million in the first half of 2021 compared with $99 million in the second half. which also included an elevated level of prepayment fees. Trust income was $169 million in the recent quarter, little changed from the previous quarter but up 8% from the year ago quarter.\nService charges on deposit accounts were $102 million compared with $105 million in the fourth quarter. That decline primarily reflects seasonal factors. The previously announced repricing of our consumer checking products did not have a significant impact on the first quarter, but we expect foregone revenues from the program to reach a run rate of $15 million per quarter by the second half of the year.\nTurning to expenses. Operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $941 million. The comparable figures were $904 million in the linked quarter and $907 million in the year ago quarter.\nAs is typical for M&T's first quarter results, operating expenses for the recent quarter which included approximately $74 million of seasonally higher compensation costs relating to the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, like (inaudible).\nAlso, it reflects the HSA contribution, the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401(k) match and FICA payments as well as the annual reset in FICA payments and unemployment insurance. Those same items amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately $69 million in last year's first quarter.\nAs usual, we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter. Aside from these seasonal factors that flow through salaries and benefits, operating expenses declined by $38 million compared with the fourth quarter.\nLower professional services costs as well as lower pension-related costs drove that decline. The efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was 64.9% in the recent quarter compared with 59.7% in 2021's 4th quarter and 60.3% in the first quarter of 2021.\nThose ratios in the first quarters of 2021 and 2022 each reflect the seasonally elevated compensation expenses. Next, let's turn to credit. Despite the challenges of the pandemic experience, supply chain disruption, lower labor shortage and persistent inflation, credit is stable to improving.\nThe allowance for credit losses amounted to $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, little changed from the end of 2021. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $10 million in the first quarter which was partially offset by just $7 million of net charge-offs.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic eases, forecasted economic indicators continue to show improvement from the prior period. But inflation remains persistently high with upward pressure from energy prices and constrained supply chains, which have been impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nThe first quarter's baseline macroeconomic forecast consider these developments, although there was a little difference in the forecast from the prior quarter for those indicators that have a significant impact on our CECL modeling results, including the unemployment rate, GDP growth and residential and consumer real estate values.\nThe result of these considerations is an allowance for credit losses that is consistent with our prior estimate. Nonaccrual loans increased very slightly, amounting to $2.1 billion, that equaled 2.3% of loans at the end of March, up slightly from 2.2% at the end of last year.\nWhen we file our first quarter 10-Q in a few weeks, we expect to report a modest decline in criticized loans. As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $7 million Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were just 3 basis points for the first quarter, which we believe is an all-time low.\nThat figure was 13 basis points in the fourth quarter. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, were $777 million at the end of the recent quarter.\nIn total, 89% of these 90 days past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities. Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 11.6% compared with 11.4% at the end of the fourth quarter. This ratio reflects earnings net of dividends, combined with a slight reduction in risk-weighted assets.\nTangible common equity totaled $11.5 billion, down just 0.3% from the end of the prior quarter. Tangible common equity per share amounted to $89.33, down $0.47 or 0.5 percentage point from the end of the fourth quarter.\nThis very moderate decline reflects our patience in deploying excess liquidity into long-duration investments until the interest rate outlook became clear. As previously announced, we expect to resume the repurchase of M&T common shares shortly, starting with the $800 million buyback program recently reauthorized by our Board. Now turning to the outlook.\nOn April 1, we closed the People's United acquisition. That development, combined with the rapid change in interest rate expectations have had a material impact on our outlook for full year 2022. The information that follows reflects the combined balance sheet, a more recent forward curve and includes 3/4 of operations from People's United.\nFirst, let's talk about our outlook for the balance sheet. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting adjustments at closing, we acquired $63 billion in total assets, including Investment securities totaling $12 million, cash placed at the Federal Reserve totaling $9 billion, loans of $36 billion and other assets of $6 billion.\nDeposits totaled $53 billion, borrowings and other liabilities totaled about $1 billion each, and equity totaled $7.5 billion. The purchase consideration was approximately $8.4 billion. With the increase in rates, the deal is now expected to be slightly dilutive to tangible book value per share.\nHowever, this also means that future earnings will benefit from additional acquisition accounting accretive. Let's go into a little more detail on our outlook for growth in the combined balance sheet. First, the interest-earning cash position at the beginning of the second quarter totaled just over $45 billion.\nWe expect these balances to decline to slightly under $30 billion by the end of 2022 due to a combination of growth in the securities portfolio, loan growth as well as a reduction in wholesale funding.\nInvestment securities for the combined company totaled $21 billion at the beginning of the second quarter, and we expect to grow the portfolio by $2 billion per quarter.\nThis cadence could accelerate or slow depending on market conditions. We start this quarter with $40 billion in C&I loans, including just over $800 million in PPP loans. CRE, residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios are $46 billion, $22 billion and $20 billion, respectively.\nIn order to provide more details on our outlook for loan growth, let's first look at our expectations for spot or end-of-period loan growth from the beginning of the second quarter through the end of 2022.\nTotal combined loans are expected to grow in the 3% to 5% range from the beginning of the second quarter. Excluding PTP and Ginnie Mae buyout loan balances, total combined loans are expected to grow in the 4% to 6% range.\nThe outlook for C&I loan growth, excluding PPP loans, is in that same 4% to 6% range, with solid growth and dealer floor plan balances. PPP loans are expected to continue to pay down over the course of the year and not have a material impact on loan growth.\nFor [CRE] loans, we expect the heightened level of payoffs to largely run their course. And thus, the outlook for total combined CRE loans is essentially flat for the rest of this year. The tailwinds from our mortgage retention strategy are expected to help drive 7% to 8% loan growth in residential mortgage balances over the course of this year.\nAnd excluding the impact of the retooling of Ginnie Mae buyouts, growth is expected to be in the 12% to 14% range. Of course, mortgage rates and home supply will ultimately affect that pace of growth.\nFinally, we are pleased with the momentum in our consumer loan portfolio and expect this growth to continue to be strong over the remainder of the year. We anticipate growth in the 7% to 9% range in this portfolio.\nTo help you understand the outlook for end-of-period growth or how the outlook for end of period loan growth ties into growth in average -- the average balance sheet when compared to stand-alone M&T 2021 average balances, we expect (inaudible) loans for the combined franchise to grow in the 24% to 26% range when compared to stand-alone M&T full year 2021 average balances of $97 billion.\nOn a combined and full year average basis, we expect average C&I growth in the 43% to 45% range. We expect average CRE growth in the 15% to 16% range and average residential mortgage growth in the 26% to 28% range.\nAnd finally, we expect average consumer loan growth in the 16% to 18% range. As we look at the outlook for the combined income statement compared to stand-alone M&T operations from 2021, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from higher rates and manage through the macro challenges we noted earlier on this call.\nThis outlook includes the impact from preliminary estimates of acquisition accounting marks that are expected to be finalized later in the quarter.\nOur outlook for net interest income for the combined franchise is for 50% full year growth compared to the $3.8 billion in 2021. We expect that 50% growth to be plus or minus 2% depending on the speed of interest rate hikes by the Fed and the pace of the deployment of excess liquidity as well as loan growth.\nThis outlook reflects the forward yield curve from the beginning of this month. Turning to the fee businesses. While higher rates are expected to pressure mortgage originations and gain on sale margins, growth in trust revenue should benefit from the recapture of money market fee waivers sooner than previously anticipated.\nWe expect noninterest income to grow in the 11% to 13% range for the full year compared to $2.2 billion in 2021. Next, our outlook for full year 2022 operating noninterest expenses is impacted by the timing of the People's United system conversion and subsequent realization of expense synergies. We anticipate 23% to 26% growth in combined operating noninterest expenses when compared to $3.6 billion in 2021.\nAs a reminder, these operating noninterest expenses do not include pretax merger-related charges. At the time of the merger announcement, onetime pretax merger charges were estimated at $740 million, including $93 million of capitalized expenditures. These merger charges are not expected to be materially different than these initial estimates.\nWe expect the majority of these merger charges to be incurred in the second and third quarters of this year. Turning to credit. We continue to expect credit losses to remain well below M&T's legacy long-term average of 33 basis points.\nFor 2022, we conservatively estimate that net charge-offs for the combined company will be in the 20 basis point range. As a reminder, the provision for credit losses in this year's second quarter will include provision related to the nonpurchase credit deteriorated loans from People's United.\nWe are still finalizing the acquisition accounting marks, but given the improvement in economic conditions over the past year, this provision will likely be lower than the $352 million pretax provision estimated at the time of the announcement, the so-called double count.\nFinally, turning to capital. Due to the delay and growth in capital at both firms, the preliminary combined CET1 ratio at closing should be over 11%. We believe this level of core capital is higher than what is needed to safely run the combined company and to support lending in our communities. We plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace. We will be participating in the DFAST this year and again in 2023.\nNormally, next year would have been an off year for a Category 4 bank like M&T. However, the Federal Reserve has reasonably requested that we participate again next year so that our stress test and stress capital buffer can be at best, including the balance sheet and operations of People's United.\nWith a solid starting capital position and the potential to generate significant amounts of capital over the next few years, we don't anticipate the test results causing a material change to our capital distribution plans.\nOur objective, as always, is to bring our CET1 ratio down gradually to a level that is near the high end of the lower quartile of our peer group. Based on that objective, we anticipate ending 2022 with a CET1 ratio in the 10.5% range.\nAs noted earlier, we anticipate restarting the currently authorized $800 million common share repurchase program now that the acquisition is closed. Now let's open up the call to questions, before which Gretchen will briefly review the instructions."

(Operator Instructions) Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Brian Klock, Head of Market and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Paul Klock\n\nSenior VP and Head of Markets & IR, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Britney, and good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for participating in M&T's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call, both by telephone and through the webcast. Joining on the call today are Darren King, M&T's Chief Financial Officer; and Don MacLeod, M&T's outgoing Director of Investor Relations, who will be retiring after our Annual Meeting of Shareholders in April. As he has done for the past 17-plus years, let me turn the call over to Don to read our disclaimers.\n\nDonald J. MacLeod\n\nFormer Administrative VP, Assistant Secretary & Director of IR, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian. If you have not read the earnings release we issued this morning, you may access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website, www.mtb.com, by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events & Presentations link.\nAlso before we start, I'd like to mention that today's presentation may contain forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's earnings release materials as well as our SEC filings and other investor materials. These materials are all available on our Investor Relations web page, and we encourage participants to refer to them for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements and risk factors. These statements speak only as of the date made, and M&T undertakes no obligation to update them.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Darren King.\n\nDarren J. King\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, M&T Bank Corporation\n\nThank you, Brian, and Don, and good morning, everyone. Don, it's hard to believe that it's the end of an era, 17 years at M&T and 40 years in the industry. You've been nothing but a true professional and certainly helped make my transition into the role a lot easier. I've learned a lot from you. I thank you, and we wish you all the best in your retirement.\nBefore we get into the details of the recent quarter's results, I'd like to pause and reflect on a few highlights of the past year. While the impact of the pandemic is still being felt by M&T and the rest of the banking industry, the turnaround in 2021 has been remarkable. We've seen a transition from economic contraction and a 0-bound interest rate environment to the prospect of persistent inflation and higher interest rates in 2022.\nAgainst that backdrop, GAAP-based diluted earnings per common share were $13.8 compared with $9.94 in 2020, up 39%. Net income was $1.86 billion compared with $1.35 billion in the prior year, improved by 37%. Those results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.22% and 11.54%, respectively. Net operating income, which excludes the after-tax impact from the amortization of intangible assets as well as merger-related expenses, was $1.9 billion, up 39% compared with $1.36 billion in the prior year.\nNet operating income per diluted common share was $14.11, compared with $10.02 in 2020, up 41%. Net operating income for 2021, expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity, was 1.28% and 16.8%, respectively. We increased the common stock dividend for the fifth consecutive year to an annual rate of $4.80 per share per year. Tangible book value per share grew to $89.8 at the end of 2021, up 11.5% from the end of 2020. And as we build capital in anticipation of the merger with People's United Financial, our CET1 ratio increased to an estimated 11.4% at the end of 2021 from 10% at the end of 2020.\nWhile the season -- pardon made the year had its ups and downs, it sure felt like another division championship. Now let's turn to the results for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.37 for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $3.69 in the third quarter of 2021, and $3.52 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net income for the quarter was $458 million compared with $495 million in the linked quarter and $471 million in the year ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.15% and an annualized return on average common equity of 10.91%. This compares with rates of 1.28% and 12.16%, respectively, in the previous quarter.\nIncluded in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $1 million or $0.01 per common share, little change from the prior quarter. Also included in the quarter's results were merger-related expenses of $21 million, related to M&T's proposed acquisition of People's United Financial. This amounted to $16 million after tax or $0.12 per common share. Results for 2021's third quarter included $9 million of such charges amounting to $7 million after tax or $0.05 per common share. Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.\nM&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses was $475 million. That compares with $504 million in the linked quarter and $473 million in last year's fourth quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.50 for the recent quarter compared with $3.76 in 2021's third quarter and $3.54 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.23% and 15.98% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.34% and 17.54% in the third quarter of 2021.\nIn accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Included in the recent quarter's GAAP and net operating results, was a $30 million distribution from Bayview Lending Group. This amounted to $22 million after-tax effect and $0.17 per common share. We received a like distribution in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to 2020, we had generally received such distributions in the first quarter of each year.\nTurning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $937 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, marking a decrease of $34 million or 3% from the linked quarter. The primary driver of that decrease was a $30 million decline in interest income and fees from PPP loans as that portfolio continues to decline following forgiveness of those loans by the Small Business Administration. The net interest margin decreased by 16 basis points to 2.58%, that compares with 2.74% in the linked quarter. We estimate that the higher balance of low-yielding cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve diluted the margin by about 9 basis points in the quarter.\nThe lower income from PPP loans, including declines in the scheduled amortization and accelerated recognition of fees from forgiven loans, contributed about 5 basis points of the margin pressure. All other factors, including lower benefit from hedges accounted for an estimated 2 basis points of the decline. Average earning assets increased by $4 billion compared with the third quarter. This includes a $5.3 billion increase in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve and a $785 million increase in investment securities. On average, total loans decreased by $2.1 billion or about 2% compared with the previous quarter.\nLooking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter. Commercial and industrial loans declined by $1.4 billion or about 6%. That reflects a $1.6 billion decline in PPP loans, primarily reflecting loan forgiveness. Auto floor plan loans to vehicle dealers declined by -- or $58 million on an average basis, but grew by $554 million on an end-of-period basis. All other C&I loans grew about 1% compared with the prior quarter. Commercial real estate loans declined $830 million or about 2% compared with the third quarter. We've seen a higher level of paydowns and payoffs of some of the troubled loans, often being refinanced by other lenders.\nResidential real estate loans declined by $89 million or less than 1%, as a result of principal repayments as well as the ongoing repooling of loans previously purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing pools. That was largely offset by the retention of new loans originated and held for investment. Consumer loans were up over 1%, reflecting growth in indirect auto loans and positive but seasonally slower growth in recreation finance loans, partially offset by lower home equity lines of credit. Average core customer deposits, which excludes CDs over $250,000, grew by $3.6 billion or 3% compared with the third quarter, primarily reflecting noninterest-bearing products.\nTurning to net interest income -- or sorry, noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $579 million in the fourth quarter compared with $569 million in the prior quarter. The increase reflects the $30 million distribution from BayView Lending Group that I previously mentioned. Mortgage banking revenues were $139 million in the recent quarter compared with $160 million in the linked quarter. As we noted on the October call, we have begun to retain a significant majority, around 85% of residential mortgage originations, to hold for investment on the balance sheet, which utilizes a portion of the excess liquidity we currently have. This includes the roughly 20% normally held for investment.\nAs a result of increasing mortgage rates and the holiday slowdown, residential mortgage loan applications during the most recent quarter amounted to $1.7 billion compared with $2.2 billion in the third quarter. Of those, we recorded gains on sale on the $191 million that were locked for sale in the fourth quarter versus gain on sale on the $1.1 billion that were locked in the third quarter. Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $91 million in the fourth quarter compared with $110 million in the prior quarter. The decrease reflects the lower level of loans originated for sale, partially offset by gains from the sale of loans previously purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing pools, that based on borrower reperformance recently became saleable. Residential servicing revenues improved slightly.\nCommercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $48 million, encompassing both originations and servicing compared with $50 million in the third quarter. Recall that in the third quarter's Commercial servicing results, they included an $11 million fee for yield maintenance as a result of prepayment of previously securitized Commercial mortgage loans. Trust income was $169 million in the recent quarter, improved from $157 million in the previous quarter. Business remains solid with very strong capital markets activity, continued growth in retirement plan assets and higher asset values. Service charges on deposits were $105 million in the recent quarter, unchanged from the third quarter.\nTurning to expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and the merger-related expenses were $904 million compared with $888 million in the third quarter. Salaries and benefits increased by $5 million from the prior quarter. This reflects, in part, higher levels of branch staffing as customer traffic returns to normal, and our ongoing program of adding on-payroll IT professionals. Data processing and software increased by $6 million from the third quarter tied in part to higher business volumes as well as the costs from software licensing agreements.\nThe $6 million linked quarter increase in advertising and marketing reflects the beginning of the winter marketing campaign combined with incentives paid on new customer accounts. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization, and merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was 59.7% in the linked quarter, compared with 57.7% in the third quarter. It's cliche in sports that defense -- defense wins championships. In banking, credit is the defense. Let's take a look at credit.\nWhile some sectors of the economy remain challenged by supply chain and labor constraints, credit trends overall continue to improve, even in the most severely impacted sectors. The allowance for credit losses declined by $46 million to $1.47 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. That reflects a $15 million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses, combined with $31 million of net charge-offs in the quarter. At December 31, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding was 1.58% compared with 1.62% at September 30.\nAnnualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 13 basis points for the fourth quarter, down slightly from 17 basis points in the third quarter. With the advantage of hindsight, it would appear that criticized loans did indeed peak in the third quarter of 2021. And when we file our 10-K, we expect to report a noticeable decline in criticized loans, reflecting both payoffs and upgrades. Nonaccrual loans as of December 31 declined to $2.1 billion, a decrease of $182 million from the end of September. Nonaccrual loans, as a percentage of loans outstanding, were 2.22% compared with 2.4% at the end of the prior quarter.\nLoans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, were $963 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of those loans, $928 million or 96% were guaranteed by government-related entities. In a difficult environment, 1 might argue our credit is the top-ranked defense in the league.\nTurning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 11.4% as of December 31 compared with 11.1% at the end of the third quarter. This reflects the impact of earnings in excess of dividends paid in a slightly higher risk-weighted and slightly higher risk-weighted assets. As previously noted, we increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 9% this quarter to $1.20 per share per quarter, raising the annual dividend rate to $4.80 per share.\nNow turning to the outlook. As we look forward into 2022, we are pleased to see that the economy is improving, evidenced by the fact that GDP is growing and unemployment is falling. However, these conditions are driving inflation, which is impacting our cost structure as well as that of our customers. It has also changed the outlook for interest rates as the forward curve now has embedded a number of increases in both 2022 and 2023. Our outlook considers these macro factors. Also, as we are still awaiting regulatory approval for our merger with People's United, we will focus our comments on M&T stand-alone. That said, there are no material changes to our expectations for the financial impact and benefits of the merger. Of course, the timing of those benefits will depend on the date we close the merger and complete the conversion.\nStarting with the balance sheet. There are a number of moving parts that will impact where we're headed. We don't expect the $42 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of 2021 to endure through 2022. We are managing deposit balances, both brokered and customer relationships that don't make economic sense in this rate and liquidity environment. We'd expect interest checking and MMDA accounts -- balance to decline over the course of the year. Our current plan is to continue securities purchases to increase the proportion of our liquid assets that are held in longer duration assets and have higher yields. We expect to do this by replacing maturities and principal amortization and to increase investment securities by an incremental $1 billion by the end of the year.\nOn the Commercial side, PPP loans on our balance sheet amounted to $1.2 billion at year-end. We expect a significant majority of those loans will be largely repaid or forgiven in the first half of 2022. We've seen a meaningful turnaround in vehicle inventory financing, and we believe we're past the low point and expect growth in 2022, although not fully back to prepandemic levels. The remainder of our C&I portfolio experienced growth this past quarter, and we believe we've also reached the inflection point in these balances. We expect this growth to continue.\nThe pandemic resulted in a slow pace of new Commercial real estate transactions over the past 2 years, putting pressure on balance growth. This leads us to expect low single-digit declines in CRE balances in 2022. Our efforts to make this portfolio more capital-efficient should result in a transition to more fee income, less interest income, less use of the balance sheet, and higher returns over time. In connection with those efforts, we may seek to participate CRE loan exposures to third parties while retaining the customer relationships and loan servicing. These factors are reflected in our outlook for interest and fee income.\nAs noted earlier, we're retaining a large majority of the mortgage loans we originate, which we expect will grow balances by approximately $2.5 billion in 2022, depending on the level of refinance activity. Offsetting that growth, are $2.8 billion of mortgage loans purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing pools on our balance sheet at the end of 2021, more than half of which we believe will qualify for repooling over the course of 2022. On average, we expect the residential real estate loan portfolio will contract during 2022.\nWe expect more of the same in the consumer portfolios with growth in indirect vehicle financing being partially offset by continued pressures on home equity balances. Taking all of this into account, the balance headwinds from PPP and Ginnie Mae buyouts will lead to average balance declines in 2022. However, excluding those impacts, we expect aggregate loan growth to be in the low to mid-single digits. We expect net interest income to be down in the low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Growth in securities, retention of mortgage loan originations, and a return to growth in C&I loans will help, but not fully offset the lower benefits from the PPP loans and our interest rate hedging program.\nWe continue to expect net interest income to trough in the first quarter of the year and grow from there. That should result in a net interest margin, little change from full year 2021 in the area of 2.75%. Our forecast incorporates 3 increases in short-term interest rates, although the third increase occurs late enough in the year, to not have a meaningful impact on either net interest income or margin.\nTurning to fees. As we noted, residential mortgage gain on sale revenues will be diminished in 2022 by our programs to retain for investment, a large portion of originations, although repooling of Ginnie Mae buyouts should be a partial offset. Commercial originations and servicing as well as residential mortgage servicing should still be solid. We see continued momentum in Trust income based on the capital markets activity, continued growth in retirement plan assets and possibly higher asset values. We would need to see short-term interest rates rise by 50 to 75 basis points before we can fully recover the money fund fees we are currently waiting. Those amount to an annual run rate of approximately $50 million.\nWe expect service charges on deposit accounts to be down, with modest growth in Commercial, offset by declines in consumer, largely related to changes in our overdraft practices. All in, we're looking for low single-digit growth in noninterest revenues in 2022.\nTurning to expenses. Noninterest operating expenses in 2021 grew at an uncharacteristically high rate, rising 5.6% over prior years. Lower profitability and growth led to decreased compensation costs in 2020. The recovery in profitability in 2021 carried with it a return to more normal compensation costs, which accounted for over half of the increase. Our current estimate contemplates low- to mid-single-digit operating expense growth in 2022. And like 2021, salaries and benefits, data processing and software, and advertising are the categories that will drive the majority of the increase. We would expect to see our typical seasonal surge in compensation expense during the year's first quarter. That amount last year was approximately $69 million.\nAnd we're encouraged by the improvement in credit conditions over the past several quarters. Overall, we expect net charge-offs to be consistent with the average of the past 2 years, although it could be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We expect loss provisioning to normalize as loan growth offsets potential declines in troubled credits.\nLastly, turning to capital. We've paused our buyback program while we wait to close the merger with People's United. Since that pause, our CET1 ratio has increased by 140 basis points to 11.4%, leaving us positioned well in excess of what we believe we need to run the combined company. Our focus, as always, will be on deploying excess -- the excess capital we have beyond that needed to support growth in the business. Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.\nNow let's open up the call to questions before which Britney will briefly review the instructions."

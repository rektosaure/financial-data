The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]\nI'll now turn the call over to Mr. Steve Frank. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, November 4, 2025. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call. Today, we reported 4% revenue growth and 9% growth in adjusted net income on an organic operational basis. thanks to the relentless focus and consistent execution of our colleagues across the world. Our International segment delivered 6% organic operational revenue growth with the U.S. contributing 3% growth excluding the impact of the MFA divestiture. By species, companion animal revenue grew 2% operationally and livestock organic operational revenue grew 10%.\nAs we anticipated, growth moderated this quarter driven by a strong year-over-year comp and macro factors, including vet clinic visits and promotional activity. Our resilient growth engine remains strong fueled by our market-leading innovation and pipeline, a diversified portfolio across species and geographies, global reach and trusted brands that continue to lead their categories and remain essential to veterinarians despite some near-term headwinds.\nNow let's turn to our key franchises where we're continuing to drive growth and the market opportunities remain significant. In parasiticides, our Simparica franchise grew 7% operationally with 6% operational growth from Simparica Trio. Internationally, we delivered strong broad-based double-digit growth, driven largely by the continued strength of Trio across all regions, underscoring this strong and growing global demand. And Trio's most recent approval in Brazil further extends that momentum. Another example of how our innovation and geographical expansion continue to fuel the franchise's long-term growth.\nIn the U.S. while broader end market dynamics affected overall franchise performance, we continue to see solid growth in retail and home delivery channels, which drive compliance and convenience for head owners. Trio growth moderated against a strong prior year comp with continued strength in the alternative channels, helping to partially offset subdued clinic traffic. We continue to navigate a more competitive U.S. market and hold share with disciplined and focused execution.\nTrio continues to set the benchmark in the category, supported by the broader strength of the Simparica franchise. Our first mover advantage, strong retail presence and customer loyalty position us well to sustain momentum across the portfolio. Parasiticides remains the largest category in Animal Health, and as the clear leader, we are competing from a position of strength with best-in-class innovation and high adoption, driving long-term growth. Our key dermatology franchise grew 3% operationally in the quarter reflecting the resilience of our differentiated and innovative portfolio.\nIn the U.S., growth was driven by applicable chewable adoption and strong retail performance offset by clinic softness and competitive dynamics in the category. Internationally, dermatology grew despite heightened competitive dynamics, including aggressive promotional activity tied to new product launches. At the same time, we continue to expand our differentiated portfolio with Apoquel chewable approved in Chile and Cytopoint receiving an expanded label in Brazil for allergic itch, again, reflecting our approach to geographic expansion and life cycle innovation that support sustained category growth.\nAs expected, we saw some minor share shifts during these launch periods, however, we're confident our portfolio will maintain its position as a preferred choice among customers. Even with this competitive backdrop, the overall opportunity in dermatology remains significant. More than half of critic cases globally remain untreated, and we see substantial runway for continued growth and market expansion.\nIn the quarter, our osteoarthritis or OA pain franchise declined 11% operationally. In addition to impact in the U.S., our performance in primarily English-speaking international markets has also been affected by MIP perceptions amplified on social media, contributing to a 15% operational decline in global Librela sales. We are executing a focused multipronged strategy to return Librela to growth. First, we're increasing awareness that OA is a serious progressive disease requiring early and proactive care to control associated pain and improve a pet's quality of life.\nSecond, we're deepening education and engagement with specialists and veterinarians to reinforce Librela's positive risk-benefit profile and real growth impact. Third, we're continuing to share clear science-based information and amplify the overwhelmingly positive experiences people and pets are having. Finally, beginning in Q4, our Phase 4 research conducted through independent third-party studies aimed to provide vets and specialists with even greater confidence in Librela.\nWe are encouraged by recent trends showing signs of stabilization, supported by strong satisfaction among the majority of pet owners, giving us confidence in the actions we're taking to support recovery and then how we're applying those learnings to future launches. To that end, we are excited about the first market approval of Lenivia, a distinct long-acting molecule for dog that offers greater choice and flexibility for veterinarians and pet owners in Canada, with a launch expected there in the first half of 2026.\nWe also received a positive CVMP opinion recommending marketing authorization in Europe. In addition to that, we received European approval for Portela, our long-acting monoclonal antibody for feline OA pain with the launch also expected in the first half of 2026, further extending our leadership in chronic pain management across species. These milestones highlight the durable strength of our innovation engine and our ability to advance a deep pipeline from approvals through launch and we anticipate a major new market approval each year for the next several years. Together, Librela, Lenivia, Solensia and Portela for a next-generation OA pain portfolio, unmatched in its depth and scientific innovation, offering flexibility, reaching a broader patient population and reinforcing the long-term growth trajectory of this important and underpenetrated market.\nTo enable growth in this expanding portfolio, we're continuing to invest in manufacturing excellence including our new Atlanta Advanced Biologics facility and expanded monocle antibody production capability, ensuring that every innovation we bring to market reaches veterinarians and pet owners with a [indiscernible] viability and scale they expect from Zoetis. Beyond our product portfolio, we're evolving our U.S. commercial structure to better serve customers and enhance our agility and efficiency building on the strength of our key companion animal franchises and the critical role in veterinary practices.\nAs the U.S. pet market expands, expectations for more personalized convenience and enhanced care continue to rise. To better meet those needs, we're implementing a go-to-market model that sharpens our focus and simplify our structure. The result will be a leaner, more agile field organization with single point of contact coverage, expanding our reach and frequency and deepening engagement with our customers. We expect this model will support growth and bolster our competitive positioning, and we will continue evaluating opportunities for similar enhancements across the business into 2026, ensuring we continue delivering the best experience for customers and the strongest value for shareholders. We look forward to sharing updates on our progress.\nIn livestock, organic operational revenue grew 10% in the quarter, reflecting broad-based growth across geographies and species, and we're on track for a third consecutive year of above-market growth in 2025 supported by strong execution and resilient market demand. As an example, poultry continues to benefit from focus and vaccine-led growth following the MFA divestiture with deeper penetration among key accounts, market expansion and growing adoption of Procerta across multiple regions. This progress reflects the strength of our strategy, advancing innovation strengthening partnerships and ensuring our portfolio meets the evolving needs of producers worldwide.\nRising protein consumption and the growing role of fish in the global food supply continue to reinforce the long-term fundamentals of this business. And beyond strong performance, we continue to live our purpose through innovation, demonstrated by the speed and effectiveness of our response to emerging zoonotic diseases including recent approvals related to HPAI and New World screwworm.\nTurning to guidance. We are updating our full year outlook based on our year-to-date performance and expectations for the remainder of the year. For organic operational revenue, we're revising and narrowing our range to 5.5% to 6.5%, given a more measured view of the macro and operational environment in the back half of the year. We're also narrowing our organic operational adjusted net income growth range to 5.5% to 7%, supported by continued cost discipline with a balanced approach to investment that enables us to sustain strong profitability and deliver shareholder value even amid near-term variability.\nOverall, we have the right portfolio, the right strategy and deep connections with customers and pet owners, positioning us not only to navigate the current environment but to capture the significant opportunities ahead. And we're delivering on the commitments we've made since outlining our innovation time line in January, we've executed on or ahead of schedule.\nWe are continuing to differentiate our portfolio with more than 130 geographic expansion and life cycle innovations this year, several of which you can see in today's slides. Our ability to deliver on our commitments continues to define Zoetis and position us to create significant value for shareholders. It's how we build trust year after year with customers, colleagues and investors alike. We are confident that Zoetis has the most robust comprehensive pipeline in animal health, advancing care across every category and stage, powered by innovation and purpose, we're shaping the future of animal health and creating entirely new categories of care.\nAnd with that in mind, as we announced yesterday, Rob Polzer, our Head of R&D, will retire following a 10-year distinguished career at Zoetis, advancing our innovative pipeline. We are grateful for Roth's incredible contributions. Rob will remain in his role until the end of the year and following his retirement at the end of February will be available to Zoetis as a scientific adviser until the end of 2026, ensuring a smooth transition and continued momentum for Zoetis' pipeline.\nWe are excited to appoint Kevin Esch as Rob's successor, effective January 1. Kevin has held a series of influential roles in our R&D organization over the last decade and is ready to step in and lead Zoetis' R&D into the future. Kevin has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to advancing animal health. Before joining Zoetis, Kevin was a practicing veterinarian and practice owner for more than 10 years and has a strong scientific background with formal training in public health, immunobiology and pathology.\nI hope you'll join us on Tuesday, December 2 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time for an innovation webcast where we will provide investors with the latest pipeline updates and the progress we're making to move the industry forward with a resilient business and unmatched pipeline and significant market potential, we remain confident in Zoetis' long-term growth trajectory.\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristen, and hello, everyone. Let me now provide some additional insights into our third quarter results. We posted $2.4 billion in revenue in the third quarter, growing 1% on a reported basis and 4% on an organic operational basis. This was primarily driven by price as volume was flat in the quarter. As Kristin noted, we anticipated that growth would moderate as we entered the second half of the year. Adjusted net income of $754 million was 5% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic operational basis.\nOur global companion animal portfolio posted revenue of $1.7 billion growing 2% operationally in the quarter. On an operational basis, our Simparica franchise contributed $356 million, growing 7% and key dermatology posted $469 million, growing 3%. This growth was partially offset by our or pain franchise, which declined 11% operationally to $138 million. Our global livestock portfolio grew 10% on an organic operational basis in the quarter, contributing $725 million in revenue with strong balanced performance across segments and species.\nAgain, these results reflect the continued resilience of our business following last year's strong comparison, and they reaffirmed the solid fundamentals driving our growth. Even amid near-term challenges, our core strengths market-leading innovation, a diversified global portfolio in trusted brands continue to position us well for future growth and market expansion.\nNow moving on to our Q3 segment results. As expected, growth moderated in the U.S. as we enter the second half of the year, with revenue down 2% on a reported basis and up 3% on an organic operational basis. Companion animal was flat and livestock grew 14% on an organic operational basis. This moderation primarily reflects the strong comparable period in companion animal, particularly in derm and parasiticides. In the vet channel, we continue to believe clinic revenue is more impactful to our growth than overall visits.\nThat said, we saw declining visits across all major therapeutic areas during the third quarter, which impacted new patient starts. Meanwhile, the distributor inventory dynamics we discussed earlier in the quarter, normalized by quarter end and remain near the low end of the [indiscernible]. The U.S. companion animal business was flat in the quarter with growth in our Simparica and key dermatology franchises, offset by declines in our OA pain meds. Our Simparica franchise grew 2% in the quarter to $263 million in revenue.\nOur performance builds off a strong comparable period in the prior year where we saw 27% operational growth, driven by a more disciplined approach to our promotional strategy. Growth in alternative channels continues, fueled by pet owner preference and higher compliance. This strength has helped sustain Simparica Trio's momentum despite continued softness in the U.S. vet channel. As the leader in triple combination parasiticides, the fastest-growing segment in animal health, Simperica Trio is well positioned for continued growth. driven by our first-mover advantage, world label and strong market presence.\nKey dermatology sales grew 1% to $306 million, with growth in Apoquel being partially offset by declines in [indiscernible] due to lower dermatology clinic visits. Our growth in the quarter primarily reflects the impact of the initial distributor stocking of the Apoquel film-coated tablet, which was made available to distribution in September. In addition to a strong comparable period in the prior year, we saw modest share loss in the U.S. derm space, primarily driven by competitive discounting and sampling related to new product launches.\nBased on our experience, these impacts are typically short-lived, and we remain confident in the value of dermatology portfolio provides to vets and pet owners and that our pricing aligns with the quality and outcomes we deliver. We are well positioned to grow and expand the dermatology market moving forward, anchored by our 3 differentiated brands with a proven track record of safety and efficacy and an estimated 11 million medicalized dogs that remain untreated or undertreated for itch in the U.S. alone.\nOur OA pain products saw a decline of 21% in the U.S. on $58 million in sales. Librela posted $41 million in revenue for the quarter, a decline of 26% versus Q3 of last year. Kristen highlighted our multipronged strategy to return Librela to growth and we are confident that the actions we are taking will help reaccelerate adoption. Additionally, I will echo that we are seeing early signs that Librela is beginning to stabilize. While this is an early read, we continue to see high satisfaction scores among vets and pet owners who use level, reflecting the meaningful and positive impact this product has on those living with OA.\nSolensia revenue of $17 million declined 4% in the quarter. Despite the decline in this quarter driven by fewer new patient starts, we remain optimistic about the untapped market potential of the fee line OA space. where currently only 15% of effective cats are receiving treatment. Our U.S. Livestock business posted broad-based organic operational growth of 14%, with almost all major brands showing improvement in the quarter. Our performance was primarily driven by improved supply of setter. Additionally, as Kristin mentioned, we have seen an acceleration in our lifelike vaccines, both MSA divestiture due to increased field force focus.\nMoving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic operational basis. Companion animal grew 4% operationally, and Livestock grew 8% on an organic operational basis. International companion animal growth was driven by our Simparica and key dermatology franchise. Our international Simparica franchise grew 22% operationally or $93 million in revenue with double-digit growth across both brands. Simparica Trio grew 32% operationally to $41 million in sales bolstered by an increasing standard of care in many international markets. Simparica grew 15% operationally to $52 million in sales.\nGrowth remains strong, especially in markets that have not yet adopted triple combinations will then have low hardware equivalence. Our key dermatology franchise grew 7% on an operational basis, posting $162 million in revenue, driven by both Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth was driven primarily by Europe, where we continue to see expansion in new patients and increased compliance in chronic cases. While we saw a share loss to competitors in certain international markets, these declines like those in the U.S. are losses driven by launch promotions. We continue to see significant room for expansion in our international markets and remain confident in our differentiated franchise of products continuing to be first-line treatment.\nOur OA pain mAbs declined 3% operationally in international markets on $80 million in revenue. International Librela sales were $62 million, down 6% operationally in the quarter. As Kristin highlighted, we continue to see perception challenges primarily in English-speaking countries and are implementing many of the same U.S. tactics to return to growth. Solensia sales grew 9% operationally to $18 million. Solensia's adoption continues to expand as the product redefines the standard of care for free line osteoarthritis, supported by strong and sustained vet satisfaction.\nWe are excited about the recent European approval of our long-acting feline OA pain mAb, Portela. Portela's extended dosing interval delivers meaningful quality of life benefits for cat and pet owners alike, aiming to drive stronger treatment compliance. International livestock grew 8% on an organic operational basis in the quarter, with broad-based growth across all species. In cattle, growth was driven by both price and volume across the portfolio.\nPoultry continues to benefit from focus and execution on vaccine growth. Additionally, we saw increased key account penetration across most geographies. Finally, Fish was driven by price increases as producers recognize the value our products provide in driving healthier fish and lower mortality rates contributing to higher yields.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 71.6% grew 90 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 20 basis points. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, we saw higher margins due to favorable impact of our MFA divestiture as well as benefits from price. Adjusted operating expenses increased by a modest 1% operationally, reflecting our ongoing commitment to cost discipline in a dynamic and inflationary environment.\nAdjusted net income grew 5% operationally and 9% on an organic operational basis. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally in the quarter and 12% on an organic operational basis.\nNow moving to guidance for the full year 2025. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October and does not assume any impact of future tariffs or policy changes. We are revising our full year revenue guidance to a range of $9.4 billion and $9.475 billion and organic operational growth of 5.5% to 6.5%. It's on a more measured view of macro and operational trends in the back half of the year. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $2.8.4 billion, reflecting a narrowed organic operational growth range of 5.5% to 7%.\nFinally, we are maintaining our reported diluted and adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $5.90 to $6 and $6.30 to $6.40, respectively. We are operating from a position of strength, supported by the broadest portfolio in the industry, even while we are navigating some temporary headwinds. We remain confident in the long-term growth potential of both our business and the broader animal health market.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2025 earnings call. Thanks to the dedication of our colleagues around the world. We delivered strong broad-based 8% organic operational revenue growth, a reflection of the strength of our innovation engine and the excellence of our customer-focused execution. We also grew adjusted net income 10% on an organic operational basis, underscoring our focus on operational efficiency.\nOur International segment grew organic operational revenue 9%, demonstrating our ability to capitalize on key trends that are expanding regional markets. The U.S. grew 7%, excluding the impact of the MFA divestiture. Companion animal grew 8% operationally, while livestock delivered 6% organic operational growth, driven by sustained demand for our trusted, market-leading solutions. This quarter's performance highlights the strength of our diversified portfolio, with growth across markets, species, franchises and channels, and balanced contributions from price and volume, a testament to our strategy.\nWith organic operational revenue of 9% in the first half, we are delivering in line with our plan and are well positioned to carry that progress into the second half. Our consistent performance across economic and competitive cycles reinforces the strength of our business and Animal health as one of the most compelling long-term growth sectors. Key franchises collectively delivered an order of double-digit performance, underscoring not only their continued momentum, but also the power of our innovation and the disciplined execution that drives value across the business.\nAs you look closer at our companion animal growth drivers, it's clear that innovation is not only our core competency. It's the most powerful way we live our purpose. And what's equally clear, our key franchises have significant runway for continued durable growth. Our Simparica franchise, for example, grew 17% operationally, even after nearly 2 years of competition. Demand continues to rise for comprehensive triple combination protection, the fastest-growing segment in the parasiticide market or Simparica Trio is setting the standard of care, delivering 20% operational revenue growth.\nWith new entrants, the overall category continues to expand, fueled in part by increased promotional activity that is raising awareness of the benefits of triple combination protection. Thanks to our first mover [indiscernible] strong commercial relationships and preferred position with key veterinary partners, these efforts are often reinforcing our leadership. Trio remains the trusted first choice for veterinarians and pet owners alike.\nIn this franchise, our alternative channel strategy, especially in the U.S. the largest market for parasiticides remains a key source of diversification and differentiation, helping us meet customers where they are and driving stronger compliance by ensuring pet owners have convenient ongoing access to trusted products. We expect these dynamics to continue for the foreseeable future. More than 10 years since launch and with over 12 million dogs treated, our key dermatology franchise continues to deliver, growing 11% operationally, a testament to how durable true innovation can be. This quarter's performance was fueled by particularly strong results internationally, where we are seeing increased uptake among new patients and higher compliance.\nWhat continues to set this franchise apart is its depth and versatility. We didn't just create the derm category, we continue to expand it with complementary treatment options that address a range of needs. Apoquel Chew provides added flexibility for pet owners, while Cytopoint is a convenient injectable solution for longer lasting relief. Together, these modalities help personalize care, improve compliance and deliver high satisfaction reducing the likelihood of switching and supporting durable franchise performance. Even after a decade, we see meaningful runway ahead, driven by 2 powerful dynamics. The continued importance of compliance in chronic disease management and the opportunity to reach more than $20 million remain under or untreated today.\nOur confidence is grounded in what sets us apart. We lead through science, designing solutions that address the most persistent needs in animal health and establishing a standard of care that's not easily surpassed. And as we shared earlier this year, we're confident not only in our market-leading differentiated portfolio today, but in the portfolio of the future already taking shape. In osteoarthritis or OA pain, Librela [indiscernible] 7% operationally this quarter. We are actively advancing efforts to accelerate adoption grounded in both the scale of the opportunity and the positive patient impact we continue to see.\nIn the U.S. alone, 27 million dogs suffer from OA yet only 9 million are currently treated and today, we are reaching just 1 million of them. As with any breakthrough innovation that establishes a new standard of care, adoption rarely follows a straight line. That's why we're taking deliberate steps to develop the market, educating veterinarians and pet owners to ensure a clear understanding of the product's benefit risk profile and the elastin confidence. In fact, more than 75 prints of U.S. patients past and present report being extremely or very satisfied with Librela's results. Shaping a new market takes time, but we remain confident in our ability to deliver over the long term. We see significant potential in Librela, and we'll continue to invest in unlocking it because the need for chronic pain relief is significant, persistent and lead personal for our customers.\nIt also reflects how we're thinking more broadly about sustaining growth through continued innovation, access and differentiation. Globally, across these franchises, more pain unaddressed than treated and in many cases, the opportunity to expand care exceeds the current market, particularly outside the U.S., where rising pet ownership and medicalization are fueling demand for therapies that support longer, healthier lives, including among aging COVID pets. In livestock, demand for our portfolio remains strong with 6% organic operational revenue growth, led by double-digit gains internationally. Across species, this business remains an important driver, reflecting multiple years of strong execution and above-market performance.\nBroader industry dynamics, including [indiscernible] protein consumption continued to reinforce the long-term fundamentals. This quarter, we also advanced our pipeline with the conditional license of our Avian Influenza Vaccine for use in lactating dairy cattle in the U.S. While the revenue impact is limited, it reflects our longer-term focus, a company both on purpose and powered by innovation. Altogether, these results highlight the strength and diversity of our portfolio, driving consistent performance from multiple sources of varying market conditions.\nBased on our strong first half performance and what we see in the current macro environment, we are raising our full year guidance for organic operational revenue growth to 6.5% to 8%. We are also raising our guidance for organic operational growth in adjusted net income to 5.5% to 7.5%, reflective of continued discipline in execution and cost management. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to deliver our full year commitments, supported by durable industry trends and our ability to adapt and execute with focus.\nOur consistent performance across economic cycles and competitive dynamics reflects the strength of our business, the breadth of our portfolio and our commitment to delivering differentiated value. That resilience is grounded in the strength of our global manufacturing and commercial capabilities, enabling us to deliver reliably, scale effectively and support our customers across geographies and market conditions. As we look to the second half of the year, our focus remains clear, execute with discipline, advance meaningful innovation and stayed deeply connected to the needs of our customers.\nWith the portfolio build to solve real-world challenges and a pipeline aimed at raising the standard of care, we are well positioned to lead not just to the markets we serve today, but in shaping the future of Animal Health. Thank you for your continued support.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Wetteny to walk through the financials. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, we posted $2.5 billion in revenue growing 4% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the MFA investiture. Adjusted net income of $783 million grew 10% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic operational basis. Our organic operational revenue growth was down driven by 4% price and 4% volume.\nOur performance highlights are diverse and differentiated portfolio with strong growth across species, geographies and channels. This broad-based growth underscores our ability to compete and win across the markets in which we operate, and to generate durable returns in the face of competition and in challenging macroeconomic environments. Our companion animal portfolio posted $1.8 billion in revenue growing 8% operationally. Globally, on an operational basis, our Simparica franchise contributed $448 million, growing 17% and key dermatology posted $460 million, growing 11%. Our global lifestyle portfolio contributed organic operational growth of 6% on $638 million in revenue.\nOur lifestyle business has outperformed our expectations thus far this year, growing 7% on an organic operational basis year-to-date compared to low single-digit market growth projections. This also marks the fifth consecutive quarter of organic operational lifestyle growth above 5%. We signaling good momentum that we expect to continue through the remainder of the year.\nNow moving on to our Q2 segment results. U.S. revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic operational basis. Companion animal with 9% and last stock declined 2% on an organic operational basis. The U.S. companion animal business was driven by the performance of Simparica and key dermatology franchises, partially offset by a decline in sales of our OA pain mAbs. We have seen [indiscernible] activity improved throughout the quarter versus the lows in February. And as expected, our business continues to grow above the market despite increasing competition across 2 of our key franchises. Both our Simparica and key dermatology franchises benefited from strong alternative channel sales in the quarter.\nIn addition to organic growth above the vet channel, we also saw tailwinds from certain retailers increasing their presence in this space. This increased presence will further expand the attractiveness of alternative channels that more and more pet owners are choosing for product fulfillment. Our Simparica franchise grew 18% in the quarter on $329 million in revenue. Despite intense competition, Simparica Trio has not experienced year-over-year patient share loss since competition launched almost 2 years ago. During this time, we have seen triple combination share in vet practices expand from 30% to 45%. In our retail channel sales, which drive significantly better compliance and stickiness have more than doubled. In [indiscernible] remains the market leader in the triple combination space and the largest product in the largest therapeutic area in animal health.\nKey dermatology sales were $307 million, growing 9% with growth across both Apoquel and Cytopoint, with growth coming more from bottom than price. We continue to see minimal patient share impact due to competition. We see the strongest growth in our Apoquel Chewable formulation, which provides easier administration than a film-coated tablets and remains differentiated from competitive entrants. Lastly, as a reminder, we saw growth headwinds from the empire initial Apoquel Chewable stocking order in the prior year. This impact offsets the new retail stocking tailwinds I noted earlier.\nAdditionally, our combined OA pain mAbs declined 12% in the U.S. this quarter on $62 million in sales. The wells declined 16% on $45 million in revenue. As noted last quarter, our ramp-up for Librela in the U.S. has not gone according to expectations with headwinds impacting product adoption and creating barriers for recommendations. As Kristin mentioned, our demand generation efforts remain focused on education to help vet and pet owners overcome perceived safety concerns with Librela.\nAdditionally, we are working on Phase IV study to reaffirm the safety and efficacy of Librela when compared to alternative treatments such as NSAIDs. These efforts will help our return to sustained growth and accelerate our trajectory. We remain confident in Librela long term.\nSolencia declined 3% from $17 million in sales for the quarter. Organic operational declines of 2% in U.S. livestock are primarily driven by the timing of supply of [indiscernible]. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic operational basis. Companion animal grew 8% operationally and large stock grew 3% on an organic operational basis. International companion animal growth was driven by our key dermatology and Simparica franchises. Our key dermatology franchise grew 5% operationally, posting $153 million in revenue internationally with strong performance across both Apoquel and Cytopoint.\nOur growth has been largely driven by the efforts of our field force who have been instrumental in driving high engagement with our key corporate accounts. This has continued to expand the market in new patient adoption as well as improved clients, especially in chronic cases. We continue to see preference for our differentiated products, Apoquel Chew and Cytopoint, both of which offer benefits in ease of administration and compliance compared to alternatives. Our International Simparica franchise grew 16% operationally on $119 million in sales with double-digit growth across both brands. Both brands continue to be among the fastest-growing [indiscernible] brands across international markets gaining share despite growing competition.\nSimparica Trio grew 22% internationally on $55 million in sales. Similar to what we are seeing in the U.S., where less than half of dogs prescribed a parasiticide by vet are currently receiving triples, many international markets have not yet adopted triple combinations as a standard of care, with 30% of our top 10 markets doing less than $1 million in Trio sales this quarter. This represents a continued opportunity for market expansion for Simparica [indiscernible]. Simparica contributed $64 million in sales, growing 12% operationally. Our growth in both brands has benefited from strong key account relationships, driving stickiness among competitive conversion as well as increased utilization and expansion of the oral parasiticide market.\nInternationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 4% operationally on $83 million in combined revenue. International sales of Librela were $64 million, growing 1% on an operational basis. Despite high vet confidence in Librela and international markets, we are seeing impact to new patient starts from social media headwinds, particularly in English-speaking markets. We have begun echoing our U.S. efforts international and to address these concerns.\nSolensia sales were $19 million, growing 17% operationally in the quarter. We have seen high satisfaction and balanced growth across key markets and expansion into Latin America and Asian markets. International lifestyle grew 10% on an organic operational basis in the quarter, with growth across all of our core species. Performance was driven by swine, partly due to tailwinds from China, which are timing related and will gradually normalize in subsequent quarters as well as vaccine growth in Latin America. Additionally, saw strong performance in our Fish portfolio driven by high demand for our vaccines across both Norway and Chile. Poultry growth came primarily from vaccine performance in the Middle East and Asia driven by increased focus on vaccines after our MFA divestiture. Our cattle business benefited from price contributions, particularly in high inflationary markets.\nNow moving on to the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 73.7% grew 200 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 130 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to favorable impact of our MFA divestiture as well as benefits from price. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs in line with our expectations, which have been improving as we work through inventory valued at prior year standards. [indiscernible] operating expenses increased by 5% operationally. Growth was primarily driven by SG&A increases of 6% operationally, mainly due to the timing of advertising and promotion spend as well as higher compensation-related expenses.\nOperational R&D growth was 1% in the quarter, with higher compensation-related expenses, partially offset by lower project spend primarily due to timing. Adjusted net income grew 7% operationally and 10% on an organic operational basis. Adjusted diluted EPS was 9% operationally in the quarter and 13% on an organic operational basis.\nNow moving to guidance for full year 2025. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July. Consistent with last quarter, our guidance does not include any impact of future tariffs or policy changes. The impact of currently enacted and assumptions on announced tariffs on our business is slightly higher than our estimate as of our May guidance update. However, we feel we can absorb the incremental impact. For the year, we are guiding revenue between $9.45 billion and $9.6 billion and reaching our organic operational growth to a range of 6.5% to 8% and based on our strong first half performance.\nWhile our first half organic operational revenue growth of 9% is above our guidance range, we have highlighted all year that our guidance is reflective of headwinds from launch-related competitive impacts in the second half of the year. There is still significant uncertainty on the timing of these events. Despite these temporary headwinds, we still see significant room for growth long term. We have been pleased with the growth of our Simparica in dermatology franchises despite headwinds in pain and reiterate our expectation that these combined innovative franchises will grow double digits in 2025. This commitment, although the strength we have seen in our lifestyle business highlight the revenue diversity that is fundamental to our continued above-market growth. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.825 billion to $2.875 billion, reflecting operational growth of 5.5% to 7.5% on a [ GAAP ] rational basis.\nThe increase in our expected adjusted net income is driven by improved margin expectations due primarily to lower manufacturing costs, the higher revenue outlook and expense management, partially offset by the increased impact of tariffs. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.40 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.\nConsistent with prior guidance, our EPS projections are based on current share counts and do not consider the future favorable impact of our ongoing share repurchase debt. The first half of the year has not been without its challenges. We have navigated tariffs on uncertain macro environment, competitive pressures and challenges with Librela. Through all of this, we have driven gross portfolio growth above our expectations that has given us the confidence to raise our guidance. As we progress into the back half of the year, we are confident in our ability to meet our commitments as we have done time and again.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Hosting the call today is Steven Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of the call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.\n[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, May 6, 2025. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2025 earnings call. By staying laser-focused on delivering for our customers, our colleagues drove strong 9% organic operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income 6% on an organic operational basis. Our International segment led with 11% organic operational revenue growth, highlighting our global scale and diversification, while the U.S. grew 6%, excluding the impact of the MFA divestiture.\nGrowth was balanced across [indiscernible]. Our innovative companion animal portfolio grew 9% operationally, fueled by sustained demand for our diverse market-leading franchises. Livestock grew 7% on an organic operational basis, driven by broad-based double-digit performance internationally.\nBefore we go deeper into the quarter, I want to briefly address what is top of mind for many of you. In today's operating environment, the essential nature of our business remains clear. Animals provide companionship and nourishment, and in uncertain times, people will rely on both. It's precisely because of the enduring secular trends and the fundamentals underpinning our innovation-led operating model that Zoetis has consistently proven its resilience even through economic turbulence.\nThat resilience is embedded in how we operate from our global footprint and diverse durable portfolio across species and geographies to our omnichannel presence, matrix manufacturing network and talented field force, combined, those dynamics ensure we're operating from a position of strength as we navigate a fluid environment shaped by macroeconomic, regulatory and geopolitical uncertainty.\nWe are managing these challenges thoughtfully, working to minimize their impact while also seizing opportunities where they exist, so we can continue delivering for our customers, colleagues and shareholders. That means executing our strategy with discipline, supported by a strong balance sheet, operational excellence, thoughtful and strategic capital allocation and experienced leadership team ready to adapt as needed. Most importantly, we continue to prioritize what matters most, living our purpose and ensuring our products reach the people and animals who depend on them.\nWith that context, let's pivot back to the quarter. While our performance reflects the strength of our diverse multi-levered strategy, I'll touch on a few of the key growth drivers. In companion animal, our combined key franchises grew double digits operationally, fueled by exceptional performance in our International segment, where our trusted brands, even after several years on the market, continue to grow by winning new patients and improving compliance with significant runway to further define the standard of care and deliver meaningful outcomes.\nIn parasiticides, our Simparica franchise continues to expand the overall category and is gaining share, driven by our omnichannel strategy, meeting customers where they are, whether in the clinic through retail, where Simparica Trio is the top-selling parasiticide in the U.S. or via home delivery. As you've heard us say, we are seeing increased conversion to broad-spectrum triple combinations, setting us up for an even longer-term growth tailwind. Together, these dynamics positions us well to continue leading through innovation, most recently with Simparica Trio U.S. label expansion to include flea tapeworm protection.\nSimilarly, key dermatology has consistently been a high-growth category built on innovation, customer trust and a portfolio that remains the preferred choice for treating allergic itch. Through years of investment and strong partnerships, we have built brand loyalty and established a clear leadership position. We continue to leverage our first-mover advantage by capitalizing on the breadth of our portfolio to grow and sustain share in a dynamic environment.\nWe remain focused on what we can control: execution, innovation and customer experience, and we are winning with customers every day. Demand for our portfolio remains strong, fueled by the convenience and the unmatched flexibility we provide to vets and pet owners through our 3 differentiated products. At the same time, an estimated 20 million dogs still untreated or undertreated for itch. Advances in diagnostics are helping unlock this opportunity, enabling broader access, earlier intervention and better outcomes. That's why we're confident in the enduring strength of this franchise and our ability to continue leading.\nAnd similarly, building on our track record of scientific innovation, our osteoarthritis pain franchise marks a meaningful advancement in care, delivering strong double-digit growth and approximately 25 million doses distributed globally. While adoption has been more gradual than initially expected, we are encouraged by the foundation we are laying and the long-term potential ahead. We are building and scaling a new category of care, one that requires significant education and engagement. Both veterinarians and pet owners need time and support to fully understand the safety and efficacy profile of newer, more advanced treatments for chronic pain. And in this economic environment, we're seeing pet owners take a more measured approach to managing chronic conditions, making choices that reflect broader consumer spending trends, which could include adjustments to timing or frequency of care.\nThat said, we see the impact of these therapies every day. They are safe, effective and improving the quality of life for pets and the people who care for them. To accelerate adoption, improve access and grow the OA pain market, we are taking focused strategic actions. We are expanding medical education for veterinarians and partnering with key opinion leaders to shape best practices. We're investing in and plan to leverage post-launch studies to generate additional real-world insights for vets. We are engaging directly with pet owners to increase education on the burden of OA pain and the long-term value of treatment. And we are launching 360 campaigns, including targeted direct-to-consumer efforts to build awareness and demand. So uptake may be slower in the near term, our long-term confidence remains strong as we build a durable, differentiated market with significant room to grow, especially given the sizable and underpenetrated opportunity ahead.\nIn livestock, we delivered strong performance with 7% organic operational growth. Through the sale of our MFA portfolio, we consistently reaffirmed our commitment to livestock and our customers because what makes Zoetis unique and reliable is the diversity and durability of our business model.\nRegardless of portfolio mix, one thing is true. People need to eat and global demand for animal protein will continue to rise. That's why we continue to invest in solutions that protect the health of food-producing animals and safeguard supply chains.\nSince reporting our results in February, we received conditional licensure from the USDA for avian influenza vaccine for chickens, ensuring we are ready to support customers and regulators wherever the path leads in addressing this evolving threat. And it's during periods of uncertainty that execution matters most. Our experience enables us to rise to the occasion, to stay focused, stay ready and continue delivering solutions where and when they are needed most.\nAs we look to the rest of the year, we're encouraged by our first quarter performance and the steady demand for our products, along with the resilience we've consistently seen across the animal health industry. We are maintaining our full year organic operational revenue guidance range of 6% to 8%, reflecting confidence in the differentiation of our portfolio and our ability to execute in the current environment.\nWhile the operating backdrop remains unpredictable, we believe this range appropriately reflects what we know today, and we will remain agile in navigating new uncertainties and embracing new opportunities. At the same time, based on our current estimates of enacted tariff-related cost impacts, we are updating our full year organic operational adjusted net income to a range of 5% to 7%. And just to clarify, our outlook does not include any potential impact from future tariffs as it's still too early to know how the situation will unfold.\nAnd with that, I will close with this. The performance we shared today reflects the dedication of our colleagues around the world, living our purpose, being a trusted solutions provider to our customers and delivering results through their relentless focus. Uncertainty is top of mind for everyone, but it's not unique to Zoetis. What sets us apart is how we respond. Zoetis has consistently leveraged its innovation-led, customer-first operating model to outperform the market and deliver value for both customers and shareholders. We remain vigilant and agile. We'll draw on our experience navigating complexity, stay clear-eyed in our decision-making and continue moving forward with discipline.\nWe are confident in the strength of our portfolio, in the promise of our pipeline, in our ability to adapt. Most of all, we're confident in the commitment of our teams around the world to lead through change and continue delivering for our customers and shareholders. because ultimately, what we do matters for the well-being of animals, people and communities. That's why animal health is both essential and resilient, an industry fueled by long-term demand and rising expectations for high-quality care. And as a global leader, we recognize our responsibility to lead today and well into the future.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Wetteny to walk us through the more detailed financials. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristen. In the first quarter, driven by balanced portfolio growth, we posted $2.2 billion in revenue, growing 1% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic operational basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and the MFA divestiture. Our organic operational growth was driven by 4% price and 5% volume. Adjusted net income of $662 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic operational basis.\nOur companion animal portfolio led the way with $1.5 billion in revenue, growing 9% operationally. Globally and on an operational basis, our Simparica franchise contributed $367 million, growing 19%, key dermatology posted $387 million, growing 10% and our OAPayMAbs reported $147 million, growing 15% in the quarter. Our livestock portfolio also contributed organic operational growth of 7% on $645 million in revenue.\nNow moving on to our Q1 segment results. U.S. revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 6% on an organic operational basis in the quarter, with companion animal growing 8% and livestock declining 2% on an organic operational basis. In companion animal, U.S. growth was driven by our 3 key franchises, while vaccines faced headwinds from supply timing, coupled with competitor reentry.\nAcross the portfolio, alternative channel sales continued to outpace the vet channel, offering greater convenience for pet owners, improving compliance and stickiness. Driven by strong growth in autoship programs that boost compliance and increase the lifetime value of each dog on treatment, our Simparica franchise posted 17% U.S. growth this quarter on $260 million in revenue. Additional competitive entrants are accelerating the market shift to triple combinations, where we continue to gain share, thanks to the strength of our field force, our first-mover advantage and ongoing innovation, including expanded label claims.\nIn key dermatology, sales were $249 million, up 7% with growth across both Apoquel and Cytopoint, while also reflecting the comparison to last year's initial distribution stocking of Apoquel Chewable. Apoquel growth continues to be driven by the retail channel and continued conversion to the chewable, which is easier to administer and promotes daily compliance.\nOur OA pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $65 million in U.S. sales, growing 14% Librela grew 17% on $47 million in revenue, and Solensia posted $18 million in revenue, growing 7%. To reiterate Kristin's point, building a new category of care takes time, but we remain confident in the sizable market potential.\nOur foundation is solid and record penetration confirms that veterinarians want better OA solutions.\nOrganic operational declines of 2% in livestock are primarily driven by declines in DRAXXIN due to aggressive price competition and the timing of price adjustments in the prior year as well as the timing of supply of SepsiFure.\nMoving on to our International segment. Revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 11% on an organic operational basis. Companion animal grew 10% operationally and livestock grew 12% on an organic operational basis. Similar to the U.S., international companion animal sales were driven by strong performance in our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises.\nOur international Simparica franchise, including Simparica and Simparica Trio grew 23% operationally on $106 million in sales, with both brands driving strong market share gains. Simparica grew 22% operationally on $61 million in sales, driven by expansion of the combination parasiticide market, especially in Latin America and Eastern Europe.\nSimparica Trio contributed $46 million, growing 26% operationally with strong performance across all regions. Our key dermatology franchise delivered $138 million in revenue, up 15% operationally with double-digit growth in both Apoquel and Cytopoint. Our performance was driven by field force engagement with vets, leading to new patient starts and improved compliance, especially among chronic cases.\nAs Kristin highlighted, we're executing globally on our key derm strategic priorities. We continue to show strong progress driven by continued conversion of Apoquel Chewable, which now accounts for 57% of doses in Europe. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 16% operationally, posting $82 million in combined revenue. International sales of Librela were $65 million, growing 14% operationally.\nOur international efforts have had a significant head start over the U.S. as we enter our fifth year in some markets. We continue to drive double-digit sales growth and expand both the market and our share.\nSolensia sales were $18 million, growing 27% operationally in the quarter. Solensia holds over half of the feline OA market share in international markets, underscoring the strong demand for an OA solution for cats.\nInternational livestock grew 12% on an organic operational basis in the quarter. Growth was driven by higher price, including some impacts from high inflationary markets. Volume growth, excluding the impact of MFAs, was driven by poultry vaccine growth from key account penetration across Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Cattle contributed to growth with a return to a more normal environment in Australia as well as strong demand across much of South America, Canada and Mexico. Our Fitch business saw good vaccine growth across geographies.\nNow moving on to the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 72.1% grew 140 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 220 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw lower margins due to higher manufacturing costs, in line with our expectations and included in our initial guidance in February, which should improve as we work through inventory valued at prior year standards and unfavorable product mix. This was partially offset by the favorable impact of our MFA divestiture.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 3% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by SG&A increases of 4% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation-related expenses and increased direct-to-consumer advertising. R&D declined 2% operationally this quarter due to lower project spend primarily due to timing. Adjusted net income grew 2% operationally and 6% on an organic operational basis. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% operationally in the quarter and 8% on an organic operational basis, 2% higher than adjusted net income and reflective of a lower share count as a result of our ongoing share buybacks.\nBefore we get into guidance, I'll expand on the business impact of the tariff landscape. While the current situation remains fluid, we are well positioned to navigate this dynamic environment. We'll be thoughtful and deliberate in our actions with a clear focus on both near- and long-term goals. We will leverage the diversity of our revenue across geographies and species to seize opportunities for growth, ensure we work to control expenses, price strategically and manage inventory.\nPeople and animals depend on our products, and we will continue to deliver for customers.\nNow moving to guidance for the full year 2025, which reflects continued confidence in our operating model while acknowledging that there will be some profitability impact in the near term due to enacted tariffs. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April.\nFor the year, we are guiding revenue between $9.425 billion and $9.575 billion, with increases due to favorable foreign exchange when compared to the late January rates used in our initial February guidance and maintaining organic operational growth of 6% to 8%. We recognize that there are external factors that are beyond our control. As such, our current guidance does not include any assumed impact of future tariffs, policy changes or further worsening of the macro environment. We continue to expect broad-based operational growth across our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises, and reiterate our expectation that these combined innovative franchises will grow double digits in 2025.\nWe now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.775 billion to $2.825 billion, reflecting operational growth of 5% to 7% on an organic operational basis. Our revised adjusted net income guidance is reflective of the estimated impact of current enacted tariffs while not accounting for any future changes in the tariff landscape.\nLastly, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.30, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.85 to $5.95. This EPS increase is primarily due to favorable foreign exchange compared to the late January rates as well as a reduction in our share count due to share repurchases in the quarter, slightly offset by enacted tariffs.\nAs we indicated in February, our EPS projections are based on current share counts and do not consider the future favorable impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.\nAs we look forward to the remainder of the year, we recognize there is a degree of uncertainty, but we remain confident in our outlook. In the past, our proven diversified model has delivered steady, predictable and meaningful growth through dynamic environments. We lead in 2 attractive end markets with strong fundamentals, have a portfolio of market-leading franchises, a sustainable stream of innovation and a proven track record of execution. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements that actual results could differ materially from those projections.

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Today, thanks to the dedication of our purpose-driven colleagues, we reported an excellent full year results in line with the high end of our November guidance. We delivered double-digit operational revenue growth of 11%, highlighting the strength of our strategy and the enduring demand of our brands and our relentless focus on execution drove broad-based growth across the business.\nIn the U.S., revenue grew 11%, while internationally, we grew 10% operationally, marking significant revenue milestones even in a competitive landscape. Our ability to grow, defend and launch products across markets drove 14% operational revenue growth in our companion animal portfolio alongside solid 5% operational revenue growth for our livestock portfolio, reflecting our commitment to shareholders, adjusted net income grew 15% operationally.\nAs we look ahead to 2025, we are confident that the drivers of our 2024 success are sustainable, positioning us for continued above-market growth in the mid- to high single-digit range for this year and beyond. Our confidence is rooted in the diversity of our business model where multiple growth drivers powered by scientific innovation and commercial excellence works together to create and expand markets. This combination ensures that our market-leading franchises deliver long and, in some cases, decade-long growth tailwinds with significant room for further expansion. While Wetteny will discuss the quarter, I want to highlight some of the drivers that will carry us into 2025.\nOur global comparative franchise grew 28% operationally on the year, even amidst competition. This success is fueled by the ongoing shift for triple combination treatments, a market that has grown over 40% in the past 12 months, currently valued at $2 billion, the global triple combination market pioneered and led by Simparica Trio in the U.S. is projected to more than double to $4.5 billion by 2028. Over 50% of in the U.S. are now on triple combination, a clear signal of the market's trajectory. And veterinarians and pet owners tend to stay with trusted, proven solutions, underscoring the importance of our 3-year first-mover advantage in triple. This dynamic, combined with the strength of our diverse portfolio and robust channel strategy, driving higher compliance and increasing total value per patient, positions us to continue leading in this critical segment.\nOur osteoarthritis or OA pain franchises, including Librela and Solensia grew revenue 80% operationally in 2024. Librela's U.S. launch is the most successful in our history, cementing its blockbuster status in less than 4 quarters and has quickly become the fourth largest product in our U.S. pet care portfolio. As Wetteny mentioned at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January, true disruptive scientific innovation often follows a nonlinear growth trajectory due to the investment, education and market development required to establish entirely new categories of care. Even so, innovations like Librela are revolutionizing the treatment paradigm, offering new hope for pets and their owners. With nearly 25 million doses distributed globally, we have already helped millions of dogs, regain mobility and improve their quality of life. Just as Librela is transforming care for dog, Solensia is doing the same for cats. Now a blockbuster product, Solensia has redefined OA pain management driving a meaningful increase in feline veterinary visits. By encouraging proactive care, Solensia is bridging long-standing gaps in medicalization and strengthening the relationship between cat owners and their veterinarians. This momentum underscores a significant opportunity to drive sustainable growth in the underpenetrated feline segment and demand for future therapies and long-acting formulations.\nIn our key dermatology franchise, we grew revenue 17% operationally for the year. As we shared at JPMorgan, even with over 25 million dogs treated by our differentiated portfolio to curb itch, the total addressable market is projected to grow to $2.5 billion by 2028, an 11% CAGR. That's because there are still 20 million worldwide who remain untreated or undertreated. With a long runway for growth ahead, a diverse, safe and effective portfolio supported by strong customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and future long-acting formulations positions us to lead and expand the market. And at the heart of our success is our commitment to living our purpose each day, to nurture the world in humankind by advancing care for animals. That means as customer preferences evolve, ensuring our treatments are available where and when they are needed while always championing the essential role of veterinarians. This commitment has shaped our omnichannel strategy, meeting customers where they are, whether at the clinics or through alternative channels. As a result, Simparica Trio and Apoquel are the top-selling product in U.S. retail, contributing meaningfully higher compliance. When combining retail and home delivery, approximately 20% of our U.S. pet care portfolio flows through alternative channels, driving growth and expanding the total market. We expect this trend to continue into 2025.\nAt the same time, we continue to educate veterinarians and pet owners on the benefits and availability of our treatments, helping to drive informed decisions and better health outcomes. For the year, our livestock portfolio delivered strong 5% operational revenue growth, exceeding our initial expectations and being at the high end of the historical 2% to 4% annual industry growth range. We achieved this result despite the Q4 divestiture of the Medicated Feed Additives product portfolio and certain water soluble products and related assets. The divestiture was a strategic move to streamline our portfolio, enhance operational focus and prioritize high-growth, high-value areas that align with our long-term strategy. And we remain deeply committed to livestock and to continue to lead with innovative vaccines and life cycle solutions, including antibiotic alternatives and advanced therapies that enhance disease prevention and support sustainability aligned with our core capabilities.\nAs a result of the MFA divestiture, our press release and slides highlight organic operational revenue growth for the full year and fourth quarter, excluding all divested products and adjusted for foreign exchange. Based on this and building on the momentum from 2024, we are guiding to a range of 6% to 8% organic operational revenue growth in 2025, and we'll continue to provide updates on this metric throughout the year. We also expect organic operational growth in adjusted net income in the range of 6% to 8% in 2025.\nExcluding the impact of interest and taxes, we expect bottom line growth of 8% to 10%, reflecting the strength of our business fundamentals and the robust secular trends driving our industry. Our strong underlying performance and financial discipline ensures we remain well positioned to deliver on our value proposition. This guidance underscores the strength of our portfolio and commercial engines as we continue to grow our key franchises. The industry remains essential and resilient, driven by strong underlying demand and the indispensable nature of our work.\nAs we look ahead, we will continue balancing strategic investments in innovation and commercial excellence to sustain our track record of profitable growth and generate long-term value for our shareholders.\nIn 2025, our success will be anchored in the same key drivers that have propelled us over the past decade. We operate in highly attractive end markets, driven by scientific innovation and market-leading franchises. With our global scale, we can launch therapies across geographies and channels, ensuring veterinarians and pet owners has access to the best treatments available. And while the operating environment evolves every year with new entrants, shifting geopolitical dynamics and an evolving regulatory and trade landscape, our agility positions us to navigate these challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Our success is driven by the strength of our strategy, differentiated execution, innovative pipeline, our colleagues and culture.\nThis is evident in our R&D engine, where we expect at least one major approval annually over the next several years with multiple potential blockbusters in our pipeline. These innovations will drive durable, diversified growth across both companion animal and livestock, reinforcing our commitment to addressing unmet needs. Above all, we remain committed to our track record of value creation and delivering performances that outpace the market, positioning Zoetis as a trusted leader in animal health now and in the future. And finally, a sincere thank you to our colleagues whose dedication makes these results possible. And with that, let me turn it over to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin. To echo your enthusiasm, 2024 was an excellent year. Our full year performance reflects broad-based revenue growth across segments, species, price and volume. The foundation of our ability to continually outperform the animal health industry comes from the diversity of our portfolio and the channels and markets in which we lead. For the year, we posted revenue of $9.3 billion, growing 8% on a reported basis and 11% operationally, with 6% driven by price and 5% from volume. We raised our revenue guidance throughout the year and ultimately finished above the high end of our initial range.\nAdjusted net income grew 10% on a reported basis and 15% operationally to $2.7 billion. Global revenue growth was driven by our companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally. Leading the way, our Simparica franchise posted $1.4 billion in revenue on the year, growing 28% operationally. Simparica Trio exceeded $1 billion in revenue globally. Simparica Trio remains the number one selling canine parasiticide in the U.S. and the trusted choice for vets and pet owners. As Kristin mentioned, triple combination treatments are the fastest-growing segment in animal health, and are less than 40% of prescription treatments signaling significant room for continued growth.\nIn OA Pain, we continue to see increased adoption. Librela and Solensia reported combined revenue of $581 million globally for the year, growing 80% operationally. Over a decade since our first launch, our key dermatology franchise posted operational growth of 17%, generating $1.6 billion in revenue. We remain steadfast in our confidence to grow the franchise in the face of competition, and we delivered strong double-digit growth balanced across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. We expect continued market expansion, driven by higher compliance and new patient growth as we have highlighted that a significant portion of this market remains untreated or undertreated.\nLastly, our livestock portfolio also had a strong year with $2.9 billion in revenue or 5% operational revenue growth, driven primarily by price, while volume growth faced headwinds from the MFA divestiture. On an organic operational basis, livestock grew 7%.\nMoving on to segment performance for the year. Both the U.S. and international segments saw impressive double-digit revenue growth. The U.S. posted $5.1 billion in revenue, growing 11% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $4.1 billion, growing 10% operationally for the full year. U.S. growth was led by our companion animal portfolio, which grew 15%, driven by the performance of our Simparica franchise, our OA pain and market expansion across our key dermatology franchise. The Simparica franchise reached nearly $1 billion in revenue, growing 26%. Simparica Trio was a primary growth driver with $918 million in sales, growing 30%. With high vet and pet owner satisfaction, Trio is the leading parasiticide product in the U.S.\nOur ability to grow our volume double digits, while simultaneously taking price by being more targeted in our promotions highlights our first-mover advantage. Our OA pain mAbs reported $271 million in sales in the U.S., growing 197%. In its first full year in the market, Librela generated $201 million in sales and reached blockbuster status in the U.S. market faster than any product in our history, where it is already the first-line choice for severe OA cases.\nWith nearly 40% of dogs suffering from are at some point in their lifetime, we are confident that Librela will be a contributor to growth for years to come. Solensia posted $70 million in U.S. revenue for the year, growing 58%. For the year, Solensia accounted for over 70% of clinic revenue in the feline OA category and has continued to substantially grow the market since launch.\nKey dermatology had an exceptional year, posting growth of 16% on $1.1 billion in sales. As we highlighted, there is a substantial population of untreated or undertreated dogs with derm conditions. Our double-digit volume growth in key dermatology demonstrates our ability to convert those patients to our differentiated portfolio of treatment options and highlights the continued expansion opportunity in the derm space.\nU.S. livestock business declined 1% on the year due to the MFA divestiture, which closed on October 31. Excluding the impact of MFAs, our organic operational U.S. livestock growth was 6%, which was driven by improved supply of\nMoving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 5% on a reported basis and 10% operationally for the year. International performance was favorably impacted by price increases, especially in high inflationary markets, including Argentina, which contributed more than 1.5% to our total company growth for the year. Our international companion animal growth was driven by our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain mAbs franchises. Our Simparica franchise grew 32% operationally to $357 million in international sales. Performance was driven by Simparica, growing 29% operationally to $212 million in sales, driven by performance in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Simparica Trio grew 39% operationally on $145 million in sales, driven by key account growth in Europe, DTC and the positive impact of our Q1 China launch.\nKey dermatology posted revenues of $551 million for the year, growing 18% operationally. Performance was driven by Apoquel through new patient growth, especially in Europe. Cytopoint also contributed with new patient growth and compliance in existing patients. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 34% operationally, posting $310 million in combined revenue. Sales of Librela were $246 million internationally, growing 33% operationally. Solensia sales were $64 million, growing 39% on an operational basis.\nOur International livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally to $1.9 billion in sales for the year, with growth driven by price as well as strong performance in partially offset by headwinds from swine volumes in China.\nMoving on to our Q4 results. In the fourth quarter, we posted $2.3 billion in revenue, growing 5% on a reported basis and 6% operationally, with 5% driven by price and 1% from volume. Excluding the impact of our MFA divestiture, our Q4 organic operational growth was 9% with 4% coming from volume. Adjusted net income of $632 million, grew 11% on a reported basis and 9% operationally. Revenue in the quarter was driven by our innovative companion animalk portfolio. Globally, our Simparica franchise contributed $324 million, growing 21% operationally. Our key dermatology franchise posted $417 million or 11% operational growth and our OA pain mAbs contributed revenue of $150 million, growing 20% operationally in the quarter. Our livestock Lisi portfolio also contributed operational growth of 1% with $726 million in revenue. Livestock organic operational growth in the quarter was 8%. Our global companion animal diagnostics business grew 10% operationally in the quarter on revenues of $96 million.\nNow let's move on to our segment results for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 4% in the quarter, with companion animal growing 7% and livestock declining 8% due to our MFA divestiture. On an organic operational basis, excluding the MFA impact, U.S. revenue grew 8% in the quarter with 12% livestock growth. In companion animal, U.S. performance was driven by growth in our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises. Pet owners continue to seek the higher standard of care offered by our innovative products, and vet clinic revenue remains healthy, growing 7% on an average spend per visit basis despite declining visits overall.\nOur mAbs are driving higher therapeutic visits. Our Simparica franchise posted U.S. growth of 17% with $240 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, led by Simparica Trio. As Kristin highlighted, we expect the triple combination parasiticide market to more than double by 2028, and higher triple combo share amongst puppies is a key indicator of where the market is going. Our key dermatology franchise grew 7% in the quarter, generating $270 million in revenue despite clinic stocking headwind from the Apoquel Chewable launch last year. Derm visits were 4% in the quarter, highlighting the willingness of pet owners to treat itch. Cytopoint was the largest driver of growth, driven by preference for injectable treatments. Apoquel growth continues to be driven by expansion of Apoquel Chewable, benefiting from increased conversion and compliance driven by alternative channels. Our OA pain mAbs with Solensia posted a combined $71 million in U.S. sales in Q4, growing 22%. Our growth in the quarter is reflective of headwinds from initial clinic stocking in Q4 of 2023.\nLibrela, now entering its second year in the market generated $53 million, growing 21% on the quarter and reaching more than 1.2 million patients. We remain confident that the market opportunity is significant. Pain-related vet visits increased 15% in the fourth quarter, highlighting the demand that has propelled Librela, to the fourth largest product in our U.S. business and the most successful launch in animal health history.\nOrganic operational growth in U.S. livestock of 12% was primarily driven by the timing of supply of and volume growth in DRAXXIN.\nMoving on to our International segment for the quarter. Revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 13% operationally and livestock grew 6% operationally. The MFA divestiture did not have a material impact on our international organic operational growth. Our International companion animal portfolio growth was driven by our key dermatology products, our Simparica franchise and our OA pain mAbs. Our key dermatology products grew 19% operationally with sales of $147 million in the quarter. Growth in key dermatology was driven by new patients and increased share for both Apoquel and Cytopoint, driven by field force execution and brand marketing campaigns. Preference for chewables continues to increase with conversion to Apoquel Chewable in Europe now at 50%. We saw 32% operational growth in our Simparica franchise internationally with revenue of $84 million on the quarter. Simparica was the main growth driver, growing 33% operationally on $53 million in revenues. Simparica Trio was 30% operationally with $31 million in revenues. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 18% operationally, posting $79 million in combined revenue. Librela posted sales of $62 million in the quarter, growing 15% operationally. We see continuous growth in prescribing rates and penetration and reorder rates remain high.\nSolensia growth of 28% operationally on $17 million of sales is driven by increases in both returning and new OA patients. International livestock reported sales of $477 million in the fourth quarter, growing 6% operationally. Growth came primarily from price in hyperinflationary markets and in cattle.\nMoving down the P&L. Full year adjusted gross margins of 70.7%, grew 50 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 40 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price and favorable mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 10% operationally for the year. Growth was driven primarily by SG&A increases of 9% operationally, largely due to higher compensation-related expenses due in part to company performance.\nFull year G&A growth is inclusive of our Q4 growth of 11% operationally, reflective of the acceleration of certain demand-generating activities into Q4 of 2024. R&D spend grew 12% operationally for the year on higher compensation-related expenses due to company performance and increases in project spend related to internal portfolio advancement. Adjusted net income grew faster than revenue at 15% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the year.\nWe remain committed to reinvesting in the business while returning capital to shareholders. In 2024, we repurchased $1.9 billion of Zoetis shares, the most in our history. We also reaffirmed our commitment to buying back shares in August when our Board approved a new multiyear $6 billion share repurchase program. Additionally, we increased our dividend rate 15% during the year, while distributing $786 million back to shareholders. In total, we returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders in 2024, an increase of over $800 million versus the prior year.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the full year 2025. The strengthening U.S. dollar throughout 2024 has been a headwind to our reported revenue and adjusted net income projections. As a reminder, we do not forecast foreign exchange and our guidance reflects rates as of late January. Our 2025 guidance reflects foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $250 million to revenue and $50 million to adjusted net income versus 2024.\nFor 2025, we are projecting revenue between $9.225 billion and $9.375 billion, representing an organic operational growth range of 6% to 8%, with growth across both price and value. We expect our performance to be driven by our companion animal business with broad-based growth across our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises. We are projecting, these combined innovative franchises to grow double digits in 2025. Our growth estimates include a range of assumptions for new market entrants and conditions across our business.\nAs a reminder, our guidance does not include products that have not yet been approved. Additionally, guidance does not account for the impact of recent and potential policy changes, including tariffs, tax reform or other regulatory changes. For livestock, 2024 growth was favorably impacted by tailwinds from price, particularly in high inflationary markets, including Argentina. Those impacts normalized as the year progressed, and we do not expect similar tailwinds for 2025. Additionally, our reported growth for livestock will be negatively impacted by our MFA divestiture. We will continue to provide organic operational comparisons throughout the year to normalize for this impact. We expect our organic operational livestock growth to be in line with the livestock industry growth for the year.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 28%. Our expected margin improvement is driven by favorable product mix, aided by our MFA divestiture. This improvement is partially offset by foreign exchange impacts within our supply chain. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.35 billion. This change is reflective of the normalization of compensation increases tied to 2024 performance as well as the acceleration of certain demand-generating activities into Q4 of the prior year. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2025 is expected to be between $680 million and $690 million. We are coming off a multiyear cycle of R&D investment at a pace greater than revenue growth, with the output of those investments reflected in the portfolio progress we disclosed at the JPMorgan conference last month. Adjusted interest expense and other income deductions is expected to be approximately $200 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2025 is expected to be approximately 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.75 billion, representing growth of 2% to 4% on an operational basis and 6% to 8% on an organic operational basis. Our growth on adjusted net income is impacted by net interest headwinds due to lowering rates on invested cash versus prior years. Additionally, while our adjusted effective tax rate guidance for 2025 is within our historical range, it is at the higher end of the range due to higher taxes on foreign earnings. Our organic operational adjusted net income growth is expected to be 6% to 8%. If we further exclude the impact of interest and taxes, our bottom line growth is expected to be between 8% and 10%.\nLastly, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $6 to $6.10 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.80. Our EPS projections are based on current share count and do not consider the future impact of our ongoing share repurchase program.\nIn closing, 2024 success was built upon the strength of our broad portfolio and our purpose-driven colleagues. Our success across key brands, geographies and channels is the foundation which gives us confidence in our ability to sustain above-market growth this year and into the future.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call for 2024, we had another outstanding quarter, growing revenue 11% operationally and 18% operational growth in adjusted net income. Success was fueled by strong demand for innovative products, our ability to capture and expand markets and the dedication of our purpose-driven colleagues.\nSegment growth was well balanced with 12% growth in the U.S. and 10% operational revenue growth internationally even against a strong comparative quarter. Our innovative companion [indiscernible] portfolio grew 12% operationally, while our livestock portfolio saw 9% operational growth across species and geographies. It's been an excellent first half of 2024, growing revenue 12% operationally, highlighting that our leadership stems from both industry-leading innovation and differentiated execution. We remain focused on our core strategy, delivering consistent results for our customers, the animals and their care and our shareholders and our unwavering commitment to excellence has resulted in the most diverse and comprehensive animal health portfolio. We lead the industry in R&D investment, bringing over 300 science-driven innovations to , [indiscernible] including 3 of the top 5 best-selling products in Animal Health, APOQUEL, Simparica Trio and CYTOPOINT.\nWith our global footprint and world-class manufacturing facilities, we ensure consistent quality and on-time delivery. Our early investments in digital transformation, power and exceptional customer experience while positioning us for future growth. We continuously refine our commercial strategies and for effective launches and market penetration. And our powerful brand recognition, targeted direct-to-consumer campaigns experienced sales reps and medical experts help us capture new market share and win loyalty.\nOur customers are at the center of everything we do from understanding their challenges to exceeding their expectations. Scientific innovation enables us to meet their demands while creating new markets, our commercial execution allows us to defend and grow that market leadership. The animal health industry has proven essential and resilient in all types of climates, but it's also dynamic and growing, and we are well positioned to seize the opportunity. Look no further than our revolutionary osteoarthritis pain franchise, Librela for dogs and [ Palencia ] for cats. We are developing a market with breakthrough products that are safer and more effective while offering convenience for veterinarians and trade owners.\nThe results speak for themselves. Globally, Librela grew 142% operationally this quarter, fueled by the successful and ongoing U.S. launch. But again, its innovation coupled with execution. Tikelencia, for example. Despite launching in Europe 3 years ago, we reported 60% operational growth this quarter.\nOur breakthroughs are driving increased feline clinic visits, which in turn expands the total market. We, along with veterinarians and pet owners are excited about how these safe and efficacious products are revolutionizing first-line treatment for chronic pain [indiscernible] cats of all ages. Given our proven track record of building and scaling billion-dollar franchises, we remain confident about the OA pain trajectory, but we don't just launch products, we cultivate them for long-term success.\nOur key dermatology franchise exemplifies this commitment, delivering strong 18% operational growth driven by APOQUEL and APOQUEL chewable along with CYTOPOINT, we have transformed the management of atopic dermatitis in dogs, providing safe, effective and convenient solutions with over 23 million dogs treated globally and a decade of proven results APOQUEL is the world's #1 prescribed oral medication for [ Lerdagich ] and it is overwhelmingly endorsed by veterinarians worldwide with approximately 90% satisfaction, reflecting the trust and confidence they place in our market-leading brands. And we are still unlocking the opportunity.\nToday, there are approximately $20 million globally with undertreated or untreated pyritic itch presenting a vast untapped market. Take the U.S., for example, we estimate that 10 million dogs are currently receiving veterinary treatment for itch. While the majority or roughly 70% received APOQUEL or CYTOPOINT, there are 3 million dogs prescribed alternative options like steroids. Moreover, an estimated 8 million dogs are treated with over-the-counter products or not treated at all. This highlights the potential addressable market of 11 million dogs in the U.S., alone that could benefit from our safe and effective therapies.\nInternationally, the trend is similar with room for even more growth as dogs become increasingly medicalized, underscoring a significant global market opportunity that will fuel our ongoing growth. To solidify our leadership and win new patients, we are focused on DTC marketing to raise awareness, enhance medical education to improve compliance and expanding retail partnerships. Our ability to execute extends to the Simparica franchise, which grew 22% operationally for the quarter. We have not only navigated the changing competitive landscape, but embrace new opportunities with confidence and agility.\nSeveral pre trends are fueling our growth. First, pet owner demographics are shifting. They are younger, more affluent and connected by the powerful human animal bond. They are highly engaged and willing to invest in their pet health and well-being. Second, and Wetteny will say more on this. There's a significant channel shift aimed at meeting the evolving needs of these younger pet owners. We are making our products more accessible, ensuring they are available where and when they need them.\nThis combination is a crucial part of our growth strategy, and the results are reflected in our performance. In this dynamic environment, our execution across all phases from launch to expansion to defense, set up the part, showcasing we can introduce, sustain and grow products in a competitive market. Our focus on innovation and execution cuts across every part of the business to create shareholder value. In our livestock portfolio, the sale of our medicated feed additives and certain water-soluble product portfolios remains on track to close in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, we are focusing on innovative solutions for producers, including preventative antibiotic alternatives and genetics. As the demand for healthy and sustainable animal protein continues to rise, we remain committed to supporting our livestock customers.\nOur dedication to meeting their needs and adapted to the evolving market conditions ensures that we are well positioned to contribute to their success. Building on our outstanding performance this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to grow faster than the market and through competition as reflected in our raised guidance. While macroeconomic headwinds persist, Animal Health remains resilient and Zoetis' strong operational execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio enable us to navigate all kinds of market conditions effectively.\nWe further demonstrated our commitment to shareholders and confidence in our growth trajectory with the recent announcement of a Board-approved $6 billion share repurchase program, which Wetteny will elaborate on. The animal health landscape is evolving, and our innovations are at the forefront. And while breakthrough innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy, our success is rooted in multiple drivers of growth. We are not just launching new products we are transforming existing ones to unlock their full potential and better serve customer needs through life cycle innovations. That means taking proven therapies and developing new formulations, uses and delivery methods maximizing their impact and reach.\nThis translates to value created for customers and shareholders alike by allowing us to bring critical new solutions to market faster minimizing development risk and costs by leveraging existing safety profiles of proven products and expanding the reach of established products. Our commitment to life cycle innovation is just 1 reason we are the leader in animal health. When combined with our market leadership, deep customer insights, strategic investments and our purpose-driven colleagues, we are uniquely positioned to deliver against the 4 tenets of our value proposition to grow revenue faster than the market, to invest in innovation and growth capabilities to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue and to return excess capital to shareholders.\nOur differentiated execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio ensures we are not just keeping pace, we are setting the pace and redefining what's possible in animal health.\nWith that, let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristen, and good morning, everyone. As you heard Kristen mention, our ability to execute on our commercial and strategic plans drove another outstanding quarter. We simultaneously executed across product launches market expansion and market defense to propel us to a strong first half.\nIn the second quarter, we posted $2.4 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Adjusted net income of $711 million grew 9% on a reported basis and 18% operationally. Quarterly growth was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, OA [indiscernible] posted $149 million. Our Simparica franchise posted revenue of $384 million, which includes $299 million from Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise contributed $414 million.\nOur lifestyle portfolio also saw strong growth with $694 million in revenue. Looking closely at our success and execution. I'd like to focus first on OA pain. As we continue to execute our U.S. launch strategy, we remain confident in our OA pain trajectory. Based on our experience launching other billion-dollar franchises, we know that first-in-class therapies require significantly more market development than lagging local likes.\nIn the U.S., we have reached over 9,000 vets and veterinary technicians through interactive information sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and industry KOLs. This is on top of the thousands of interactions our sales reps and medical teams have had on individual vet visits. These interactions ensure our customers have the tools and resources to reinforce the safety and efficacy of Librela and Selencia with pet owners.\nAdditionally, we are deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. Pet owners know their pets better than anyone, and we want to help them detect the signs of OA and the available treatment options. We know these therapies are improving lives based on the positive testimonials from pet owners. The positive impact and reception of Librela are reflected in the market adoption. In the U.S., we see record penetration with over 80% of clinics now purchasing the product. No product in our history has penetrated this quickly. Reorder rates are approaching 90%, which is the leading indicator of customer satisfaction.\nIn Europe, shipment is expanding to moderate and mild OA cases that were largely untreated, now making up more than 65% of total cases. This is just a glimpse into what we expect in the U.S. over time, as Librela continues to expand the addressable market and gain market share. Despite our early success, we still have significant room for continued expansion. Our focus on execution doesn't stop after we launch a product. After more than a decade of exceptional safety and efficacy, our geicdermatology franchise is still a critical performance driver, growing 18% operationally in the quarter. In the U.S., derm clinic visits are increasing, driving volume growth across both APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT. The franchise, including APOQUEL, APOQUEL chewable and CYTOPOINT is designed to cover multiple needs across different dermatological indications and their different methods of administration suit any vet or pet owner preference.\nOur derm products also address a full spectrum of pruritic cases, providing relief from acute and seasonal conditions as well as treatment for those with lifelong chronic conditions, which make up the majority of total derm revenue. And vets and pet owners are extremely happy with the results. In global studies, veterinarians report approximately 90% of that satisfaction with APOQUEL safety and efficacy. Our comprehensive portfolio meets vet needs and the needs of their patients, and we are confident in our ability to grow revenue even in the face of competition.\nThat confidence is fueled by the significant opportunities for market expansion that Kristen mentioned earlier. First, we are targeting the $8 million in the U.S. with atopic dermatitis that are either untreated or not treated by a vet through direct-to-consumer advertising, helping to educate pet owners on the signs of an itchy dog and our prescription treatment options.\nAdditionally, in the U.S., there are 3 million dogs who are prescribed alternative products like steroids. We are confident in our ability to win these new customers through our proven safety and efficacy. We are also drawing more doses from the same patient base due to trends within pet health care, including reference injectable therapies towable formulations and alternative channel growth, increasing compliance.\nLastly, there are many markets where our key dermatology franchise is in the early stages of maturity. These markets should provide long-term growth trajectory and our outstanding international growth highlights this momentum. Our excellence and execution on our payment launches and key dermatology expansion has contributed to a great first half of the year.\nNow let's move on to our segment results. U.S. revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with companion animal growing 13% and livestock posting 11% growth. For the first time, Sales across our U.S. companion animal portfolio surpassed $1 billion in the quarter. Performance was driven by our OA payinmabs, Simperica Trio and our key dermatology franchise. Portfolio growth was largely driven by trends in retail and home delivery reflecting the evolution of pet-owner preference for convenience and increased compliance on dispensing or medications.\nIn the clinic, usage of injectable therapeutic treatment is going to offset the alternative channel shift. Our ethane mabs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $71 million in U.S. sales in Q2. Librela generated $53 million, primarily on increased clinic utilization. As I mentioned to date, market adoption is higher than any product in our history. Thus, we are confident in our trajectory. Solensia posted $18 million in revenue. We continue to be pleased with what we are seeing in the feedline OA space.\nAs Kristen mentioned, we see positive trends in feline OA visits which have nearly doubled since our launch almost 2 years ago. Simparica Trio posted U.S. growth of 19% in the quarter on $254 million in revenue. We are entering our second year with competition in the triple combination parasiticide market, and we continue to execute on not just defending our leadership position with Trio, but growing it. Again, we do not take a launch and done mentality.\nWe posted 26% moving average total growth over the past 12 months. The majority of which was in a competitive market, highlighting not only our first mover advantage, but also the stickiness of our customer base. Lastly, in the vet channel, Simparica Trio is winning with Puppies, a leading indicator of future performance. In the absence of meaningful differentiation, vets and pet owners are reluctant to switch from a safe, efficacious product. The dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $283 million for the quarter, growing 17%.\nAPOQUEL was the largest growth driver with APOQUEL chewable benefiting from increased conversion. CYTOPOINT growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable solutions, especially for chronic cases. Earlier, Kristen alluded to shifting pet owner demographics in the evolving landscape. Much of our success with Simparica Trio and APOQUEL has been bolstered by our ability to win in the growing retail and home delivery space. The convenience of these channels for self-administered products are increasingly popular with pet owners, and we are committed to making our products available where our customers need them.\nCurrently, Simparica Trio is the best-selling prescription products in the retail channel and APOQUEL is second. We estimate that over 20% of Trio sales and 1/3 of APOQUEL sales now come via the retail channel. Additionally, the alternative channel growth rate for both Trio and APOQUEL exceeded overall growth rate for these products this quarter. Growing pet-owner preference for alternative channel convenience has led to a decline in product-only clinic visits. This is why visits are not the best indicator of our performance, given we have consistently grown volume in an evolving landscape.\nOur U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 5% in the quarter, its [indiscernible] after Q1 distributor inventory work downs following our channel strategies change. U.S. [indiscernible] had a strong quarter, growing 11%, driven primarily from the timing of supply on [indiscernible] which had a soft comparable period last year. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 12% operationally and livestock grew 8% operationally.\nOur international companion animal portfolio growth was driven by our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises, partially offset by impact in China. Our international Simparica franchise grew 35% operationally. Growth was driven by Simparica, growing 38% operationally to $59 million in sales in the quarter. We continue to see increased use in Latin America and Eastern Europe as well as price benefits in high inflationary markets. Simparica Trio grew 31% operationally on $45 million in sales benefiting from key account growth in Europe, continued focus on DTC and the positive impact of our recent launch in China.\nOur key dermatology franchise grew 19% operationally in the quarter posting $131 million in sales. We saw double-digit growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was partially offset by headwinds in Japan due to preprice buy-ins in Q1. As we highlighted earlier, we continue to see significant opportunity for growth. Many international markets are in the early stages of market development with significant runway for growth.\nInternationally, our OA pain maps grew 35% operationally, posting $79 million in combined revenue. International Librela sales were $63 million, growing 32% operationally. As we highlighted last quarter, we have lapped the launches in our last significant international markets, which occurred in Q2 of 2023. [indiscernible] sales were $16 million, growing 49% operationally. Our international companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 15% operationally with strong performance across much of Asia and Europe. International companion animal growth was partially offset by expected declines in China, driven by evolution franchise. International livestock grew 8% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases, primarily in cattle and poultry in high inflationary markets. We saw strong growth in our fish portfolio this quarter with contributions from price and volume driven by strong demand for vaccines in Norway.\nGrowth in price and fish was partially offset by volume declines in most of our other lifestyle species due to a challenging comparable quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable rotations. As expected, the economic challenges in China persist, putting pressure on certain companion animal products as well as livestock, especially in swine. Consistent with what we have said for several quarters, the impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but continued headwinds are expected throughout the year across companion animal and livestock.\nFiscal discipline across the P&L is 1 of the things that unlocks successful execution. As we move on to some of the highlights, we wanted to reaffirm our continued commitment to reinvesting in our business and our confidence in the returns we see from those investments. Adjusted gross margins of 71.7% declined 70 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 130 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases favorable mix and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in high inflationary markets. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally contributing to this growth was SG&A increases of 7% operationally and 17% operational growth in R&D. Improvements in operational gross margin and prudent expense growth contributed to adjusted net income which grew 18% operationally.\nAdjusted diluted EPS grew 20% operationally for the quarter. Lastly, I want to highlight our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we repurchased a record high $533 million in shares. Additionally, on August 1, we announced that we received board approval for a new $6 billion share repurchase program, our largest program to date. The shares are expected to be repurchased over a multiyear period of up to 4 years, and the program can be canceled at any time. The company's previous $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in December 2021 is expected to be completed this year. This commitment reflects continued confidence in our ability to return value to shareholders.\nBefore moving to guidance, an update on the planned divestiture of our Medicated Feed Additives portfolio. As Kristen mentioned, we are expecting this divestiture to close some time in the second half. Our current guidance is not reflective of the sale and may be adjusted subsequent to the close of the deal. As we stated in our April announcement, this portfolio generated approximately $400 million in revenue in 2023 with roughly linear seasonality.\nNow moving on to guidance for full year 2024. Our outstanding first half performance particularly in our Simparica and key dermatology franchises demonstrated our ability to drive growth through execution across our business and gives us confidence going forward. Thus, we are raising our 2024 guidance provided during May's earnings call. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates of late July. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.25 billion, a range of 9% to 11% operational growth.\nAs we stated earlier, our overpaying trajectory remains on track. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.64 billion to $2.69 billion, representing operational growth of 13.5% to 15.5%. We are maintaining our commitment to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term while increasing our investment in demand-generating activities such as direct-to-consumer advertising. While we saw exceptional leverage this quarter, subsequent quarters may not have the same level of operating leverage due to the optimal timing of investments.\nFinally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.78 to $5.88 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. In closing, before we go to Q&A, the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our relationships as well as our ability to execute on our strategic vision, continually allows us to outperform our peers. We have the utmost confidence in our best-in-class portfolio and colleagues to continue to set the benchmark moving forward.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of the call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 2, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for 2024. Today, we reported outstanding first quarter results, underscored by steady demand for our products, a focused strategy and our purpose-driven colleagues.\nWe delivered 12% operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income 15% operationally, in line with the tenet of our value proposition. Driven by the launch of our osteoarthritis pain franchise, the U.S. led the way with 16% growth and 8% operational growth internationally. More specifically, globally, Librela grew 189% operationally, including $40 million in sales in the U.S., in line with our expectations.\nThe powerful human animal bond fueled demand for our companion animal portfolio with 20% growth operationally, while livestock declined 1% operationally. The quarter's results, even amidst global uncertainty, are a testament, once again to the power of our diverse and durable portfolio across markets, species and therapeutic areas. It also highlights the continued rise and resilience of the animal health industry.\nOur purpose and performance are rooted in science, which has way been the great disruptor. And as animal health is increasingly essential for nutrition and companionship, caregivers demand even more high-quality innovation. That means we identify the most prevalent area of unmet veterinary needs and invest in, develop, manufacture and deliver life-changing products that customers have been waiting for.\nTake for example Librela and SOLENSIA, our equal monoclonal antibodies to treat OA pain in dogs and cats, which are helping millions of pets return to play. With more than 18 million doses distributed worldwide, we are providing long-lasting relief animals, many of whom were previously undiagnosed or untreated due to limitations of NSAID.\nWith nearly 40% of all dogs suffering from OA pain globally, we believe just 1/3 of them are being treated. So we're just scratching the surface of care. And cats are visiting the clinic more often. In fact, we're helping current clinic [indiscernible] with Bocat, the first FDA product to alleviate anxiety in cat, which means we're expanding care in a historically under-medicalized area of the market.\nWe understand that social media is a form for convening, a place for pet owners to connect and to share, but we also have responsibility to empower our customers to make informed decisions grounded in science and data. We are unwavering in our commitment rigorous safety and quality standards, which has earned us the trust and confidence of veterinarians worldwide.\nBacked by that commitment, Librela and SOLENSIA are safe and effective. be anchored in 10-year science and have been used in Europe for more than 3 years. In the U.S., 78% of veterinarians, who are at the center of care, are very satisfied with Librela. This is driven by real world experience and consistent with the feedback we hear in other markets. And our research indicates that 46% of vets globally will treat OA earlier and 65% will treat more dogs now that Librela is available.\nTo accurately reaffirm the safety and efficacy of these therapies, we are doubling down, working directly with veterinarians who need these products, hosting live sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and expanding online education screening while deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. And veterinarians continue to be confident in Librela, as evidenced by a recent blind survey of U.S. vets confirming that perception and intent to prescribe remain unchanged.\nWe remain confident that OA pain could be our next $1 billion franchise because we are meeting the needs of an underserved market. We are growing by nearly every metric, including adoption, penetration, reorder rates, patient share and expanded utilization. And looking at our 4-week rolling over U.S., we're excited to report that sales steadily increased through April.\nOur performance speaks to the power of the human animal bond, discerning pet owners want option, and they will work with their vets to find relief for their best friends. Beyond OA pain, Zoetis has been able to lead the market in other key categories because we deeply understand our customers' needs. This allows us to not only compete in existing markets, but again to create entirely new ones.\nAnd science has created something completely unique to our industry, $2 billion franchises. Our parasiticide portfolio expanded the total market based on deep customer insights. Before Simparica and Simparica Trio, we were #5 in this category. These innovations changed how we compete.\nToday, we are #2, continue gaining share and growing the market even in the face of competition. Similarly, we were first to recognize that new therapies were needed to treat canine itch safely and effectively. That market foresight changed the treatment paradigm and revolutionized type. A decade of dermatology has led to 3 products, 20 major life cycle enhancements, including Cytopoint, the first ever animal health monoclonal antibody and the first chewable with APOQUEl Chew.\nFrom what was 1 believed to be just a $100 million market had grown to $1.4 billion because we know what our customer needs. Today, more than 18 million dogs are treated for allergic itch and atopic dermatitis, and another 13 million remain untreated globally. We built a $1 billion franchise and demonstrated the durability of our portfolio, and we will continue growing this franchise underpinned by strong brand equity, first-mover advantage, life cycle innovation and strong customer relationships.\nWe've led in parasiticide, dermatology and now OA pain. And each time our innovation for these new categories in animal health, you've seen the total industry opportunity expand.\nNow moving to livestock. I'm sure you all saw the news this week on the announcement of our agreement with Phibro Animal Health to sell our global medicated feed additives and certain water-soluble product portfolios and related assets for $350 million. This deal is another great example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus investments in areas with the greatest growth potential and innovation that are aligned with our key capabilities.\nI'm confident that under Phibro's management, the global reach of these products will continue to expand to meet customer needs worldwide. We remain very committed to livestock and just sharpening our focus and our core innovative livestock growth areas, including preventative antibiotic alternatives and genetics.\nIn summary, for more than 70 years, Zoetis has been leading the industry with our commitment to innovation. We've invested over $5 billion in R&D since our IPO, which has brought more than 300 product lines to the market. Science is and always has been the great disruptor and at the core of our success in delivering the innovations with veterinarians, livestock producers and pet owners expect from us.\nOur pursuit of science has led to breakthroughs in dermatology, like Cytopoint and chew in parasiticides is Simparica Chew and now the latest OA pain with Librela and SOLENSIA, that are revolutionizing animal health. Blazing new trails isn't easy, but time and time again, our purpose-driven colleagues have proven their ability to expand our industry leadership and board in highly new markets, and we remain committed to delivering strong growth through our anti franchises and diverse portfolio, while continuing to invest for the future.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2024, our increased operational guidance reflects the resilience of the animal health market and the execution of our strategic rarity. We continue to be disciplined yet adaptable and our approach to the opportunities, challenges and economic shifts that occur throughout the year. And with that, I will turn it over to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had an outstanding start to the year driven by the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, particularly our innovative products as well as price growth across all species.\nIn the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 10% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $634 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 15% on an operational basis. Our 12% operational revenue growth was due to the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, aided by the impact of a weak comparative quarter in our U.S. companion animal business.\nHowever, the majority of this ability to growth was offset by headwinds related to economic conditions in China the impact of a tough comparative quarter in livestock due to the timing of supply for certain products last year and inventory destocking related to our U.S. diagnostics sales model change.\nOf the 12% operational revenue growth, 7% is from price with 5% growth in volume. While we saw price growth across our portfolio, which was favorably impacted by hyperinflationary markets, especially Argentina, which contributed 2% to our overall price growth. The volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Talentia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\nOn a segment basis, the U.S. posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 16% on the quarter, while our International segment reported revenue of $1 billion with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was a [indiscernible] revenue growth in Q1, growing 20% operationally. This growth was partially offset by livestock, which declined 1% on an operational basis.\nWe saw double just operational companion animal growth in both the U.S. and our international segments again this quarter, driven by the strong performance of our innovative products, contributions from both volume and price.\nSimparica Trio was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, generating $243 million globally, representing operational growth of 61%. We saw strong demand for Trio as well as continued growth in patient share even with competition. Our OA pain mAbs were also a significant contributor to growth, posting $131 million in the quarter. Global growth came from the impact of new launch markets, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nIn our early launch EU markets, recent vet surveys showed an increase in [indiscernible] therapy and expansion into more moderate OA cases. Our key dermatology products grew 25% operationally in the quarter with $360 million in global revenue. Growth within dermatology was driven primarily by APOQUEL franchise, where we are seeing solid conversion to APOQUEL Chewable, including a modest impact from initial distributor stocking in the U.S. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable methods of treatment.\nOur global companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 12% operationally, with declines in the U.S. driven by distribution model change. These declines were anticipated as our distribution partners sold off their remaining inventory due to our transition to a direct-only model for our U.S. diagnostics portfolio. U.S. declines were partially offset by growth internationally.\nOur lifestyle portfolio declined 1% operationally, as expected, driven by a tough comparative quarter in the prior year, especially in the U.S. as well as impacts from the ongoing economic conditions in China. This decline was partially offset by price growth in our other international markets. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter.\nU.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 16% with companion animal growth of 25% and livestock posting a 7% decline. The companion animal performance in the quarter was driven by Simparica Trio, our key dermatology portfolio, and the impact of the launch of Librela in the U.S. as well as the impact of a weak comparative quarter.\nOur outstanding companion animal growth came in the quarter where we saw vet clinic visits decrease 1.5%. We continue to see growth in the therapeutic visits, while wellness visits drove the decline. Outgrowth in the retail delivery continued to outpace vet clinics fulfillment, which is based on growing pet owner preference for these alternative channels. This dynamic is expected to put continued pressure on total vet clinic visits without impacting our expectations for revenue.\nDespite the visit decline, revenue and spend per visit in the clinic grew 4.5% and 6%, respectively, which reflects continued pet owner willingness to pay. Turning to product performance.\nSimparica Trio posted sales of $205 million in the quarter, growing 6%. We continue to be the market leader in the triple combination parasiticide space. Our leading footprint across channels has allowed us to continue to drive dosage growth through increased compliance even with declines in wellness visits at the clinic. In addition to a weak comparable period in the prior year, we have seen favorable price realization due to more targeted discount programs to vets as well as channel dynamics.\nDermatology product sales in the U.S. were $233 million for the quarter, growing 27%. We saw growth in both price and volume and across both APOQUEL and Cytopoint. Growth also benefited from a weak comparable period in the prior year. Market demand for dermatology products remains high.\nIn the quarter, we saw growth in both our patient share as well as higher periodic visits in the clinic. Additionally, growth of retail outship programs continue to bolster compliance. At the beginning of April, we made APOQUEL Chewable available through our distribution partners. Our pain maps, Librela and SOLENSIA, posted a combined $57 million in U.S. sales in Q1. Librela generated $40 million in the quarter with underlying vet demand continuing to build on the momentum from our full launch in Q4 of last year. Excluding the impact of the initial clinic stocking, which we were provided last quarter, we are seeing robust sequential quarter growth in Librela, in line with expectations.\nWe continue to see good growth in penetration as well as strong reorder rates, which are approaching 80%, all of which points to positive real-world satisfaction in the clinic and among pet owners. We remain confident, not just in the safety and efficacy of Librela, but also in our expected performance.\nAs Kristin alluded to, we have seen steady increasing trends in our trailing 4-week sales average in the U.S. even into April after the increased media attention. We continue to see steady progress in SOLENSIA, which had U.S. sales of $17 million in the quarter, more than doubling our prior year [indiscernible] sales. We have indicated the feline market needs significant development, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. SOLENSIA is now the market-leading product for feline OA pain in the U.S., and we have seen a significant increase in the medicalized patient pool since launch.\nOur U.S. Companion Animal Diagnostics portfolio declined 21% in the quarter, driven primarily by distributor inventory work-downs following our channel strategy change. This is in line with our expectations and has negligible impact on underlying claim demand.\nU.S. flag [indiscernible] declined 7% in the quarter, while our underlying business performance in the quarter was as expected. Our results are reflective of a strong comparative period in Q1 of 2023, in which we grew 15% due to the return of supply on several products, primarily in cattle.\nSales of swine product due to decreased sales of vaccines as well as Jackson. In poultry, we saw declines as a result of increased generic competition in our medicated feed additive products.\nMoving on to National segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 14% operationally and livestock grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of our international competitor products were driven by OA pain mabs, key dermatology products, vaccines and small animal parasiticides. This growth was partially offset by impacts in China.\nOur international OA pain mabs grew 67% operationally to $74 million in combined revenue in the quarter. International Librela sales were $59 million, growing 71% operationally. Growth is balanced across new launch markets and our first EU markets. We continue to see evolution in the European markets, where you have seen expansion in Librela's use in moderate cases, which the latest vet surveys now represents the majority of the Librela patients in Europe. We remain pleased with the success of our DTC advertising campaigns in increasing pet owner awareness of OA.\n[indiscernible] sales were $15 million internationally in the quarter, growing 54% on an operational basis. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 23% operationally in the quarter, posting $127 million in sales. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by [indiscernible] and new patients. Wealth was also favorably impacted by preprice increased buy-ups in Japan and certain European markets.\nOur international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 6% operationally driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica Trio, growing 58% operationally to $38 million in sales. Chewy growth benefited from continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and salesforce effectiveness as well as contributions from Trio's launch in China.\nSimparica posted $56 million in revenue, growing 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 29% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China. International livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases as in high inflationary markets. Price growth was partially offset by volume declines across all of our species, partially driven by a tough comparative period in the prior year due to the return of supply of certain lifestyle products.\nThe volume declines in livestock were driven by cattle due to a tough comparable period related [indiscernible] and worsening market conditions in Australia. Our international swine portfolio saw volume declines driven by China, where we saw lower hog prices as well as a reduction in herd sizes.\nIn sheep, we saw declines from herd reductions due to expected weather conditions in Australia and New Zealand as well as supply constraints on AK products. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see economic challenges in China, where low consumer spending and higher urban unemployment have reduced spending. We are also seeing a slowdown in livestock with lower pork prices and smaller herd sizes. The impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but we expect to continue to see headwinds throughout the year across both companion animal and livestock.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.7% declined 10 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 180 basis points on our reported adjusted margins. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases, favorable mix and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in hyperinflationary markets.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by SG&A growth of 10% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased advertising and promotion spend on our OA pain maps. R&D grew 13% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend related to both recent acquisitions as well as advancements of our pipeline candidates.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, a decrease of 80 basis points, primarily due to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings.\nAnd finally, adjusted net income grew 15% operationally despite a $31 million headwind to growth from the nonrecurring benefit of our prior year royalty settlement. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $140 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $339 million of Zoetis shares.\nBefore moving to guidance, I wanted to comment on our recent announcement to divest our medicated food additive portfolio and certain water soluble products to Fibro Animal Health. This is a transaction that demonstrates Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus our investments on innovative solutions that advance animal health, productivity and sustainability. This divestiture will allow us to remain focused on other livestock solutions, including vaccine, biologic and generic programs that are more aligned with our strategic priorities.\nNow moving on to guidance for full year 2024. As we have mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter that highlighted our ability to deliver through multiple sources of growth. Our performance in companion animal, especially in parasiticides and our key dermatology franchises exceeded our expectations. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with the progress of the U.S. launch of Librela and are confident in our ability to meet expectations.\nWe are, therefore, raising our 2024 operational guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. The updated foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our reported revenue guidance by approximately 2% and our reported adjusted net income guidance by approximately 4% when compared to our initial guidance issued in February.\nFor the year, we expect revenue between $9.05 billion and $9.20 billion, representing a range of 8.5% to 10.5% operational growth. Our increase in operational growth is reflective of Argentina's pricing impact as well as due to performance in our companion animal parasiticides and key dermatology products. We now expect our full year operational growth for Simparica Trio to be double digits, while we expect growth in our key dermatology products to be in the high single-digit range.\nAs we stated earlier, we remain pleased with our U.S. launch of Librela. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. Moving down the P&L. we now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.67 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.71 to $5.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44.\nJust to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are very pleased with our start to the year. While our reported results are reflective of various foreign exchange-related headwinds, operationally, we continue to deliver growth across our key therapeutic areas and across most of our major markets. This growth highlights the diversity and dependability that allows us to continually outpace the animal health market. Additionally, we continue to lead the way, creating new markets and launching new innovation that increases the standard of medical care for animals.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full year results, driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues.\nWe delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for our innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% in the U.S. and 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species and therapeutic areas has sustained our performance further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential and growing industry.\nOur track record of innovation from pioneering breakthroughs to product life cycle enhancements has solidified our position as the industry leader consistently growing above the market and enabled us to create market-leading franchises. We don't just follow trends, we make markets. The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first 2 injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats and strengthening the human animal bond. That's why today, Librela remains the #1 selling OA pain product in Europe.\nAt Investor Day last May and again at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion. And we are excited about Librela's performance since its U.S. launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth. Similarly, Solensia has also been well received with strong clinic penetration around the world with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain [indiscernible].\nWithin our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians. And after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. increasing pet owners' awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improve compliance and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs underpins our optimism. We remain confident that we can sustain growth, thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticide portfolio and particularly Simparica Trio remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength and the efficacy of our products.\nThe performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position, but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine. As we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human animal bond and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges while delivering shareholder value.\nLooking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance. Our dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage, and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chain and commercial excellence to cultivate new markets, drive growth and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers while performing above the market. Our focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In closing, we will continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis.\nAs you look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world in humankind by advancing care for animal and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio and defend our position amidst competition. I want to reiterate the 4 tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and you will return excess capital to shareholders. While there is need and demand to improve the quality life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession and purpose-driven colleagues. Thank you.\nNow let me hand it over to Wetteny. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023 with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition.\nOur revenue growth was broad with strong growth across both our U.S. and international segments, with our companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and due to both price and volume. Full year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal bodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our International segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business and represented a 0.5 percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Our lifestyle portfolio also had a strong year with operational growth of 6%.\nPerformance in companion animal was led by OA pain maps, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the U.S. We continue to see penetration of our pain maps grow within vet clinics and a high level of satisfaction amongst both vets and pet owners. Our key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 10% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our lifestyle portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth driven by both price and volume.\nMoving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both the reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in U.S. companion animals. Adjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both the reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth assisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our in-line products. Volume from our [indiscernible] products was flat in the quarter.\nOn a segment basis, our U.S. business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while International segment reported revenue of $982 million with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed with operational growth of 6%. We saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our international segment, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain maps were the primary driver of growth posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 launch of Librela in the U.S.\nSimparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as some increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $87 million and [ 8% ] operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our lifestyle products ended the year on a strong note with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our U.S. and International segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from [ DRAXXIN ] and price decreases as well as by volume with growth in [ Cinemex ] from our expanded label claims.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal sales growing 10% and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by a full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier-than-normal preprice buy-in at the end of last year. In the U.S., vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year. While we continue to see solid clinic revenue and revenue per visit growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our U.S. companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace its veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.\nMoving on to product performance. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our pay maps, Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain maps posted $58 million in U.S. sales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the U.S. early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in U.S. sales in the quarter which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain maps, there's significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher-than-expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year as well as rapid patient share growth in the [ K9 ] pain category.\nSolensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the U.S. We have seen a marked increase in [indiscernible] vet visits and [indiscernible] revenue growth in the clinic. In the U.S., [indiscernible] line OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%. Growth was driven primarily by price as we ran promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges, and in advance of a [indiscernible] expected competitor launch in early 2023.\nIn our second quarter with competition in the trip combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships and a significant advantage of being first to market. [indiscernible] Dermatology products sales in the U.S. were $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume with vets and pet owners referring this injectable method of administration. [indiscernible] franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year.\nOur U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. U.S. livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotation back to certain medicated [indiscernible] and the extended use of [indiscernible] as well as share gains due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally and lifestyle grew 7% operational. China represented a 3% drag on our International segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain maps, our key dermatology products and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\nGrowth in our OA pain products was equally driven by [indiscernible] focus and DTC awareness campaign in early launch European markets as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million international with 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million of revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis. We continue to see benefits to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets, and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. [indiscernible] Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong price season and demand generation in emerging markets.\nSimparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness. This growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our revolution franchise which generates a high proportion of sales in China, where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022 as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing onto international livestock, which grew 7% operationally driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our [indiscernible] portfolio.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which was 10% operationally primarily due to higher competition related expenses as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation. R&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, Other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, an a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net dispute tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income grew 6% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase. continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the full year 2024. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an incredible impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. On adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points. with significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX. So these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January.\nFor 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and [ $9.225 billion ], representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth with growth across both price and volume. We expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the U.S. launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our pain maps both in the U.S. and internationally. Our current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the U.S. are exceeding our expectations. And as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrants, we anticipate mid- to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. For livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we enter 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with lifestyle industry growth.\nI'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. For companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect U.S. visits to grow flat to 1% and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our pain products. For an animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio. We expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination [indiscernible] parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In other key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our 3 differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower state utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase in 2023, focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects as well as higher competition related expenses.\nAdjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million. This is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the nonrecurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023 as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market. and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $5.84 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth.\nTo summarize, 2023 was another strong year. even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China. We again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future. As we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. And welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2023. We generated strong performance in the third quarter, driven by our diverse companion animal portfolio of key dermatology products, pet parasiticides, monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and diagnostics.\nWe delivered 8% operational growth in revenue and 13% operational growth in adjusted net income, despite continued market challenges in China. We showed balanced segment growth this quarter with 8% operational growth internationally and 8% growth in the U.S.\nOur companion animal portfolio grew 11%, and our livestock portfolio grew 3% operational -- operationally in 3Q, in line with our overall expectations.\nThrough the first 9 months of the year, we have grown our revenue 7% operationally, as customers place a premium on the animal health benefits that our products deliver, even in times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. As the market leader in animal health we compete in an essential global industry that has been resilient during various economic cycles, and we continue growing above the market based on a steady pipeline of new products, life cycle innovation and commercial execution.\nWe are on track to achieve our full year operational guidance and have narrowed it around the midpoint of the range, as we continue to balance headwinds and tailwinds in the marketplace. We are executing well on the drivers where we have more control, like the successful launch of Librela in the U.S., while also mitigating the downside of macroeconomic declines in China, both of which were not considered in our original guidance this year.\nOnce again, our diverse portfolio across product categories and geographies generates durable, reliable, long-term growth. We continue to expect our key companion annual franchises to be our core catalysts for growth. We anticipate strong growth in our market-leading dermatology portfolio for the year, building on the ongoing direct-to-consumer, or DTC, digital campaigns that support disease and product awareness, as well as the continued introduction of life cycle innovations like Apoquel Chewable.\nOur Simparica franchise and broader portfolio of parasiticides continue to perform well in this increasingly competitive product category, based on our innovative and highly effective products and promotional support from DTC.\nIn terms of new products, we're very pleased with the U.S. launch of Librela , our canine monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis or OA pain. This product has been very well received by veterinarians and pet owners in the U.S. as well as other major markets globally, and we have built ample supply for continued growth in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nSolensia, our monoclonal antibody for OA pain in cats, has also been well received by veterinarians in markets around the world as we look to help increase medicalization of cats. We're building awareness of this condition among cat owners, and introducing our monoclonal antibody treatment through DTC campaigns, as well as AI tools like Cat Pain IQ, which helps vets and pet owners use videos to identify this condition.\nOur diagnostics portfolio has been showing stronger year-over-year performance in 2023 with 14% operational growth in the third quarter, and we continue to refine this business to better serve customer needs across our comprehensive portfolio. For example, we're simplifying our reference lab service and operating model in the U.S., and focusing on expanding our larger regional hubs, which can deliver 1-day turnaround and have more modernized operations.\nWe also continue to emphasize the benefits of AI technology and our virtual lab services to enhance the speed and quality of our diagnostic solutions. With all these in mind, we are narrowing our full year guidance for operational growth to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% in revenue and a range of 7.5% to 8.5% in adjusted net income, keeping the same midpoint as our prior guidance. Wetteny will provide more details on guidance in his remarks.\nWe continue to see strong underlying customer demand this year and into 2024, even while recovery in China is still a notable uncertainty. The majority of that practices in the U.S. continue to see high customer demand for veterinary services. However, labor constraints and more limited hours continue to hamper their ability to meet this demand.\nYear-to-date, clinic business are flat as we expected. We did see a modest decline in clinic visits this quarter in the U.S., while clinic visit revenues and average revenue per visit were up.\nLooking ahead, we remain confident in the sustainable underlying demand for animal health, based on the strength of the human animal bond, people's willingness to spend on pet house and the essential need for safe and secure food supply. We expect to achieve double-digit operational growth for our companion animal portfolio this year and low single-digit operational growth in our livestock portfolio.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to reiterate a theme I discussed earlier this year at Investor Day. It's the confidence we have in sustaining our key market-leading franchises across dermatology, pet parasiticide and osteoarthritis pain based on life cycle innovations in these categories as well as the pipeline we are exploring in other areas of unmet need.\nWe are firmly committed to investing in our portfolio as well as the DTC programs and capabilities we need to support our growth, while managing costs and creating value for our shareholders.\nDespite economic and geopolitical uncertainties in China and elsewhere, we believe we will continue to grow faster than the market for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. This confidence stems from our diverse portfolio across markets and species. Our industry-leading franchises, the ongoing launch of Librela and the operational excellence and agility that our people deliver every day for our business and for our customers.\nSo thank you, and let me hand this over to Wetteny. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, with broad-based growth across both our U.S. and international segments across both companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and across both price and volume.\nFor the quarter, we were able to deliver results in line with our expectations, even in light of continued headwinds in China. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 7% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis.\nAdjusted net income of $629 million grew 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 3% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio.\nOur companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth, growing 11% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 3% in the quarter.\nCompanion animal growth was again driven by our innovative products with double-digit operational growth in our key dermatology portfolio, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia and Simparica Trio.\nOur key dermatology products generated $393 million in sales globally, posting growth of 14% on an operational basis with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international.\nGlobally, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain posted $77 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Growth came primarily from our European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets internationally.\nWith the October full launch of Librela in the U.S., our pain products are now available in most major markets. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $206 million in the quarter, representing growth of 20% operationally versus the comparable 2022 period. Growth was driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as from increased field force and promotional focus.\nOur companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $90 million and grew 14% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international.\nOur life sci portfolio grew 3% operationally, with international growth partially offset by a slight decline in the U.S.\nGrowth in livestock was driven primarily by price, especially in high inflationary markets. We also saw volume growth in our poultry portfolio, driven by increased usage of vaccines as well as our [ antioxodio ] product, Zoamix in the U.S.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 8%, with companion animal products growing 11% and livestock sales declining 2%.\nOn the companion animal side, while vet clinic visits declined 1.5% in the quarter, we continue to see robust play in revenue growth, up 6% versus a year ago. Average revenue per visit is up over 7%. On a year-to-date basis, clinic visits are flat, while clinic revenue is growing 8%. These trends highlight the continued durability of pet owner willingness to spend as well as the continued impact of vet clinic staffing challenges. Our companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth, due in part to our continued upsized growth in retail channel.\nTurning to product performance. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven by our key dermatology portfolio, Simparica Trio and Solensia. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $260 million in the quarter, growing 13%. [ spider ] point sales continued to drive growth in the quarter, with vets showing a preference for injectables due to higher compliance and pet owners appreciating the longer duration of treatment.\nApoquel sales were driven by growth in the retail channel as pet owners continue to rely more heavily on retail for ongoing pharmacy needs as well as retail auto ship programs that drive higher compliance.\nOur latest dermatology life cycle innovation at Apoquel Chewable was launched in the U.S. in October. Apoquel Chewable has been well received in Europe, as pet owners favor the ease of chewable administration over film-coated tablets.\nSimparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $184 million in the quarter, growing 17%, driven by increased focus in our parasiticide promotional programs. We continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio, even with the recent competitive launch in the triple combination space. We remain confident in our ability to compete through our superior label, strong retail channel presence, and the strength of our corporate and specialty relationships.\nIn the U.S., our pain products posted sales of $15 million in the quarter. We continue to see solid player penetration growth for Solensia, as well as an uptick in feline clinic visits and expect to continue to drive awareness of Feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns.\nLibrela has been well received by early experience program participants and their patients during the third quarter. We moved to a full launch in mid-October. We have been very pleased with post launch performance thus far, and are confident that we have ample supply to meet our demand expectations.\nOur U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 18% in the quarter, as we continue to see positive results from the new field force we introduced last year. We saw strong placement growth in the quarter, especially on our images device.\nU.S. livestock sales declined 2% in the quarter, primarily resulting from the timing of supply on certain cattle products in the prior year, where we had an improved supply position and restocking in the channel, which drove a strong comparable quarter. The Q3 decline was partially offset by growth in our cattle productivity implant, Synovex due to extended label claims. The cattle decline was partially offset by growth in poultry due to vaccines and the extended use of Zoamix, an alternative to antibiotic medicated feed additives.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on both a reported and operational basis in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 12% operationally and livestock grew 5% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, or key dermatology products and our small animal parasiticides portfolio.\nGrowth in our OA pain products was bolstered by field force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launch European markets, specifically the U.K. and Germany, as well as the continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year.\nLibrela sales were $50 million international or 55% operational growth in the quarter, despite a slightly more difficult comparator in Q3 of 2022 due to the removal of supply constraints in our international markets. We remain confident in our ability to supply our forecasted demand for Librela.\nSolensia sales were $12 million in the quarter. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $133 million of revenue and grew 17% operationally. We saw double-digit growth across most of our major markets and strong uptake of Apoquel Chewable. Apoquel growth was driven primarily by the delayed itch season in Europe and Canada. Cytopoint growth was driven by continued patient expansion and higher compliance in existing patients.\nOur international small animal are parasiticides portfolio growth of 9% operationally was driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $40 million in revenue, growing 29% operationally, driven primarily by demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio posted $23 million, growing 47% on an operational basis, driven by growth in corporate account contracts.\nThe Simparica franchise performance was partially offset by a 16% operational decline in Revolution franchise, driven by a difficult comparable period in China, due to the return of supply in the prior year as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions.\nAs Kristin mentioned, we have seen declines in China due to the ongoing economic challenges, particularly on the companion animal side, which were not fully reflected in our initial guidance. We continue to monitor economic conditions. However, we are not expecting an improvement this year or into the first half of next year.\nOur international livestock segment grew 5% operationally in the quarter, driven primarily by price increases, especially in high inflationary markets. Growth was driven primarily by our cattle portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Brazil was the largest contributor, where we have seen price growth, supply recovery on certain products as well as continued improvement in cattle industry dynamics.\nAdditionally, the prior was a weak comparative period due to the impact of supply disruptions and a more uncertain industry dynamic led to a lowering of channel inventories in the quarter.\nOur poultry business also contributed to growth in the quarter, growing 9% operationally due to increased key account penetration in emerging markets.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 70.5% improved 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of price increases and lower freight charges. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, inventory charges and product mix.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 7% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which were 5% operationally due to higher competition related expenses. R&D expenses grew 13% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased project spend for our pipeline projects.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.6%, a decrease of 130 basis points due to favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings and a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, partially offset by lower net discrete tax benefits.\nAnd finally, adjusted net income was 13% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 15% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $145 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of Zoetis shares.\nNow moving to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October, which reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nBeginning with revenue for the full year. Due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, we are revising our reported revenue range while narrowing our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.475 billion and $8.55 billion, with a range of 6.5% to 7.5% operational growth. Our previous guidance was 6% to 8%.\nWe have been pleased with our operational performance thus far. While foreign exchange headwinds have been larger than expected, our year-to-date operational revenue growth of 7% is in line with our expectations. We expect to benefit from the approval and launch of Librela in the U.S., which is included in our revised guidance last quarter as well as the performance of our Lifestyle business. However, ongoing uncertainty in China has continued to offset upside potential.\nWe are expecting adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.51 billion, also slightly lower, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. Operationally, we are narrowing our growth expectations to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%, previously 7% to 9%. Expected reported diluted EPS narrows to a range of $5.14 to $5.21. And adjusted diluted EPS narrows to $5.38 to $5.43.\nFinally, to summarize before we go to Q&A. Our broad-based growth across species and geographies despite the challenging economic environment in China, continue to highlight the resilience of our portfolio and of the animal health industry. We remain committed to growing above the industry, driven by our innovative portfolio, commercial execution and multiple sources of in-line growth.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call [indiscernible] or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, August 8, 2023.\nWe also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nExecutive Vice President & Group President, U.S. Operations, Business Development and Strategy, Zoetis, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call for 2023 and I hope you were able to join us or listen to our Investor Day this past May. If you missed it, please check out a replay on zoetis.com. I think you'll find it worth the time in learning more about Zoetis and where we see future growth in animal health. We appreciated the opportunity to step beyond the cadence of our quarterly earnings calls and speak to you about the long-range perspective on our business and on our industry during Investor Day. We also appreciated your questions and the ongoing dialogue about the issues most important to you.\nAs you know, we shared more detail about our growth strategy, innovative pipeline and the key franchises, capabilities and investments we are making to build on our competitive advantages as the world leader in animal health. The 4 tenets of our value proposition were affirmed and expanded on throughout the day, and you can expect us to revisit that framework and provide progress updates in future investor interactions. Our goal is always to ensure that you understand how we are positioned to deliver on our value proposition, the revenue growth, strategic investments, margin expansion and capital returns.\nWith that covered, let's turn now to the second quarter financial results. Today, we reported strong second quarter results of 9% operational growth in revenue and 12% operational growth in adjusted net income based on our diverse portfolio across markets and species. As expected, we returned to a more balanced segment growth this quarter with 11% operational growth internationally and 7% growth in the U.S.\nOur companion animal portfolio grew 11% operationally, driven by our major franchises in dermatology, osteoarthritis pain and pet parasiticides. The second quarter results and drivers were more in line with our performance trends in recent years with innovations and strength in our companion animal portfolio leading the way.\nMeanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 4% operationally in the second quarter, driven by sales of poultry, cattle and fish products, and continue to demonstrate the benefits of our diversified portfolio across species and geographies with a strong first half.\nOverall, the first half of 2023 has played out much as we expected. We have grown revenue 6% operationally in the first half, driven by strong results from our international markets and livestock performance, which were partially offset by the distributor destocking we explained in the first quarter.\nAs expected, the impact of distributor destocking in our U.S. companion animal portfolio has stabilized and was not a significant factor in the second quarter. We continue to see strong customer demand for our companion animal portfolio. For the first half of 2023, companion animal grew 5% operationally. We believe companion animal should be a bigger driver of performance for the remainder of the year with a stronger second half driven by our key franchises. While we are monitoring how inflationary pressures may impact pet care spending in markets around the world, the underlying demand has remained steady and resilient to date, and this is what we have seen historically. In the U.S., veterinary clinic visits continue to stabilize, staying relatively flat through the first half of the year, and clinic revenue and spend per visit were both up about 9% in the U.S. in the first half.\nMeanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally in the first half of 2023, reflecting strong growth internationally and continued supply recovery in our U.S. cattle products. We expect livestock growth for the full year to be in the low single digits operationally, reflecting tougher comparisons in the second half of the year for U.S. portfolio.\nWith the first half of the year playing out largely as expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income. In our companion animal portfolio, we expect Librela and [ Solensia ] to continue to ramp up in various markets as we build our franchise for osteoarthritis pain. One way we are supporting growth for both products is increased use of direct-to-consumer campaigns in launch markets. These campaigns are building disease and product awareness, creating conversations among vets and pet owners and accelerating our efforts in markets where DTC is available.\nWe're also pleased to have received U.S. regulatory approvals in the second quarter for Librela and for Apoquel [ chewable ]. Both have been performing well in markets outside the U.S. to date. Librela is expected to launch in the U.S. in November with an early experience trial beginning in September. As you look at the second half, we continue to expect strong growth even as we factor in uncertainty around the macroeconomic conditions and droughts that exist in certain countries around the globe, particularly Asia Pacific, and tougher comparisons for U.S. livestock portfolio in the U.S.\nAs we have seen historically in these type of environments, our global footprint and diverse portfolio provide more stability to our business during uncertain times and we remain ready to pivot resources and investments to the greatest opportunity areas that it can ensure we continue to deliver on our commitments. For example, we continue to expand in large and growing product areas such as parasiticides, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies for pain, vaccines and diagnostics and invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, many of which we discussed at Investor Day.\nBefore I wrap up, 3 quick points around our colleagues. First, I want to welcome [ Esther Bank ] to our Zoetis executive team as [ EVP ] and President of U.S. Operations. [ Ester ] joined us in July coming most recently from Bristol-Myers Squibb and having spent a major part of her career at Novartis as well. She brings diverse global experience in health care and an impressive track record of driving results to Zoetis and I'm happy to say she is already off and running with the U.S. business. I also wanted to call out the recent publication of our 2022 sustainability report. This year's report captures how sustainability is integrated across the business and shares the progress we are making toward our driven to care aspirations. This report honors our outstanding Zoetis colleagues who champion our purpose and work every day to make us the world's most trusted and valued animal health company.\nAnd finally, I wanted to mention a recent recognition from [ Fast ] Company, which named Zoetis as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Shaping animal care through innovation is something we have always done across the company and has been a key element of our success. This is a well-deserved honor for our culture and our people who continuously strive to solve critical unmet medical needs in animal health from chronic illnesses like osteoarthritis pain and allergic dermatitis for pets to emerging infectious diseases threatening the food supply. I'm truly proud of our colleagues for receiving this recognition.\nIn conclusion, with a solid first half behind us, I remain very positive about achieving our full year guidance, thanks to the purpose-driven colleagues, innovation-driven culture and diverse portfolio that continues to drive our success. Thank you, and now let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Catalent, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning. As Kristen mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with balanced growth across both our companion animal and livestock portfolios as well as our U.S. and International segments. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis.\nAdjusted net income of $652 million grew 15% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth is 4% on price and 5% is on volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from other in-line products, 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Companion animal products are the primary driver of growth this quarter, growing 11% operationally with lifestyle growing 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. For companion animal, our key dermatology portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting $355 million in revenue, our largest quarter ever and representing 14% growth on an operational basis.\nWe saw double-digit operational growth in both international and the U.S. driven by strong growth in Cytopoint as well as growth driven by Apoquel and the conversion to [ Apicotruable ] in certain international markets. Our monocolantibodies, phosphatase pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $69 million in revenue globally in the quarter with strong demand for both products as well as the impact of the launch of Librela in several new international markets. Our companion animal parasiticides also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by our well solution franchise, which had $103 million in revenue and grew 22% operationally. Simparica Trio also contributed to the [ parasite ] growth with $248 million of revenue and growth of 5% operationally.\nOur global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $92 million in revenue in Q2, growing 12% operationally. We saw double-digit growth in the U.S. driven by high instrument placements in the quarter and disruptions from the implementation of our new field force model that impacted the prior year. Sales of our livestock products grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw growth across both our U.S. and international segments driven by poultry, cattle and fish.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal products growing 7% and livestock sales growing 5%. As Kristen mentioned, our company performance in the quarter reflects the stabilization of the distributor inventory levels that were a headwind to our growth in Q1. U.S. vet visits were flat in the quarter. [ link ] revenue growth and average revenue per visit were both up 8%. These trends are in line with expectations and continue to reflect the stabilization post COVID.\nTurning to U.S. product performance. Our key dermatology product sales were $241 million for the quarter, growing 10% and benefited from higher periodic patient visits in the quarter. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth with vets and pet owners showing a preference for injectables. Our U.S. small animal vaccines revenue grew 20% in the quarter, driven by higher sales of our canine influenza virus vaccine due in part to a competitor back order as well as higher sales into certain corporate and strategic accounts.\nThe [ Paracatu ] posted sales of [ $213 ] million in the quarter, growing 2%. Growth was driven by inpatient demand across all channels, partially offset by a difficult comparison period given the timing of distributor shipments from last year during our supply challenges as well as aggressive competitive promotion in the current quarter.\nOur growth cadence for Trio across the year will be impacted by the timing of supply recovery in 2022, and we expect growth rate improvement in the second half. As expected, we received FDA approval for Librela in the U.S. in May. We look forward to starting our early experience program in late Q3 with an expected November launch.\nNow turning to U.S. livestock. We saw 5% growth in our lifestyle portfolio in the quarter, primarily from our cattle business where we saw significant growth in Jackson, resulting from a favorable comparative quarter last year when an anticipated midyear price reduction limited sales in the quarter. Additional U.S. cattle growth came from [ Synevex ], which benefited from our reimplementation label claim. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also contributed to growth of 11%, based on our vaccine portfolio and an increased focus on egg layer market. We also benefited from favorable MFA rotations at certain large producers.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue was $1 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally in the quarter, while livestock revenue grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our small animal parasiticides, our monoclonal antibodies for Osteoarthritis pain and our key dermatology products.\nOur international parasiticide portfolio growth was primarily driven by a revolution franchise with $57 million in revenue, growing 52% operationally driven by the lack of supply last year, which particularly impacted China in the second quarter of 2022. Our Simparica franchise also contributed to growth with continued market share expansion, especially in Latin America, Europe and Asia. We continue to see strong adoption of Librela and Solensia.\nLibrela generated $48 million in revenue with 89% operational growth in the quarter driven by strong growth in Europe, supported by our direct-to-consumer advertising efforts in major markets and recent launches in various international markets, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan.\nSolensia delivered $11 million of second quarter sales internationally, driven by higher demand and supported by direct-to-consumer marketing efforts. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 22% operationally. We continue to see double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by growth from and conversion to Apoquel chewable as well as from Cytopoint with higher compliance and new patients. Our growth also benefited from a weak comparative quarter in Japan, which was impacted by prepriced buy-ups in Q1 of last year.\nMoving on to our International Lifestyle portfolio, which grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our poultry portfolio performed well with growth driven by key account penetration and MFA rotations in core poultry markets, including Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Our fish portfolio continues to perform well as a result of increased sales of vaccines across salmon markets in Norway and Chile.\nLastly, [ Ocado ] portfolio saw gains in Turkey, Brazil and Argentina from strong price growth and the recovery of supply issues. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 72.4% improved 260 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from favorable foreign exchange, price increases and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs in the quarter.\nAdjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally with both SG&A and R&D growing 8% operationally driven primarily by headcount-related compensation costs due to the timing of new hires in 2022 and the impact of annual salary increases.\nThe lower growth in R&D expenses this quarter is reflective of the timing of spend in project investments and not a reduction in our expected R&D spend for the full year. Year-to-date, adjusted R&D expenses has grown 13% operationally. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, an increase of 80 basis points, driven by higher net discrete tax expenses in the quarter, mainly related to changes to prior year's tax positions and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income grew 12% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% operationally in the quarter.\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter were $166 million and continue to be on track with our expectations for the year. In the quarter, we repurchased $324 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July, beginning with revenue for the full year due to unfavorable foreign exchange we are slightly lowering our revenue range while maintaining our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.50 billion and $8.65 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth.\nWith the approval of Librela in the U.S., we are now including our projected sales for November and December in our guidance, which are expected to be immaterial to our overall operational growth rate. Their impact on the full year revenue is largely offset by potential uncertainty in China as well as broader macroeconomic conditions in certain markets.\nOperationally, the first half has played out largely as we expected with 6% operational revenue growth. We expect stronger growth in the second half of the year overall, especially in our U.S. companion animal business. In livestock, which has grown 8% year-to-date on an operational basis. We anticipate unfavorable comparisons in the second half, driven by the timing of price decreases in Jackson in the U.S. last year, and the resumption of supply of several products after outages in the first half of 2022.\nWe expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.50 billion to $2.55 billion, slightly above our previous guidance while maintaining our previous guidance of operational growth of 7% to 9%, driven by foreign exchange favorability in cost of sales and expenses, which were partially offset by unfavorability in revenue.\nReported diluted EPS increases to a range of $5.15 to $5.27, which is impacted by foreign exchange and a onetime gain from a business development deal. And finally, due to the impact of foreign exchange, we are increasing adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.37 to $5.47.\nJust to summarize before we go to Q&A. We saw strong well based growth in the second quarter, growing in both companion animal and livestock as well as in the U.S. and internationally, with contributions from price and volume. We expect stronger growth as we move into the second half. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our operational full year guidance commitments. We continue to see improving fundamentals in the overall industry and remain committed to delivering on our value proposition to grow revenue faster than the market and to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our report -- reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 14, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full year results for 2022, in line with the high end of our guidance from November, and thanks to our diverse portfolio, global scale and talented colleagues.\nOur 8% operational revenue growth for the year was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally while our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally, primarily due to generic competition and market challenges, especially in the U.S. Thanks to our broad mobile scale and diversity, we delivered well-balanced operational growth across our U.S. and international segments, which grew 7% and 9%, respectively.\nFor the year, we generated operational growth in all of our top 13 markets despite the economic challenges, continued COVID recovery and political uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine.\nReflecting our long-standing value proposition, we grew our adjusted net income faster than sales for the year with an operational increase of 11% for the full year and we use this performance and financial strength to continue investing in the R&D, manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing resources to support our future growth and pipeline.\nAs we begin 2023, we will stay adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions around the world and focus on executing our plans. We remain very confident in the fundamental and resilient global demand for animal care. And most importantly, we are confident in Zoetis' ability to continue delivering solid sustainable growth as we resolve our prior supply constraints and build share of our market-leading franchises.\nLooking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance even in the face of today's economic uncertainty, we are well positioned with our strategic priorities and capabilities to expand in large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics.\nWe are guiding to a range of 6% to 8% operational growth for revenue in 2023 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 7% to 9% operationally, which reflects our increased investment plans for R&D and manufacturing to support growth. As the world leader in animal health, a market that has grown on average of 5% to 6% through various economic cycles over the last 2 decades, we feel very positive about how our portfolio, pipeline and strategy can drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders.\nWetteny will discuss more details about the 4Q results and full year 2023 guidance, but let me provide some additional perspective on our business and set the stage for some of our growth drivers for the year. First, we have remained the world leader in animal health over the last decade, outperforming the market and bringing groundbreaking innovation to veterinarians, producers and pet owners who care for animals.\nWe marked our 10-year anniversary as a public company on February 1, a decade, which saw a spring more than 2,000 new products and life cycle innovations to market, build a diverse portfolio, featuring market-leading franchises and 15 current blockbusters generate consistent above-market revenue growth and deliver a total shareholder return of more than 500% all while increasing our market cap from $16 billion in 2013 to about $75 billion today. While we celebrate those accomplishments, I'm even more excited about where we can go in the next decade. And by the talented colleagues, innovative pipeline and best-in-class capabilities we have brought together at Zoetis.\nOur colleagues purpose-driven mindset and steady performance in the face of adversity give me confidence in the continued execution, innovation, growth and durability of our business. As we turn to 2023, we're focused on 5 key growth catalysts for the year. In dermatology, we see excellent growth opportunities even after nearly a decade of game-changing innovation that began with the introduction of Apoquel in 2014 and has continued with the success of our first monoclonal antibody, Cytopoint, as well as recent life cycle innovations like Apoquel chewable.\nWe continue to see even more opportunity to grow and expand in this market. In pet parasiticides, the largest single product area in animal health, we continue to gain share and are now the second largest in revenue for this category. We've improved supply in 2023, we expect to continue expanding share in this market and supporting our diverse global portfolio beating Simparica Trio, our triple combination product.\nIn the area of pain, we are off to a great start with our 2 monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela for dogs, which became our latest blockbuster in 2022 and Solensia for cats. We are, once again, revolutionizing care in this category and seeing very positive early reaction to both products in their large markets as we continue to expand geographies and supply.\nIn terms of the U.S. approval for Librela, we remain confident in receiving approval in the first half of '23 with a leasing plan for late in the year.\nIn Diagnostics, we continue to generate solid above-market growth in international markets of all our go-to-market model in the U.S. and drive greater global adoption for VETSCAN IMAGYST, our AI-based diagnostics platform.\nAnd finally, as population growth and economic mobility drive more demand for animal protein and pets, we see major opportunities in fast-growing emerging markets outside the U.S., where our portfolio is well suited to meet those evolving needs. Overall, our business continues to be weighted towards higher-growth, innovation-driven areas in companion animal, and these will remain our growth drivers for the foreseeable future.\nMeanwhile, our livestock portfolio will remain a valuable cash-generating piece of our business as we continue to recover in the U.S. from generic competition and show solid growth in emerging markets. As always, we will stay disciplined yet adaptable, and our approach to the new market opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur.\nAnd in conclusion, Zoetis remains well positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth in 2023.\nThank you, and I'll hand this off to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2022 with revenue of $8.1 billion and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion both in line with the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 3% on a reported basis and 11% operationally.\nLooking deeper into the operational growth for the year. Price contributed 3% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 5%. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, including Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia, and 2% from key dermatology products, partially offset by a decline of 1% from other In-Line products.\nRevenue growth was broad-based with positive operational growth in each of our top 13 markets, which make up approximately 85% of our total revenues with international growing 9% operationally and the U.S. growing 7%. Our growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative new products in our companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally.\nOur companion animal portfolio now makes up 64% of our global revenues. This growth was partially offset by our livestock business, which declined 2% operationally, primarily due to generic competition, supply constraints as well as challenging market conditions in certain geographies.\nPerformance in companion animal was driven by our small animal parasiticide portfolio, which grew 20% on an operational basis. Simparica Trio generated $744 million in sales, growing 58% on an operational basis. Our Simparica franchise reached $1 billion in global revenue for the first time in 2022. Our key dermatology products generated $1.3 billion in sales posting strong growth of 17% operationally with double-digit growth in both international and the U.S. Derm grew -- growth in our international markets was especially strong at 27% operationally.\nWe continue to see solid growth in our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain. As expected, sales of Librela eclipsed the $100 million mark on the year, marking Zoetis' 15th blockbuster product. We look forward to Librela's expected launch in the U.S. in late 2023. Solensia contributed $30 million in sales in 2022, primarily from international markets, with solid plan penetration in the U.S. after a launch late in the year.\nOur companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 2% operationally in the year, with declines in the U.S., partially offset by growth internationally. Our livestock business declined 2% on an operational basis. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generic and cheaper alternatives to DRAXXIN in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry. We do expect the generic impact to begin to moderate in 2023. Additional declines were driven by supply challenges on certain lifestyle products as well as unfavorable market conditions, especially the U.S. cattle and China swine markets.\nMoving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $539 million is an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 27% operationally. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% from price and 6% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio as well as Librela and Solensia and 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products grew 1%.\nCompanion animal products grew 15% operationally while our livestock portfolio was flat in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting global revenue of $171 million, representing operational growth of 39% for the quarter. We expect Simparica Trio to continue to grow the addressable market for fleet taking hardware globally and drive the conversion from collar and top parasiticides to oral combination products. These dynamics will provide additional run rate for future expansion of the broader market and revenue growth for Trio even once competing super combination products enter the market.\nOur key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth in the quarter, posting $347 million of revenue, representing 14% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 23% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOur monoclonal antibodies osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats continue to grow posting $39 million of revenue in the quarter, primarily in international markets. Meanwhile, sales of livestock products were flat on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in fish and poultry offset by the impact of generics and supply constraints on cattle and swine products.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal sales growing 12% and livestock sales declining by 6%.\nFocusing first on companion animal, we returned to double-digit growth in the quarter, as we resolve the majority of our supply issues from earlier in the year. In the U.S. veterinary practice revenue is growing approximately 6% and spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing 10% despite a 4% decline in clinic visits in the quarter.\nThe visit decline reflects comparison to the peak visit numbers in 2021, driven by pandemic after effects and increased adoption of pets as well as the impact of veterinary workforce challenges that have limited some clinic capacities. Absolute clinic visits remain above prepandemic levels.\nWe continue to see growth in the retail segment outpacing other channels. In Q4, sales to our retail partners grew by 49%. Simparica Trio continues to grow -- to drive growth in the quarter with sales of $158 million in the U.S., growing 39%. With the supply constraints from earlier in the year largely resolved, we were able to leverage promotional efforts to drive growth and regain market share in the quarter.\nKey dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $239 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint, each growing double digits. We expect to continue the expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. U.S. livestock declined 6% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by supply restocking for certain products in the third quarter of 2022 as well as the impact of generic competition in cattle and poultry.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 12% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 21% operationally and livestock grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, our key dermatology products and our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain.\nOur international small animal parasiticide portfolio had a very strong quarter. Growth was driven by revolution franchise, which rebounded well from supply challenges, especially in China. Our key dermatology products contributed $108 million of revenue and grew 22% on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in Cytopoint across all key markets and continued double-digit growth of Apoquel.\nWe continue to be pleased with the performance of our OA pain portfolio with Librela generating $26 million and Solensia delivering $7 million in fourth quarter sales internationally. Librela sales in the quarter dipped slightly below the prior quarter due to the removal of supply allocation in certain markets, which led to higher inventory levels at the end of Q3. We expect to see significant contribution to growth in 2023 coming from Librela across our International segment.\nMoving on to our International Livestock segment, which grew 4% operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 25% operationally due to increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of poultry products grew due to increased demand for poultry reporting. Growth was partially offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints in certain vaccines across international. The slight decline was partially offset by growth in China, driven by a weak comparative quarter in the prior year and improved swine market conditions.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 68.1% decreased 150 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin declined 60 basis points, driven by higher inventory charges as well as higher manufacturing and freight costs, which were partially offset by favorable price and mix.\nOperationally, adjusted operating expenses decreased 6% with SG&A declining 9% driven by lower compensation-related expenses and lower advertising and promotion, partially offset by higher freight and logistics related expenses. R&D expenses increased 10% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher project spend. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 220 basis points, primarily due to lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income.\nAdjusted net income grew 27% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 30% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $171 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. For the year, we have repurchased almost $1.6 billion of Zoetis shares and returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income.\nNow moving on to our guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have a minimal impact versus the prior year, with the full year impact neutral at revenue and slightly accretive at adjusted net income. The foreign exchange impact in the first half will be unfavorable versus prior year, particularly in the first quarter.\nIn the second half of the year, foreign exchange is expected to be favorable based on the late January exchange rates. For 2023, we are projecting revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. Volume will be 1% to 2% at the low end of our guidance range and 3% to 4% at the high end. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2023 with the continued strength of our diverse Simparica Trio portfolio, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and further expansion of our key dermatology products.\nDespite the decline in vet planning visits last year, industry fundamentals remain strong. Business remain above pre-COVID levels and clinic revenue is at an all-time high as the standard of care continues to increase. We anticipate modest livestock declines in 2023, driven by the generic impact on DRAXXIN sales, particularly in the first half as well as unfavorable market conditions in U.S. cattle. These declines will be partially offset by growth in poultry, driven by increased demand for poultry protein and new product launches as well as fish.\nThe fundamental trends which make livestock an essential business remain intact. I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectation for revenue growth. For companion animal, we assume a tribal combination product will launch in the U.S. in the first half of 2023 to compete against Simparica Trio. We expect this entrant will help Trio drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination or parasiticides and still project significant growth for Trio. We do not expect competitive entrants in 2023 for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint.\nWe expect another year of robust growth of our key derm portfolio coming from continued expansion of the dermatology market and price. We are excited about the continued growth in our OA franchise and plan to launch in several new markets next year.\nFor the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%, where favorable foreign exchange price increases and product mix are partially offset by higher input costs.\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.06 billion and $2.1 billion, with the increase from 2022 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2023 is expected to be between $635 million and $660 million. R&D spend can fluctuate year-over-year. This increased investment is reflective of both new projects as well as those advancing in our pipeline.\nZoetis is the leader in animal health because of the disruptive innovation, novel products and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. This increase in R&D expenses reflects our commitment to ensuring our capital allocation prioritizes innovation.\nAdjusted interest and other income reductions are expected to be approximately $170 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion, representing operational growth of 7% to 9%.\nOur guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14.\nWe are anticipating capital expenditures in 2023 to increase to $950 million to $1 billion. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage.\nFinally, about Zoetis and the animal health industry remain resilient in the face of economic headwinds. Our 2023 guidance range is reflective of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and the impact of veterinary clinic labor challenges. While guidance represents our expectations for the full year, Q1 revenue is expected to be below the low end of the operational growth rate in our full year guidance due to a variety of reasons.\nFirst, Q1 2022 was a strong comparable quarter as we saw robust growth with limited impact from vet clinic labor constraints as well as minimal disruption from our diagnostics field force model change, which began in Q2. Additionally, in the quarter, we expect to see lingering impacts of the latest COVID wave in China.\nLastly, the return of supply on certain products, including Simparica Trio, and subsequent channel restocking as well as promotions to regain share in Q4 2022 modestly increased inventory levels in the channel in the short term.\nIn Q1, we expect a modest decline in adjusted net income versus the prior year as a result of the timing of our 2022 sales force extension in the U.S., which did not start until Q2, as well as the R&D investment noted earlier, which is also off a low base in Q1 2022.\nNow to summarize. 2022 was another strong year despite some challenges, we significantly outperformed the market and continue to take share, all while growing the bottom line faster than the top line. As we begin 2023, we once again expect to grow faster than the market, driven by the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and expand existing markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.\n(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVP of IR, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 3, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2022. While the world faces a dynamic external environment and uncertainty in the global economy, our business has been tested and continues to perform well based on our diverse durable portfolio and global footprint. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results with 5% operational revenue growth, reflecting steady performance across our innovation-driven companion animal portfolio especially in our international markets.\nOur international business grew 8% operationally and the U.S. grew 2% in the quarter. As we've been saying for some time, supply challenges throughout the year remain a headwind to meeting global demand, and those impacts were more pronounced in the third quarter. Supply has been improving in certain product categories such as parasiticides, and we continue prioritizing supply for key products and markets. However, we do expect constraints in some categories to continue.\nOverall, positive pet care trends in terms of increasing spend and pet owner demographics continue to underpin the strength of our business. With 10% operational growth in companion animal products in the third quarter, we continue to see strong demand globally for Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, small animal vaccine and monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia.\nIn the U.S., supply constraints for companion animal products tempered some of our expected growth in the quarter, and we also experienced an impact related to workforce challenges in veterinary clinics. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID rates as clinics struggle with capacity issues. That being said, average revenues per visit continue to rise in the U.S. as pet owners plays a premium on the care of their pets, a positive long-term trend.\nThis commitment to pet well-being is also demonstrated in the success of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela and Solensia. They are performing exceptionally well in the EU and Solensia is on track after being launched in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter. We are investing in building a fee line market for pain treatment and undertreated condition for cats.\nOutside of the U.S. companion animal products showed strong growth of 17% operationally. In some of our largest markets like China and Australia, we're seeing our innovative pet care products contributing more and more to growth in these traditionally live stock-driven markets. Meanwhile, our global livestock business performed largely as expected in the third quarter, with a decline of 3% operationally. We continue to face generic competition for livestock products, especially in cattle and poultry, and we face supply constraints in products such as vaccines.\nHowever, we are seeing solid pockets of growth, especially in aquaculture and poultry products and certain markets outside the U.S. As we stabilize from the generic competition, and review more consistent supply, we will improve our livestock performance. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the innovation-driven strength of our business especially in areas such as parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. I am optimistic about the fundamental growth drivers and essential nature of the animal health industry to weather challenging times. However, we are revising our full year guidance to affect lower-than-expected sales in the second half of the year due to supply constraints, veterinary workforce challenges and recent changes to foreign exchange rates. We believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view given the increasing uncertainty around supply, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions that have become less predictable. As we look ahead, to our tenth anniversary as an independent company next year and I reflect on all that we've achieved in the last decade. I feel very positive about where we are and the capabilities we have to overcome any challenges we face.\nHistorically, we've always been able to adapt our business to meet evolving customer needs, drive growth faster than the market and achieve our purpose in nurturing the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. The human animal bond and people's connection to pets and farm animals is powerful. It's a bond we support with a diverse portfolio that remains the strength of our business, and we see strong global demand for innovative products, especially in companion animal parasiticides, dermatology, vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibodies for pain. Positive pet owner demographics and their willingness to spend on the care of their animals remain long-term sustainable drivers of growth despite some of the workforce challenges in clinics and livestock continues to be an important part of our business, an area where we drive significant value for our customers and shareholders.\nTo sustain our growth, innovation remains our lifeblood, and we continue investing in the industry's leading R&D engine at Zoetis. Our monoclonal antibody portfolio for OA pain is a game changer. It has been performing exceptionally well as a pet treatment and growth driver in an increasing number of markets, and Librela is expected to be a blockbuster for Zoetis in 2022.\nIn terms of the U.S. approval for Librela, we have confirmed dates for the FDA site inspections outside the U.S., but their timing makes it unlikely to have an approval this year. Given our ongoing conversations with the FDA, we are confident in receiving approval in the first half of 2023 with a launch planned for late in the year.\nIn closing, our business continues to perform well in a dynamic market and we are well positioned to advance our strategic growth opportunities in parasiticides, dermatology, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. Even as we face challenging supply constraints, generic competition and macroeconomic uncertainty, I remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues as we finish 2022 and we go into 2023. Given the importance of the companionship and nutrition provided by pets and farm minimals and the power of the human animal bond, the animal health industry has consistently grown in the mid-single digits even in down markets. And as the leader in animal health, we have the pipeline, market leadership positions, global scale and financial strength to continue outpacing the market. Throughout the last 10 years in various market conditions, we have grown the top line an average of about 8%. And even in the last recession, when our business was more livestock than companion animal, we still grew.\nAs we look toward the end of the year and into 2023, I expect us to continue setting the bar on innovation, cultivating a high-performing culture and delivering superior customer experiences. All of this will have us growing significantly above the market and building enduring value for shareholders in this dynamic market. Thank you.\nNow let me hand things over to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a solid quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises, driven by our companion animal performance, especially in international. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results. The key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance.\nIn the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 1% on a reported basis and 5% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $566 million declined 5% on a reported basis and grew 2% on an operational basis. Of the 5% operational revenue growth, 4% is from volume and 1% from price. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and monoclonal antibodies, for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela an Solensia and 1% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 1%. The decline was largely the result of supply challenges. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 10% operationally, with livestock declining 3% on an operational basis in the quarter.\nSimparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $172 million, representing operational growth of 43% versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flea, tick and heartworm globally and see significant room for growth with brands like Simparica Trio, Simparica, ProHeart and Revolution Plus.\nMeanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth, especially internationally, with $343 million of revenue, representing 11% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products grew 26% operationally. Year-to-date revenue is $966 million, representing 18% operational growth. Sales of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in International continue to exceed expectations posting $37 million of sales in the quarter.\nSwitching to Diagnostics. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $78 million in revenue in Q3, declining 9% operationally. Despite declining revenues, we saw solid new instrument placements in the quarter. The decline in our U.S. diagnostics portfolio was partially offset by growth internationally into the quarter. In the U.S., our diagnostics results were also impacted by the vet clinic workforce challenges, and we continue to experience a slowdown in sales as we transition to our new go-to-market model and build out a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run.\nWe expect the effectiveness of our new diagnosis field force to improve gradually into 2023. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Meanwhile, sales of livestock products declined by 3% operationally in the quarter. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to DRAXXIN in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry and supply challenges for certain products.\nOur fish portfolio grew 19% operationally in the quarter and along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 2% with companion animal sales growing 6% and livestock sales declining by 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. The effects of our ongoing supply challenges were more pronounced in the third quarter, tempering growth in our parasiticides. In U.S. companion animal, we are also seeing vet clinic workforce challenges limiting appointment availability as visits declined 4% in the quarter.\nDespite lower visits, parasiticide revenue is growing approximately 5% and as spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing more than 9%. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID levels as the impact of higher pet ownership growth rates due to COVID normalize and vet practices deal with workforce challenges. However, underlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country, even as people return to work. While vet clinic workforce challenges do exist, we believe vet clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better pet ownership demographics, higher compliance and more pets.\nEven with the robust comparative year, we continue to see volume growth in our companion animal products, driven by our innovative products, such as Trio and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of [$157 million] in the U.S., growing 43%. Despite the impact of supply constraints and the vet clinic workforce challenges, we continue to take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio.\nKey dermatology products sales in the U.S. were $231 million for the quarter, growing 6% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our U.S. derm portfolio has grown 12%. Growth is tempered by prior year COVID related spikes in derm visits that drove visit growth of 25% in Q3 2021 and help accelerate market expansion. This growth was also impacted by the ongoing pet clinic workforce challenges. We expect continued expansion of the market for the foreseeable future.\nU.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter as expected, with sold of cattle products impacted by generic competition for DRAXXIN. Meanwhile, our U.S. poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. U.S. swine product sales declined 3% in the quarter, driven primarily by increased competition for vaccines. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue declined 2% on a reported basis and grew 8% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue was flat operationally.\nIncreased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of monoclonal antibodies for elevation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products, and Simparica Trio. We remain excited with the long-term prospects of these innovative brands and expect future direct-to-consumer advertising to help drive additional growth. Sales of companion animal vaccines also contributed to growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $31 million and Solensia delivering $6 million in third quarter sales.\nLibrela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year, a new blockbuster for Zoetis. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the #1 pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. We saw volume growth in our international companion animal portfolio in the third quarter and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.\nMeanwhile, international livestock was flat operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 19% operationally and experienced increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of ship products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. Growth was offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints across international and lower sales across Europe due to reduced exports to China and higher input costs for producers.\nSales in Brazil also declined as we are seeing supply challenges on cattle products. Additionally, inflationary impacts on consumer spending are driving consumption away from beef to lower-cost animal proteins such as pork and chicken and reducing reducer profitability. Lastly, the Jurox acquisition, which is based in Australia, was completed on September 30 and is not reflected in our Q3 results.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 90 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin slightly declined driven by higher manufacturing, freight and other costs, which were largely offset by favorable mix and price. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% operationally with SG&A growth of 3% operationally, driven by T&E costs beginning to return to pre-COVID levels as well as freight and logistics. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher operating costs.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, an increase of 420 basis points due to unfavorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including decreased favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income in the prior year period. And finally, adjusted net income grew 2% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $154 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $375 million vet shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.\nYear-to-date, we have repurchased almost $1.2 billion of Zoetis shares.\nNow moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are lowering our growth to 7% to 8%, previously 9.5% to 10.5%. We are also lowering our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 9% to 11%, previously 11% to 13%. This change in guidance is reflective of our Q3 results continued to impact from supply challenges and the ongoing vet clinic workforce challenges.\nForeign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late October and reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to lowering of our guidance and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.0 billion and $8.075 billion. We lowered our operating expense guidance for the full year, reflecting lower expenses in both Q3 and Q4, which reflects our ability to manage costs. Additionally, it is worth noting that our expected Q4 expense decline is also impacted by an easier comp due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter last year.\nAdditionally, our guidance for adjusted interest expense and OID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.83 to $4.90 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59. While lower -- our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term.\nOur success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation and our infrastructure to develop and expand market globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on key growth opportunities for the foreseeable future.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.\nThe presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. Presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.\n(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVP of IR, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. And that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP.\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, August 4, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call for 2022. I'm pleased to say Zoetis delivered another strong quarter with 8% operational growth in revenue and 9% operational growth in adjusted net income, driven once again by the strength of our companion animal portfolio.\nWe saw a balanced performance across our segments with similar operational revenue growth for both the U.S. and international, 9% and 8%, respectively. Our diversity and strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for pain continue to demonstrate people's desire for innovative and effective care for their pets. We continue to see positive spending trends across the globe for pet care. And we grew 14% operationally in our companion animal portfolio.\nAs anticipated, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 1% operationally in the second quarter, largely due to generic competition primarily in U.S. cattle and declines in swine products in China due to lower pork prices and COVID-related supply constraints. Overall, our business remains strong, thanks to the durability of our global portfolio and a steady pipeline of new products.\nEven as we face uncertain macroeconomic conditions, continued supply constraints, generic competition and the war in Ukraine, we remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues. As we look to the rest of the year, we are updating and narrowing our guidance to reflect our positive outlook for the remainder of 2022 and the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. Wetteny will walk you through the details in his remarks.\nAs we look at the second half of the year, we remain confident in our long-term growth drivers and our ability to maintain a steady supply for customers despite inflationary pressures on the global economy and ongoing constraints for certain products.\nWe all know pet owners love their dogs and cats and pet care remains a very positive and robust market, showing little impact from broader consumer concerns with inflation for the global economy. As we expected during the pandemic, that clinic visits are normalizing over time and spending continues to show strong growth based on the latest U.S. numbers. The positive dynamic between pets and pet owners, which I've spoken about before, is proving sustainable and recession-resistant due to people's affinity for their pets, a willingness to prioritize medical care for their pets and key demographic drivers such as the increased pet ownership by Gen Z and millennials and the greater percentage of high income households owning pets.\nOur innovative companion animal portfolio is well suited to address these customer needs. Our key dermatology products continue to demonstrate strong growth, 22% operationally for the first half, and we see opportunity to expand in underpenetrated markets especially internationally and introduce life cycle innovations like Apoquel chewable tablets. We have more to come in the pipeline for dermatology, and we do not foresee any competitors for Apoquel or Cytopoint this year or in the first half of 2023.\nIn terms of parasiticides, the Simparica franchise, including Simparica Trio, is performing extremely well having grown 47% operationally through the first half of the year and is gaining share in the industry's largest category. We currently anticipate a competing triple-combination parasiticide to be approved in the U.S. in the next 6 months with a possible launch next year.\nHowever, we believe Trio will continue to grow based on a strong label, proven efficacy and the support of DTC marketing in the U.S. and international markets. Our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia, are performing very well in approved markets across Europe, and we remain very confident in the blockbuster potential of these breakthrough treatments. In terms of the U.S., we have begun early experience trials for Solensia and expect a broader market launch in the fourth quarter.\nAnd we still anticipate approval for Librela later this year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside the United States. Meanwhile, our operational growth in international has remained steady throughout the first half of the year at 8% despite COVID lockdowns in China and revenue reductions in Russia and Ukraine due to the war.\nExcluding the impact of Russia and Ukraine in the first half, our international sales would have grown 9% operationally. This is the latest example of how our diverse portfolio and global footprint drive steady and sustainable growth for the business. While some markets may be experiencing setbacks in the quarter, other markets like the U.S., Australia, Southern Europe and other emerging markets are driving our performance.\nIn the second half, we see China returning to stronger growth if COVID stays in check, and we continue to expect the diversity across geographies and species to remain strong. In terms of livestock, we expect continued pressure from generic competition, primarily in U.S. cattle and poultry products. However, we are generating growth across various livestock species in markets outside the U.S. and fish continues to perform exceptionally well.\nFinally, like many companies, we are managing through supply constraints this year with certain products. We continue working hard to optimize our supply chain this year so we can meet the increasing demand for certain key products.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to invest in the resources, DTC marketing and manufacturing capacity we need to support our future growth and achieve results for our customers and shareholders. We are advancing our driven-to-care sustainability goals that were established last year. And we published our 2021 progress update and ESG metrics in the second quarter, highlighting achievements toward our DE&I aspirations, expanded clinic goals and support for the veterinary profession. We are committed to staying on our journey to be the most sustainable animal health company in the world.\nWe also continue to invest in R&D, business development and new capabilities across the business to enhance our portfolio and ensure our long-term growth. In the second quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products like Poulvac, Procerta HVT-IBD, ND, expand key franchises like Apoquel into new markets and acquire new businesses to complement our portfolio such as Basepaws, a pet care genetics company. In closing, our business continues to perform extraordinarily well in one of the most dynamic markets I've ever seen.\nDiversity, innovation and customer focus are our cornerstones for excellence. I want to thank our colleagues for their tenacity, commitment and resilience as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Thank you.\nNow let me hand things off to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises and the continued resilience of our end markets. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance.\nIn the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.1 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $567 million was flat on a reported basis and grew 9% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 5% from volume.\nVolume growth consisted of 6% from new products, which includes the Simparica Trio and Librela, 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 3%. The decline in other inline products was expected and largely the result of the impact of intermittent supply challenges and generic competition for DRAXXIN. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 14% operational with livestock declining 1% on an operational basis in the quarter.\nSimparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $237 million, representing operational growth of 72% versus the comparable 2021 period. We also continue to experience better-than-expected results from our Trio franchise outside the U.S. where we had sales of almost $30 million.\nWe expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flea, tick and heartworm globally and see significant headroom for growth with brands like Simparica and Trio. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint had significant global growth again with $315 million of revenue, representing 16% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products were 22% operationally in the second quarter of 2021.\nIn Europe, our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats also meaningfully contributed to growth posting $31 million in sales. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $83 million in revenue in Q2, declining 9% operationally. Growth in our international diagnostics portfolio was more than offset by a decline in our U.S. business in the quarter.\nIn the U.S., we experienced a decrease in sales resulting from our new growth in market model and the build-out of a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary fundamental elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run.\nWe expect the effectiveness of our new diagnostic sales force to improve gradually for the remainder of the year. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Sales of livestock products declined 1% operationally in the quarter, negatively impacting growth across the portfolio were global generic competition for DRAXXIN and the war in Ukraine.\nChina swine products again declined due to lower pork prices and COVID-related lockdowns. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to Zoamix. Meanwhile, our fish portfolio again grew double digits in the quarter. And along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline.\nOverall, livestock performance in the quarter continues to be in line with our expectations. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal products growing 13% and livestock sales declining 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. U.S. vet practice revenue trends continue to be positive with practice revenue growing approximately 5%. Spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing over 7%. Visit declined more than 2%, primarily due to challenging prior year comparisons.\nIn terms of vet line traffic, it is worth noting that business in the second quarter were above the number of visits pre-COVID in the second quarter of 2019 and the trend line for growth in visits over the last several years continues to slope favorably. I would also like to point out that our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. had volume growth of 8% in the quarter. Our injectable portfolio of products that must be administered in the vet clinic also saw volume growth in the quarter. These products include Cytopoint, vaccines and Poulvac.\nUnderlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country even as people return to work. While labor challenges do exist as they do across most industries, we believe that clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth of 13% in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from Simparica Trio as well as key dermatology products.\nGrowth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $208 million in the U.S., growing 74%. We are pleased to see that a significant number of Trio customers are new to the flea, tick and heartworm category altogether. In addition, we continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio.\nKey dermatology product sales were $219 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each significantly contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our derm portfolio grew 16%. Our investments to support our derm portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market.\nU.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by sales of cattle products as a result of generic competition for DRAXXIN. Meanwhile, our poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. Swine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of increased disease prevalence and favorable market conditions for producers.\nMoving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 16% operationally and livestock revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of modifying studies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products and the Simparica franchise.\nThese core brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer promotional campaigns and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $26 million and Solensia delivering $5 million in second quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year.\nAs we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the #1 pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations, and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. It is also worth noting that we are observing similar pet owner and vet clinic trends in many of our key international markets that we are seeing in the U.S.\nThe higher standard of care and better demographics as well as a more rapid adoption of innovation continues to expand markets for our products, and we expect these trends to continue. Volume growth in our international and companion animal portfolio was 10% in the second quarter, and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and Cytopoint.\nMeanwhile, international livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter with solid growth across fish, cattle and sheep. Our fish portfolio experienced increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Chile and Norway. Cattle grew through favorable market conditions and price in key emerging markets, including Australia, Turkey, China and the U.K. Sales of [shoe] products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia.\nGrowth was partially offset by continued weakness with the price of pork and COVID-related supply challenges in China as well as unfavorable producer rotational programs with MFAs in Europe and reduced stock sizes in Latin America impacting poultry. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 120 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts as well as higher manufacturing, freight and other costs partially offset by favorable price and mix. Adjusted operating expense increased 10% operationally with SG&A growth of [8%] operationally, driven by promotional and marketing expenses related to key brands and new product launches as well as T&E costs beginning to return to pre-COVID levels.\nR&D expenses increased 16% operationally due to higher compensation costs, increased spending on projects and higher operating costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, an increase of 70 basis points, driven by changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings and lower discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments. And finally, adjusted net income grew 9% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter.\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter were $146 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in CapEx expenditures for the back half of 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $600 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately $450 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest share repurchase ever.\nNow moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are maintaining the midpoint and narrowing the range of growth to 9.5% to 10.5%, previously 9% to 11%. We are increasing our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 11% to 13%, previously 10% to 13%. This change in guidance signals increased confidence in the back half of the year due to the continuing outperformance of companion animal, easing of certain supply constraints and an improvement in our business in China.\nPlease note that our guidance for adjusted interest expense and/or ID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance as of late July and reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to the narrowing of our range and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.325 billion. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.97 to $5.05 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.75.\nWhile guidance represent our outlook for the full year, due to the unique factors impacting our business in 2022, I would like to note that our guidance for growth, especially for revenue and adjusted net income will be rated towards the end of the year. While we expect operating expenses to be incurred at a similar rate across the back half of the year, we are noting an easier OpEx pop in Q4 than Q3 due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter of last year.\nAlso, in Q3 of last year, we experienced an unusually low adjusted effective tax rate of 16.7% due to favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income and certain discrete items. We do not expect similar favorability this year. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term. Our success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation, and an infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future.\nNow I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.\nIn addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.\n(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVP of IR, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.\nFor a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings including but not limited to our annual reports on Form 10-K and our reports on form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 5, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call for 2022. Zoetis delivered a strong quarter to start the year with 9% operational revenue growth and 8% operational growth in adjusted net income driven by the strength of our companion animal portfolio. We generated similar growth for both the U.S. and international segments, with 9% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Our strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies and diagnostics are all capitalizing on the marriage of positive trends in pet care with customer-driven science coming from Zoetis.\nIn the first quarter, we grew 20% operationally in our companion animal portfolio. As we expected, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 6% operationally in the quarter largely due to declines in swine product sales in China and generic competition from DRAXXIN. As we look at the rest of the year, we are updating our guidance to reflect the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates, but this has no impact on our previous operational growth rates and assumptions for the year, even as we face uncertainties related to the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns, inflation and ongoing supply chain constraints, we remain confident in the underlying strength and performance of our business.\nOur diverse portfolio, global scale, talented colleagues and continuous innovations remain the foundation of our long-term success and durability, and we continue to invest in the resources, marketing programs and manufacturing capacity we need to support our growth. In R&D, we're building new capabilities and pipeline across our companion animal and livestock portfolios to ensure our long-term performance.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products and indications, develop life cycle innovations for major brands and expand our portfolio into new markets. On the livestock side of the business, we expanded our cattle vaccine portfolio with an approval in the U.S. of Protiviti, the first modified live vaccine to offer protection against mycoplasma Bovis. This vaccine provides cattle producers and veterinarians with broader overall protection against bovine respiratory disease. We also gained approval in Brazil for Draxxin KP, which is also a treatment for BRD and combines the antimicrobial properties of DRAXXIN with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ketoprofen to rapidly reduce fever in a single dose. Draxxin KP is also approved in the U.S., Canada and European Union, Australia and Mexico, and it has been an important part of how we continue to distinguish the DRAXXIN brand in the face of generic competition.\nIn poultry, we received approval in Brazil for Poulvac® Procerta™ HVT-IBD, our recombinant vector vaccine that is also approved in the U.S. and Canada. On the companion animal side of the business, we received another approval for Solensia, the industry's first monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis pain in cats, adding Australia to the U.S., European Union, U.K., Canada and Switzerland and another mAb therapy, Cytopoint, received a claim extension in Canada so it now covers both the treatment of atopic dermatitis and allergic dermatitis in dogs.\nCytopoint and Apoquel continue to grow significantly and expand the dermatology market as disease awareness and treatment options become more known to pet owners. We have a strong leadership position based on our innovative science and do not believe competing products will come to market in 2022. We also continue building our multipurpose diagnostics platform, Vetscan images with the recent addition of blood smear testing. Introduced in September 2020, Vetscan images is a first-of-its-kind technology with a multitude of applications, including AI fecal analysis, digital cytology image transfer and now AI Blood smear, all helping veterinarians broaden their in-clinic diagnostic offerings to provide the best care possible for dogs and cats.\nFor the last 2 years, I've been speaking to you about our catalyst for growth, and those continue to drive our performance. Our outlook for growth in international markets remains very positive based on a diverse global footprint and continued expansion opportunities for key brands like Simparica Trio, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia. In terms of Ukraine, we have condemned the Russian invasion from the outside, and we are deeply saddened by the senseless violence being brought upon the people of Ukraine. Our company, colleagues and the Zoetis Foundation have worked together to provide veterinary care, medicines, financial support and evacuation assistance to those in need. With every decision, even the most difficult and complex ones, we're guided by our purpose to nurture the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. While we have suspended all investments and promotional activities in Russia, the continued care of pets and livestock remains an essential responsibility for Zoetis and our colleagues, and we remain focused on maintaining a critical supply of animal medicines and vaccines for veterinarians and producers there.\nWe anticipate a negative impact of about 1% to our original full year growth expectations due to Ukraine and Russia, but we are maintaining our previous operational growth rates based on the overall strength of our companion animal business and the positive momentum of expanding our U.S. pet care and diagnostic commercial teams.\nSpeaking of Diagnostics, another catalyst for growth, we delivered 12% operational growth in the first quarter. We continue to invest significantly in this space to accelerate our growth. For example, we've been shifting our go-to-market model this year and building a dedicated field force for our diagnostics portfolio. This hiring is a significant part of a 40% increase to our total U.S. companion animal field force. We see field force expansion as a key lever to supporting growth opportunities in our diagnostics and pet care businesses. We also continue to see very strong growth in pet care as we expand our major companion animal brands in markets around the world.\nSimperica Trio is doing very well as it continues to gain market share based on veterinarians preference for an innovative triple combination parasiticide for dogs. Pet owners have also been demonstrating strong loyalty rates after trying Trio, and we are excited by the ability of our direct-to-consumer campaigns and additional field force colleagues to increase interest in this product.\nLibrela is also doing incredibly well across Europe, and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. As we see improvements in supply, we will be launching Solensia in additional markets such as Canada and Australia this year. In terms of the U.S., we are still planning a launch of Solensia in the second half of the year, and we anticipate approval for Librela by the end of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside of the U.S. Overall, we continue to benefit from pet care trends in terms of increased demand, clinic revenues, pet ownership and spending habits.\nFinally, a brief update on supply. As I mentioned last quarter, we are managing certain isolated supply constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products as we compete for some limited manufacturing inputs critical to human health during the pandemic. We were also seeing additional global supply challenges related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent COVID-19 resurgence in China.\nWhile some of these challenges are Global manufacturing and supply network to mitigate any impact to our overall business. And our commercial teams are ensuring control launches for new products and coordinating with customers to minimize any impacts on their animal care. In conclusion, we are off to a good start for the year, and we're maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year. Our diverse and durable portfolio, global scale and pipeline of innovations have us well positioned to meet customer needs and shareholder expectations for this year and beyond.\nThank you. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year with continued growth across a number of our core product franchises. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $625 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is on price and 6% from volume. Volume growth of 6% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and Librela, 3% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 2%. The decline in other in-line products was expected and largely the result of a difficult comparison to the prior year and the impact of our swine business in China.\nCompanion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 20% operationally with livestock declining 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, where our innovative and diverse fleas, tick and heartworm portfolio drove growth of 25% operationally. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $164 million, representing operational growth of 83% versus the comparable 2021 period. In Q1, Simparica Trio was the #1 canine parasiticide sold in the U.S. in terms of revenue, and we recently launched Trio in Japan, a sizable international heartworm market. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had significant global growth again with $307 million of revenue, representing 28% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 24% in the first quarter.\nIn Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody Librela, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference grew 24% in the first quarter.\nIn Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody, umbrella, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference lab. I think revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from our parasiticide portfolio as well as key dermatology products.\nGrowth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $147 million in the U.S., growing 77%. We continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics with additional runway for future revenue growth. Federal on and satisfaction material is approximately 90% Key dermatology products sales were $194 million for the quarter, growing 23% with APOQUEL and Capon each significantly contributing to growth. Our investment to support the portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic, and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dolls with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market.\nIn an effort to support all of our long-term sustainable sources of growth in our companion animal portfolio. In April, we launched our new pet care go-to-market strategy, expanding our U.S. companion animal field force by approximately 40% and creating dedicated and separate diagnostic and pharma coverage for our portfolio of products. U.S. livestock declined 11% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business. This was expected as we experienced challenges from generic competition for Jackson, which didn't exist in the same quarter last year as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Meanwhile, upholstery business continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives resulting from reduced disease pressure from smaller foxises as well as generic competition for Zoamix.\nSwine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of favorable market conditions for producers and higher disease equivalence. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally, and livestock revenue declined 3% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from the growth of our key dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of ore pain and our parasite portfolio.\nSemak brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe, and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibody for OA pain with Librela generating $21 million and Cerencia delivering $3 million in first quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year. As we mentioned last quarter, Librela became the #1 pain product in the EU in the first year of launch, with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain at around 90%. Compliance exceeded our initial expectations, and we'll continue a significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. This decline was driven predominantly by our swine portfolio in China. As we indicated over the past several months, increased port supply in the market like to a significant decline in pork prices, which impacts producer profitability. In addition, our first quarter of 2021 presented a difficult comparative period as pricing and producer profitability in that quarter had been at an all-time high. While we expect China to return to growth in the back half of the year, we anticipate a challenging second quarter for our swine portfolio. Partially offsetting our decline in swine was growth in our fish, poultry and cattle portfolios.\nOur fish portfolio grew double digits again this quarter, driven by growth of the AlphafluxCLIce treatment product and AlphaGeLivVac vaccine for SRS in Chile. Sales of cattle products grew in key markets due to favorable market conditions and pricing in Brazil and Australia as well as demand generation efforts in emerging markets such as Turkey and China. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 71.6% improved Advertising and promotion as well as direct-to-pet owner campaigns for key brands. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points, driven by the impact of favorable discrete tax items and settlements with certain tax authorities, slightly offset by changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.\nAnd finally, adjusted net income grew 8% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $115 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We purchased approximately $361 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest dollar-based quarterly share repurchase ever. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2022.\nForeign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late April and reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Please note that any update to our full year guidance are related directly and only to foreign exchange and that the ranges of our operational growth rates for revenue of 9% to 11% and adjusted income of 10% to 13% remained the same as our previous February guidance. We are holding these top and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio.\nBeginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%. and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.25 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%.\nFor adjusted net income for the year -- adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.365 billion to $2.4 billion, while maintaining our expected operational growth of 10% to 13%. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.99 to $5.09 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.77. Sales of companion animal products will be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse prior silicide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and growth in point-of-care diagnostics.\nWe also continue to see a very favorable global companion animal backdrop for 2022. For livestock, the fundamental macro trends, which make animal protein on essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023. While our guidance represents our expectations for the full year, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth for the remainder of 2022. We expect top line operational growth for Q2 to be slightly below Q1 as today business and certain supply chain activities.\nWe also expect a similar foreign exchange impact in Q2 that we experienced in Q1, where reported revenue was negatively impacted by about 3%. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support future revenue growth, including field force expansion in the U.S. and incremental DTC advertising will drive OpEx growth in Q2 at a faster rate than revenue, impacting Q2 bottom line profitability more materially than in the back half of the year. We expect that foreign exchange in Q2 will have a negative impact to the bottom line of about 5%. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.\nOur success is derived from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, and agile and disciplined innovation engine and our infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We extract to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\n\nSteven Frank\n\nVP of IR, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.\nOur remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's filings dated today, Tuesday, February 15, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\n\nKristin C. Peck\n\nCEO & Director, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our year-end earnings call for 2021. I am happy to report that Zoetis delivered its strongest performance ever in 2021, thanks to our innovative, diverse and durable portfolio and the talent and commitment of our colleagues.\nWe grew revenue 15% operationally, which is once again above the anticipated growth rate for the animal health market, and these results were highlighted by 27% operational growth in our companion animal portfolio with 1% operational growth in livestock. Our parasiticide dermatology vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibody therapies all contributed to these strong results driven by the positive trends in pet care, trends that we see continuing to be a key growth driver in 2022 and beyond.\nFrom a segment perspective, we saw solid balance across our global footprint with the U.S. up 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Operationally, for the year, China grew 25%, Brazil grew 28% and other emerging markets grew 22%, leading the way for our international performance.\nAnother major growth driver for the year has been our global diagnostics portfolio, which grew 21% operationally with significant strength in international markets and the continued launch of VetScan Imagyst, our AI-driven diagnostics platform. Based on the strong revenue performance, we were able to deliver 19% operational growth in adjusted net income for the year while investing significantly in our latest product launches as well as staffing, R&D and manufacturing projects for future growth.\nLooking ahead, we believe this momentum sets us up well for 2022. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in the coming year driven by continued strength in pet care, expansion of our diagnostics portfolio internationally as significant growth in both companion animal and livestock product sales for emerging markets, including China and Brazil.\nAs a result, we are guiding to full year operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue. Wetteny and I will discuss more details about the full year 2022 guidance. But let me share some views on the year and other updates. First, the essential nature of animal health continues to be affirmed by our performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen the fundamental drivers such as increased emphasis on pet wellness, a growing global population and continuous consumption of animal-based proteins all reinforce the animal health industry as a positive investment choice.\nIn terms of the companion animal market, people's commitment to the health and well-being of their pets has continued to drive higher spending and new opportunities for innovation, geographic expansion and increasing levels of care.\nPet owners spending in animal health remains one of the more durable trends in consumer spending as people place a premium on the health and wellbeing of their pets, even during challenging economic times. In January, the Human Animal Bond Research Institute and Zoetis released the results of a new global survey of more than 16,000 pet owners and 1,200 small animal clinics which reinforce how deep the connection is between pets and pet owners and how that dynamic relates to views on veterinary care and the related benefits of pet ownership.\nIn the study, 92% of respondents said there was no reason they could ever be convinced to give up their pets and 86% said they would pay whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. The strength of the human animal bonds strongly correlated with higher rates of veterinary treatment for both preventative care and specific conditions in their pets. This study and other research support our focus on advancing an innovative pipeline for pain, dermatology and parasiticide for pets, and we continue to invest in our field force, direct-to-consumer marketing and manufacturing capacity to bring these products to market.\nMoving on to the livestock industry. The need for safe and reliable sources of animal protein continues to be a fundamental growth driver for the industry, particularly in emerging markets. In any given year, weather, disease and market dynamics may have various regional impacts, but the underlying demand continues to be served locally or through global trade across more than 100 markets where Zoetis products are sold.\nWe've continued to see Zoetis livestock business show modest growth during the pandemic and recent economic challenges based on our strength internationally. We see that international growth continuing this year while we continue to see declines in the U.S. driven primarily by generic competition in certain product lines. Our competitive strategies in pricing and new life cycle innovations will help us mitigate some of that impact.\nLivestock products are a key element of our global strategy and long-term growth, and we've continued to expand our vaccine product lines like Poulvac Procerta for poultry and ALPHA JECT micro for fish as well as Draxxin KP as a treatment for cattle. We're also exploring more livestock innovations around greater efficiency, precision animal health and more sustainable food production. We've been focusing on our investments in vaccines for prevention and maintaining healthy animals, data analytics for more individualized animal care and research into other sustainability improvements around immunotherapies.\nI was particularly excited by 2 recently announced additions to our precision animal health portfolio, Performance Ranch, a new cloud-based cow-calf management software this simplified tracking of individual animal performance and health product usage and our new block yard platform, which is blockchain technology developed in cooperation with IBM to provide a secure way to share information across different segments of the animal production supply chain.\nFor Zoetis, we continue to stay focused on our 5 strategic priorities for the long term, and we are optimistic about the growth drivers we see for 2022. Pet care will remain a major growth driver for Zoetis globally based on our diverse and innovative portfolio. We see continued growth potential for our dermatology portfolio which surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2021.\nOur parasiticide, driven by our triple combination, Simparica Trio as well as Revolution Plus, Stronghold Plus, Simparica and ProHeart 12 will continue to achieve growth as we gain market share in major markets and look at further life cycle innovations and label gains across the portfolio.\nLibrela and Solensia are monoclonal antibodies for control of osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats will continue to increase their revenue in 2022 primarily in the EU, and we're making regulatory progress for these products in the U.S. We received FDA approval for Solensia in January with the launch expected in the second half of the year, and we still anticipate approval of Librela in the second half of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at a facility outside the U.S. As we begin 2022, we are seeing strong demand in the EU for Librela and Solensia and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term.\nWe continue to optimize our global supply chain and manage ongoing challenges, which have been creating isolated constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products. As always, maintaining a consistent reliable supply for our customers is our top priority, and we've been communicating with them about any impact to their orders. We want to ensure all pets can continue their treatments without interruption especially for chronic treatment of OA pain.\nOur global manufacturing network is working around the clock to ensure reliable supply for our customers as they did throughout 2021, and our full year guidance and strong growth reflects our views on supply. Diagnostics is our next major growth driver in 2022 with a fully integrated point-of-care business that is prime for strong growth internationally, along with the expansion plans for a relatively new reference lab operations.\nWe are making significant progress in one of the fastest-growing markets for animal health. We're adding more dedicated field force and customer service resources while developing more offerings that will leverage our portfolio across the continuum of care. And finally, we see significant growth opportunities in emerging markets, including China and Brazil, where we see excellent opportunities for both our companion animal and livestock products based on increased medicalization and other positive trends.\nMeanwhile, our R&D team, along with external partners, will continue to generate the industry's most productive pipeline in the years to come with more than $500 million in R&D spending in 2021 our largest ever annual investment for R&D. We continue progressing research to address allergies, livestock health, chronic pain and inflammation, chronic kidney disease and diagnostics through our vaccines, therapeutics and digital technology platforms.\nIn conclusion, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another terrific year and for always bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers every day. Zoetis remains well positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth to investors in 2022 and beyond. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny.\n\nWetteny N. Joseph\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Zoetis Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was an exceptional year for us with revenue of $7.8 billion and adjusted net income of $2.2 billion both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 16% on a reported basis and 15% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 21% on a reported basis and 19% operationally.\nLooking deeper into the 2021 numbers, price contributed 1% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 14%. Volume growth consisted of 6% from other in-line products, 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio and 3% from key dermatology products. Revenue growth was again broad-based with the U.S. growing 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Our strong performance was driven by our innovative, diverse and durable companion animal portfolio, which grew 27% operationally.\nOur livestock business, which faced generic competition on key franchises as well as challenging macro conditions in certain markets, grew 1% operationally on a year-over-year basis. Performance in companion animal was led by our small animal parasiticide portfolio bolstered by full year sales of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $425 million, an increase of $305 million compared to 2020 sales. Sales of Simparica also grew double digits for the year with operational revenue growth of 13%. For the year, the Simparica franchise grew 82% operationally with revenue of approximately $0.75 billion.\nOur key dermatology products performed incredibly well, growing 24% operationally with approximately $1.2 billion in revenue for the year, performing above our expectations. Our diagnostics portfolio grew 21% operationally in the year with strong contributions from our U.S. and international segments, and we will continue to make meaningful investments in the coming years to drive global growth. We do believe the adoption of diagnostics products and services outside the U.S. represents larger growth opportunities geographically and feel we are favorably positioned to capture future growth in those markets.\nOur -- performance in 2021 depicts the importance of geographical diversification. Generic competition and challenging market conditions weighed on our U.S. performance but were offset by solid growth internationally primarily in emerging markets. The modest lifestyle growth on a global basis was in line with our expectations for the year.\nMoving on to our Q4 financial results. We posted another strong quarter with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 9% on both a reported and operational basis. Adjusted net income of $474 million is an increase of 8% on a reported basis and 5% operationally of the 9% operational revenue growth, 1 percentage from price and 8% from volume. Volume growth of 8% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio, 2% from key dermatology products and 1% from other in-line products.\nCompanion animal products led the way in terms of -- growth, growing 21% operationally, with -- 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Small animal parasiticides were the largest contributor to growth in the quarter where our innovative and diverse fleet, tick and heartworm portfolio was 32% operationally. Simparica Trio posted revenue of $124 million, representing operational growth versus the comparable 2020 period and the third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $100 million. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, again, had significant global growth in the quarter with $360 million of revenue, representing 23% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key -- grew 27% in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOur livestock business declined 6% in the quarter as a result of generic competition for DRAXXIN unfavorable market conditions in the U.S., primarily resulting from elevated input costs as well as softer conditions in China, loss driven by reduced pork prices. Our fish business grew double digits in the quarter, and along with the strength of our emerging markets, partially offset the broader decline. Overall livestock performance in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations.\nNow moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 9%, with companion animal products growing 20% and livestock sales declining by 13%. U.S. pet care vet practice trends remained robust in Q4, with practice revenue growing approximately 8% with visits growing 3% despite challenging prior year comps. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales from our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We are driving growth in both therapeutic areas by making meaningful investments primarily through direct-to-consumer advertising and field force, and we continue to be pleased by the return on investment the programs are yielding.\ngrowth in Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $114 million growing more than 100%. We also met our penetration target and continue to take share within the clinics. Key dermatology sales were $216 million for the quarter, growing 22% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each growing significantly. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic, and we'll continue to invest meaningfully in this space as the large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain untreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market.\nU.S. livestock fell 13% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business which, as expected, was challenged by generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Our poultry business was negatively affected by reduced disease pressure from smaller lot sizes as well as generic competition while swine faced competitive pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccine products.\nMoving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on a reported and operational basis in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally, and livestock revenue declined 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our key dermatology products, our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of OA pain and our parasiticide portfolio. Several key brands are benefiting from our international DTC campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe, and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. Overall, companion animal grew double digits operationally in every major market in the quarter.\nWe are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $15 million and Solensia delivering $3 million in fourth quarter sales. In the fourth quarter, Librela became the #1 pain product in the EU in its first year with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates were in excess of 90%, and compliance rates exceeded our initial expectations. In the past, we've highlighted the significant opportunity to expand the pain market. Therefore, we were extremely pleased to see approximately 40% of Librela and Solensia sales were from patients receiving medication for the first time.\nInternational livestock declined 2% operationally in the quarter as declines in cattle and swine were partially offset by growth in fish and poultry. Cattle declines were largely in the EU and Canada as generic competition for DRAXXIN weighed on sales. The decline in swine sales was primarily the result of lower pork prices in China negatively impacting producer profitability. Our fish portfolio grew double digits again this quarter driven primarily by growth of ALPHA JECT in Chile and the growth in poultry was largely attributed to further key account penetration.\nNow moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 69.6% increased 190 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year resulted from favorable product mix, lower inventory charges, favorable FX and price. This was partially offset by higher freight, manufacturing and other costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with compensation-related costs being the primary driver of the 15% operational increase in SG&A as well as 3% operational increase in R&D expenses. Increased international advertising and promotion expense for key brands also contributed to higher SG&A, while R&D had increased project spend in the quarter.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%, an increase of 510 basis points driven by the impact of prior year discrete tax benefits and changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 5% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 6% operationally for the quarter.\nIn December, we announced a 30% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $200 million of Zoetis shares and announced the authorization of a $3.5 billion multiyear share repurchase program. Because we generate significant free cash flow, we have the ability to grow our business through organic investments and business development and return excess cash to shareholders without consuming our cash balance or being dependent on elevated leverage.\nNow moving on to guidance for 2022. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact versus prior year by approximately $160 million on revenue, which is roughly 200 basis points and approximately $0.12 on EPS, which is about 250 basis points. For 2022, we are projecting revenue between $8.325 billion and $8.475 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse parasiticide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and the growth in point-of-care diagnostics and reference labs. We see a very favorable companion animal backdrop for 2022. While expecting certain vet clinics trends to moderate over time, we believe they will remain above pre-pandemic levels.\nThe catalyst for growth in 2022 and beyond stem from a younger pet owner demographic and the standard of care increases, which took shape over the prior 2 years. Our innovative portfolio, geographic representation and significant investments in key brands have us positioned extremely well to capture a meaningful portion of that growth.\nWe anticipate modest livestock growth again in 2022 led by the contributions of our emerging markets. The macro trends, which makes livestock and essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023.\nI'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with companion animal, we do not assume a triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2022 to compete against Simparica Trio or competitive entrants for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. As Kristin mentioned, in 2022, we expect Librela to become a blockbuster product in the first full year of sales with revenue exceeding $100 million largely from the EU markets. We remain very optimistic about the potential of Solensia as well. While the revenue curve will have a different shape due to the lack of an established feline pain market, we review Solensia as a long-term blockbuster product, which suggested a significant unmet need in animal health.\nIn livestock, we expect generic competition to negatively impact DRAXXIN revenue by approximately 20% in 2022 comparable to the impact we saw this year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29%, where favorable product mix and price are expected to generate margin expansion.\nAdjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion with the increase from 2021 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including investments to support new and existing products as well as diagnostics. Adjusted R&D expense for 2022 is expected to be between $540 million and $560 million.\nZoetis is the leader in animal health because of the novel products, disruptive innovation and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. Our internal R&D engine remains the primary source of innovation, and we are committed to ensuring it will continue to be significantly funded as a priority in capital allocation.\nAdjusted interest and other income inductions are expected to be approximately $240 million, representing a minimal year-over-year change. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2022 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2022 is primarily related to the favorable impact of foreign derived intangible income and nonrecurring net discrete tax benefits that occurred in 2021.\nAdjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.470 billion, representing operational growth of 10% to 13%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We are anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures in 2022 primarily related to investments in manufacturing expansions in Ireland, the U.S. and China. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.19 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.87.\nWhile guidance represents our expectations for full year financials, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth in 2022. We expect top line growth to be fairly consistent between the first half and second half of the year. However, due to the impact of generic competition for DRAXXIN, isolated supply constraints and the continued weakness of our swine business in China, we expect growth in the first quarter of 2022 to be lower than the remaining 3 quarters. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support revenue growth, primarily in companion animal, including diagnostics, along with very challenging comparative periods for T&E and other expenses, will impact Q1 materially more than the subsequent quarters.\nNow to summarize. 2021 was another exceptional year, our best performing year with 15% operational revenue growth and 19% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our guidance for 2022 reflects the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and establish new markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

I'm Mike Beckman, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Haviv Ilan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.\nThis call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website.\nThis call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.\nYou likely saw last week, we announced that the Board of Directors has elected Haviv Ilan, Chairman of the Board, beginning January 2026. Haviv succeeds Rich Templeton, who will retire as Chairman after a 45-year career with TI. I'm sure you will join me in congratulating them both.\nToday, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he will provide insight into third quarter revenue results with some details on what we are seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management as well as share the guidance for fourth quarter 2025.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Haviv.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThanks, Mike. I'll start with a quick overview of the third quarter. Revenue came in about as expected at $4.7 billion, an increase of 7% sequentially and an increase of 14% year-over-year. Analog and Embedded both grew year-on-year and sequentially. Analog revenue grew 16% year-over-year and Embedded Processing grew 9%. Our Other segment grew 11% from the year ago quarter. Let me provide a few comments about the current market environment.\nThe overall semiconductor market recovery is continuing, though, at a slower pace than prior upturns likely related to the broader macroeconomic dynamics and overall uncertainty. That said, customer inventories remain at low levels and their inventory depletion appears to be behind us. We are well positioned with capacity and inventory and have flexibility to support a range of scenarios.\nNow I'll share some additional insights into third quarter revenue by end market. First, the industrial market increased about 25% year-on-year and was up low single digits sequentially following a strong result in the second quarter. The automotive market increased upper single digits year-on-year and around 10% sequentially with growth across all regions. Personal electronics grew low single digits year-on-year and grew upper single digits sequentially. Enterprise Systems grew about 35% year-on-year and grew about 20% sequentially. And lastly, communications equipment grew about 45% year-on-year and was up about 10% sequentially.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability and capital management.\n\nRafael R. Lizardi\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Accounting Officer, Finance & Operations, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, third quarter revenue was $4.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.7 billion or 57% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin decreased 50 basis points.\nOperating expenses in the quarter were $975 million, up 6% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.9 billion or 23% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.7 billion in the quarter or 35% of revenue and was up 7% from the year-ago quarter.\nNet income in the quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.48 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.10 reduction, not in our original guidance. This includes $0.08 of restructuring charges related to efforts to drive operational efficiencies to support our long-term strategy, including the planned closures of our last 250-millimeter fabs.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion in the quarter and $6.9 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter and $4.8 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $2.4 billion. This includes $637 million of CHIPS Act incentives, including a $75 million payment received in the third quarter related to the direct funding agreement.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $119 million of our stock. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 4%, marking our 22nd consecutive year of dividend increases. This reflects our continued commitment to return free cash flow to our owners over time. In total, we returned $6.6 billion to our owners in the past 12 months.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with $5.2 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt outstanding is $14 billion with a weighted average coupon of 4%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, up $17 million from the prior quarter, and days were 215, down 16 days sequentially. We have executed well on building an inventory position, which we believe will allow us to consistently deliver high levels of customer service.\nTurning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI's revenue in the range of $4.22 billion to $4.58 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.39. Our fourth quarter outlook includes changes related to the new U.S. tax legislation and now assumes an effective tax rate of about 13%. In addition, we expect our effective tax rate in 2026 to be about 13% to 14%.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Mike.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the line for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?",

Today, we'll provide the following updates.\nFirst, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he will provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover financial results, give an update on capital management, as well as share the guidance for third quarter 2025. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Mike. Let me start with a quick overview of the second quarter. Revenue came in about as expected at $4.4 billion, an increase of 9% sequentially, and an increase of 16% year-over-year. Both Analog and Embedded grew year-on-year and sequentially. Analog revenue grew 18% year-over-year, and Embedded Processing grew 10%. Our Other segment grew 14% from the year-ago quarter. Let me provide some comments on the current environment and what we saw in the second quarter. We continue to see two distinct dynamics at play. First, tariffs and geopolitics are disrupting and reshaping global supply chains. As we work closely with our customers, we are\nleveraging our global manufacturing capabilities to support their needs. We have flexibility and are prepared to navigate as things evolve. Second, the semiconductor cycle is playing out. Cyclical recovery is continuing while customer inventories remain at low levels.\nIn times like this, it is important to have capacity and inventory, and we are well positioned. Now, I'll share some additional insights into Q2 revenue by end market. First, the Industrial market increased upper teens year-on-year and mid-teens sequentially, with recovery across all sectors. The Automotive market increased mid-single digits year-on-year and decreased low single digits sequentially. Personal Electronics grew around 25% year-on-year and grew upper single digits sequentially. Enterprise Systems grew about 40% year-on-year and grew about 10% sequentially. And lastly, communications equipment grew more than 50% year-on-year and was up about 10%\nsequentially. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability and capital management.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, Q2 revenue was $4.4 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.6 billion, or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 110 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $1 billion, up 5% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.9 billion, or 23% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.6 billion in the quarter, or 35% of revenue, and was up 25% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the quarter was $1.3 billion, or $1.41 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital\nmanagement results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $6.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis.\nCapital expenditures were $1.3 billion in the quarter and $4.9 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.8 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $302 million of our stock. In total, we returned $6.7 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remained strong with $5.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we issued $1.2 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding is $14.15 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 4%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, up $125 million from the prior quarter, and days were 231, down 9 days sequentially.\nTurning to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect TI's revenue in the range of $4.45 to $4.80 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.60. Our earnings per share outlook does not include changes related to recently enacted US tax legislation and assumes an effective tax rate of about 12% to 13%. In closing, as we transition into the second half of 2025 and going into 2026, we're prepared for a range of scenarios. We are and will remain flexible to navigate, especially in the immediate term. We will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a\nbroad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions.\nWe will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Mike.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the line for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the Star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, if I think how your tone sounded last quarter, and frankly, even how you sounded kind of mid-quarter, you seemed really confident that the cyclical recovery was here and we were kind of off to the races. And now I'm hearing you kind of saying you're staying flexible to go after a range of scenarios. And even in the quarter, auto was down sequentially. I guess, what's going on? How is your, I guess, outlook and feeling about where things are? How has that changed over the last three months? Because you sound, I guess, just based on tone and everything else, it doesn't sound maybe quite as exuberant as maybe you sounded a few months\nago. What's going on?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nHey, Stacy. I'll take this one. So first, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing two dynamics at play, and one of them is the cyclical recovery. I think we talked through it in the second quarter call back in April, and the discussion was all about industrial is joining the pack. We are now one more quarter in, and this is the third quarter that we see a signal of industrial recovering. It's actually accelerated. So I can say we support five markets. We now have it started with PE, then enterprise, and comms joined, and industrial is already in. So we have four out of five markets recovering in a nice pace. And this is part of the reason we've added commentary on year-over-year performance to\njust show the dynamics over there.\nIn terms of Automotive, to your question, look, Automotive, let's just remember that it's kind of a year delayed versus Industrial, right? Industrial peaked, for us at least, in Q3 2022. Automotive peaked one year later in Q3 2023. So one could expect Automotive to be joining last. The Automotive recovery has been shallow, meaning we are running single digits versus the peak. We are running year-over-year. We are actually having some growth in Q2 from a year-over-year perspective, but at a very low level. So I will say that Automotive has not recovered yet. But because of content growth, I think the cycle here is going to be less pronounced and more shallow.\nThe second point related to getting ready, look, we had some taste of it in the beginning of the second quarter, and we talked through it a lot during the call. But I think all this situation of tariffs and geopolitics disrupting supply chains, I think that's not over, right? It's true that there is pause right now on the semiconductor tariffs, both in the US and in China. But we have to be prepared for what the future may hold. So we want to make sure, and this is also the message to our customers, that we'll remain flexible and we'll know how to support our customers whatever the environment is moving forward.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nDo you have a follow-up, Stacy?\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI do, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up. Actually, I think I want to ask about gross margins. We'll go there. If I just back into the guidance for next quarter, it seems like you're guiding gross margins probably down sequentially, implicitly, on revenue growth. I guess, is that the case? And what is that? Is that just depreciation? I know depreciation went up in the quarter. Is it just depreciation going up further, or is something else going on on the gross margin line, or what?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Stacy, so I'll take that. So to help you and everyone with their models, where you should be landing given our guidance is GPM percent about flat, despite the higher depreciation that we're going to have going into Q3. OpEx about flat. And then what you're probably missing is the net of other income and expense, and interest expense. That's going to be unfavorable, about $20 million, as we have lower cash levels, interest is lower, while debt interest expense has continued to increase. So that's the part that's probably missing to round out your model.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right. Thanks, Stacy.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWell, move on to our next caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. One of the signs of cyclical recovery is improvement in your turns business. Did the team see turns business grow sequentially in Q2, both in dollars and percent of revenues, and was it broad-based across both your industrial and auto businesses?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me start, and maybe Mike can comment right after. So I think, yeah, from a turns perspective, we see a continuation of that dynamic. We saw, again, acceleration in Q2. We continue to invest in our inventory. Our lead times are at the lowest level. Customer inventories are very low. So we've seen that continuing. And Mike, maybe you want to provide some more color here.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I think we've talked about in previous quarters. That's something that late last year and in the first quarter began to build. We continue to see that into the second quarter as well.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. And then for my follow-up question, good to see the continued sequential in year-over-year recovery in the Industrial segment. It's quite diverse, right? 10 subsegments, but the largest subsegment, industrial automation, which is tied to manufacturing activity, is pretty sensitive to trade and tariffs. So just wondering if this segment is relatively weaker due to tariff concerns, or are you seeing shipment and order recovery here as well, especially among your China-based Industrial customers?\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, maybe I'll take that one. What we actually saw in industrial was, recovery was broad, and it was across all sectors. I'd say that it's a continuation of the recovery we saw in Q1, and that's where we are. I'll move on to the next caller. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for the question. Kind of going back to the first question, just kind of the tone, and it seems like a little bit of a tone change on our side, maybe not so much to you, but maybe I'll try to ask it a different way. You highlighted the uncertainties about the tariff side of things, but then endorsed the cycle was coming. Last quarter, you guided significantly above normal seasonality. You seemed to lean in on the cycle side and didn't really say that tariffs were doing much. So did something change? Any of the strength of the cycle or the uncertainty around the tariff to lead you to guide to more of a typical seasonal quarter for Q3?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me put some more color into it, Ross. I think it's a great question. So remember, when we met here in April, we dealt with reciprocal tariffs on both sides. The US was exempting semis, but China had a 125% tariff rate on semis during the call, right? So just a different situation versus where we are now. Now tariffs are put on hold. So a little bit of a different environment. I will say that we—and I think I mentioned it also during the last call—when there is a change of dynamics, like tariffs are being added, and I go back to April, customers are sitting on very low inventories. I think it's a good assumption to make that customers will want to have a little bit more inventory. And we\ndid see that phenomenon.\nWe did see that in the early parts of the quarter, there was an acceleration of demand. And as expected, when customers are sitting on no inventories and there is a lot of noise around tariffs, that has normalized through the quarter. And we are kind of back to, right now, what drives our day-to-day is just a cyclical recovery. Now, as we forecast into Q3, and given the fact that we have a lot of real-time turns business that we have to kind of assess for the future, I think it's prudent to have a little bit of, or to remember that what we saw in Q2 is probably a combination of customers wanting to have a little bit more inventory because of tariffs and also the cyclical recovery. When\ncustomers make orders, they don't tell us why they want more parts.\nI would assume that some of it was for building a little bit of inventory on their shelves to protect themselves from tariffs, if you will. That is my assumption. Again, I don't know how the third quarter will play out, but that's part of the way we are forecasting Q3.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nRoss, do you have a follow-up?\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI do. Switching over to Rafael, just kind of on the CapEx side of things. How should we think, or is there any update on the CapEx and depreciation framework that you've given us for the annual numbers for this year and next year, especially given where you are in phase two, maybe going to phase three on the CapEx side? Just wanted to see if there's any incremental color there.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, happy to do that. The bottom line, there's no change, but let me go through those so that everybody has those. On CapEx for this year, 2025, we continue to expect to spend $5 billion. And for 2026, it's going to be between $2 billion and $5 billion, depending on revenue and growth expectations at that time. And we will update you on narrowing that CapEx window most likely later this year, okay? On depreciation, switching to depreciation, for 2025, we continue to expect $1.8 to 2 billion. And for 2026, we continue to expect $2.3 to 2.7 billion and likely to be at the lower side of that range.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, we'll move on to our next caller.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. Haviv, sorry to go back to this tone change, because it's not just from the last earnings call. It's at the end of a conference at the end of May. I think you had suggested that every remaining quarter of 2025 will accelerate from the first half up 13%, but your Q3 sales gap is up only 11%. So my question is that versus that reference point, which end market has softened? Is it that the industrial normalization is done? Is it that auto, right, was a little weaker? Or is that just extra conservatism on TI's part? Because the tone change is, as I mentioned, not just from earnings, but from the end of May.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, and again, I don't control probably tone level, but that's you guys are hearing it.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nBut you quantified it, Haviv. You quantified it. It wasn't just tone.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nSorry, directly to your question, Vivek, I would say that in Q2, we have seen industrial, in my opinion, running very hot, right? What were the numbers sequentially?\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nIt was up.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nMid-teens, I think.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nUpper teens, yeah.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nIt grew significantly year-over-year in the second quarter, close to 20%, right? So in that sense, I do believe it ran a little hot. This is where I want to be a little bit more cautious into Q3. We also saw, and I let Mike comment about geographies. We also saw a little bit of higher pull from China in the second quarter. We will have it in the Q when it comes out, but Mike, maybe you can give a little bit of a China by region, maybe, not only China behavior into Q.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nSure, yeah. So China, it was up about 19% sequentially, grew about 32% year-over-year. And all end markets grew there with the exception of automotive. And auto was pretty consistent with our overall results there. And industrial did lead the growth there in China. And just as a reminder, our China-headquartered customers represent about 20% of our overall revenue.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nAnd Vivek, that information gives you a little bit of why I want to be cautious for Q3, right? We have seen China running, again, a little bit hot in Q2. It was not across all markets, meaning on the automotive side, it behaved very similarly to the rest of the world. So it was not across the board. So we give you the data, that it's hard to decipher what exactly or to decouple what was related to \"pull-ins\" or what was related to cyclical recovery. I think both are happening, and that's the data we have right now, and that's what guides our third quarter as we plan for Q3.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nDo you have a follow-up, Vivek?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you, Mike. For my follow-up, given everything we have heard, I know you typically don't guide a quarter out, but how would you advise us to start thinking about Q4? That, should we assume a similar conservative tone and assume something that is usually your seasonality is, I think, down sequentially or flat sequentially? If you could remind us of that in Q4. Given everything we have heard, how should we just conceptually think about the move into Q4? Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nVivek, as you know, we are a one-quarter-of-the-time company specifically on guidance. So I will just say let's let the Q3 play out. Mike, do you want to comment about seasonality?\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, so historically, second and third are typically stronger quarters. Fourth and first are typically seasonally lower. But yeah, we'll have to let third quarter play out before we're going to be ready to talk about fourth. So maybe we'll go on to move on to our next caller. Thanks, Vivek.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping to revisit gross margins. You indicated flat, roughly, sequentially. And I guess within that, could you speak to your plans for utilization? Are there any sort of changes in mix? And if we were to normalize to kind of your more typical 80% kind of fall-through, that would be an incremental maybe $25 to $27 million. So is kind of the pause in gross margin uplift 100% due to that increase in depreciation, or are there other factors that we should be thinking about?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, just to give you a few more information there. As I said earlier and just restated, we expect Q3 gross margin to be about flat to Q2. That is with higher revenue, but also higher depreciation. In terms of loadings and inventory, we expect to run loadings about the same in Q3 as we did in Q2 as we are well-positioned with inventory to support a wide range of cyclical recovery scenarios. Inventory I expect to grow, but at a slower rate than the growth we just had in Q2. So hopefully that gives you, and then on the fall-through, we guide 75% to 85%. That's over the long term. That's over year-over-year, not any one quarter. But we should be close to that fall-through. We'll speak more about\nthat when we have actuals and we'll have better information to provide.\nBut you should continue to think of 75% to 85% as a good number to use over the long term.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nCJ, do you have a follow-up?\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor\n\nI do, thank you. With the ITC going from 25% to 35%, curious if you can comment on your thoughts on impact to your net CapEx into 2026, 2027, and is there any sort of movement or thought process that we should have around the impact of depreciation? Thanks so much.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, no, thanks for that question. So let's talk about that legislation that just passed. First, we're very pleased with the changes resulting from the passage of the recently enacted US federal tax law. It includes expensing of US R&D and eligible capital expenditures, an increase to the ITC from 25% to 35%, and changes to other tax provisions such as making FDII permanent. The effects of the new tax law are not reflected in the statement that we just released, in the financials that we just released since the passage of that law happened in July. We are currently evaluating the changes on the legislation that are going to have on future financial statements. That's why in the guide that we\ngave, we did not incorporate it. We need additional time to do a full evaluation.\nHowever, I would tell you that based on our initial assessment, what we expect, what will likely happen is our GAAP tax rate will increase in Q3 2025. However, it will decrease in 2026 and beyond. More importantly, from a cash flow standpoint, we expect significantly lower cash tax rates for the next several years. So again, we're very pleased with that legislation. Let me speak real quickly. You asked about CapEx plans specifically. Our CapEx plans remain consistent with what we shared in February and will depend on revenue.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right. We'll move on to our next caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe following up on some of the other questions that were asked, could you maybe comment on some of the end markets, whether it be Personal Electronics or Enterprise Systems or otherwise, that you think may have gotten a little bit ahead of themselves or maybe run a little bit hotter into Q2, and which ones you think are sort of at risk of reverting a little bit in Q3 and Q4? Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me take that. Remember that when we talk about the PE market and also enterprise and CE, they're all kind of running at different phases on their cyclical recovery. It started with really PE, then followed by enterprise and comms, and then industrial joined later. As I mentioned before, the Automotive market, again, a very shallow cycle, but we haven't seen enough signs of true broad recovery over there. Now, regarding the, if you go back to Q2, where we saw a little bit, I would say, markets that ran higher than expected was on the industrial. We did expect the cyclical recovery in industrial, but it did grow 15% sequentially, which is a little bit unnatural. When you add on top of\nit the geographic footprint, this is where I have a little bit of more cautiousness.\nI wouldn't mark anything else that behaved differently in Q2, Mike. Would you agree?\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThat's the right assessment.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, that's a market where we saw a little bit of, I think, I wouldn't say anxiety, but customers just preferring to just have more parts. We did see normalization through the quarter. So, think about the front end of the quarter was running faster than the second half of the quarter. We think we left the quarter at a normal rate, but it's very hard to assess right now. So we keep watching it, and that's the market where I want to be more cautious when I think about Q3.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right, do you have a follow-up?\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, I do. Thank you. Relative to capital allocation, you mentioned about the cash tax benefits that you expect that will positively impact free cash flow next year and beyond. You reiterated the CapEx guidance, but can you maybe kind of speak to the capital return portion of this? Obviously, if free cash flow is better, then what might you do differently or more on buybacks or dividends?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, that's a good question. It's going to depend, and it's going to depend on a number of factors. For instance, right now, we're still in the middle of a high CapEx environment, and we'll see how long that lasts. As we said, next year, we do have a range of two to five. So that's still, even at the low end, it's still a meaningful amount of CapEx, and we need to be ready for that. And there are other factors: cash on the balance sheet, the price of the stock price of the stock that also plays into our decision. So we'll take that all into account. But at the end of the day, our objective remains the same when it comes to returning capital to owners, and that is to return all free cash flow through\ndividends and buybacks.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right, thanks, Jim.\nLet's move on to our next caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, thank you. Good afternoon. The question is about fab loading and what your intentions are as we go through the back end of the year into next year. I guess in light of some of the caution that you expressed, any changes you're making to fab loading and basically where you want your internal inventories to sit as you exit the year?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, so I tell you, in an ideal world, what we would want to do, and of course, the world is not ideal, and we'll have to navigate through that, but in an ideal world, what we would do is manage the operations so that the loadings are relatively stable, relatively flat over time. And what happens during a cyclical upturn, we actually drain some inventory. And then during a cyclical downturn, we actually build some inventory. And that's how you get the factory to run effectively constant over that time. Of course, it's not an ideal environment. You never quite know when you're at peak, when you're at trough. So we'll have to add some guardrails to that to make sure that we maximize the\nopportunity and maintain flexibility. But at a high level, that's how we would like to run the company.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right, do you have a follow-up, Chris?\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nI do, thanks. And my follow-up is I could dig into auto a little bit more deeply. And it sounds like what you're saying there is auto hasn't really changed but hasn't recovered yet. That's a market where if you've got a few customers that you speak to there, what's their tone right now, given all the macro uncertainty? What are they doing with inventory levels and preparing now? Is it just sort of in a holding pattern right now with regard to auto?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I think that's a good description. In a way, and again, I look at my graph here in front of me. So automotive, again, peaked for us in Q3 2023. And in the last, I would say, sixth quarter, a little bit up, a little bit down, but hovering around a certain level of high single-digit down versus that number. And think about the automotive customers. Those who ship into the US, they have tariffs to deal with. So I don't think they want to. I think they're being cautious right now. And I think the orders we get is only when they really need it. I don't think there is any inventory replenishment there, not only at the OEMs, but also at the Tier 1 level. So everything is almost real-time.\nOur lead times are so low, and most of our automotive customers are on consignment. So we just get it real-time. So to your point, we haven't seen yet the recovery. But remember, industrial peaked in Q3 2022, and we saw the recovery starting in Q4 2024. So you can argue that automotive could be maybe a year later if you just keep the same duration. So is it going to be same time in the second half of the year? We'll just have to see real-time.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, Chris, thank you for the question. Let's move on to the next caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe following up on Chris's previous one, when you spoke about China, it was clear that auto was sort of the outlier there and was down in line with your broader auto business. I mean, it seems like China auto trends have been positive year to date, including in Q2. It doesn't sound like there's de-stocking going on. Can you maybe explain what's going on specifically in China auto? Is there any element of share loss happening there, or do you think it's more inventory dynamics? Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I think it's a good question. I think it's more the latter. Automotive ran very hot last year in China, and there was enough news out there that there was a little bit of a caution coming or guidance, say, Slow down some of the price wars over there. So I think we saw some of the dynamics. I think automotive business in China is doing well. I think from a year-over-year perspective, we grew the automotive business in Q2, but China was ahead of the rest of the market simply because, again, first in, first out. So we saw the recovery in China starting in 2024. I think it takes a little bit of a breather right now, but I think it's related to inventory correction on their side.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nI would just add, if you look across the major regions for us in auto, US, Europe, and China, they more or less perform pretty similarly on a sequential basis. They weren't vastly one stood out differently than the others. Now, when you look on a year-over-year, that's where China now is going to be leading.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nI would say China and Asia ahead, and then you go to Europe and Japan behind. Very coherent with what we've seen in other markets.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right, do you have a follow-up, Josh?\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYes, please. And so similarly, when you talked about China, it sounds like there was some element of potential pull-ins that were impacting Q2. You guys have talked for a while about having geopolitically dependable supply for the West. Are you seeing that on your customers outside of China at all? Have they changed their behaviors? And when should we expect sort of the share gains that you expect because of your US-based manufacturing to start to flow through the model? Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, so let me start with just you mentioned the pull-ins. We don't know. I just want to repeat that point. We just have to make assumptions. Customers don't tell us why they order. We just go through the data and try to decipher it, right? So we just can't rule out the possibility. And we say there was likely could have been some. When you see such a strong behavior in Q2 versus Q1, you have to attribute some of it to the tariff environment. Also, remember that in China, the Automotive market is more like what we call assigned accounts. We talk to the customers. We can explain to them the options. We have many industrial customers. It's just hard to get to everyone at once.\nI think it just takes longer to let customers know that TI is a diverse manufacturing footprint, and we've got their back. So I think that's part of what we've seen during the second quarter, plus the tariffs that took a breather after a month or so. Now, regarding the overall discussion on tariffs and our US manufacturing footprint, I think that's an important point. We've spent a lot of time during the last call talking about the challenges made in China and how we're navigating it. But remember, the environment is dynamic. Things are changing regularly, and tariffs and geopolitics will continue to evolve. And as I said in the prepared remark, reshape the supply chain. I think some of it is going to\nbe a little bit more permanent. So our customers are increasingly valuing our geopolitically dependable capacity.\nAnd in the US, I think, first, let me say, our global manufacturing footprint is optimized to support all of our customers worldwide. But if you go into the US, I do believe that the US will make US semis increasingly incentivized in the US. And we do have a unique position. These are not investments that were made during the last quarter. We have been working on it for the past five years. Again, not because we foreseen tariffs. We just wanted to control our destiny. And the best way for us, or the best efficiency for us to build our manufacturing footprint, was in the US. And I think that hasn't played out yet. We do have a few customers, you could probably count them on one hand, that are savvy\nand knowing how the plans could evolve.\nThey are already shifting and getting closer to us. But I think there is a lot of confusion at the broad customer base. People don't exactly understand the difference between reciprocal tariffs, sectoral tariffs, and what's going to come and when. There is a little bit of a wait and see. By the way, we don't know as well how things will evolve in the second half of the year. I will say that I believe our opportunity is greater than our challenge. While we are well-equipped and well, the diversity of our manufacturing footprint and supply chain is high, and we've proven it to our customers in Asia and specifically in China in the second quarter, I think TI is unique in the fact that we have a\nmanufacturing footprint in the US.\nIf US chips are indeed becoming incentivized in whatever ways they choose to do that, TI has a unique answer. Not only that we have the scale and the size of the required capacity, it's also very affordable. It's low cost, very competitive. Again, that opportunity has not played out yet, but we are ready for whatever changes we are going to meet in the second half of the year and beyond.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right, thanks, Josh. We'll move on to our last caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. It's a variation on the theme that we've listened to tonight. I think it was the past call, and if not, certainly during the quarter. So Steve, I think you characterized the environment as cyclical recovery is the signal and that tariffs and geopolitics are more noise and that the signal-to-noise ratio is very high. I think there was an expectation that the momentum that we saw in the first half of the year was going to extend. Yet, the guidance is sort of confusing in light of that view. Specifically, you just delivered a +16.5% result year-over-year, and I think you're guiding to +11.5%. So how do I reconcile this? Is the environment just much more noisy than what\nyou had characterized a quarter ago, or did something else change?\nIs there another way to describe what happened in the last quarter?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nNo, I think regarding a bit what happened, well, sorry, what happened in Q2, I think we were very open about it. As I said, we did see some dynamics within the quarter. It was more noisy, if you will, in the second half of the quarter. And it's very hard for us, as I said, to Vivek and others, to quantify how much of, and when you make guidance into the Q3 with the data we see right now, we just want to take a responsible approach. That's the data we have right now. That's the way we call it. I think during the last call, everybody was pushing back, \"How could it be that TI will grow 7% sequentially?\" And I think we've upsided there, right? So I think right now, maybe the expectations were\nhigher, but we are just calling the forecast the way we see it.\nWe have to let it play out. I will reiterate that I believe the cyclical recovery is strong, even if it's masked a little bit by this tariff environment. I think we now have four out of the five markets already in. I expect automotive to join. I just don't see it yet. And once we have all five markets pointing in the right direction, we'll be complete. This recovery is very, very different from any previous one. You can see it also at the slope of the recovery. When you look at the overall WSTS without memory trend, you can see a not very sharp return to trendline. We are still running 12% or 13%, I believe, below trendline. And there is a lot of, usually, when a cycle establishes itself, you first have to get a\ntrendline and then you have to establish the next peak.\nWe are still running double digits percentage-wise on units below trendline. So I think that's what we're seeing. We are not different than the rest of the market, I believe. And we'll just have to continue to let it play out. So that would be my answer to your question, Will.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nDo you have a follow-up?\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nYeah, if I can follow up one area that I hope might be a little bit more optimistic. In enterprise, I think you had a good quarter. And I'm wondering if you can remind us or update us as to your current and maybe future anticipated exposure to the rapid growth AI markets. Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, very well. Our enterprise market is mainly, I think, the largest sector over there for us is data center, data center compute. But it's not only data center. We also have, for example, large printers or enterprise printers over there and also projection devices. So we probably want to clarify that over time. But if I just focus on data center, and it's mainly today inside the enterprise market for TI, but also a little bit of the optical communication inside the comms, when I kind of cut out and I look at our data center story, that's behaving very well this year. It's growing very nicely. It's a very high level, above that 50% that I've mentioned before. And the future has a large opportunity for TI because we are\nseeing ourselves playing in more sockets over time.\nCurrently, our footprint on the data center side is more with our general purpose part. We have a large share over there. But we're also working closely with some key customers to expand our positions there to more application-specific opportunities. This is based on our new technology that is ramping right now in Sherman, Texas. We already have samples, and we are competing to win share over there. That's more of a tailwind, a potential tailwind for us in 2026 and beyond. So that's our data center story. And thanks for that question, Will.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, so let me wrap up with what we've said previously. At our core, we are engineers, and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and best metric to measure progress and generate value to owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. With that, thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

In addition, Mike Beckman has joined us. As you may know, I will be retiring, and Mike will replace me as Vice President of Investor Relations. Mike has worked at TI for nearly two decades and has worked directly with me in investor relations for five years. Mike will moderate today's call, and with that, let me turn it over to Mike.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Dave. I'm looking forward to the opportunity. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter, including insight into Q1 revenue results and some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets.\nNext, he'll share how we are approaching the overall market environment and provide guidance for Q2 2025. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and give an update on capital management. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Mike. Let me start with a quick overview of the Q1. Revenue came in at $4.1 billion, an increase of 2% sequentially, and an increase of 11% year-over-year. Analog revenue grew 13% year-over-year, and embedded processing was about flat, and both segments grew sequentially. Our Other segment grew 23% from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our Q1 revenue by end market. We continue to see recovery across our end markets, with Industrial showing broad recovery across sectors and geographies. We believe customer inventories are at low levels across all end markets. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market increased upper single digits after seven consecutive quarters of sequential decline. The automotive market increased low single digits.\nPersonal electronics declined mid-teens, in line with typical seasonal trends. Enterprise systems grew mid-single digits, and communications equipment was up about 10%. Before I go to our Q2 guidance, let me take a minute to frame how we are approaching the current environment. It is a time of high uncertainty in the world as tariffs and geopolitics are disrupting global supply chains and creating unpredictable economic conditions. Adding to that, semiconductors are highly visible as it is broadly understood that people and economies are increasingly dependent on chips. To navigate in this environment, we will continue to rely on our three key ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adopt and succeed in a world that is ever-changing, and we will be a company that we are proud to be part of and would be proud to have as our neighbor.\nThese guiding ambitions are not new. They have served us well for decades, and they are enormously valuable in times like these. We look at the current environment in two important categories: one, where we are in the phase of the semiconductor cycle, and two, providing geopolitically dependable capacity and navigating in a world that is changing. To help understand where we are in the cycle, we spent some time looking at previous events, including Y2K, the global financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. While no two scenarios are identical, these recent examples help inform our decisions as we prepare for a range of market scenarios. What may be unique right now is that we are at the bottom of the semiconductor cycle, and customer inventories are at low levels across all end markets.\nSo, relative to where we are, history says it is important to have capacity and inventory in times like these, and we are well-positioned. In addition, geopolitically dependable capacity will matter more, and it is increasingly critical and valuable to our customers. We have flexibility and are prepared to navigate the evolving supply chain dynamics. Translating all these to Q2 guidance, I would like to make three points. First, we remain cautious as there are many things still changing, and we are working with our customers to understand and support their needs. As such, potential impact on our customers, suppliers, and TI is unclear and will likely evolve. Second, at this time, we don't see near-term impact to Q2, and we expect TI's revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to 4.53 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.21 to 1.47.\nFinally, we will have to see what happens in the second half of 2025 and going into 2026, and we are prepared for a range of scenarios. We are and will remain flexible to navigate, especially in the immediate term. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability and capital management.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, Q1 revenue was $4.1 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, or 57% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin decreased 90 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $989 million, up 6% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.8 billion, or 24% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.3 billion in the quarter, or 33% of revenue, and was up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the quarter was $1.2 billion, or $1.28 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $849 million in the quarter and $6.2 billion on a trailing 12-month basis.\nCapital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter and $4.7 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.7 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $653 million of our stock. In total, we returned $6.4 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remained strong with $5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the Q1. In the quarter, we repaid $750 million of debt. Total debt outstanding is $12.95 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.93%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.7 billion, up $160 million from the prior quarter, and days were 240, down one day sequentially. For Q2, we now expect our effective tax rate to be about 12% to 13%.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Mike.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the line for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Again, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks much. So the guidance up 7%, that's even better than normal seasonal. I know this is a hard question to answer, but is there any way for you to know how much of this is pull-ins ahead of the tariffs? I mean, is there any way your discussions with customers, any of the tonality that's changed? Thanks.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nTim, thanks for the question. So first, before I talk about our approach into Q2, just as I said in my prepared remarks, we are looking at two different categories of change in front of us. One is related to the cycle, and the cycle we saw in Q1, a continued recovery. I think we mentioned before, I think it was in the previous call, that we have three markets now growing year-over-year and recovering. It was the PE or personal electronics market, enterprise, and comms. It's very obvious to us now that industrial is really joining the pack, and it's a large market for us.\nWe've seen some evidence in Q4, but based on what we've seen in Q1, I think this is a real recovery rather than the way I see it right now related to tariffs, at least not for the Q1, right? And the cycle has hit a bottom because we are seeing more and more evidence from customers that they are really, really short on inventory. They have sometimes a few days of inventory. We've seen that aging phenomena or orders within the quarter turns, as we call it, strengthening in Q4. It continued to do the same in Q1. So more and more evidence and signals that across all channels, all geographies, a recovery of the industrial market is here. Plus, the automotive market was always correcting in a very shallow manner.\nSo you can kind of say that the markets are now. We're pointing, pre the trade challenges, all up and to the right. Now, when you look at Q2, I think we have to be very cautious, as we said, about the forecast. So we are seeing that many things are still changing. It's a very, very dynamic environment, and I say sometimes by the day. And there is a potential impact on our customers, our suppliers, and also on our revenues. So it is unclear, and it will evolve, but as I see it, and we spent a lot of time on it, looking at past examples, understanding what the cycle is, and looking at the data we have in front of us, we don't see an immediate near-term impact.\nOf course, the customers wouldn't tell us why we see the orders coming in, but I would guess that at a time like this, when there is a little bit of anxiety, and do you want to have a little bit of more inventory on your shelves or less? So my guess is more, and that's maybe why we are seeing kind of, I would call it a seasonal, maybe a little bit pretty typical seasonal Q2 forecast. And Mike, you have looked at some more data on the Q2. Maybe you can add a little bit more information on what we're seeing specifically for Q2.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, yeah. So quarter to date, the revenue linearity we've seen has started out about as we'd expect, and it shouldn't be too surprising just given the low inventory levels across the customer base. And it also, we see diversity across end markets and geographies, so consistent with what Haviv shared. You have a follow-up, Tim?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, yeah. Is there a way to handicap sort of what your exposure is in China to these retaliatory tariffs? I know you report 19% as companies into China, but there's probably some added exposure from other companies that are domiciled beyond China that are building product in China. I guess, can you offset some of that by having product on consignment? Do you have a lot of inventory on consignment in China to sort of offset some of that? Thanks.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. And again, Tim, as I've said, again, in my prepared remarks, we are providing geopolitically dependable capacity to our customers, and we are working every hour with them right now to navigating the changing world. So as you said, we have a lot of capabilities. I think it is important to start and focus first on our China-headquartered customers. As you said, it's a little bit, maybe it was 19% of our revenue last year. I think it was 20% in Q1, aligned with our GDP share, so nothing very special here. And I think we said many times it's an important market. And our customers, we have a long-term relationship with them, right? They value our product breadth, they value our quality, they also value our scale and service.\nTo your point, part of the service we provide is having inventory on hand, some of it consigned, some of it very close to their manufacturing plants. So all of that is part of the way we serve our customers and have been serving them for years, especially in the last several years where we've taken more customers direct in China and worldwide. Now, you also remember saying that these guys, they want to be, they are and want to continue to be an even further grow their global play. They are making end equipment that are sold into China, but they're also making end equipment that are sold worldwide. And again, this is where our geopolitically dependable capacity is very, very important and valuable. This is where our immediate focus is right now. And this is where I'm sure we'll have some follow-up questions on that.\nI'll just say at a high level, we do have flexibility, and it's a case by case, but we are working with the customers. Everyone has different requirements of how we can support them on an immediate basis and alleviate some of their concerns on what's going to happen in second half of 2025 or even into 2026.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Tim. Let's move on to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks so much. First, just wanted to say thanks and best wishes to Dave and his next adventures, and also good wishes to Mike. For my first question, maybe for Rafael, so inventory was up again, and I think on the last call, you suggested that factory loadings would go down, so it seemed like maybe they did not. So how much was the gross margin benefit from that? And then how are you thinking about the direction of loadings and the pace of gross margins from here?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, not sure. Let me give you a few pieces of information on that. Gross margin did better than expected. Most of that was due to higher revenue and the greater mix of industrial in the quarter, but also our loadings; they were down versus Q4, but they were higher than originally expected, the base case that we originally had. And that was, of course, revenue did better than the midpoint. And what we're seeing, as Haviv described, the current environment with customers running pretty lean on inventory, demand being pretty strong, and aging, etc. On a forward-looking basis, our base case right now at the midpoint, we expect factory loadings to increase slightly into Q2 and gross margin to be up versus Q1. So Q1 to Q2 gross margin up. Do you have a follow-up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes, thank you. So maybe for Q2, I think you mentioned that it is perhaps right in the range of seasonality or perhaps at the upper end. I know it tends to be a stronger quarter for your other calculator business, but when you look at your core segment, could you help us get a feel for what is going to be better or lower than the 7% or so sequential rate, whether it is by industrial or automotive or consumer markets or whether it's by analog or embedded? Just so we get a better feel for what is driving Q2 to be at kind of the upper end of seasonality despite all these macro and tariff-related headwinds. Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nSure, Vivek. And first, I would say when we are in a normal environment and we are in an up cycle, just to go back to trend line, you need to have some of these quarters running a little bit above seasonality, right? That's the only way to get back to trend line. So I think we've started to see some of it in terms of the demand signals we're seeing. And I think there is nothing I would call specifically versus Q1 other than the continued strength in industrial. I think the industrial signal is now, I would say, probably a five-month or so. I mean, we've seen some above industrial seasonality in Q4. Typically, it goes like mid-single digits down in Q4. I think it went down low single, I think, Mike. And then again, an above seasonal in industrial in Q1, close to that 10% mark.\nI don't see right now, at least, any slowdown there. And that's also very, I think it's also very intuitive, as I said, when there is a little bit of anxiety and unknown. I think customers want to have a little bit more inventory than less. So if I have to call the Q2, I would expect it to behave very similarly to Q1. Remember, the automotive cycle was the last one to join the pack, just kind of a latecomer, both on the way up in COVID and down, okay? So I do expect it to come in last, but it was always very, very shallow. Even in Q1, I think we've seen automotive growing sequentially, and I think even growing year-over-year. So the automotive cycle has been very, very shallow, kind of mid- to high-single-digit.\nThat was what we've seen on a 12-month basis. So overall, that would be my read into the Q2.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Vivek. Let's move on to the next caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Haviv, you said at first that you didn't see any pull forward, but then you talked about customers wanting to hold more, which sort of seems like the definition of pull forward, and you seem concerned about the second half. I mean, I guess my question is, if there was pull forward going on, would you care or would you just ship? Is your typical plan, I always thought it was if you can fulfill it, you ship it, and it doesn't really matter more than that. Is that how we should be thinking about how you're living in this environment right now, given some of the upside that you are seeing or clearly seeing?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYes, Stacy, thanks for the question. Let me first clarify the first point I've made. Maybe I was a little bit not clear enough. I would guess that what we've seen in Q1, okay, that the dominant signal I've seen in Q1, and we've seen it across channels, across geography, was very consistent. It's just the return of industrial. We've seen that broadly, across the channels, on our online business. It's just been very, very broad. Nothing that looked anxious or nothing that looked like huge orders or whatever, just an acceleration of the aging trend we saw in Q4. So very consistent with what we've seen in Q4, but accelerated, right? So that's my comment on Q1. For Q2, we have data only for, I mean, it's not even been, it's not even a month yet, right?\nOur lead times are very short. The signals we see right now are nothing that signals anxiety or something very, very weird, but kind of a continuation of the cycle. My guess is, again, that's when I think about industrial customers running low volumes, exposed to all these news, I think that you would want to have a little bit more than less. That's also my anecdotal discussion with customers. They do have a wish to maybe replenish some of their empty shelves. So I think we are seeing now maybe end demand on industrial, plus a little bit, okay? That's what I would say is a typical cycle behavior. Now, when I say we have to prepare to any scenario, that thing can develop both ways.\nThe second half could turn into, I don't know, slowdown and just no end demand, and we will see that in our orders at a certain point of time. We haven't seen it yet. But as anxiety builds, and we've seen sometimes situations like that. Think about COVID, and COVID, and we looked at that cycle very, very carefully. The economy stopped. I mean, people were not building end equipment. We were not showing up to factories, so everything stopped. But then that was this period after that anxiety has built, and we've seen orders, three years' worth of orders on our books. And we are not right now there. But we do have to think about what happens if customers get into this anxious mode. And then we need to support them.\nTo your question, specific one, we are not going to just flood them with stuff that we don't think they need. We have a playbook that we have written over the last several years of what happens in an up cycle. We'll manage customers according to that demand in a very structured and organized way.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nStacy, do you have a follow-up?\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI do, thank you. Maybe to follow up on that. Again, I know it's only been less than a month in the quarter. I know we're 23 days in. I think we're what, about two weeks or so since Liberation Day. Just what have you seen on, I guess, any acceleration in the order rate during those kind of two weeks post-term versus, say, what you saw exiting Q1? Have orders materially accelerated? The pace of orders materially accelerated over the last couple of weeks? Or is it consistent?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nI'll say a very high-level comment, and Mike, you can give some more color. In general, Stacy, our forecast represents what we're seeing right now. I mean, we, of course, want to give you the best data when we come to this call, and that's our best estimate of what the quarter will do according to what we see right now.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I think it's difficult to rule out any specific reason for a given order. But again, as we mentioned before, what we have seen since the beginning of the quarter, the linearity so far is about what you'd expect to see from a first to second transition and also in an environment where you're having end markets that are in recovery. So not unusual what we've seen so far. All right, with that, I'll move on to the next caller.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nYes, thank you. Congratulations to Dave on his retirement. Tremendous career, and you'll be sorely missed. My first question is on some of the activity that you've seen here the last few weeks. Is there any regional disparity here? I mean, I'm asking the question because obviously there's variances on the potential tariffs by region. Is that also very consistent with what you typically would see?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I'll take that and maybe provide a little bit more color. I think Tim went there and I can provide a little bit more color on what's happening. As we said in the preparatory remarks and also in my response to Tim, we are working very closely with our customers because, of course, they are reading the situation. They are studying the supply chains, and we are a large supplier of them, very broad supplier. And of course, they want to have flexibility. And by the way, the rules are changing every day, and they could continue to change. They are acting and thinking about what can they do right now. And of course, if you think about the way our market works, the way cycle times are built for semis, nothing can be fixed immediately, right?\nEverybody's kind of preparing for what the second half of the year could be, and they want to have a very robust and what we like to call a geopolitically dependable capacity supplier on their side. So if you go and I'll go a little bit of more specificity why we think and why we can say that our discussions are going well because we do have flexibility. If you think about the, let's just take, for example, our main focus is our China headquartered customers. For the majority of our portfolio, we have already an internal dual flow capability, right? This was put together back in, actually, the Japan earthquake more than a decade ago that we want to have a disaster recovery framework when the supply chain gets shut and what customers can do.\nAnd that's also a very big requirement for customers to buy high volume from TI. So that is something that we now have to work immediately on some logistics because now to optimize potential costs for customers, we have to adapt our manufacturing flow and our logistics in order to get the right parts to the right customers, okay? And we have inventory. Sometimes we have inventory from both flavors on our shelves right now, but we just have to make sure that the machine, because we have more than 100,000 customers and they are buying sometimes hundreds of different parts for customers, we have to make sure that logistically our machine has to adapt and optimize the right path for the customer. We also have external partners, right? So if you think about, I can give a very easy example from our embedded business.\nOur embedded business is in the process of shifting manufacturing from foundries, in this case in Taiwan, to our fab in Lehi. So by definition, the parts are double, they have a dual flow, one internal, one external. And we just have to, again, get the right wafers to the right customers. That is something that we are busy doing with the customers who need that. And just a reminder, we are coming from a very deep cycle, way below the trend line. And we have four fabs outside of the US. We have two in Japan, one in China, one in Germany. And we have most of the parts that we have running in the US also running there, right? So maybe these fabs are not as cost-efficient as our 300-millimeter wafer fabs, but they are competitive.\nAnd this is where the control of our technology allows us to shift some of our supply into these fabs where needed. Obviously, these fabs are underutilized because at the down cycle, you optimize your capacity to your lower cost rather than to your 200mm wafer fab. So the bottom line, it's a complex execution plan that we have. The teams are engaged, working closely with customers. And we are prepared to navigate the evolving supply chain dynamics into Q2, but also into the second half of 2025, into next year.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Tore. Let's move on to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. And again, I want to pass along the thanks to Dave. You will be missed. My first is just on the China for China strategy. So if you look at your global footprint versus your peers, clearly, you guys are really well positioned from the ability to serve different geographies with different capacity. But maybe just one on your China facility. If you were to look at demand that is coming from China specifically, can you meet all of that demand with your China facility in-country? Or could you help me just understand how much of that demand you can meet with that facility? Is that something that you could entirely support with your footprint there?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me, I think I said before that I think customers, they don't ask for domestic manufacturing plan. They ask us for a dependable capacity footprint. And that's what we have. Look, the tariff could change three more times in the next two weeks, okay? And that's something that we can't forecast, and also, know our customers. But I will say that when we look at our footprint of manufacturing between the US and between Asia and Europe, and also look at the work we do with our external partners and foundries, we are well positioned. The issue is not the capacity size. The issue is how quickly you can get your logistics and also the cycle time of starting new wafers landing at customers to optimize the cost of the supply. I think TI is very, very well prepared for that.\nSo when you have a part that is already running on the board and it's already qualified, and all you need to do is right now ship it instead of from Dallas, from Japan, that's not a big deal, okay? It works in the system. It is dual qualified. It's just a matter of cycle time of starting wafers and getting the supply to our customers. So that's the kind of challenges we deal with. It is going well. Our team is working 24/7 on it, and I'm very pleased with our reaction time and the urgency that the team is showing. I will say on the China supply, in general, we have a decent fab. It's a decent fab in China. We also have a large AT facility over there.\nIn general, I think the footprint that TI has is very, very, it's a good answer to what our customers in China need, but beyond that, what our customers need worldwide.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYou have a follow-up, Tom?\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nYes, super helpful. This may be a silly question, but I just want to understand too, because in your filings, you talk about front-end and back-end manufacturing at your different facilities. When you're doing production of a certain chip in a geography, is the back-end always associated with that same foundry, or are you shipping that to different places before it meets the end customer? Again, where is the back-end done? Is it pretty much aligned with your foundry footprint just because they're listed similarly in the filings? I just wanted to understand a little better.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThe short answer is no, but I'll let Rafael. We have full flexibility, but Rafael, maybe you can comment.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no. So there's an almost unlimited amount of permutations of how the fabs and the ATs and processes in between bump and probe, if you will, that happen. So a wafer can be fabbed in the United States and then be assembled and tested, be assembled in Malaysia and then tested in Taiwan, for example. So it's not all in one geography. And some of that, by the way, can be changed immediately. Some of that can take time, but a lot of that actually can be moved pretty quickly.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I think the most important point is there are things that can happen immediately and the things that take a little bit of a longer time. So if you think about them in order of, the easiest thing to do is just to route. And that's a logistic comment I had: to route the right parts to the right customers. That's an IT thing. Again, we are a massive supplier, okay? We run well above 10 billion units a year, sorry, a quarter to our customers. So that's not something you could do manually in an Excel sheet, right? So logistics and IT has to be put together, and we are. The second thing that you are doing is just on the AT.\nAT is a very easy permutation to Rafael's point, and it's very simple to take a wafer from a certain fab and run it quickly on a new assembly and test factory just because the cycle time is lower. Of course, when we go to the base layer, the chip, the chip just has longer cycle time, and this is where we are gathering information from our customers so we can solve their problems as soon as possible.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Tom. Let's move on to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could talk to us about the breakdown in growth between pricing and volume, specifically as it relates to tariffs. Was there anything that helped? For example, there's new tariff, you're passing the price along, and so you see some price benefit either in the Q1 result or in the Q2 guidance. Anything that we can quantify?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nNo, I can. That's an easy answer. It's based on just shipping more volume to customers. That's what we're seeing, the recovery of the cycle.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYou have a follow-up, Will?\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Truist Securities\n\nI wonder if you could give us an update on the competition in China. I think some people have observed greater competition there. One of your somewhat smaller competitors in analog and embedded sort of similar product profile, perhaps a bit more narrow, but similar product profile, talked about no longer competing in standard products in China and instead sort of selling dice and having customers assemble, test, support, etc., which seems like a strange approach, but they said that the Chinese are becoming more intense or more capable competitors now. I wonder if you could update us relative to what you see. Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. This is something that we've been watching, as you know, for years. This is not a 2025 phenomenon. As I said before, and we said many times, the competition in China is intensifying. By the way, I was in China just last quarter, okay? No discussion on trade. It was all about supply, expanding positions on boards, and design in. So just a regular visit across more than 20 customers. In general, the competition is intensifying across the board. It's in general purpose, but it's also in a more application-specific part. I will tell you, our largest competitor on a 77GHz chip in China is a Chinese competitor. That's where we fight, and that's where I won't call that a general purpose part, okay?\nThat's a very, very unique, large die size for chains of transmit and receive, running at very high frequency. This is not a general purpose part. Very application-specific, very complex. And we are not surprised. We've seen those folks working for more than five years and just very, very good companies. And very aggressive, very urgent, moving fast. And I like to call it our conditioning room because that's where you can strengthen your muscle, your muscle of competitiveness, of urgency. China is the best landscape to do that. I think we can compete on both. And even now, and especially now, when we show the scale and power of TI, we have a lot of options for our customers, not only the breadth of the product, the high level of quality. The number one discussion point I had a quarter ago is about supply.\nThe fact that we had inventory and we have capacity is super important for our customers. They are feeling, they are always the Chinese, or the China market, is always a little bit ahead in the phase of any cycle, any recovery. We saw it on the way up in COVID and the way down, and now we see it on the way up. They're always like almost the early indicator. That was the discussion. It was all about how can we get more quicker, and also a lot of thanks to the level of support of TI, simply having inventory for them ready to go with very short lead times. So that would be my high-level comment on the competition. I think we need to assume that the competition will continue to intensify.\nI will say that our competitive advantage is, especially on the breadth of the portfolio, the fact that we can solve many problems on the boards, you can solve it with one company rather than with 20. The fact that we have this diverse supply chain or diverse manufacturing plan, which is geopolitically dependable for their China business, but also for their export business, is super important. I think it will continue to stay important at this time.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay. Well, we'll move on to our last caller.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the share repurchases in the quarter. I saw that this is a $600+ million number. You've got $1.7 billion of trailing free cash and $5 billion dividend. I know the free cash is getting better, but can you just talk about what drives the timing of your buybacks and how much are you willing to take on more debt to buy back more? Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Our objective when it comes to buybacks, and in general, just cash return, is to return all free cash flow via dividends and repurchases. But you got to recognize that there's times to build and drain cash. So if you look at our cash balance, for example, we're at a very comfortable $5 billion, and our balance sheet is really strong with that. But a year ago, it was at $10 billion. And that's because we had so much more of our CapEx ahead of us. Right now, we're at 70%. We're 70% through the elevated investment. So we're approaching the last innings of the elevated CapEx period. So we felt more comfortable operating at lower levels of cash. But having $5 billion of cash still gives us plenty of room.\nAnd on your question on debt, we've taken debt before. We still have plenty of room on our balance sheet to take on more debt as it makes sense, when it makes sense.\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nJoe, you have a follow-up?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I do. Thank you for that. I guess with regards to the Chinese tariffs, I've talked to some of the customers, and people don't seem to have clarity on what exactly the tariff rate is. And yet, I think the tariff is already being charged. Do you have clarity on that? Are people immediately paying those tariffs? Is there just any way to sort of tell how much impact there is, or is that something where the actual tariff is kind of calculated later? Just what are the mechanics of this being implemented so rapidly?\n\nMike Beckman\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. I'd first start with and reiterate that there's a lot still changing. It's a dynamic environment. Our customers are looking at their supply chains, and they're working, and we're working with them to understand and help support their needs. As you've mentioned, we have the flexibility to navigate those evolving dynamics. In terms of how that who pays that, or really the question is, are you able to be competitive? With our competitive advantages, the flexibility that we have, our geopolitically dependable footprint, we do have the ability to be competitive and to support our customers where they are. If you have anything to add.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nPresident and CEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, just a last point on that, Joe. This is where we just need to let the quarter play out. So many things can change in the next few weeks. I actually expect them to change, right? So it's very hard to answer the question. I will just say that the way we learn about what our customers need is through their orders, through their backlog. And of course, if we see a change, if we would see a change, we will let you know. But that's the only way for us to gauge demand is what our customers are asking us to do. Our objective is to serve them, serve them well at high quality, and deliver the parts they want, not only right now in Q2, but also towards the second half of the year and also next year. Okay.\nSo with that, let me wrap up with what we've said previously. At our core, we are engineers, and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and best metric to measure progress and generate value for our owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Congratulations to Dave, and have a great evening. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your line at this time.

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Haviv Ilan, and our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations.\nWe encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings. For a more complete description, I would like to provide some information that's important to your calendars. On Tuesday, 4 February 2025 at 10:00AM Central Time, we will have our Capital Management call, similar to what we've done in the past. Haviv, Rafael, and I will share our approach to capital allocation and summarize our progress as we prepare for the opportunity ahead.\nMoving on, today we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results, with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Haviv will then provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end market. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the first quarter of 2025. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Dave. Let me start with a quick overview of the fourth quarter. Revenue was $4 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially and 2% from the same quarter a year ago. Analog revenue grew 2% year over year after eight quarters of decline. Embedded Processing declined 18% and our other segment grew from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. Our overall results reflect the performance from our two largest markets, industrial and automotive, which saw modest sequential declines, similar to last quarter. I'll focus on sequential performance, as it is more informative at this time.\nFirst, the industrial market was down low single digits, the automotive market was down mid single digits, personal electronics grew mid single digits. Next, enterprise systems declined low single digits, and lastly, communications equipment grew upper single digits. In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market as a percentage of revenue for 2024. Industrial was 34%, automotive 35%, personal electronics 20%, enterprise systems 5%, communication equipment 4%, and other was 2% in 2024. Industrial and automotive combined made up about 70% of TI's revenue, up from 42% in 2013.\nWe see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our customers across all regions are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end products more reliable, more affordable, and lower in power. This drives growing chip content per application or secular content growth, which will likely continue to drive faster growth in industrial and automobiles. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, higher depreciation, and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 190 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $937 million, up 4% from a year ago, and about as expected on a trailing twelve month basis. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion, or 24% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.4 billion in the quarter, or 34% of revenue, and profit was down 10% from a year ago.\nNet income in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, or $1.30 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.Cash flow from operations was $2 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $537 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in the fourth quarter, marking our 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $5.7 billion in the past 12 months to owners.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, with $7.6 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $13.7 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 3.79%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, up $231 million from the prior quarter, and days were 241, up 10 days sequentially. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2024, cash flow from operations was $6.3 billion and capital expenditures were $4.8 billion. As expected, we are nearly 70% through a six-year elevated CapEx cycle that, once complete, will uniquely position TI to deliver dependable low-cost 300-millimeter capacity at scale to meet customer demand.\nFree cash flow for 2024 was $1.5 billion or 10% of revenue. Our free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model as well as our decisions to invest in 300-millimeter manufacturing assets and inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $1.16. Based on current tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for 2025 to be about 12%.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press STAR to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing. One moment please while we poll for questions.\nOur first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question first. One for Haviv: you're guiding Q1 revenue down, I think, 2% to 3% sequentially. I was hoping you could maybe provide some color by end market, what you're seeing on a sequential basis. You guys were quite helpful last quarter diving deep into automotive, what you're seeing in China, etc., etc. So any color, any standouts to the upside or downside relative to what's typical seasonality would be very helpful, thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, thanks, Toshiya. For Q1, as you said, about 3% sequential, which is, I would describe it as a seasonal decline for Q1. I will say that typically in Q1 what we do see is the personal electronics market would usually show quite a significant decline, just seasonality. We did have a pretty decent Q4. For PE, I think that's what we expect there. Typically, if you look at markets like automotive and industrial, the decline should be less pronounced there. That's kind of my expectation. Expectation, nothing specific that I would add on markets. I will provide a little bit more color on Q4, especially in our two main markets, industrial and automotive.\nI think, again, they behave similarly like the overall company in Q4 and also similar to what we've seen in Q3, but maybe with some little bit small changes. If I start with the industrial market, as I described, I think during the last call most of the sectors are kind of hovering at the bottom, maybe found the bottom. There are a couple of sectors that are still showing larger declines, especially industrial, automation, and the energy infrastructure market that is still not found, I believe, at the bottom. We'll have to see what H1 2025. Has planned for that. On the automotive market, similar to Q3, we did see kind of a pretty significant weakness, maybe outside of China.\nIt declined about mid single digit, about 5% sequentially. China did grow, but not enough to offset the declines in Europe, the US, and Japan, which is very, it was kind of similar to what we've seen in Q3, but maybe the growth in China was less pronounced and the decline outside of China was more pronounced. That would be my high level summary for Q4 and a little bit for Q1.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nFollow up to Toshiya?\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI do. Dave, thanks so much. The earnings outlook for Q1, Haviv, there's a pretty significant drop off on a sequential basis for a 2% to 3% decline in revenue. I was hoping you could kind of provide some context there. Is it primarily gross margin, and behind that, is it continued underloading, increase in depreciation, some of the same dynamics we saw over the past 12 months? Is it higher OpEx? Anything below the line? Any sort of additional color on the drop off in EPS Q4 to Q1? That would be helpful.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nI think I covered revenue. Rafael, maybe you covered the other part.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, happy to. Okay, maybe let me start with GPM, then I'll go to opex, and then I'll go to the other income line, which is relevant this time. On gross margins, keep in mind that depreciation is increasing, first of all. Second, revenue is decreasing. That has an impact. Depreciation is increasing. We are, in order to manage inventory, reducing factory loadings. We reduced some of that in fourth quarter, but we're going to reduce those.Further. In first quarter, I do expect GPM percent to decrease probably a few hundred basis points fourth quarter to first quarter. Let me comment on OpEx. OpEx. Will increase 3% to 5% fourth to first.\nThat's kind of normal seasonal increases that happen in first quarter on OpEx, in addition to the overall increases in investments that we're making beyond that. This time it's relevant that interest income is decreasing by about $50 million. The reason that is happening is short term interest rates are decreasing, and that's where we invest our cash, and our cash on the balance sheet cash levels are also decreasing. A combination of lower interest rates and lower cash gives you a significant drop in other income. In this case, that's about $50 million less, fourth going to first quarter.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you,\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThank You Toshi. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director Covering Semiconductors & Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, thank you. I guess first question would be with regard to the embedded business. We're seeing a sharp divergence there between those two businesses, particularly on the margin side. Can you give some explanation of what's going on between the analog and the embedded businesses, and the reason for the decline in the embedded margins?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me just say a few words on the revenue side, and I'll let Rafael talk about the margins over there. Again, embedded and analog a little bit are like many of the phenomena we see regarding markets, geographies. We are seeing an asynchronous behavior between these two markets. As you remember, embedded, our embedded business grew in 2023, while our analog business in 2023 declined double digits. We saw a later peak about a year later on embedded. That's the reason we see a sharper decline in embedded right now, while analog in Q4 actually grew. I think analog is about a year, maybe, ahead on embedded in terms of the cyclical behavior regarding profitability. Rafael, I'm sure it's related to alpha, but you go, that's absolutely right.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. The profitability embedded first is revenue. As revenue drops, you know, that clearly has an impact on profitability. The second part that is different than Embedded is that Embedded is taking a disproportionate impact due to LFAB, the Lehi factory in Utah. That factory, while it's going to serve both Embedded and it's serving both Embedded and Analog, disproportionately serves Embedded. Since it's underutilized right now, it takes that hit from that underutilization of factory loading, which affects Embedded disproportionately. Follow on, Chris.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director Covering Semiconductors & Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, got it. That's helpful. I guess the follow-up question would be some update on, you know, what's going on in China right now. You had spoken about, you know, I guess the auto business again is stronger there. Perhaps you could talk about, you know, the rest of the business that you're seeing in China, the industrial business, for example. You know, we know that you've been taking some actions to, you know, kind of take back some of the share that you may have lost when your lead times were longer. Could you give us an update on that and how that may be affecting some numbers in the near term?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nSure. First, at high level, our China business in Q4 did grow. Both. Sequentially but also year over year, I think it was mid-teens or that area for the entire China business. I think the automotive, Frank, we talked about it last quarter, we're seeing the same phenomenon, meaning customers are continuing to do well, and there is a bigger share for the EV.You know, vehicle types in China, which has higher content. Secular growth is helping us in China on the automotive side. You also see, and I think we mentioned it also in the previous calls, that we had some supply limitations during the up cycle in China,\nand the personal electronics market was one of the main markets tha suffered when we were short. We are seeing this market growing in China. It grew sequentially again nicely in Q3, but also year over year. That market grew significantly in China and also in the US. These are the main markets. We have our personal electronics businesses. Overall, again, overall business in China right now is healthy. You asked about industrial. We haven't seen yet. The start of the cyclical growth again in industrial across all of our geographies. China here is not an outlier. The strength is coming mainly from, I would say, automotive and from personal electronics.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me just add a little color. US, China, and really rest of Asia. It's really more flat. Describe it sequentially. Europe and Japan were down low double digits as Haviv mentioned. If you look year on year, you see the US and China up kind of 12%, 14% in that range, and that growth was offset overall by declines in the other regions.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYep.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat. Okay.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director Covering Semiconductors & Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you,\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Chris. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to ask about the pricing environment in general. You didn't mention that, Rafael or Haviv, in any of your discussions about gross margin, or the competitive environment, or any of the sequential weakness. Just wondered if that has changed in any meaningful way, either Analog versus Embedded, or in certain geographies. Just any update on that front will be helpful.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, at a high level, the pricing environment does not. We've not seen any change in Q4 versus what we've seen in 2024, I think. We've expected, I think we said in the beginning of 2024 that pricing would go back to previous behavior pre-Covid where pricing would decline. Low single digits like for like parts per year. That's more or less what it did in 2024 as the year ended. Of course, I think I did provide some color on revenue by market. The mix has changed, right? The selling price, if you will, has changed because industrial in 2023 was 40% of revenue. It declined to 34% in 2024, and the PE market.\nGrew from 15% in 2023 to 20% in 2024. That is a big change of mix, if you will. That's what we have seen. The like for like parts has behaved as expected. I'm not expecting that to be different in 2025. That's a comment across all geographies.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nFollow on, Ross.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, I do a little bit of a longer term question maybe for Haviv. Historically, the company's talked about share gains and losses in your markets being measured in basis points. I think 15, 20, 25 basis points a year, given the fragmented nature of it, was kind of what you would aspire to. It can, of course, go down or up, I guess for kind of idio reasons, supply shocks, those sorts of things. Now that you have the supply, it seems like the world has plenty of supply. Is there any reason that that historical share gain pace would be any different going forward?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nAgain, when we talk about share down or up, I think the only way to really measure it is over the long term. That's always been our approach. That's the way we run the company. That's the way we behave. Right. So TI, yes, there was a lot of, I would say, a shockwave almost during COVID. It was not only supply, demand mismatch, but behavior of customers and almost anxiety of needing parts. I think inventory was built, and I think it's still playing out. I wouldn't say that this asynchronous behavior across markets is done. We see it still across sectors in industrial. We see it differently between geographies.\nWe even see it internally between our Embedded business and Analog business. It's one of these things, and I kind of hate to say it, but time will tell where we are. I am excited about the fact that now we have the right inventory level, the right supply to support growth. I'm encouraged about our progress in the analog market. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did grow the analog business from a year-over-year perspective in Q4. It was a couple of points of growth, after about eight quarters of decline. I think.I look forward to continue to grow that business, especially when you think about the longer term, and most importantly,\nthe secular growth in the market that we've mentioned, industrial and automotive. I'm convinced that it's there. I'm convinced that our product portfolio is improving and strengthening, and we will have the right level of capacity and inventory to support our customers. Obviously, expectation that I have for the team is TI will continue to compete for market share and grow it.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Russell. Go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next call question comes from the line of Chris Danley with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Danely\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, thanks guys. Hey Haviv. I guess just a little bit of a drill down on the end markets. How would you expect things to sort of play out this year? Maybe talk about where you would expect relative strength or not strength by the end markets. Have you seen, would you say you've seen any change in business conditions over the last three months? Like better, worse, or not really?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. You know, Chris, as I think I told you last time we met, we call it when we see it. Meaning I can tell you what happened. It's very hard for us to tell you exactly what will happen even for this quarter. I think I mentioned even during the last call. Lead times are short. Customers are coming real time for demand. Our turn business, or what we call aging, is running high right now simply because customers are almost waiting for the last second before they make the order. We fulfill it because we do have the right level of inventory, and, of course, capacity to support further growth. I will say that I think that some of the markets, and we've seen it through 2024.\nThey are already on the cyclical upturn. We saw it in PE, then enterprise really driven by data center joined, and we are seeing nice growth over there, and even communication business. I would say that I think it found the bottom. We saw it somewhere in, I think, in Q1 2024 and grew sequentially since then, and even returned to year-over-year growth in Q4. These three markets, I think they are on the upturn, and I don't think that I expect, at least, that if nothing major changes, to continue into 2025. The big question for us, also, 75% of our business or 70% of our business in 2024 is industrial and automotive. Here, we haven't seen the bottom yet. Let's be very clear about that.\nWe're seeing points of strength. I've given China as an example. We'll have to see how the year play out. I do believe that this on the industrial side that there is. Kind of, as I said last time, kind of this hovering at the low level is a great position to grow from. We'll just have to wait and see when it wants to do it, Chris. Of course, when we see it, we'll say it.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nA follow on, Chris.\n\nChris Danely\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Citi\n\nSure. Just quickly on Embedded. It looks like you guys have the lowest margins there in, I think, over a decade or something like that. You know, does something need to be changed or restructured there to get Embedded back to an adequate level of margins, or maybe talk about what needs to be done to get it to, you know, some sort of an appreciable level of margin.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me take a quick high-level answer. Chris and Rafael will give a little bit more. What's going on there? I think you're seeing a business in transition, Chris. I'm growing more excited about Embedded every quarter. I think our portfolio is strengthening, and we are winning business. We are going through a transition, especially on the manufacturing side, and that puts pressure on the margins. We are convinced that strategically Embedded is going to be a great contributor to free cash flow per share. The short answer to your question about restructuring or anything, the answer, Rafael, maybe you can provide some more color. What's going on there?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, I'll just add, similar to what I said in a few calls, a few questions ago, one is the revenue is the main factor. As Haviv talked about earlier in the call, Embedded has seen a sharp decline because it took longer to get into the downturn than Analog did. If you look at peak to trough, they're about the same place, Analog and Embedded. The other reason is LFAB. Right. Embedded is taking a disproportionate amount of the impact from having LFAB underutilized. Let me stress, just like that takes away, it gives it to you on the other end. When we ramp, as we ramp LFAB and as we move from external to internal, you're really going to like the fall through both to GPM,\nbut even better to free cash flow. As we do that. Embedded is that Haviv said it's in transition, and when we're on the other side, we're going to like the results.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Chris, and go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, one of the metrics we look at to gauge the health of the cycle is the number of customer pushouts, cancellations, rescheduling of the backlog relative to prior quarters, or maybe big changes right on customer forward forecasts inside of the quarter. Has this level of activity remained at kind of normalized levels? Maybe on another metric we look at is terms orders, and I know Haviv, you said it's at high levels, but is that coming in about as expected as well?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Let me start with the second part of the question. I'll let Dave comment about the first part. Look, we came in Q4 at the higher side of the range, close to the top of the range. That all came from what you call the terms business. We didn't see that in the beginning of the quarter, and it came in real time. You know, we need to see that that continues into the beginning of this year. Of course, there is Chinese New Year right now, and we just have to see that it's a trend rather than anything that is, you know, a one quarter phenomena, but the terms business looked very, very good in Q4.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Harlan, when you look at those other indicators like you brought up cancellations, we, you know, had seen those drop several quarters ago, and they continue to be at very low levels. You know, if you look at things like revenue linearity, you know, revenue increase through the quarter, that's very typical for us to see that. Haviv mentioned earlier, you know, lead times remain short. We have availability of essentially all of our products that we sell via the web available for immediate shipment, so customers can behave and have that confidence that they can get the product that we've got. You have a follow on?\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah. Thank you. Right before the Capital Management update back in August, I remember you had just received your preliminary CHIPS and Science Act grant allocation, $1.6 billion. That number was solidified, I think, in December. This was not contemplated in your free cash flow per share calculation. In the CHIPS and Science Act press release, you guys articulated some of the milestones attached to those grant dollars. It looks like actually many of those milestones are going to be executed, you know, in or before 2026.\nThat's, you know, $1.6 billion in grant dollars that drives, you know, an incremental $75 of free cash flow per share versus sort of what you potentially laid out in your 2026 scenario analysis.Have you mapped out that $1.6 billion in CHIPS and Science Act grants over 2025, 2026, and maybe have an updated view on the potential better free cash flow per share profile for Texas Instruments?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me try to answer that question first. Kind of bigger picture. As you alluded to, the Department of Commerce awarded us up to $1.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding. This will help support three of our new 300-millimeter wafer fabs under construction in Texas and Utah. This direct funding, coupled with the ITC, will help us provide a geopolitically dependable supply of Analog and Embedded Processing chips for years to come.\nOver the life of the, maybe the most important point is over the life of the program, between the ITC and the direct funding, we expect to receive $7.5 to 9.5 billion in total. We've received some of that already in 2024 and expect 2025 and beyond to continue. We don't have any specific details to share at this point on the cash payments related to the direct funding. As those happens, we will share those.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nI will just add that, you know, the math is not incorrect, but the timing is the problem. Right. I think, as you said, there is, and we talked about free cash flow. It also depends when we get the cash. We just do not have that visibility. The milestones are related, as you, I think, mentioned, to clean room construction and tool installations in SM1, which we are. In the, you know, we started installing tools in the summer of 2024 and it moves well. The construction of SM2, the shell, which, you know, it's not done yet, but it's moving well. The other part is more in Utah, it's LFAB2. This is where we talk about clean room construction and tool installation for LFAB2.\nWe are now only now starting the groundwork over there. Right. There is still quite a bit of execution in LFAB2. We will see how that timing works as we continue to move forward on that execution.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me add one more thing. Just given that we have been officially awarded at $1.6 billion, we already booked that on our balance sheet. We have a $1.6 billion receivable. You can see that on the balance sheet. The other side of that, $1 billion of that decreased our net PP&E because that's related to a factory that's already built. $0.6 billion of that is actually deferred liability because it's related to a factory that's not built. The bottom line where I'm going is that this is already going to decrease our expected depreciation. With that, let me give you an update to depreciation. Depreciation for 2025 now, you should expect $1.8 to 2 billion.\nThat's slightly down from the previous expectation. For 2026, we're keeping the range the same, $2.3 to 2.7 billion. I'll tell you that we expect to be on the lower half of that range. That's a 2026 depreciation expectation, 2.3% to 2.7%, to be at the lower end of that range.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I know you guys are loath to talk out beyond the quarter, but was hoping you could give us a framework for thinking about gross margins beyond the March quarter. You just gave us the depreciation, so that's very helpful. We'd love to hear kind of your thoughts on what's optimal inventory, and therefore planned utilization beyond March. Is March quarter kind of the low for gross margins, and we should start tracking higher? Any thoughts there would be very helpful.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, I'll be happy to do that. It's going to be very similar to what I've said before, but it all starts with revenue. You know, revenue is the number one driver of gross margin, both dollars and percent. Going forward, you model your revenue, then you follow that through at 75% to 85%. After you do that, you have to adjust for depreciation increases, and I already gave you the depreciation number so you can model that in the future. This works much better if you do full years and you do it over the long term rather than any given quarter. On that, you know, the other factor that you have is factory loadings or underutilization. Right now, as I mentioned, we expect a hit from that in the first quarter.\nThat just as it's a hit sometimes is a benefit when you go the other way. That depends on revenue expectations. If revenue materializes in the future and we expect that to continue, we ramp up the factories and that helps with the loadings, and that tends to take the 75 to 85 towards the high end of that range. If that doesn't happen, you're looking at the lower end of that range.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nI think you touched it before, Rafael, it is related to our execution. Of course, revenue, we want to grow it, and definitely we want to do it faster than the market. That's always our objective. On the other hand, it's that LFAB execution. Right. We are executing our transitions from our foundry business into Lehi. I expect that to have a step forward in 2025, especially as our automotive business. We have a bunch of parts that are what we call, they have a safety spec that usually the qual is a little bit more complex, it just takes a little bit longer. We are moving well on that execution. Again, my expectation from the team is to meet our commitment to our customers and get these parts.\nOut of Lehi as they prefer that dependable capacity. For us, it's a way lower cost and of course helps.As a byproduct on the margins as well.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nFollow on, C.J.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, yeah, just a quick one, Dave. Rafael, just to go back to kind of the loading question. If we do assume normal seasonal pattern for your top line into Q2, Q3, should we assume that loadings would move higher in Q2?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYou know, we forecast 1/4 at a time, so I'm going to stick with that. I'll also say, maybe as you're alluding to, the more revenue we have, then let me put it this way: we're not planning $4.5 billion of inventory as a healthy level of inventory, and we would not want to be draining those levels at this point. Maybe that gives you enough to think about.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWe'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHey guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow up on the previous one. You mentioned not necessarily wanting to drain the inventory levels below the $4.5 billion levels. As we think about how you're thinking about Q1 though, is this the level you're comfortable with and you're going to manage to the $4.5 billion? I guess to ask more acutely, is there a near to medium term inventory target on a day's basis that we should be thinking about? I know that's obviously evolved through the last several years. I'd be curious how you're thinking about it now as we sort of are chipping to end, closer to end demand.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. First, let me give you the big picture, and I'll give you some specifics. Big picture, inventory, the goal here, the objective is to maintain high levels of customer service while we minimize the obsolescence of inventory. We have target levels at the finished goods at the chip level for the 80,000 parts that we sell in different end markets. That is done in a very rigorous and disciplined way on a part-by-part basis. That's how we look at it. The risk of obsolescence on this part is very, very low. This part lasts for a long time. They sell to many, many customers for many, many years in very long life cycles.\nNow, to the specific that you add, given how we're running the factories right now, I would expect a further increase of inventory levels going into the first quarter, but probably in the $100 million, $100 million plus level, and then potentially stabilize at that point around that level.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nFollow on, Josh.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, thank you for the color, Rafael. To follow up, I wanted to ask about there are some earlier questions about competition, specifically in pricing. I guess I wanted to ask bigger picture, not necessarily pricing related, but as some of your peers have sort of gotten through and lapped and are no longer shipping to NCNRs or LTSAs. Have you noticed a change in the competitive backdrop on the number of sockets that are open for competition? I'd be curious to hear about if there's any change again competitively over the last couple quarters. Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I haven't seen a significant change. It feels the same to me, kind of stable. I mean, we are in a down cycle, and I remember throughout my career every time there is a down cycle the market gets more competitive, and it feels the same now. That's again across all markets, all geographies. I haven't seen any significant change in the last couple of quarters. To your direct question.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Josh. We've got time for one last caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nHi guys. Thanks. Let me ask a question. This is for Haviv and Rafael. At the Capital Management Day, you guys highlighted different CapEx ranges depending on different revenue categories. I know the intention there wasn't to guide revenue, but you just updated us on depreciation in response to the ITC and some of the grants as well. Is the depreciation being at the lower end entirely a function of the updated guide that you're giving today, entirely a function of those tax credits and grants, or is that a function of potentially lower CapEx as well?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nIt is not a function of lower CapEx. We continue to expect CapEx for 2025 to be $5 billion. In 2026, as we said at the last call, between $2 to 5 billion depending on further expectations. We'll have more clarity on that in the second half of the year.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, and again, I will add this is not, I mean, as we said in August, our plan is still, we like the plan. We are going to be very disciplined. We always look at the environment and what's going on. Based on what I see right now, you shouldn't expect a plan to change. In terms of our phase, phase II as I described, phase I is serving us very well. This is how we move revenue from external foundries into our LFAB factory in Utah. Also, on the Analog side, we want most of our parts running on 300-millimeter other than, for example, 6-inch fab that we are shutting down. That's going well. The phase II is very important for our future.\nYou know, we are going to complete the qualification line in Sherman 1, we are going to set the shell or build the shell in Sherman 2, and also build the shell in Lehi so it can give us this flexible capacity phase that we are so excited about, and so are the customers. Once they engage with us, they fully understand that not only will they have enough cleanroom capacity to grow into, but also the qualification is going to be behind them. Their parts are already running, for example, in Xiamen or in Lehi, and that gives them a very, very.\nEasy path to grow. Their business with us without having to go through recall and new fabs or new suppliers. I think that plan serves our customers well, and we'll continue to execute to it. As you said, the slide in August, and we'll probably see a very similar story in a couple of weeks, is that we want to say that we have a plan, but we do always have flexibility into the plan, especially in 2026 and 2027.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat. Tom, you got a follow up?\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nI do. Thanks for all the detail. There's last one of the call, so broader and hate to end it on this, but I just wanted to give you a chance to respond. Articles out on a China statement talking about dumping product in that market. I think there's an ongoing debate just around the sustainability of China longer term. I guess part, part of this question is can you just address what do you, what you've seen in the public there and then kind of as a derivative of that, you're obviously growing year over year in China.\nYou're seeing strength in China Auto, you highlighted that. Outside of that, are you seeing any change in the dynamic there in terms of your ability to ship product, competition? Just addressing the whole debate. Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. I'll probably not settle the debate. I'll just tell you what we see, and I'll start with the high level in China. It's an important market. China represents 20%, more or less, of world GDP, and you want to play in that market. By the way, our business in 2024 in China was at about 20%. We are kind of.\nNot over or under penetrated in China. It's kind of just right at 20%. Our commitment is to our customers. Our customers in China rely on our parts. They want to have the best products, they want to have the highest quality, they want to get best service. TI is a good supplier. On top of it, their ambitions is to be global players. Right. Maybe they are part of the headquarters in China, but they want to sell their end equipment to any geography. In that sense, TI is a great supplier because we are a global player. We have a diverse footprint of manufacturing and support structure, and that's a great fit for their needs.\nNow, as you know, and I think this is not news, the China market has always been competitive and is continuing to be. We know that they are very capable, motivated, fast-moving competition. I think the competitive advantages of TI allow us to compete, whether it's our broad portfolio, the reach of the channel, and also our position in industrial and automotive. Customers value that and want to continue to do business with TI. We want to compete, and that's really the fact that we own our manufacturing, own our technology. I think we have the right cost structure to compete across our entire portfolio.\nWhether it's low AUP general purpose parts or very integrated, sophisticated ASPs that are tailored for a specific application, we don't need to self-select. We want to compete across our portfolio, and our customers there appreciate that. I continue to see that specifically to your question. You know, at this time we haven't been notified about an investigation, and it's kind of business as usual between us and our customers in China.\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you for asking that question, Tom, and thank you, everyone else, for joining us tonight. We look forward to sharing our Capital Management call on Tuesday, 4 February 2025, at 10:00AM Central Time. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, and this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\nSa.\nIt.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWelcome to the Texas Instruments Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer Haviv Ilan and our Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations.\nWe encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings. For a more complete description, I would like to provide some information that's important to your calendars. On Tuesday, 4 February 2025 at 10:00AM Central Time, we will have our Capital Management call, similar to what we've done in the past. Haviv, Rafael, and I will share our approach to capital allocation and summarize our progress as we prepare for the opportunity ahead. Moving on, today we'll provide the following updates.\nFirst, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results, with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Haviv will then provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end market, and lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the first quarter of 2025. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Dave. Let me start with a quick overview of the fourth quarter. Revenue was $4 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially and 2% from the same quarter a year ago. Analog revenue grew 2% year over year after eight quarters of decline. Embedded Processing declined 18%, and our other segment grew from the year ago quarter.Now I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. Our overall results reflect the performance from our two largest markets, industrial and automotive, with some modest sequential declines. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance, as it is more informative at this time.\nFirst, the industrial market was down low single digits, the automotive market was down mid single digits, personal electronics grew mid single digits, next, enterprise systems declined low single digits, and lastly, communications equipment grew upper single digits.In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market as a percentage of revenue for 2024. Industrial was 34%, automotive 35%, personal electronics 20%, enterprise systems 5%, communication equipment 4%, and other was 2% in 2024. Industrial and automotive combined made up about 70% of TI's revenue, up from 42% in 2013.\nWe see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our customers across all regions are increasingly turning to Analog and Embedded technology to make their end product more reliable, more affordable, and lower in power. This drives growing chip content per application, or secular content growth, which will likely continue to drive faster growth in industrial and automotive. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments",
    "content2": "Thanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, higher depreciation, and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 190 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $937 million, up 4% from a year ago, and about as expected on a trailing twelve month basis. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion, or 24% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.4 billion in the quarter, or 34% of revenue, and profit was down 10% from a year ago.\nNet income in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, or $1.30 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.Cash flow from operations was $2 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $537 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in the fourth quarter, marking our 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $5.7 billion in the past 12 months to owners.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, with $7.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $13.7 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 3.79%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, up $231 million from the prior quarter, and days were 241, up 10 days sequentially. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2024, cash flow from operations was $6.3 billion, and capital expenditures were $4.8 billion. As expected, we are nearly 70% through a six-year elevated CapEx cycle that, once complete, will uniquely position TI to deliver dependable,\nlow-cost 300-millimeter capacity at scale to meet customer demand. Free cash flow for 2024 was $1.5 billion, or 10% of revenue. Our free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model, as well as our decisions to invest in 300-millimeter manufacturing assets and inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $1.16. Based on current tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for 2025 to be about 12%.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up the handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions.\nOur first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question first. One for Haviv, you're guiding Q1 revenue down, I think 2% to 3% sequentially. I was hoping you could maybe provide some color by end market what you're seeing on a sequential basis. You guys were quite helpful last quarter diving deep into automotive, what you're seeing in China, etc. etc. Any color, any standouts to the upside or downside relative to what's typical seasonality would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, thanks, Asia. Again, for Q1, as you said, about 3% I think sequential, which is, I would describe it as a seasonal decline for Q1. I will say that typically in Q1 what we do see is the personal electronics market would usually show quite a significant decline, just seasonality. We did have a pretty decent Q4. For PE, I think that's what we expect there. Typically, if you look at the markets like automotive and industrial, the decline should be less pronounced there. That's kind of my expectation. Nothing specific that I would add on markets. I will provide a little bit more color on Q4, especially in our two main markets, industrial and automotive.\nI think, again, they behave similarly like the overall company in Q4 and also similar to what we've seen in Q3, but maybe with some small changes. If I start with the industrial market, as I described, I think during the last call most of the sectors are kind of hovering at the bottom, maybe found the bottom.There are a couple of sectors that are still showing larger declines, especially industrial, automation, and the energy infrastructure market that is still not found, I believe, at the bottom. We'll have to see what H1 2025. Has planned for that. On the automotive market, similar to Q3, we did see kind of a pretty significant weakness, maybe outside of China.\nIt declined about mid single digit, about 5% sequentially. China did grow, but not enough to offset the declines in Europe, the US, and Japan, which is very, it was kind of similar to what we've seen in Q3, but maybe the growth in China was less pronounced and the decline outside of China was more pronounced. That would be my high level summary for Q4 and a little bit for Q1.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYou have a follow-up, Toshiya?\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI do. Dave, thanks so much. The earnings outlook for Q1, Haviv, there's a pretty significant drop off on a sequential basis for a 2% to 3% decline in revenue. I was hoping you could kind of provide some context there. Is it primarily gross margin, and behind that, is it continued underloading, increase in depreciation, some of the same dynamics we saw over the past 12 months? Is it higher OpEx, anything below the line? Any sort of additional color on the drop off in EPS Q4 to Q1? That would be helpful, thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nI think I covered revenue. Rafael, maybe you covered the other part.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, happy to. Okay, maybe let me start with GPM, then I'll go to opex, and then I'll go to the other income line, which is relevant this time. On gross margins, keep in mind that depreciation is increasing, first of all. Second, well, revenue is decreasing. That has an impact. Depreciation is increasing, and we are, in order to manage inventory, reducing factory loadings. We've reduced some of that in the fourth quarter, but we're going to reduce those further. In first quarter, I do expect GPM percent to decrease probably a few hundred basis points fourth quarter to first quarter. Let me comment on OpEx. OpEx.\nWill increase 3% to 5% fourth to first, and that's kind of normal seasonal increases that happen in first quarter. On OpEx, in addition to the overall increases in investments that we're making, beyond that, this time it's relevant that interest income is decreasing by about $50 million. The reason that is happening is short term interest rates are decreasing, and that's where we invest our cash, and our cash on the balance sheet cash levels are also decreasing. A combination of lower interest rates and lower cash gives you a significant drop in other income. In this case, that's about $50 million less fourth going to first quarter. Great, thank you. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director Covering Semiconductors & Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, thank you. I guess first question would be with regard to the Embedded business, and we're seeing a sharp divergence there between those two businesses, particularly on the margin side. Can you give some explanation of what's going on between the Analog and the Embedded businesses, and the reason for the decline in the Embedded margins.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me just say a few words on the revenue side, and I'll let Rafael talk about the margins over there. Again, embedded and analog a little bit are, you know, like many of the phenomena we see regarding markets, geographies, we are seeing an asynchronous behavior between these two markets. As you remember, embedded, our embedded business grew in 2023, while our analog business in 2023 declined double digits. We saw a later peak about a year later on embedded. That's the reason we see a sharper decline in embedded right now, while analog in Q4 actually grew. I think analog is about a year, maybe, ahead on embedded in terms of the cyclical behavior regarding profitability. Rafael, I'm sure it's related to alpha, but you go, that's absolutely right.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. The profitability embedded first is revenue. As revenue drops, you know, that clearly has an impact on profitability. The second part that is different than Analog is that Embedded is taking a disproportionate impact due to LFAB, the Lehi factory in Utah. Because that factory, while it's going to serve both Embedded and it's serving both Embedded and Analog, it disproportionately serves Embedded. Since it's underutilized right now, it takes that hit from that underutilization of factory loading, which affects Embedded disproportionately. You have a follow on, Chris?\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director Covering Semiconductors & Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, got it. That's helpful. I guess the follow-up question would be some update on, you know, what's going on in China right now. You had spoken about, you know, I guess the auto business again is stronger there. Perhaps you could talk about, you know, the rest of the business that you're seeing in China, the industrial business, for example. You know, we know that you've been taking some actions to kind of take back some of the share that you may have lost when your lead times were longer. Could you give us an update on that and how that may be affecting some numbers in the near term?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nSure. First, high level, our China business in Q4 did grow. Both. Sequentially but also year over year. I think it was mid teens or that area for the entire China business. I think the automotive, Frank, we talked about it last quarter, we're seeing the same phenomenon, meaning customers are continuing to do well, and there is a bigger share for the EV. Vehicle types in China, which has higher content. Secular growth is helping us in China on the automotive side. I think we mentioned it also in previous calls that we had some supply limitations during the upcycle in China. The personal electronics market was one of the main markets that.\nSuffered when we were short. We are seeing this market growing in China. It grew sequentially again nicely in Q3, but also year over year. That market grew significantly in China and also in the US. These are the main markets. We have our personal electronics businesses. Overall, again, overall business in China right now is healthy. You asked about industrial. We haven't seen yet. The start of the cyclical growth again in industrial across all of our geographies. China here is not an outlier. The strength is coming mainly from, I would say, automotive and from personal electronics.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me just add a little color. US, China, and really rest of Asia, it's really more flat. Describe it sequentially. Europe and Japan were down low double digits, as Haviv mentioned. If you look year on year, you see the US and China up, you know, kind of 12%, 14% in that range. That growth was offset overall by declines in the other regions.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYep.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Thank you,\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank yoy Chris. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I wanted to ask about the pricing environment in general. You didn't mention that, Rafael or Haviv, in any of your discussions about gross margin, or the competitive environment, or any of the sequential weakness. Just wondered if that has changed in any meaningful way, either Analog versus Embedded, or in certain geographies. Just any update on that front will be helpful.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, at a high level, the pricing environment is not. We've not seen any change in Q4 versus what we've seen in 2024. I think we've expected. I think we said in the beginning of 2024 that pricing would go back to previous behavior where pricing would decline low single digits, like-for-like parts per year. That's more or less what it did in 2024 as the year ended. Of course, I think I did provide some color on revenue by market. The mix has changed, right? The selling price, if you will, has changed because industrial in 2023 was 40% of revenue. It declined to 34% in 2024. The PE market.\nGrew from 15% in 2023 to 20% in 2024. That is a big change of mix, if you will. That's what we have seen. The like for like parts has behaved as expected. I'm not expecting that to be different in 2025. That's a comment across all geographies.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Follow on, Ross.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, I do a little bit of a longer term question maybe for Haviv. Historically, the company's talked about share gains and losses in your markets being measured in basis points. I think 15, 20, 25 basis points a year. Given the fragmented nature of it, it was kind of what you would aspire to. It can, of course, go down or up, I guess for kind of idio reasons, supply shocks, those sorts of things. Now that you have the supply, it seems like the world has plenty of supply. Is there any reason that that historical share gain pace would be any different going forward?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nAgain, when we talk about share down or up, I think the only way to really measure it is over the long term. That's always been our approach. That's the way we run the company. That's the way we behave. Right. TI, yes, there was a lot of, I would say, a shockwave almost during COVID. It was not only supply, demand mismatch, but behavior of customers and almost anxiety of needing parts. I think inventory was built, and I think it's still playing out. I wouldn't say that this asynchronous behavior across markets is done. We see it still across sectors in industrial. We see it differently between geographies. We even see it internally between our embedded business and analog business.\nIt's one of these things that, and I kind of hate to say it, but time will tell where we are. I am excited about the fact that we have the right inventory level, the right supply to support growth. I'm encouraged about our progress in the analog market. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did grow the analog business from a year-over-year perspective in Q4. It was a couple of points of growth, after about eight quarters of decline. I think.\nI look forward to continue to grow that business, especially when you think about the long term, and most importantly, the secular growth in the market that we've mentioned, industrial and automotive. I'm convinced that it's there. I'm convinced that our product portfolio is improving and strengthening, and we will have the right level of capacity and inventory to support our customers. Obviously, expectation that I have for the team is, well, TI will continue to compete for market share and grow it.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please.\nThank you. Our next call question comes from the line of Chris Danley with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Danely\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, thanks guys. Hey Haviv. I guess just a little bit of a drill down on the end markets. How would you expect things to sort of play out this year? Maybe talk about where you would expect relative strength or not strength by the end markets. Have you seen, would you say you've seen any change in business conditions over the last three months? Like better, worse, or not really?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. You know, Chris, as I think I told you last time we met, we call it when we see it, meaning I can tell you what happened. It's very hard for us to tell you exactly what will happen even for this quarter. I think I mentioned even during the last call, lead times are short, customers are coming real time for demand. Our turn business, or what we call aging, is running high right now simply because customers are almost waiting for the last second before they make the order and we fulfill it because we do have the right level of inventory, and of course, capacity to support further growth. I will say that I think that some of the markets, and we've seen it through 2024.\nThey are already on the cyclical upturn. We saw it in PE, then enterprise, really driven by data center joint, and we are seeing nice growth over there and even communication business. I would say that I think it found the bottom. We saw it somewhere in, I think, in Q1 2024 and grew sequentially since then, and even returned to year-over-year growth in Q4. These three markets, I think they are on the upturn, and I don't think that I expect, at least, that if nothing major changes, to continue into 2025. The big question for us, also, 75% of our business or 70% of our business in 2024 is industrial and automotive.\nHere, we haven't seen the bottom yet. Let's be very clear about that. We're seeing points of strength.I've given China as an example. We'll have to see how the year plays out. I do believe that on the industrial side, there is kind of, as I said last time, this hovering at the low level is a great position to grow from. We'll just have to wait and see when it wants to do it. Chris, and of course when we see it, we'll say it the following. Chris?\n\nChris Danely\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Citi\n\nSure. Just quickly on Embedded, so it looks like you guys have the lowest margins there in, I think, over a decade or something like that. Does something need to be changed or restructured there to get Embedded back to an adequate level of margins, or maybe talk about what needs to be done to get it to some sort of an appreciable level of margin?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me take a quick high-level answer. Chris and Rafael will give a little bit more. What's going on there? I think you're seeing a business in transition, Chris.\nI'm growing more excited about embedded every quarter. I think our portfolio is strengthening and we are winning business. We are going through a transition, especially on the manufacturing side, and that puts pressure on the margins. But we are convinced that strategically embedded is going to be a great contributor to free cash flow per share. And so this short answer to your question about restructuring or anything, the answer. No. Rafael, maybe you can provide some more color. What's going on there?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, I'll just add similar to what I said in a few calls a few questions ago, one is the revenue is the main factor. As Haviv talked about earlier in the call, Embedded has seen a sharp decline because it took longer to get into the downturn than analog did. But if you look at peak to drop, they're about the same place analog and embedded. And then the other reason is LFAB. Right.\nSo Embedded is taking a disproportionate amount of the impact from having LFAB underutilized. But let me stress, just like that takes away, it gives it to you on the other end. So when we ramp, as we ramp LFAB and as we move from external to internal, you're really going to like the fall through both to gpm, but even better to free cash flow. As we do that.So Embedded is as in transition, and when we're on the other side, we're going to like the results.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Chris. And go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You know, one of the metrics we look at to gauge the health of the cycle is the number of customer pushouts, cancellations, rescheduling of the backlog relative to prior quarters, or maybe big changes right on customer forward forecasts inside of the quarter. Has this level activity remained at kind of normalized levels? And then maybe on another metric we look at is terms orders and I know Haviv, you said it's at high levels, but is that coming in about as expected as well?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Let me start with the second part of the question. I'll let Dave comment about the first part. So look, we came in Q4 at the higher side of the range, close to the top of the range. That all came from what we call the terms business. So we didn't see that in the beginning of the quarter, and it came in real time. So you know, we need to see that that continues into the beginning of next year, of this year. Of course, there is Chinese New Year right now. And we just have to see that. It's not that it's a trend rather than anything that is, you know, a one-quarter phenomenon, but the terms business looked very, very good in Q4.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Harlan, when you look at those other indicators, like you brought up cancellations, we, you know, had seen those drop several quarters ago, and they continue to be at very low levels. You know, if you look at things like revenue linearity, you know, revenue increase each through the quarter, that's very typical for us to see that. And Haviv mentioned earlier, you know, lead times remain short. We have availability of essentially all of our products that we sell via the web available for immediate shipment, so customers can behave and have that confidence that they can get the product that we've got. You have a follow on?\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah, thank you. So right before the Capital Management update back in August, I remember you had just received your preliminary CHIPS Act grant allocation, $1.6 billion. You know, that number was solidified I think in December. And this was not contemplated in your free cash flow per share calculation. In the CHIPS Act press release, you guys articulated some of the milestones attached to those grant dollars. And it looks like actually many of those milestones are going to be executed, you know, in or before 2026.\nAnd that's, you know, 1.6 billion in grant dollars that drives, you know, an incremental $75 of free cash flow per share versus sort of what you potentially laid out in your 2026 scenario analysis. Have you mapped out that $1.6 billion in CHIPS Act grants over 2025, 2026, and maybe have an updated view on the potential better free cash flow per share profile for Texas Instruments?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nSo let me try to answer that question first. Kind of bigger picture. As you alluded to, the Department of Commerce awarded us up to $1.6 billion in CHIPS Act funding. This will help support three of our new 300-millimeter wafer fabs under construction in Texas and Utah. This direct funding coupled with the ITC will help us provide a geopolitically dependable supply of analog and embedded processing chips for years to come.\nMaybe the most important point is over the life of the program, between the ITC and the direct funding, we expect to receive $7.5 to 9.5 billion dollars in total. We've received some of that already. In 2024 and expect 2025 and beyond to continue. We don't have any specific details to share at this point on the cash payments related to the direct funding. But as those happens, we will share those.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nI will just add that, you know, the math is not incorrect, but the timing is the problem. Right. So I think, as you said, there is and we talked about free cash flow. So it also depends when we get the cash. We just don't have that visibility. The milestones are related, as you, I think, mentioned, to clean room construction and tool installations in Sherman one, which we are.\nYou know, we started installing tools in the summer of 2024 and it moves well. The construction of SM2, the shell, which, you know, it's not done yet, but it's moving well. The other part is more in Utah, it's LFAB2. This is where we talk about clean room construction and tool installation for LFAB2. But we are now only starting the groundwork over there. So there is still quite a bit of execution in LFAB2 and we will see how that timing works as we continue to move forward on that execution.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me add one more thing. Just given that we have been officially awarded $1.6 billion, we already booked that on our balance sheet. So we have $1.6 billion receivable. You can see that on the balance sheet, the other side of that $1 billion of that decrease in our net PP&E because that's related to a factory that's already built. $0.6 of that is actually deferred liability because it's related to a factory that's not built. But the bottom line where I'm going is that this is already going to decrease our expected depreciation. So with that, let me give you an update to depreciation. Depreciation for 2025, now you should expect $1.8 to 2 billion.\nThat's slightly down from the previous expectation. For 2026, we're keeping the range the same $2.3 to 2.7 billion. But I'll tell you that we expect to be on the lower half of that range. That's a 2026 depreciation expectation, 2.3% to 2.7%, to be at the lower end of that range.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I know you guys are loath to talk out beyond the quarter, but was hoping you could give us a framework for thinking about gross margins beyond the March quarter. You just gave us the depreciation, so that's very helpful. We'd love to hear kind of your thoughts on what's optimal inventory and therefore planned utilization beyond March. Is March quarter kind of the low for gross margins and we should start tracking higher. Any thoughts there would be very helpful.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, I'm happy to do that. It's going to be very similar to what I've said before, but it all starts with revenue. So, you know, revenue is the number one driver of gross margin, both dollars and percent, going forward. You model your revenue, then you follow that through at 75% to 85%. And then after you do that, then you have to adjust for depreciation increases. And I already gave you the depreciation number, so you can model that in the future. This works much better if you do full years and you do it over the long term rather than any given quarter. And on that, you know, the other factor that you have is factory loadings or underutilization.\nRight now, as I mentioned, we expect a hit from that in Q1.But that's just as it's a hit, sometimes it's a benefit when you go the other way. But that depends on revenue expectations. So if revenue materializes in the future and we expect that to continue, then we ramp up the factories and that helps with the loadings. And that tends to take the 75 to 85 towards the high end of that range. If that doesn't happen, then you're looking at the lower end of that range.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nI think you touched it before, Rafael, is related to our execution. So of course, revenue, we want to grow it, and definitely we want to do it faster than the market. That's always our objective. But on the other hand, it's that L5 execution, right? We are executing our transitions from our foundry business into Lehi. I expect that to have a step forward in 2025, especially as our automotive business. We have a bunch of parts that are what we call. They have a safety spec that usually the qual is a little bit more complex, it just takes a little bit longer. But we are moving well on that execution.\nAnd again, my expectation from the team is to meet our commitment to our customers and get these parts. Out of Lehi as they prefer that dependable capacity. And for us, it's a way lower cost and of course, helps.As a byproduct on the margins as well.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nFollow on. Cj.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah, yeah, just a quick one. Dave, Rafael, just to go back to kind of the loading question. If we do assume normal seasonal pattern for your top line into Q2, Q3, should we assume that loadings would move higher in Q2?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYou know, we forecast Q1 at a time, so I'm going to stick with that. But I'll also say, maybe as you're alluding to, the more revenue we have, then let me put it this way. We're not planning $4.5 billion of inventory is a healthy level of inventory, and we would not want to be draining those levels at this point. So maybe that gives you enough to think about.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director Covering Semiconductors & Semiconductor Capital Equipment, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWe'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHey guys, thank you for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow up on the previous one you mentioned not necessarily wanting to drain the inventory levels below the $4.5 billion levels. As we think about how you're thinking about Q1 though, is this the level you're comfortable with and you're going to manage to the $4.5 billion? And I guess to ask more acutely, is there a near- to medium-term inventory target on a day's basis that we should be thinking about? Because I know that's obviously evolved through the last several years. I'd be curious how you're thinking about it now as we sort of are getting closer to end demand.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. First let me give you a big picture and I'll give you some specifics, but big picture, you know, inventory, the goal here, the objective is to maintain high levels of customer service while we minimize the obsolescence of inventory. We have target levels at the finished goods, at the chip level for the 80,000 parts that we sell in different end markets. And that is done in a very rigorous and disciplined way on a part by part basis. So that's how we look at it. And the risk of obsolescence on this part is very, very low. This part lasts for a long time. They sell to many, many customers for many, many years in very long life cycles.\nNow to the specific that you asked, given how we're running the factories right now, I would expect a further increase of inventory levels going into Q1, but probably in the $100 million, $100 million plus level and then potentially stabilize at that point around that level.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nFollow on. Josh.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst of Semiconductors Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, thank you for the color, Rafael. Yeah, to follow up, I wanted to ask about. There were some earlier questions about competition, specifically in pricing. I guess I wanted to ask bigger picture, not necessarily pricing related, but as some of your peers have sort of gotten through and lapped and are no longer shipping NCNRs or LTSAs, have you noticed a change in the competitive backdrop on the number of sockets that are open for competition? I'd be curious to hear about if there's any change again competitively over the last couple quarters. Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I haven't seen a significant change. It feels the same to me, kind of stable. I mean we are in a down cycle and I remember throughout my career every time there is a down cycle the market gets more competitive and it feels the same now. And that's again across all markets, all geographies. But I haven't seen any significant change in the last couple of quarters to your direct question.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Josh. We've got time for one last caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. This is for Haviv and Rafael. Just at the Capital Markets Day, you guys highlighted different CapEx ranges depending on kind of different revenue categories. And I know the intention there wasn't to guide revenue, but you just updated us on depreciation in response to just the ITC and some of the grants as well. Is the depreciation being at the lower end entirely a function or the updated guide that you're giving today entirely a function of those tax credits and grants, or is that a function of potentially lower CapEx as well?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nIt is not a function of lower CapEx. We continue to expect CapEx for 2025 to be $5 billion. And in 2026, as we said at the last call, between $2 to $5 billion depending on further expectations. And we'll have more clarity on that in the second half of the year.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. And again, I will add this is not. I mean, as we said in August, our plan is still. We like the plan. We are going to be very deliberate, disciplined, executing. We always look at the environment and what's going on. But based on what I see right now, you shouldn't expect a plan to change in terms of our phase I, phase II, as I described. Phase one is serving us very well. This is how we move revenue from external foundries into our Lehi factory in Utah. And also on the analog side, we want most of our parts running on 300 other than, for example, 6-inch fab that we are shutting down. And that's going well. The phase II is very important for our future.\nSo you know we are going to complete the qualification line in Sherman 1, we are going to set the shell or build the shell in Sherman 2, and also build the shell in Lehi so it can give us this flexible capacity phase that we are so excited about and so are the customers. Once they engage with us, they fully understand that not only they will have enough cleanroom capacity to grow into, but also the qualification is going to be behind them. So their parts are already running, for example in Sherman or in Lehi and that gives them a very, very.\nEasy path to grow. Their business with us without having to go through recall and new fabs or new suppliers. So I think that plan serves our customers well, and we are continuing to execute to it. And as you said, the slides in August, and we'll probably see a very similar story in a couple of weeks, is that we want to say that we have a plan, but we do always have flexibility into the plan, especially in 2026 and 2027.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat. Tom, you got a follow up?\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nI do. Thanks for all the detail there. That last one of the call, so broader, and I hate to end it on this, but I just wanted to give you a chance to respond. So, articles out on a China statement talking about dumping product in that market. I think there's an ongoing debate just around the sustainability of China longer term. I guess part of this question is, can you just address what you've seen in the public there, and then kind of as a derivative of that, you're obviously growing year over year in China. You're seeing strength in China auto; you highlighted that. But outside of that, are you seeing any change in the dynamic there in terms of your ability to ship product competition? Just addressing the whole debate. Thank you.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. And again, I'll probably not settle the debate. I'll just tell you what we see, and I'll start with the high level in China. It's an important market. China represents 20% more or less of world GDP, and you want to play in that market. By the way, our business in 2024 in China was at about 20%. So we are kind of.\nNot over or under penetrated in China. It's kind of just right at 20%. Our commitment is to our customers. Our customers in China, they rely on our parts. They want to have the best products, they want to have the highest quality, they want to get best service. TI is a good supplier. On top of it, their ambitions is to be global players. Right. So maybe they are part of the headquarters in China. But they want to sell their end equipment to any geography. In that sense TI is a great supplier because we are a global player. We have a diverse footprint of manufacturing and support structure and that's a great fit for their needs. Now as you know, and I think this is not news, the China market has always been competitive and is continuing to be.\nWe know that they are very capable, motivated, fast-moving competition. But I think the competitive advantages of TI allows us to compete. Whether it's our broad portfolio, the reach of the channel, and also our position in industrial and automotive. Customers value their value and want to continue to do business with TI, and we want to compete, and that's really the fact that we own our manufacturing, own our technology. I think we have the right cost structure to compete across our entire portfolio. Whether it's, you know, low AUP general purpose parts or very integrated sophisticated ASPs that are tailored for a specific application.\nWe don't need to self-select. We want to compete across our portfolio, and our customers there appreciate that. I continue to see that specifically to your question, you know, at this time we haven't been notified about an investigation, and it's kind of business as usual between us and our customers in China.\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nThat's great.Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you for asking that question, Tom. And thank you everyone else for joining us tonight. We look forward to sharing our capital management call on Tuesday, 4 February at 10:00AM Central Time. A replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Haviv Ilan, and our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings.\nFor a more complete description today, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management as well as share the guidance for the third quarter of 2024. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks Dave. Let me also start by welcoming everyone to the call. I'm looking forward to joining our quarterly earnings calls, moving forward and sharing more details about our business strategy with the investment community. It is an opportunity for me to directly share more information about our results and our strategic progress. With that, I'll start with a quick overview of the second quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and a decrease of 16% year over year. Analog revenue declined 11% year over year, and Embedded Processing declined 31%. Our Other segment declined 22% from the year ago quarter.\nNow I'll provide some insight into our Q2 revenue by end market. Our results continue to reflect the asynchronous behavior across our end markets that we've seen in and throughout this cycle. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down low-single digits, the automotive market was down mid-single digits, Personal Electronics grew mid-teens with broad-based growth while demonstrating continued improvement compared to its low point in Q1 2023. Next, communication equipment was up mid-single digits, and finally enterprise systems was up about 20%.\nLastly, before I pass it on to Rafael, I'd like to share a few comments regarding our capacity investments. We and our customers remain pleased with our progress of the expansion of our 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity. These investments reflect our confidence in the opportunity ahead, which remains high for several reasons. First, we have a high level of confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content, particularly in industrial and automotive, where we have greater exposure and strong product positions. Second, geopolitically dependable low-cost 300-millimeter capacity will be increasingly critical and valuable, and our investments enable us to support customer demand at scale. To share more details on our progress, which we believe is helpful for all of our shareholders to understand, I plan to hold an off-cycle capital management call with Rafael and Dave on 20th August.\nDuring the call I will provide more granularity on our capacity investments along with a framework of revenue and free cash flow per share scenarios. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, second quarter revenue was $3.8 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.2 billion or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 60 basis points primarily due to higher revenue as well as lower manufacturing unit cost due to increased factory loadings and more manufacturing internally with more wafers on 300-millimeter. Operating expenses in the quarter were $963 million, up 3% from a year ago and about as expected on a trailing twelve-month basis. Operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 23% of revenue.\nOperating profit was $1.2 billion in the quarter or 33% of revenue and was down 37% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.22 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $6.4 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter and $5 billion over the last twelve months. Free cash flow on a trailing twelve month basis was $1.5 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow includes benefits from the CHIPS Act Investment Tax Credit, which was $312 million for second quarter. In the quarter we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $71 million of our stock.\nIn total, we returned $4.9 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.7 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter we repaid $300 million of debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%.\nInventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion of $23 million from the prior quarter and days were 229, down 6 days sequentially. For the third quarter we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.94 to $4.26 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.48. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value. In the long term, we continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions.\nWe will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for a follow-up.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nOperator, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please. As we poll for question.\nOur first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. There were some comments from a geopolitical perspective. You know, one of the candidates is talking about the China-Taiwan relationship, and I'm just asking how the geopolitical environment is sort of impacting your customers' buying decisions. I think you said last call that even some of your Chinese customers who are exporting product want geopolitically dependable capacity. I think you talk about that being kind of an increasingly big factor in and autos. Can you talk about that, and is that beginning to drive some share gains for you?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Tim. I'll take that, Haviv. First, geopolitical dependable capacity is not a new thing for us. We have started to see these requests coming, I think two or three years ago when tensions started to rise. But as we reflect on it now, three years in, it's obvious that there is more and more attention, usually at the highest levels of our customers. I'm talking about leadership of CEOs or chief purchasing officers looking at their supply chain and making sure that they are going to be immune from whatever is thrown at them. Part of it is geopolitical tensions, and this is where TI is a great answer. We are a very unique supplier in the sense of we can provide the capacity at scale, meaning the amount of wafers and the size of the capacity that we are building is very high.\nIt is a very affordable capacity. Us building our parts on 300-millimeter wafers allows for a lower cost per chip, and then building them internally in our assembly and test houses also provides a very good low-cost structure. Last but not least, is this geopolitically dependable capacity, meaning our fabs are being built in the U.S. mainly in Texas and in Lehi, Utah. We provide a capacity that is at scale, affordable, and dependable. Yes, every time there is some news out there, you know, we are seeing more interest. We have seen that grow over the last several years, and in that sense our discussions with our customers are providing us more opportunity to win positions in future platforms.\nI do believe we are taking a bigger share and this is part of our confidence to continue with our investments to serve that opportunity moving forward. Last but not least, you have touched China. Yes, you're right. If I take an example, and just on the automotive side, our customers in China do care a lot about their export business. In that sense, our capacity is highly welcomed by them because we can compete at the market price with a very competitive offering, yet have that dependability to serve their customers not only in China, but also outside of China for their export business.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, yes.\nRafael, can you give us an update on CHIPS Act? Do you know how much you're getting yet, and can you kind of talk about that?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, sure, Tim. So on the CHIPS, frankly, we're still going through the process, so we submitted the application, and we're just working through the details with the CHIPS Program Office. But given your question, let me comment also on the ITC Investment Tax Credit today. To date, we have accrued about $1.8 billion. In total, that's under 25% ITC. This benefit already started flowing through the income statement and slower depreciation. In addition, in second quarter, we received, as I said in the prepared remarks, $312 million of cash benefits, and that is reflected in operating and free cash flow. We expect to receive another $200 million in Q3 and for a total of $1 billion for 2024.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat.\nThank you, Tim. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. In Q2 it looked like the strength was primarily from Personal Electronics given industrial models were down and maybe calculators as well.\nI don't know.\nOther was pretty strong. I was wondering if you could give us some color on where your expectations for the growth in Q3 sequentially is coming from. Is it still primarily at personal electronics, and I guess maybe calculators or other stuff? How do I think about the end market trends as we go forward in the next quarter?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks for the question, Stacy. I'll start and I'll let Dave add some more color on Q2. So if I go back to the second quarter, yes, if you look at our results, Industrial did decline at the low single digits. Automotive continued to decline at mid single digits. That was the third quarter in a row of that decline. Although from a year over year perspective it's still doing well, meaning less than 10% of a decline. It declined about 9% in Q2. Yes, there is strength in personal electronics and I do see that market.\nIt went down through the entire cycle. It troughed sometime in Q1 2023, and we've seen that market strengthening, and again it grew mid-teens sequentially but close to 20% year over year. So there is definitely strength over there. I would also say that on the enterprise market, again smaller revenue for us, but we are seeing a recovery over there, and I believe that inventory correction is behind us. Regarding the other business, it grew thanks to our calculator business as you mentioned, but also our DLP business. We mainly serves the personal electronics market. Dave, maybe you can add some more color on the sectors as we talk about Q2.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I think as we have seen even inside of industrial, we've had sectors behave asynchronously. So when we first began to see weakness in industrial, which really began in the third quarter, that was the peak. In Q3 2022 that was the peak in industrial. We talked about seeing about half of the sectors or so show weakness. And those early, I'll call them earlier stage sectors, some of them have found bottoms and begun to grow, and you can see some of that bottoming process taking place. The others we're only three or so quarters in, and we've got several of them that are continuing decline at double-digit rates. So again, as we've seen all of our markets behave asynchronously inside of the sectors. We've seen that in industrial as well. Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI do actually, maybe to re-ask the same question. So you're guiding revenue sequentially up close to $300 million. How do I think about that $300 million growth parsing out across the end markets into Q3?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYes, Stacy, you know I'm on the call, but still we are not going to predict or to give a guidance by market for the third quarter. I mean it's at the midpoint of the range. We expect revenue to grow about 7%, but as you know, it's not unusual for us to see sequential growth in the third quarter. I mean typically this is a seasonal.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nIs it PE? Is what I'm asking.\nIs it most.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nTypically in normal? Yeah, typically Q3 is a quarter where we know if you go back to pre-COVID days, this is the quarter where customers are preparing their end equipment or their end product for the holiday season. So it's usually a strong quarter for the company, and we are seeing that a very similar behavior right now at the midpoint of the range of our forecast. I don't know, Dave, if you want\nto add anything\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nI think that's good. Thank you, Stacy. We'll go to the next call.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the China market and what you are seeing in terms of not just the demand side, but are you seeing any incremental supply coming on that can create a concern from a pricing perspective? Because every time this question is asked to industries or not just AI.\nThe answer is always that, well, the IP is not there. They don't have product breadth and whatnot, but they're still buying a lot of trailing edge equipment. So at what point does that start to become a concern from just a global capacity and global pricing perspective for Texas Instruments?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Vivek. Let me start with the first part, maybe, of your question on how the China market did, because I think it was a good quarter for our China business. Our China-based business grew sequentially at about 20% versus Q1. And we've seen momentum across all markets. I mean, all five markets grew sequentially, I think, 15% or 20%. So they all did well. And this is after seven quarters of sequential decline. So if you think about the way I look at the China.\nMarket and it was exposed.\nTo all end markets for TI, it took seven quarters for this asynchronous cycle to go through, starting with PE personal electronics, then spreading to industrial, enterprise, and just lately to automotive. All of these have now corrected, and Q2 was a good quarter for our business. I believe we are now shipping to end demand, meaning customers have stopped managing their inventories over there. Now, in terms of the competition in China, I don't think that's. I mean we've been very vocal about it. This is, first, not new that the competition has intensified over the past several years. I think it's growing stronger. I think it's a mistake for us to think that these guys are only doing simple parts. These are very ambitious, highly educated.\nCompetitors. Our job here in TI, and that's what I try to teach the team, is to compete. I will tell you that yes, the market is more competitive in China, but we can compete and we can win business in very attractive margins. We are going to continue to do that. Our goal objective is to continue and gain market share in China.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nIf I just add one thing, Haviv, the growth in China that we saw was strong across all the markets, including automotive and industrial there. So I think that's an important. So Vivek, you have a follow up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you, Dave. So I know for Q3 you're not giving specific end market commentary, but just from an industry perspective, how would you describe the supply demand situation in industrial and automotive semis? Just because we see such a broad range of data points, do you think we are past the worst in terms of inventory adjustment and supply issues for those two end markets? And if you could describe the situation in those two markets separately, that would be really, really helpful.\nThank you\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nDave. I'll let you take this one.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay. Yeah, I think of what we can see, Vivek. Of course, we don't get any data feeds on customer inventory. We don't get any data feeds on customer shipments. But we can look into things like the order patterns. We can look at feeds that we get in consignment, we can see what's happening in, you know, with our inventories and our positions. So, as we've talked about, cancellations, as an example, as a measure, have continued to come down. Our lead times I described as very stable, we've got immediate availability of almost all of our products. So that does drive lower visibility with backlog because customers can get product when they need it. And we do believe that some markets PE bottomed back in Q1 2023 and has been more seasonal since then.\nWe've seen some of the other markets that, as we shared earlier, are beginning to grow. So there's likely a bottom forming within some of those markets. We've got industrial and automotive that have continued to decline. Now I'd say within industrial, I mentioned earlier, some of the sectors are forming a bottom, others are continuing to decline, and automotive we've got Q3, Q4 behind us. Right. So that's how, as we look into where we are positioned today, but we don't have a strong signal that can tell us exactly to be able to answer the question that you asked.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, the only one comment I will add, Vivek, in terms of the difference, so you know, automotive so far, at least just year to date, is down mid single digits, and that is off of a very good 2023 for us. Right. We grew about 17% in 2023, and I think it just helped by the strong secular content growth that we see in automotive, and this is across both combustion engines or ice and EVs. So that may be the difference, the slight difference I see between these two markets.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, thank you Vivek. We'll go to the next caller please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymour with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Haviv, it's great to have you on the call, so I'll ask one for you and maybe Rafael would chime in as well. You guys have given, at least Rafael in the past, some mid-quarter updates or earnings call updates on CapEx and depreciation versus your pre-existing plan. So are you still planning to spend $5 billion a year, and is the depreciation ranges Rafael, you gave before, still apply or are we going to have some more flexibility on those metrics going forward?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, I'll start and Rafael, maybe you can, you can provide some more color. So first again, our strategy has not changed and it continues to serve as well. As I said before, the secular growth in industrial and automotive and our position, our market position, and our product portfolio position gives us the confidence that there is a higher opportunity over there. On top of it, as we said earlier, customers do want and value a geopolitically dependable capacity. So we are pleased with our progress. Our CapEx strategy provide us both with capacity for growth and flexibility. At the end of the day, CapEx supports revenue growth and need to be prepared for different scenarios. Now we always continue to evaluate our plans and investment based on what we see on the demand environment, the dynamics, the growth opportunities in the market.\nTo talk more about it, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to have our off cycle capital management call in a month, in four weeks. This is just an opportunity to share just additional insight. So we'll go through our investment plan with more granularity on what exactly we are doing per factory, and then we'll provide a framework of revenue scenarios and what free cash flow per share and CapEx would do.\nVersus each and every scenario. Regarding depreciation, Rafael, I don't know if you want to add anything.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, so I'll just comment on depreciation. Ross, I'm going to narrow that depreciation range a little bit both for 2024 and 2025. So for 2024 we now expect depreciation to be between $1.5 and 1.6 billion, and for 2025 we now expect depreciation to be about $2 to 2.3 billion.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nFollow on, Rafael.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nI do, and thanks for all those details, Haviv and Rafael. So one for you, Rafael. If I heard you right on the gross margin rising in the second quarter, you mentioned that loadings increased. I thought that they were going to decrease to burn some inventory now that you had that at kind of the $4 billion target. So did something change there? And what's the expectations for utilization going forward?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no. So the loadings came in about as expected.\nBut let me just tell you more about it. Q2 loadings were up versus Q1 and, as you saw, we were essentially flat on inventory. So, essentially, the ins and outs we're pretty much offsetting when it comes to Q3, we expect.\nFactory loadings to be flat to slightly up. You know, in our base case for our EPS guidance that we have, that's what we have in there. Of course we have time during the quarter to adjust those loadings depending on what we expect for fourth quarter on GPM, specifically for third quarter, in that base case, at the midpoint of our guidance, I would expect GPM percent to be up versus second quarter.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you, Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Danley with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nHey, thanks for letting me ask a question, guys. Just to follow up on Ross's question, in terms of gross margin, so depreciation is going up like $100 million roughly per quarter for next year. But if utilization rates keep going up, that is, if nothing gets any worse, do you think, is it possible that your gross margins are bottoming now or is there anything else that could drive them lower or maybe provide a tailwind? Just give us maybe the mechanics around it for the next several quarters.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nSure, sure. No, I'll be happy and I'll keep it. Well, at the end of the day, yes, it is possible that that is the case. It's all going to depend on revenue, of course. So the main driver is revenue. And in addition to revenue, as we bring more executing our strategy to load more 300-millimeter wafers and bring in more external loadings internal, the fall-through, excluding depreciation, will likely turn more in the range of 75%-85% on a year-on-year basis. Now, of course, any one quarter, even any one year, you may have puts and takes that, you know, utilization or factory loadings is one of those that sometimes it goes against you, sometimes it goes in favor. But in general, expect that fall-through on 75%-85%, not counting depreciation. So you do the math.\nWhatever revenue assumption you want to put over the next several quarters or years, do that, follow through, and you can very easily model where. And then I just gave you depreciation. Right. So you can then model what gross margins can do over the next several years.\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nGreat. Thanks for the additional breadcrumbs. They're very useful. My follow up is just on bookings. I think last quarter you said that bookings were increasing every month. Is that still true? And do you think that for the industrial automotive space, we're at least getting close to the bottom there, or do you feel any better about either of those end markets on a relative basis?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah.\nSo again, as you look at those things, revenue did increase as well as orders throughout the quarter, which is very typical.\nThat we would see in the second quarter. Certainly as we've got growth at the midpoint, that would not be unexpected. You know, again, those other sides of lead times.\nReally on all of our products having immediate availability and stable lead times, cancellations continuing to decline. All those things, I think, point to.\nSupply and demand becoming more imbalanced and that availability. There was a second part of your question, Chris, that I'm not addressing. I'm not sure what it was, can you just repeat it for me?\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nAre bookings still increasing month over month, and then between the auto or the industrial end market, do you feel any better or worse about either of those?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWell, yes, again, I think that we've got half of the sectors, again, we can see forming a bottom inside of industrial. Overall.\nIt's been elongated, but if you look at it sector by sector, it's probably a better view overall. In auto, this is our third quarter of decline, you know, we're down about 13%, you know, from where the revenue peaked. It's a pretty shallow decline compared to how the other markets had behaved so far. So, you know.\nThat's what we see. So thank you, Chris.\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Haviv, maybe one for you on capex and how you're thinking about long term revenue growth. You've always had this slide in your capital management call deck where you show revenue supported. I think you have. For 2026 you had $30 billion, for 2030 you had $45 billion. I know you're constantly evaluating your plans and you talked about presenting various scenarios on the August call. But I'm curious, is the $30 billion for 2026 and $45 billion for 2030, are those still kind of the base case scenarios for you or has there been any change post conversations with customers.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nSo Toshiya, first I do want to leave something for August, so I think it's going to be just a better environment to go provide this information. Will also provide supporting materials or updated presentation where you'll see, as I said, the different scenarios and how we see them. To me, step by step right now, when I think about.\nHow we establish our CapEx plan, we need to think about what the next peak wants to do. We'll discuss that. We'll discuss different scenarios of revenue leading to the next peak and what CapEx will do accordingly, and as a result what free cash flow per share will be. Again, I don't want to give the whole pitch right now, but I think it's going to be important for investors to join and hear our latest update.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nUnderstood, I do. Thanks, Dave. Just a question on embedded processing. Revenue was down sequentially, and the year-over-year decline actually accelerated. Analog. We've seen some stabilization, so I'm just curious what you're seeing in the embedded processing side. Is this purely volume pressure, or is there a pricing or competitive component here as well? I think operating margins for that business came in a little bit as well, sequentially. So just curious.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me start first on the high level, the embedded business. When I look underneath, beyond the numbers, it's getting stronger. Our product portfolio is improving. And when I look at this decade, just the opportunity for that business to be a major contributor for TI's growth of free cash flow per share is very high. So I'm very encouraged by the progress of the business. Now, regarding the cycle first, embedded has a little bit of a different structure compared to analog. It's mainly composed of industrial and automotive. So it has less exposure into personal electronics, enterprise, or communication equipment. And these two markets kind of pick up later. Right. So if you look at the embedded business versus analog, it's a year after, kind of middle of 2023 versus the middle of 2022 for the analog business.\nIn addition to that, the embedded business today, although as Rafael mentioned, it's being changed, was mainly supported from foundry wafers during the upcycle. We felt more limitation over there compared to our internal supply capacity. So now when these.\nSupply issues are resolved. We are seeing customers just adjusting their inventory. That's what I believe is happening. Therefore embedded is seeing that sharper.\nCorrection. But again, when I look at it from the top, embedded is strengthening, and I think will continue to serve us very well moving forward.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me just add on the operating profit question or angle that you had, just as a reminder, as said, traditionally embedded has relied on external wafers. But we now have. We're bringing them in, and we have the Lehi factory is disproportionately will serve embedded, and therefore embedded is taking disproportionate amount of the fixed cost charges there. But just like that is a put right now, it will be a tailwind. It's a headwind now. It will be a tailwind in the future as we qualify more and more parts, embedded parts, as well as analog at that Lehi factory.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nSir, thank you so much.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nHave a great day. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nYeah, thank you for taking my question, and great to have you on the call. Maybe to follow up on the embedded question, right, because this business grew 3% last year versus your analog business, which was down 15%. Yeah. Year to date. It's down about as much as your peers or I would argue slightly better. You've articulated the positive strategy changes previously. Right. More catalog, broad market focus. So bottom line, again, over the past few years it seems like you've made good improvements in this business. So as the team moves embedded more to internal manufacturing combined with the strategy shift, maybe Haviv, can you just comment on the design win momentum? What areas are you particularly doing well in? And I'm not sure, Rafael, how should we think about the improvements in embedded margins as you move what was once mostly outsourced to internal manufacturing?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me start, and I'll let Rafael add some more color. But again, as you mentioned, the embedded business has gone through change in the last four or five years, and we have done a great job to position the business such that it benefits competitive advantages. Think about manufacturing and technology, so shifting really from almost like 80% external to now maybe the opposite: 80% internal built, building a higher breadth of products, with not less concentration of revenue per socket, and us expanding our product portfolio utilizing the reach of our market channels. Think about the large sales team of TI. Think about ti.com; the more catalog is the product, the better fit to our strategy. So in that sense, that is moving well in terms of design-win momentum. Again, it's mainly.\nAn industrial and automotive business. So very high visibility on the automotive side. But as you also know, it takes time. So I'm encouraged. With the design-win momentum, our funnel increased tremendously when I compare it to the analog side because every funnel of every supplier grows. But we've seen a disproportionate growth of our design-win momentum for embedded versus previous year and also versus analog just in terms of the rate, and I will give some examples. We see good momentum in real-time control. Think about EVs, on-board charger, think about traction inverters, very good momentum in connectivity, automotive and beyond. Think about car entries, tire pressure monitoring, and other.\nBody-related opportunities in the automotive market. I can continue with kind of our more application-specific products like our radar system. We have great position and growing position in radar, winning a lot of new business both with the Tier 1s and the OEMs. This is imaging radar for the front to the corner radar to even parking assist and also in-cabin sensing. That radar is taking a bigger and bigger part in the automotive market and many other examples on the industrial side. Here the number of end equipment is really vast, you know, hundreds of end equipment. But this is where our Catalog MCUs that we are really reviving the presence of TI and building a new portfolio based on our MSP family is doing very well in winning new business across the board, across the markets utilizing our channel advantage.\nSo I can go on and on here. But again, just evidence of my excitement of what this business can do for us in the second half of this decade. Rafael?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I'll just add on your question on fall throughs for embedded. Of course we don't give guidance separate for the segments. So the 75%-85% gross margin fall through ex depreciation that I talked about earlier applies to both.\nYou know, outside of if we didn't have Lehi, and I'll address that in a second, we didn't have that. I would say generally Analog would be at the higher end of that range and better would be at the lower end. But for the next year, two or three, because Lehi, all those costs are, all those fixed costs are already there, including people. We're going to have some nice tailwind and a good portion of that will go to Embedded. But over the longer time frame, 75%-85% x depreciation is a good guide to use.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah.\nA follow up Harlan.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nYeah. In terms of channel retrace, we haven't heard you guys talk about ti.com in quite some time, and I think the last data point we got was it drove about $2 billion in sales in calendar 2022. And it sort of has this additional benefit from a business planning perspective of being a really good sort of leading indicator of demand inflection as you sort of potentially pass the bottom of sort of the current cycle here. Wondering if there's been any notable movement or trends in ti.com, and maybe from a longer term perspective like what initiatives has the team put in place to sort of further improve the customer pull to ti.com, you know, from a mid to longer term perspective?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me start more in the mid- to longer-term and then let Dave add some more color on how it looks versus, you know, the cycle. So in terms of the investment in TI.com, yes, they are continuing. These are very strategic and important investments for us. We believe there is a huge opportunity to digitize what we call the last mile or that interface between us and the customers. There are many, many customers, still a long tail of customers that we can't see today. But as they move to TI.com, we can supply them with more information. We can even provide opportunity to place backlog electronically directly with TI. And in that sense, the importance for us is to just know our customers better, understand the end equipment, and provide.\nThe relevant product portfolio to serve their growth and win market share. Right. So that data is to us very, very important, and that direct connectivity with the customer is important to do just that. We are investing in IT systems; we are investing in.\nWarehouses or, if you will, logistics to serve these customers just in time as they need it. And that is part of the way customers would opt to TI and just connect directly to us. Now in terms of the short term, Dave, maybe you can talk a little bit about what we're seeing there through the cycle.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. And as we would have expected, orders that are placed through ti.com are down significantly from its peak. Just, I think, just telling of where we are with availability of product. But the great thing with ti.com is customers connect through APIs and put their planning systems on that; when they do have a shortage, they can look into our inventory. They can see it. Some have even automated that process and have products shipped in many cases the same day. So we think the long term.\nStrategic value of ti.com is much higher than the transactions that will cross it here in the short term. So thank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. I wonder, just as you kind of think about this longer term strategy, you've got well over 200 days of inventory, you have relatively low factory utilization. Do you think this means we won't have shortages down the road that people can look at the capacity that you have, the inventory that you have, and they won't have the need to accumulate inventory? Is that part of the thinking or do you think it's just inevitable that we'll get back to that at some point?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nAgain, the investment, first in capacity, ahead of the demand, and then in inventory, is done to really improve customer service. Right. And we believe it's important to keep that. Not only now, when it's kind of easy, and we have a market cycle at, you can call it, at a low point.\nThe test for our company would be at the next upcycle. Okay. Not only an upcycle, that is, you know, you can model Joe, any upcycle that you want, but we want to be supporting our customers at the highest level, even if the cycle looks like a very steep one. And we model, for example, the COVID cycle as a similar one. And that's what drives.\nOur investments. I think it's very, very important to supply your customers ahead of the competition at times like that because that's the opportunity to gain share and we are going to be prepared for that opportunity. Having said that, all that is done in a very thoughtful way. Inventory is being built at the right parts, where we have this diversity and longevity position such that we don't risk scrapping the inventory. And I'm pleased with the progress we have made. But the test will come and I'm sure it will come one day at the next upcycle. I don't know if you want to add anything, Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThat's good, Jodi.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. I mean, just to follow up on that, to the extent that your competition is doing things more the way they traditionally have and probably will see boom, bust cycles, what happens in that next upturn? If they can't get parts from three of your competitors, is there a way you can keep them from accumulating inventory of TI components even though they shouldn't need to? I mean, that seems like it's part of kind of the industry behavior in the past. How focused are you on trying to dampen that?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nAgain, I think our capacity and the inventory level that we have built are such that we tend to provide good or very high customer service levels. Right. So our intention is to maintain lead times through the cycle. It depends what cycle you throw. You throw at us. There is always going to be that one cycle or that steep cycle that maybe we won't be able to do it. But we have modeled the company in such a way that in most.\nDemand situation, we would be able to maintain a good customer or high customer service levels through the cycle, which hopefully will keep the lead time short and which I'm pretty sure will encourage customers not to hoard inventory. That has to be proven. But that's the way we want to prepare for the future.\nYeah.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nI added one thing. I'd just say that I spent eight years in sales. You know, I joke, I never once took a double order. And so, trying to control customer behavior, when things get short, people want to build more inventory. Right. And so that's just a behavior that I think that will be in our industry for the foreseeable future. But we can gain share in those periods of time and that's the advantage of having the capacity in place. So that said, we'll go to the next call or next. And last caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, thanks. Good evening. The question is on your earlier comments on China. It sounds like that rebounded fairly robustly in the first quarter. Could you give some more color on what you were seeing within China? And then.\nDo you feel that those Chinese customers are still burning through inventory? Are you still under shipping demand there?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. First, I would say that in China there is a very distinct signal that customers have walked down their inventories, and we've seen that spreading through time with the market. If you think about the asynchronous behavior that we have described of the different markets, we saw the same in China. You know, the personal electronics business picked up in China somewhere in 2021. Enterprise and.\nIndustrial sometimes in 2022 and then Automotive peaked sometimes in 2023. So you saw that peak spread over three years, which I think is the reason we saw such elongated decline of seven quarters in a row. We went backwards to our history, and it's been one of the longest, if not the longest, cycle we have seen. But I can see clearly that it's mainly played out. Of course you will always find pockets and a few sectors on the Industrial in the Industrial market that are still going through that. But it's very clear that once you start to shift to end demand, you will see such behavior of, in our case, 20% sequential growth, and you know, that momentum is being built across the markets. All markets did very well in China growing between, you know, 15% to 20-something%.\nOkay, so very robust, coherent. And that's like a recovery looks like. Now we haven't seen that across the other markets. I will even tell you that the areas like, you know, Europe and Japan are in an early phase, and hopefully it doesn't take seven quarters per geography. But China was kind of the first in into the upcycle, the beginning of COVID the first one to correct on the down, and now to me the first one kind of raising a very strong sequential growth with momentum. So that's the way I would summarize it without trying to imply that we'll see the same behavior in each and every other market.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, follow on, Chris.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nI do, thanks. Just a quick follow up, and I'm sure this is another thing you'll address on the August call. But you narrowed the range for depreciation next year down a little bit. Last quarter you talked about CapEx kind of, you know, being around this $5 billion level per year was down sequentially in Q2. Is $5 billion still a reasonable way of looking CapEx this year?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, there is no news here strategically, but Rafael, maybe you want to guide on CapEx?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nNo, absolutely no. This year, $5 billion. What you saw in second quarter is just little puts and takes on a quarterly basis. But for 2024, $5 billion of capex and the depreciation numbers I gave.\nAre reflective of that.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nSo let me wrap up with what we've said previously. At our core we are engineers. Our technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we'll continue to pursue our three ambitions. First, we will act like owners. We will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and we would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWelcome to the Texas Instruments second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer Haviv Ilan and our Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today we'll provide the following updates.\nFirst, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management, as well as share the guidance for the third quarter of 2024. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments",
    "content2": "Thanks Dave. Let me also start by welcoming everyone to the call. I'm looking forward to joining our quarterly earnings calls moving forward and sharing more details about our business strategy with the investment community. It is an opportunity for me to directly share more information about our results and our strategic progress. With that, I'll start with a quick overview of the second quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and a decrease of 16% year over year. Analog revenue declined 11% year over year, and Embedded Processing declined 31%. Our Other segment declined 22% from the year ago quarter.\nNow I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by end market. Our results continue to reflect the asynchronous behavior across our end markets that we've seen throughout this cycle. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down low single digits, the automotive market was down mid single digits, personal electronics grew mid teens with broad-based growth while demonstrating continued improvement compared to its low point in the first quarter of 2023. Next, communication equipment was up mid single digits, and finally enterprise systems was up about 20%.\nLastly, before I pass it on to Rafael, I'd like to share a few comments regarding our capacity investments. We and our customers remain pleased with our progress of the expansion of our 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity. These investments reflect our confidence in the opportunity ahead, which remains high for several reasons. First, we have a high level of confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content, particularly in industrial, and automotive where we have greater exposure and strong product positions. Second, geopolitically dependable low-cost 300-millimeter capacity will be increasingly critical, and valuable, and our investments enable us to support customer demand at scale. To share more details on our progress, which we believe is helpful for all of our shareholders to understand, I plan to hold an off-cycle Capital Management call with Rafael and Dave on 20th August.\nDuring the call I will provide more granularity on our capacity investments along with a framework of revenue and free cash flow per share scenarios. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, second quarter revenue was $3.8 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.2 billion or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 60 basis points primarily due to higher revenue as well as lower manufacturing unit costs due to increased factory loadings, and more manufacturing internally with more wafers on 300-millimeter. Operating expenses in the quarter were $963 million, up 3% from a year ago and about as expected on a trailing twelve month basis. Operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 23% of revenue.\nOperating profit was $1.2 billion in the quarter, or 33% of revenue, and was down 37% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.1 billion, or $1.22 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $6.4 billion on a trailing twelve-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter and $5 billion over the last twelve months. Free cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis was $1.5 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow includes benefits from the CHIPS Act investment tax credit, which was $312 million for the second quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $71 million of our stock.\nIn total, we returned $4.9 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of Q2. In Q2 we repaid $300 million of debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%.\nInventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $23 million from the prior quarter, and days were 229, down 6 days sequentially. For Q3, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.94 to 4.26 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to 1.48. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value. In the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions.\nWe will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for a follow up. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please. As we poll for questions.\nOur first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. There were some comments from a geopolitical perspective. One of the candidates is talking about the China Taiwan relationship, and I'm just asking how the geopolitical environment is impacting your customers' buying decisions. I think you said last call that even some of your Chinese customers who are exporting product want geopolitically dependable capacity. I think you talked about that being an increasingly big factor in autos. Can you talk about that, and is that beginning to drive some share gains for you?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Tim. I'll take that from Haviv first. Geopolitically dependable capacity is not a new thing for us. We have started to see these requests coming, I think two or three years ago, when tensions started to rise. But as we reflect on it now, three years in, it's obvious that there is more and more attention, usually at the highest levels of our customers. I'm talking about leadership of CEOs or chief purchasing officers looking at their supply chain and making sure that they are going to be immune from whatever is thrown at them. Part of it is geopolitical tensions, and this is where TI is a great answer. We are a very unique supplier in the sense of we can provide capacity at scale, meaning the amount of wafers and the size of the capacity that we are building is very high.\nIt is a very affordable capacity. US building our parts on 300-millimeter wafers allows for a lower cost per chip, and then building them internally in our assembly and test houses also provides a very good low cost structure. And last but not least is this geopolitically dependable capacity, meaning our fabs are being built in the U.S. mainly in Texas and in Lehi, Utah, and we provide a capacity that is at scale, affordable, and dependable. And yes, every time there is some news out there, you know we are seeing more interest. We've seen that grow over the last several years, and in that sense our discussions with our customers are providing us more opportunity to win positions in future platforms.\nI do believe we are taking a bigger share and this is part of our confidence to continue with our investments to serve that opportunity moving forward. Last but not least, you have touched China. Yes, you're right. If I take an example and just on the automotive side, our customers in China do care a lot about their export business. In that sense, our capacity is highly welcomed by them because we can compete at the market price with a very competitive offering, yet have that dependability to serve their customers not only in China but also outside of China for their export business.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, yes.\nRafael, can you give us an update on CHIPS Act? Do you know how much you're getting yet, and can you kind of talk about that?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, sure, Tim. So on the grants, frankly we're still going through the process so we submitted the application and we're just working through the details with the CHIPS Program Office. But given your question, let me comment also on the ITC investment tax credit today. To date we have accrued about $1.8 billion in total. That's under 25% ITC. This benefit already started flowing through the income statement and slower depreciation. In addition, in second quarter we received, as I said in the prepared remarks, $312 million of cash benefits and that is reflected in operating and free cash flow. We expect to receive another $200 million in Q3 and for a total of $1 billion for 2024.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Tim. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. In Q2 it looked like the strength was primarily from personal electronics given industrial modules were down and maybe calculators as well. I don't know. Other was pretty strong. I was wondering if you could give us some color on where your expectations for the growth in Q3 sequentially is coming from. Is it still primarily at personal electronics and I guess maybe calculators or other stuff. How do I think about the end market trends as we go forward in the next quarter?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks for the question, Stacy. I'll start and I'll let Dave add some more color on Q2. So if I go back to the second quarter. Yes, if you look at our results, Industrial did decline at the low single digits. Automotive continued to decline at mid single digits. That was the third quarter in a row of that decline, although from a year over year perspective, it's still doing well, meaning less than a 10% decline. It declined about 9% in Q2. Yes, there is strength in Personal Electronics and I do see that market.\nIt went down through the entire cycle. It troughed sometime in Q1 2023, and we've seen that market strengthening, and again it grew mid-teens sequentially, but close to 20% year over year. So there is definitely strength over there. I would also say that on the enterprise market, smaller revenue for us, but we are seeing a recovery over there, and I believe that inventory correction is behind us. Regarding the other business, it grew thanks to our calculator business as you mentioned, but also our DLP business, which mainly serves the personal electronics market. Dave, maybe you can add some more color on the sectors as we talk about Q2.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I think as we have seen even inside of industrial, we've had sectors behave asynchronously. So when we first began to see weakness in industrial, which really began.\nIn Q3, that was the peak. In Q3 2022, that was the peak in industrial. We talked about seeing about half of the sectors or so show weakness, and those early, I'll call them earlier stage sectors; some of them have found bottoms and begun to grow, and you can see some of that bottoming process taking place. The others, we're only three or so quarters in, and we've got several of them that are continuing to decline at double-digit rates. So again, as we've seen all of our markets behave asynchronously inside of the sectors, we've seen that in industrial as well. Do you have a follow-on, Stacy?\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI do actually, maybe to re-ask the same question. So you're guiding revenue sequentially up close to $300 million. How do I think about that $300 million growth parsing out across the end markets into Q3?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYes, Stacy, you know I'm on the call, but still we are not going to predict or to give a guidance by market for the Q3. I mean it's at the midpoint of the range. We expect revenue to grow about, you know, 7%. But as you know, it's not unusual for us to see sequential growth in the Q3. I mean typically this is a seasonal.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nIs it? Is it PE? Is what I'm asking, is it? Mostly.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Typically Q3 is a quarter where if you go back to pre-COVID days, this is the quarter where customers are preparing their end equipment or their end product for the holiday season. So it's usually a strong quarter for the company, and we are seeing a very similar behavior right now at the midpoint of the range of our forecast. I don't know, Dave, if you want to add anything. I think that's good.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Stacy. We'll go to the next call.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the China market and what you are seeing in terms of not just the demand side, but are you seeing any incremental supply coming on that can create a concern from a pricing perspective? Because every time this question is asked to industries or not, just the, you know, the answer is always that, well, the IP is not there. They don't have product breadth and whatnot, but they're still buying a lot of trailing edge equipment. So at what point, Haviv, does that start to become a concern from just a global capacity and global pricing perspective for Texas Instruments?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Vivek. Let me start with the first part maybe of your question on how the China market did, because I think it was a good quarter for our China business. Our China business grew sequentially at about 20% versus the first quarter. We've seen momentum across all markets. I mean, all five markets grew sequentially, I think 15% or 20%. They all did well. This is after seven quarters of sequential decline. If you think about the way I look at the China.\nMarket and it was exposed.\nTo all end markets for TI, it took seven quarters for this asynchronous cycle to go through, starting with PE, personal electronics, then spreading to industrial and enterprise, and just lately to automotive. But all of these have now corrected, and Q2 was a good quarter for our business. And I believe we are now shipping to end demand, meaning customers have stopped managing their inventories over there. Now, in terms of the competition in China, I don't think that's, I mean we've been very vocal about it. This is first not new that the competition has intensified over the last, the past several years. And I think it's growing stronger. I think it's a mistake for us to think that these guys are only doing, you know, simple parts. These are very ambitious, highly educated.\nCompetitors. Our job here in TI, and that's what I try to teach the team, is to compete. I will tell you that yes, the market is more competitive in China, but we can compete and we can win business in very attractive margins. We are going to continue to do that. Our goal objective is to continue and gain market share in China.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nIf I just add one thing, Haviv, the growth in China that we saw was strong across all the markets, including automotive and industrial there. So I think that's an important point. So Vivek, you have a follow on.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, thank you, Dave. So I know for Q3 you're not giving specific end market commentary, but just from an industry perspective, how would you describe the supply demand situation in industrial and automotive semis? Just because we see such a broad range of data points. Do you think we are past the worst in terms of inventory adjustment and supply issues for those two end markets? And if you could describe the situation in those two markets separately, that would be really helpful.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Dave. I'll let you take this one.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay.\nYeah, I think what we can see, Vivek, of course we don't get any data feeds on customer inventory. We don't get any data feeds on customer shipments. But we can look into things like the order patterns. We can look at feeds that we get in consignment. We can see what's happening in, you know, with our inventories and in our positions. So as we've talked about, cancellations as an example, as a measurement have continued to come down. Our lead times I described as very stable. We've got immediate availability of almost all of our products. So that does drive lower visibility with backlog because customers can get product when they need it. And we do believe that some markets PE bottomed back in Q1 2023 and has been more seasonal since then. We've seen some of the other markets that as we shared earlier, are beginning to grow.\nSo you know, there's likely a bottom forming within some of those markets. We've got industrial and automotive that have continued to decline. Now I'd say with industrial I mentioned earlier, some of the sectors are forming a bottom, others are continuing to decline. And automotive, we've got 3/4, 3/4 behind us. Right. So that's how, as we look into where we are positioned today. But we don't have a strong signal that can tell us exactly to be able to answer the question that you asked.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, the only one comment I will add, Vivek, in terms of the difference. So automotive so far at least just year to date is down mid single digits, and that is off of a very good 2023 for us. Right. We grew about 17% in 2023, and I think it just helped by the strong secular content growth that we see in automotive. And this is across both combustion engines or ICE and EVs. So that may be the difference, the slight difference I see between these two markets.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, thank you, Vivek. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymour with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. Haviv, it's great to have you on the call. So I'll ask one for you and maybe Rafael would chime in as well. You guys have given, at least Rafael, in the past some mid-quarter updates or earnings call updates on capex and depreciation versus your pre-existing plan. So are you still planning to spend $5 billion a year? And is the depreciation ranges, Rafael, you gave before still apply or are we going to have some more flexibility on those metrics going forward?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, I'll start and Rafael, maybe you can, you can probably provide some more color. So first again, our strategy has not changed and it continues to serve as well as I said before, the secular growth in industrial automotive and our position, our market position, and our product portfolio position gives us the confidence that there is a higher opportunity over there. On top of it, as we said earlier, customers do want and value geopolitically dependable capacity. So we are pleased with our progress. Our CapEx strategy provides us both with capacity for growth and flexibility. And at the end of the day, CapEx supports revenue growth and we need to be prepared for different scenarios. Now we always continue to evaluate our plans and investments based on what we see in the demand environment, the dynamics, and the growth opportunities in the market.\nAnd to talk more about it, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to have our off cycle capital management call in a month, in four weeks. This is just an opportunity to share just additional insights. So we'll go through our investment plan with more granularity on what exactly we are doing per factory, and then we'll provide a framework of revenue scenarios. And what would free cash flow per share and CapEx do.\nVersus each and every scenario. Regarding depreciation, Rafael, I don't know if you want to add anything.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYes, so I'll just comment on depreciation. Ross, I'm going to narrow that depreciation range a little bit both for 2024 and 2025. So for 2024 we now expect depreciation to be between $1.5 and $1.6 billion. For 2025 we now expect depreciation to be about $2 to $2.3 billion.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYou have a follow on Rafael?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nI do, and thanks for all those details, Haviv and Rafael. So one for you, Rafael. If I heard you right, on the gross margin rising in Q2, you mentioned that loadings increased. I thought that they were going to decrease to burn some inventory now that you had that at kind of the $4 billion target. So did something change there? And what's the expectations for utilization going forward?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no. So the loadings came in about as expected.\nBut let me just tell you more about it. Second quarter loadings were up versus first quarter, and as you saw, we were essentially flat on inventory. So essentially the ins and outs were pretty much offsetting. When it comes to third quarter, we expect utilization or factory loadings to be flat to slightly up. And you know, in our base case for our, the EPS guidance that we have, that's what we have in there. But of course we have time during the quarter to adjust those loadings. Depending on what we expect for fourth quarter on GPM, specifically for third quarter, in that base case, at the midpoint of our guidance, I would expect GPM percent to be up versus second quarter.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Danley with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nHey, thanks for letting me ask a question, guys. Just to follow up on Ross's question. In terms of gross margin, so depreciation is going up like $100 million roughly per quarter for next year. But if utilization rates keep going up, that is if nothing gets any worse, do you think, is it possible that your gross margins are bottoming now or is there anything else that could drive them lower or maybe provide a tailwind? Just give us the maybe the mechanics around it for the next several quarters.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nSure, sure.\nNo, I'll be happy and I'll keep it. Well, at the end of the day, yes, it is possible that that is the case. It's all going to depend on revenue, of course. So the main driver is revenue. So as we, and in addition to revenue, as we bring more executing our strategy to load more 300-millimeter wafers and bring in more external loadings internal, the fall through excluding depreciation will likely turn more in the range of 75%-85% on a year on year basis. Now, of course, any one quarter, even any one year you may have puts and takes that, you know, utilization or factory loadings is one of those that sometimes it goes against you, sometimes it goes in favor. But in general, expect that fall through in 75%-85%, not counting depreciation. So, you know, you do the math.\nWhatever revenue assumption you want to put over the next several quarters or years, do that fall through, and you can very easily model where. And then I just gave you depreciation. Right. So you can then model what gross margins can do over the next several years.\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nGreat. Thanks for the additional breadcrumbs. They're very useful. My follow-up is just on bookings. I think last quarter you said that bookings were increasing every month. Is that still true? And do you think that for the industrial automotive space we're at least getting close to the bottom there or do you feel any better about either of those end markets on a relative basis?\nYeah.\nSo, you know, again, as you look at those things, revenue did increase as well as orders throughout the quarter, which is very typical.\nThat we would see in the second quarter. And certainly as we've got growth at the midpoint, that would not be unexpected. You know, again, those other sides of lead times.\nReally on all of our products having immediate availability and stable lead times, cancellations continuing to decline, all those things I think point to.\nSupply and demand becoming more imbalanced and that availability. So, there is a second part of your question, Chris, that I'm not addressing. I'm not sure. Can you just repeat it for me?\nYeah, it was just, you know, are bookings still increasing month over month, and then between the auto or the industrial end market, do you feel any better or worse about either of those?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWell, yeah, again I think that we've got, you know, half of the sectors that again we can see forming a bottom inside of industrial overall that, you know, it's been elongated. But if you look at it sector by sector, it's probably a better view overall. In auto, you know, this is our third quarter of decline, you know, we're down about 13%, you know, from where the revenue peaked. It's a pretty shallow decline compared to how the other markets had behaved so far. So.\nYou know.\nThat's what we see. So thank you, Chris.\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nYou bet.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question, Haviv. Maybe one for you on CapEx and how you're thinking about long-term revenue growth. You've always had this slide in your capital management call deck where you show revenue supported. I think $30 billion for 2026 and $45 billion for 2030. I know you're constantly evaluating your plans, and you talked about presenting various scenarios on the August call. But I'm curious, is the $30 billion for 2026 and $45 billion for 2030, are those still kind of the base case scenarios for you or has there been any change post conversations with customers?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nToshiya first, I do want to leave something for August, so I think it's going to be just a better environment to go provide this information. We'll also provide supporting materials or updated presentation where you'll see, as I said, the different scenarios and how we see them. And, to me, step by step right now, when I think about how we establish our CapEx plan, we need to think about what the next peak wants to do. We'll discuss that. We'll discuss different scenarios of revenue leading to the next peak and what CapEx will do accordingly, and as a result, what free cash flow per share will be. Again, I don't want to give the whole pitch right now, but I think it's going to be important for investors to join and hear latest update.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nUnderstood, I do. Thanks, Dave. Just a question on embedded processing. Revenue was down sequentially, and the year-over-year decline actually accelerated. Analog, we've seen some stabilization. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing in the embedded processing side. Is this purely volume pressure, or is there a pricing or competitive component here as well? I think operating margins for that business came in a little bit as well sequentially. So, just curious.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYes, let me start first on a high level Embedded business. When I look at the underneath beyond the numbers, it's getting stronger. Our product portfolio is improving, and when I look at this decade, just the opportunity for that business to be a major contributor for TI's growth of free cash flow per share is very high. So I'm very encouraged by the progress of the business. Now regarding the cycle first, Embedded has a little bit of a different structure compared to Analog. It's mainly composed of industrial and automotive. So it has less exposure into Personal Electronics, enterprise, or communication equipment. And these two markets kind of peak later. Right. So if you look at the Embedded business versus Analog, it peaked a year after kind of middle of 2023 versus the middle of 2022 for the Analog business.\nIn addition to that, the embedded business today, although as Rafael mentioned it's being changed, was mainly supported from foundry wafers during the up cycle and we felt more limitation over there compared to our internal supply capacity. So now when these.\nSupply issues are resolved. We are seeing customers just adjusting their inventory. That's what I believe is happening and therefore embedded is seeing that sharper correction. But again, when I look at it from the top, embedded is strengthening and I think will continue to serve us very well moving forward.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me just add on the operating profit question or angle that you had, just as a reminder. As said, traditionally embedded has relied on external wafers, but we now have. We're bringing them in, and we have the Lehi factory is disproportionately will serve embedded, and therefore embedded is taking a disproportionate amount of the fixed cost charges there. But just like that is a put right now, it will be a tailwind. It's a headwind now. It will be a tailwind in the future as we qualify more and more parts, embedded parts, as well as analog at that Lehi factory.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nHave a great day. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nYeah, thank you for taking my question, and great to have you on the call. Maybe to follow up on the embedded question. Right, because this business grew 3% last year versus your analog business, which was down 15%. Yeah. Year to date, it's down about as much as your peers, or I would argue slightly better. You've articulated the positive strategy changes previously, right? More catalog, broad market focus. So bottom line, again, over the past few years, it seems like you've made good improvements in this business. So as the team moves embedded more to internal manufacturing combined with the strategy shift, maybe Haviv, can you just comment on the design win momentum? What areas are you particularly doing well in? And I'm not sure, Rafael, how should we think about the improvements in embedded margins as you move what was once mostly outsourced to internal manufacturing?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me start, and I'll let Rafael add some more color. But again, as you mentioned, the embedded business has gone through change in the last four or five years, and we've done a great job to position the business such that it benefits our competitive advantages. Think about manufacturing and technology, so shifting really from almost like 80% external to, when done, maybe the opposite 80% internal builds to building a higher breadth of products, or not less concentration of revenue per socket, and us expanding our product portfolio utilizing the reach of our market channels. Think about the large sales team of TI. Think about TI.com, the more catalog is the product, the better fit to our strategy. So in that sense, that is moving well in terms of design-win momentum. Again, it's mainly.\nan industrial and automotive business, so very high visibility on the automotive side. But as you also know, it takes time. So I'm encouraged. With the design-in momentum, our funnel increased tremendously when I compare it to the Analog side because I know every funnel of every supplier grows. But we've seen a disproportionate growth of our design funnel for embedded versus previous year and also versus the Analog. Just in terms of the rate, and I will give some examples, we see good momentum in real-time control. Think about EVs, on-board charger, think about traction inverters. Very good momentum in connectivity, automotive and beyond. Think about car entries, tire pressure monitoring, and other.\nBody-related opportunities in the automotive market. I can continue with kind of our more application-specific products like our radar system. We have great position and growing position in radar, winning a lot of new business both with the Tier 1s and the OEMs. This is from imaging radar for the front, to the corner radar, to even parking assist, and also in cabin sensing. The radar is taking a bigger and bigger part in the automotive market, and many other examples on the industrial side. Here, the number of end equipment is really vast. You know, hundreds of end equipment. But this is where our Catalog MCUs that we are really reviving the presence of TI and building a new portfolio based on our MSP family is doing very well in winning new business across the board, across the markets utilizing our channel advantage.\nSo I can go on and on here, but again just evidence of my excitement of just what this business can do for us in the second half of this decade. Rafael.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I'll just add on your question on fall-throughs for embedded. Of course, we don't give guidance separate for the segments. So the 75%-85% gross margin fall-through ex depreciation that I talked about earlier applies to both.\nYou know, outside of if we didn't have Lehi and I'll address that in a second, we didn't have that. I would say generally Analog would be at the higher end of that range and better would be at the lower end. But for the next year, two or three because Lehi, all those costs are, all those fixed costs are already there, including people, we're going to have some nice tailwind and a good portion of that will go to Embedded. But over the longer time frame, 75%-85% x depreciation is a good guide to use.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. A follow up Harlan.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nYeah. In terms of channel reach, we haven't heard you guys talk about ti.com in quite some time, and I think the last data point we got was it drove about $2 billion in sales in calendar 2022. It, it sort of has this additional benefit from a business planning perspective of being a really good sort of leading indicator of demand inflections as you sort of potentially pass the bottom of sort of the current cycle here. Wondering if there's been any notable movement or trends in ti.com, and maybe from a longer term perspective, like what initiatives has the team put in place to sort of further improve the customer pull to ti.com, you know, from a mid to longer term perspective.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me start more in the mid- to longer-term and then let Dave add some more color on how it looks versus, you know, the cycle. So in terms of the investment in TI.com, yes, they are continuing, these are very strategic and important investments for us. We believe there is a huge opportunity to digitize what we call the last mile or that interface between us and the customers. There are many, many customers, still a long tail of customers that we can't see today. But as they move to TI.com, we can supply them with more information. We can even provide opportunity to place backlog electronically directly with TI. And in that sense the importance for us is to just know our customers better, understand the end equipment and provide.\nThe relevant product portfolio to serve their growth and win market share. Right. So that data is to us very, very important, and that direct connectivity with the customer is important to do just that. We are investing in IT systems; we are investing.\nIn warehouses or, if you will, logistics to serve these customers just in time as they need it. That is part of the way customers would opt to TI and just connect directly to us. Now, in terms of the short term, Dave, maybe you can talk a little bit about what we're seeing there through the cycle.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah.\nAs we would have expected, orders that are placed through ti.com are down significantly from its peak. Just, I think, telling of where we are with availability of product. But the great thing with ti.com is customers connect through APIs and put their planning systems on that. When they do have a shortage, they can look into our inventory, they can see it. Some have even automated that process and have products shipped in many cases the same day. So we think the long-term strategic value of ti.com is much higher than the transactions that will cross it here in the short term. So thank you, Harlan. Go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. I wonder, just as you kind of think about this longer term strategy, you've got, you know, well over 200 days of inventory, you have relatively low factory utilization. Like, do you think this means we won't have shortages down the road that people can look at the capacity that you have, the inventory that you have, and they won't have the need to accumulate inventory? Is that part of the thinking or do you think it's just inevitable that we'll get back to that at some point?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nAgain, the investment, first in capacity ahead of the demand, and then in inventory, is done to really improve customer service. Right. And we believe it's important to keep that not only now, when it's kind of easy, and we have a market cycle at, you can call it, at a low point.\nThe test for our company would be at the next upcycle. Okay. Not only an upcycle that is, you know, you can model, Joe, any upcycle that you want, but we want to be supporting our customers at the highest level, even if the cycle looks like a very steep one. And we model, for example, the COVID cycle as a similar one. And that's what drives.\nOur investments. I think it's very, very important to sell your customers ahead of the competition at times like that because that's the opportunity to gain share and we are going to be prepared for that opportunity. Having said that, all that is done in a very thoughtful way. Inventory is being built at the right part where we have this diversity and longevity position such that we don't risk the scrap of the inventory. I'm pleased with the progress we have made. But the test will come and I'm sure it will come one day at the next up cycle. I don't know if you want to add anything, Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThat's good. Joe, do you have a follow?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I mean, just to follow up on that. To the extent that your competition is doing things more the way they traditionally have and probably will see boom, bust cycles, what happens in that next upturn? If they can't get parts from three of your competitors, is there a way you can keep them from accumulating inventory of TI components even though they shouldn't need to? I mean, that seems like it's part of kind of the industry behavior in the past. How focused are you on trying to dampen that?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nAgain, I think our capacity and the inventory level that we have built are such that we tend to provide good or very high customer service levels. Right. So our intention is to maintain lead times through the cycle. It depends what cycle you throw. You throw at us. There is always going to be that one cycle or that cycle that maybe we won't be able to do it. But we have modeled the company in such a way that in most.\nDemand situation, we would be able to maintain a good customer or high customer service levels through the cycle, which hopefully will keep the lead time short and which I'm pretty sure will encourage customers not to hoard inventory. That has to be proven, but that's the way we want to prepare for the future. Yeah.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nIf I added one thing, I'd just say that I spent eight years in sales. You know, I joke, I never once took a double order. And so, trying to control customer behavior, when things get short, people want to build more inventory. Right. And so that's just a behavior that I think that will be in our industry for the foreseeable future. But we can gain share in those periods of time and that's the advantage of having the capacity in place. So that said, we'll go to the next call or the next. And last caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, thanks. Good evening. The question is on your earlier comments on China. It sounds like that rebounded fairly robustly in the first quarter. Could you give some more color on what you were seeing within China? And then do you think, do you feel that the Chinese customers are still burning through inventory? Are you still under shipping demand there?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. First, I would say that in China there is a very distinct signal that customers have walked down their inventories. And we've seen that spreading through time with the market. If you think about the asynchronous behavior that we have described of the different market, we saw the same in China.\nThe Personal Electronics business picked in China somewhere in 2021, enterprise and.\nAnd industrial sometimes in 2022 and then automotive peaked sometimes in 2023. So you saw that peak spread over three years, which I think is the reason we saw such an elongated decline of seven quarters in a row. And we went backwards to our history and it's been one of the longest, if not the longest, cycle we have seen. But I can see clearly that it's mainly played out. Of course you will always find pockets and a few sectors.\nIn the industrial market that are still going through that. But it's very clear that once you start to shift to end demand, you will see such behavior of, in our case, 20% sequential growth. And you know, that momentum is being built across the markets. All markets did very well in China, growing between, you know, 15% to 20-something percent. Okay, so very robust, coherent. And that's like a recovery. Looks like now we haven't seen that across the other markets. I will even tell you that the areas like, you know, Europe and Japan are in an early phase, and hopefully it doesn't take seven quarters per geography. But China was kind of the first in, into the upcycle, the beginning of COVID the first one to correct on the down.\nNow to me, the first one kind of raising a very, you know, strong sequential growth with momentum. So that's the way I would summarize it without trying to imply that we'll see the same behavior in each and every other market.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, a follow up.\nChris.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nI do.\nThanks. Just a quick follow up, and I'm sure this is another thing you'll address on the August call, but you narrowed the range for depreciation next year down a little bit. Last quarter, you talked about CapEx kind of, you know, being around this $5 billion level per year. It was down sequentially in Q2. Is $5 billion still a reasonable way of looking at CapEx this year?\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. There is no news here strategically, but Rafael, maybe you want a guide on CapEx?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nNo. Absolutely no. This year, $5 billion. What you saw in second quarter is just little puts and takes on a quarterly basis. But for 2024, $5 billion of CapEx and the depreciation numbers I gave are reflective of that.\n\nHaviv Ilan\n\nCEO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me wrap up with what we've said previously. At our core, we are engineers. Our technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we'll continue to pursue our three ambitions. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and we would want as our neighbor. When we are successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation."

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter.\nNext, I'll provide insight into Q1 revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management, as well as share the guidance for the Q2 of 2024. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter, revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.7 billion, a decrease of 10% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 14% year-over-year, and embedded processing declined 22%. Our other segment declined 33% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our Q1 revenue by end market. Revenue declined sequentially across all of our end markets. Our results reflect the current environment as customers continue to reduce their inventory levels. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time.\nFirst, the industrial market was down upper single digits. The automotive market was down mid-single digits. Personal electronics was down mid-teens. Next, communications equipment was down about 25%. Lastly, enterprise systems was down mid-teens. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, Q1 revenue was $3.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion, or 57% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with reduced factory loadings and our planned capacity expansions. Gross profit margin decreased 820 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $933 million, flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 22% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.3 billion in the quarter, or 35% of revenue, and was down 34% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in Q1 was $1.1 billion, or $1.20 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.10 benefit that was not in our original guidance, primarily due to the sale of a property.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion in the quarter and $6.3 billion on a Trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter and $5.3 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $940 million. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and in the past 12 months, we returned $4.8 billion to our owners. Our balance sheet remained strong with $10.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the Q1. In Q1, we issued $3 billion in debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14.3 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $84 million from the prior quarter, and days were 235, up 16 days sequentially.\nFor Q2, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 to 3.95 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.05 to 1.25. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Rafael, I'm wondering if you can give us an update on any CHIPS Act money that you may have gotten. I know basically all the money for the advanced nodes has been allocated and has been announced, but there's still like $9 billion outstanding for mature nodes. So can you kind of talk about that for us?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. No, happy to do it. First, let me address the grants, which I think is what you're referring to. On that, frankly, we don't have an update to give. We're still going through that process. Submitted our application late last year and are working through the details with the CHIPS Program Office. As we said before, we believe our investments in manufacturing in both Texas and Utah are well-positioned with the objectives of the CHIPS Program Office. Now, let me give you an update on the ITC, the Investment Tax Credit. To date, we have accrued about $1.5 billion on that credit. And based on the recently released regulations, we will be receiving the ITC cash benefit throughout the year in 2024 and beyond. And starting next quarter, so in Q2, we're expected to receive about $300 million and a total of $1 billion for all of 2024.\nOkay? Do you have a follow-up?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, yeah. I wanted to ask about factory loadings and sort of where you think inventory goes for June. If I look at your guidance, the gross margins implied pretty flat, ex-depreciation. So it seems like loadings have sort of leveled off in June. Is that right? And kind of what do you expect for inventory in June? It seems like it should start to come down a tick, maybe in June. Thanks.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, sure. Of course, we give guidance. We give a range on revenue. We give a range on EPS. Then 90 days from now, we'll discuss that at more length. But for now, I'll tell you that in Q1, we adjusted factory loadings as we neared our desired inventory levels. As we said during the prepared remarks, we grew inventory about $80-some million. Then for Q2, we're going to adjust those loadings depending on future demand.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Tim.\nWe'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on that. If and when revenues begin to recover, how do we think about what that would imply for your factory utilizations given your current inventory position, as well as additional capacity coming online, which I guess sort of just naturally gives a downward bias to utilization anyways? I guess, how long would you need to take utilizations up, or how much revenue growth would you need to start taking utilizations up given your positioning on inventories and capacity additions?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So Stacy, that's a good question, but it's a complex question. And at the end of the day, it's going to depend. It's going to depend on a number of factors, what kind of revenue profile we're faced with, and not just in one or two quarters, but really over a longer horizon. Maybe the best thing I can tell you is don't expect a significant or even any drain on inventory because just given our business model and how we want to run the company, keeping lead time short, and also the upside potential that we have with having this inventory and the capacity in place is so much higher than the downside risk. So hopefully, that gives you some good insight into how we're thinking. Do you have a follow-up?\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI do. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about pricing. I think last quarter, you suggested that pricing was sort of resuming historical trends, which I think it suggested was down. I think it was low to mid-single digits. Is there any update on what you're seeing in terms of the pricing environment? Is that still the environment that we're in, or things better, or things worse? Where do you see that going as we go forward?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Stacy, I'll comment on that. As I said, last quarter, really, we began seeing things change mid-last year and the back half of last year as we began discussions with customers for their demand in the following year and out in time, whatever those pricing windows would open up. Those are really just going back to what we've seen last 10, 20 years, kind of pre-pandemic. So describe it roughly in the low to very low single-digit declines over time. I'd say just generally, that's what we're continuing to see.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me add one more thing. Stacy, I want to give you a bonus answer. You always ask about OpEx.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nI appreciate it. Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So you're not asking, but I'm going to give you OpEx. Remember that second quarter has a full three months of raises, whereas Q1 only had two months of raises. There's something for your modeling. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Stacy. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you for taking my question. I think in the prepared remarks, you said customers continue to reduce inventory levels, but you're also guiding Q2 sales to be up 4% sequentially. So my question is, should we think of Q2 as kind of a normal seasonal quarter? Just any more color on what you're seeing real-time? Are we past the industry inventory correction? Are we kind of getting back to some semblance of normalcy from a demand perspective? Any other color you could give from an end market or geo perspective? Just you are the largest, right, most influential vendor in the market. So I think your perspectives would be very useful to understand where we are in the inventory and the broader demand cycle.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Vivek, let me start with what we saw happen in last quarter because I think it's helpful. First, we saw personal electronics was the first market that went into the correction. It really was the first to come out in the last few quarters. I'd describe it as behaving more seasonal. If you go to the other end of the spectrum, we've had industrial, which has been declining sequentially from some time. And over the last few quarters, we've been talking about how there's some asynchronous behavior inside of the 12, 13 sectors that we have there. That continued inside of the quarter. So we've got some of the later cycle sectors that are continuing to decline and declining at double-digit rates. But there are some that are beginning to begin to slow in the declines and even a couple that grew sequentially.\nSo that I would just describe as being more mixed this quarter, which is certainly different than last quarter. You look historically, a second quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for us. It's not unusual for us to see sequential growth sequentially. Have a follow-up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Thank you, Dave. Maybe if I press a little bit on that, for Q2, specifically industrial and automotive, do you think is your assumption that customers will continue to work down inventory, or do you think that they have worked down most of the inventory and we are getting back to some semblance of what normal demand looks like for TI in Q2? What does your guidance actually imply? That are we below seasonal? Are we seasonal? Or are we something different?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWell, again, we're not in the practice of giving guidance by end market. But even inside of last quarter, as we looked at it inside of industrial, there obviously are some customers that are nearing the end of that inventory depletion cycle. So as you know, we try to be very cautious and not try to predict tops or bottoms or those types of things and just report what we see and just stick to the facts. So thank you, Vivek. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nHey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Mine is in regards to China. 2023 data came out recently, and it looks like some of the larger North American players didn't really lose share despite some concerns on the trailing edge that you would have some increased China competition. Has there been any change in the way that customer behavior has kind of trended over the last couple of months? And can you talk about just that competitive environment? Are you seeing more players there? Are you seeing players that you didn't see before? Any color on China would be super useful. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nSure. Yeah. Thanks, Tom, for that question. I would say no change over the last couple of months. I think certainly over the last few years, there's many things that are changing in China. We've got very competent local competitors there, as well as there's subsidized capacity going in place. When you compare that to five or 10 years ago, is it harder to compete there? It certainly is. Again, I would not describe that as a competitive landscape that's changing overnight. We've talked about that for some years. China is an important market for us. It continues to be a growing market. We can and will compete there to support our customers. Our competitive advantages, whether that's our manufacturing and technologies, the breadth of the portfolio, and the reach of the markets all serve very, very well in China.\nDo you have a follow-up?\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nYeah. Just on auto particularly, I know that you're not guiding the next quarter, but just conversations that you've had since you last updated us with those customers. I think you just mentioned that inventories are coming down. But through the pandemic, there was a kind of change of standard ordering patterns of just in time to just in case. Do you see that kind of persisting, or do you think that we're moving back to a situation in which customers really want to have much lower inventory on their balance sheets? Obviously, you have a unique supply chain, but just any thoughts on just the auto environment particularly through the last several months? Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nSure. Yeah. Thanks again, Tom. Yeah. I would say that many customers, and especially those in automotive, as they went through and dealt with the disruptions that they had in supply chains, actually were very thoughtful in looking at where their supply is coming from, what things that they can do differently, well beyond just carrying extra days of inventory. And when they went through that analysis, I think many found that they have a pretty significant dependence on wafers coming out of both China and Taiwan. And what they described that to us as geopolitically dependable capacity is what they're seeking. And again, we've talked about that before in our capital management updates. We believe that that's going to be highly sought after. We are seeing that today.\nI think we're in a position to be able to support customers and that growth that will come from that. Thank you, Tom. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. I guess for the first one, Dave, I know you don't want to guide by the segments, but you gave the quarter over quarters. Could you give us what the year-over-years were by end market in the Q1, please?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nI can do that. Yes. So the industrial market was down about 25% from a year ago. Automotive was down lower single digits. Personal electronics was actually up single digits. Comms equipment was down about 50%. Enterprise system was down mid-teens. Do you have a follow-on, Ross?\n\nThomas O'Malley\n\nEquity Research Director, Barclays\n\nI do. Rafael, you talked a little bit about the trajectory of the grant side of the CHIPS Act, or excuse me, the ITC side and where you're getting the money in over time. Does any of that inflows of cash have a differing impact on the income statement, or is it just the same? It's just a matter of timing and when you're getting that $1 billion as opposed to, I think you said, $500 million before?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nRight. No, no direct impact on the income statement. That's already played in as the lower depreciation, and already flowing through the P&L, and in our expectations on depreciation. Of course, having more cash does have an impact in terms of you have more cash; you're going to have more interest income. But put that aside, that's kind of below the profit line, right, the operating profit line. Speaking of depreciation, let me give you an update on that. We've been talking about depreciation for this year, $1.5 to 1.8 billion. That is, we continue to expect that, but we're more likely to come in at the bottom half of that range. For 2025, we continue to expect $2 to 2.5 billion in depreciation.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Chris Danely with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Danely\n\nSemiconductor Analyst, Citibank\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Hey, Rafael, just another question on the balance sheet and cash. So you guys have seen the share count kind of flatten out here for the last four or five quarters, and then you're building cash and increasing your debt. I guess what's changed? Traditionally, you've sort of taken the share count down slowly but steadily. Any sort of changes in the long-term thinking there on cash, usage of cash, etc.?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. When it comes to capital management, it all depends. It depends on circumstances. At the moment, our objective when it comes to—you've known us for a while—we return all cash flow, all free cash flow to the owners of the company. We do that over time. There are times to increase liquidity and to build up cash. You have seen us over the last couple of years do that and steadily increase the cash on the balance sheet. We finished at $10.4 billion last quarter. We've done that very consciously, right, to protect the investments that we're making, particularly the $5 billion per year CapEx investments in manufacturing because that is the most important allocation of capital has been for the last few years and will continue to be for the next three years.\nSo with that in mind, we've had that in mind as we have made overall capital allocation decisions, including the decisions on repurchases.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nA follow-on, Chris?\nYeah. Thanks, Dave. Just another question on China, but more on the, I guess, the insourcing side. So some of your competitors have talked about this impacting them. Do you guys see an impact of this on TI? Would or will this alter your long-term, I guess, growth expectations or thoughts on your China business? Just any color there would be very helpful. Thanks.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So I'll start, and Dave, if you want to chime in. But as Dave alluded to earlier on the call, China is a very important market. We need to compete there. We do compete there, and we compete to win there. China, it's pretty clear that there's an incentive to design local semiconductor suppliers. I think that's what you're referring to as insourcing. And today, yeah, today that share, my guess, my sense is it's 10% to 15% of the local content is sourced by local semiconductor suppliers. I think the exact number is 12%, the one I saw. So that means there's another 88% that is shared now between US and European suppliers. And our goal is to continue that fight and maintain and gain that share, competing with local suppliers, but also competing with US and European semiconductor suppliers.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. And maybe I'll just add, in China and any market, we've just got to have the best parts. And when we have that, that means we've got to be ahead of competitors, whether that's on performance, on support, availability, and cost. And we have customers in every region that are beginning to think about where they're sourcing products from. So customers that aren't in China are looking at our, as they describe it, geopolitically dependable capacity. And that's about 80% of our revenue. The 20% that's in China, we have customers in China that have and support global markets, and they're coming and describing our geopolitically dependable capacity and wanting to have access to it because it is very unique. We're the only ones that are building at scale outside of China and Taiwan capacity. So customers understand that. They understand it both in China as well as outside.\nSo thank you for that, Chris. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I've asked this question before, but it keeps coming up. Can you talk about how you think about pricing kind of more strategically as you contemplate having a decent amount of capacity, more 300-millimeter capacity, more subsidization? Does that change the pricing paradigm at all? Are there markets where you might be more price aggressive than you wouldn't be if any of that were different?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Joe, the answer will be amazingly consistent with how you've asked it before. But we haven't changed our strategy on pricing. You know that pricing doesn't move quickly in our industry, and it isn't the primary reason why customers choose our products overall. So we regularly monitor pricing for all of our products that includes all end markets, all product categories, and all regions. And we price to be competitive. And we can do that because we've got a great product portfolio, and we've got great access to the markets through our channels. And we've got competitive products because we build it on 300-millimeter. So hopefully that's amazingly consistent. You have a follow-on?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah. Thank you for that. Yeah. In terms of the embedded business, I know you've had a number of kind of vertical markets that you de-emphasized and things like that with kind of a focus on more of a core kind of catalog strategy in that business. Where are you in that? Do you expect that your embedded business would sort of track the broader microcontroller business, or just how do you think about the transitions that are happening there?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. I think that we continue to make progress overall in our embedded business. The goal there is to have that business growing and contributing to our free cash flow over the long time. We think it's a great business and continue to invest. So we're very happy with that strategic progress. So I think in the near term, of course, we're not going to be immune to cycle-related corrections. It's a little bit later because of the constraints that we have due to embedded relying on foundry supply. And as you know, we're investing to put capacity in place, and we'll have control of that in the future and really are in a good position to gain share there. So thank you for that. Joe, we'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nYes. Thank you. Dave, I had a question about the Q4, I mean, the Q2 outlook. So I know obviously you can't guide by market and things like that. But from a bookings perspective, are we starting to see sort of a broad-based recovery in bookings, or would you still say it's quite selective in all the different applications that you're targeting?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So let me speak to bookings at the top level. We saw bookings increase each month of the quarter. That is very typical that we would see in a Q1. I don't have bookings by end market. If there's something very unusual going on, of course, that would jump out at us. So that's just not something I have here in front of me. But I would describe it as behaving as we would expect it to. And of course, those bookings and other demand signals that we get from our customers are obviously embedded into our guidance. You have a follow-on, Tore?\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nYeah. That's very helpful. As my follow-up, you mentioned there's a few segments within the industrial category that are starting to grow or perhaps have found a bottom from an inventory correction perspective. Can you talk about which segments those are?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Again, as we talked about over the last several quarters, now that there were markets that were behaving or sectors that were behaving asynchronously. So there are shorter cycle investment sectors that began to roll earlier, longer-term investment cycles that were rolling later, really just the last couple of quarters into it. So it's really, if you had to kind of divide them out, that's what they would look like. So thank you for that, Tore. And.\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGo to the next caller, please. This will be our last caller.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good evening. First question is related to the buybacks. I think you addressed this in a prior question. I guess the question is, what would be the trigger for being able to resume some degree of buybacks? We realize that the intention is to return 100% of excess free cash flow. At what point does the cash in the balance sheet and kind of the industry conditions allow you to kind of come back to what you've been doing previously?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Well, a couple of things. For example, the data point that I'll give you is our free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $940 million. And we returned, and also in trailing 12 months, $4.8 billion. So one catalyst for a change there would be once we're past this investment phase that is consuming a good chunk of that free cash flow. Another catalyst is obviously revenue and how that behaves over a number of years. But so these are just some of the puts and takes that we think about when we're allocating capital.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYep. Follow-on, Chris?\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nI do. Thanks. And I guess the question is about where TI is allocating the R&D investment going forward and how that may be changing. Over the last year, it looks like auto industrial is about 70% of your revenue. And I know that's by design. But you've got some segments such as com equipment that have been down a lot more. As we look out over the next two years or so, do you think that that percentage of revenue from some of the segments kind of stays about where it is right now? Or based on the R&D investments you're making, do you think that changes substantially?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. And it's a great question, Chris. So let me just use as a backdrop for those that hadn't looked at our capital management slide deck. Slide 21 shows our percentage of our revenue by end market. The middle column there talks about what we're doing directionally from an R&D spend. We've talked about for some time that our belief that there's going to be secular trends in increasing semiconductors in industrial and automotive. As a result of that, we have been taking investments up there. The other markets, though, if you look at personal electronics and communications equipment, our investments there have been and continue to be very steady because we can find great opportunities inside of those markets. So we'll continue those investments. Then enterprise systems, we've taken up the investments there slightly.\nAnd there's just opportunities, and enterprise systems likely will be a good grower as well. It doesn't have quite the same dynamics as industrial and automotive for us. But certainly, things that sit inside of enterprise, we believe will make that an above-average grower for over the next decade plus. So with that, I'll turn it over to Rafael to wrap up.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay. Thanks, Dave. Let me wrap up by emphasizing what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers, and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever-changing. And we will be a company that we're personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference.

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website.\nThis call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'd like to provide some information that's important for your calendars. Next week, on Thursday, 1 February 2024 at 10:00AM.\nCentral Time, we'll have our capital management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and our approach to capital allocation as we prepare for the opportunity ahead. Moving on, today we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into Q4 revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets.\nI'll then provide an annual summary of revenue breakout by end market. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for Q1 2024. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue was $4.1 billion, a decrease of 10% sequentially, and 13% from the same quarter a year ago. Analog revenue declined 12% year-over-year, and Embedded processing declined 10%.\nOur other segment declined 25% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our Q4 revenue by end market. Our results reflect increasing weakness in industrial and a sequential decline in automotive as customers work to reduce their inventory levels. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid-teens as we saw that increasing weakness. The automotive market was down mid-single digits after three and a half years of very strong growth. Personal electronics was about flat. Next, communications equipment was down low single digits. Lastly, enterprise systems grew low single digits. In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market.\nAs a percentage of revenue for 2023, industrial was 40%, automotive was 34%, personal electronics 15%, communications equipment 5%, enterprise systems 4%, and other was 2%. In 2023, industrial and automotive combined made up 74% of TI's revenue, up about 9 percentage points from 2022, and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to Analog and Embedded technologies to make their end products more reliable, more affordable, and lower in power. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, Q4 revenue was $4.1 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.4 billion, or 60% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansions, and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 650 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $898 million, up 4% from a year ago and about as expected.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 21% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.5 billion in the quarter, or 38% of revenue. Operating profit was down 30% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in Q4 was $1.4 billion, or $1.49 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter.\nCapital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $65 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in Q4, marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $4.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. Our balance sheet remained strong with $8.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of Q4.\nTotal debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of Q4 was $4 billion, up $91 million from the prior quarter, and days were 219, up 14 days sequentially. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2023, cash flow from operations was $6.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $5.1 billion. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.3 billion, or 8% of revenue.\nOur free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model as well as our decisions to invest in 300mm manufacturing assets and inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for Q1, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.45 to 3.75 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to 1.16. We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions.\nWe will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. My first question is on your Q1 outlook. I think at the midpoint, you're guiding revenue down 12% or so, which is clearly well below what we consider to be typical seasonality. Any end markets or regions or device types that you can call out that's driving that view, or is it broad-based weakness across all applications?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I'll take that, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. In Q4, we did see weakness in industrial, increasing weakness there. We saw the sequential decline in automotive. As the guide would suggest, we believe that we'll just continue to operate in a weak environment and one where customers are continuing to rebalance their inventories overall. Nothing specific to comment on. You have a follow-up?\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI do. Thanks, Dave. Just on gross margins, I think you guys did a good job in explaining what's driving it. Still, I'm a little bit surprised with the year-over-year kind of drop-through, if you will. Gross margin dollars essentially dropping as much as your revenue. I understand the underutilization, the increase in depreciation, but what are you seeing from a pricing perspective? Is it more pricing than volume that's driving the revenue decline and the decline in gross margins? Or if you can kind of speak to your strategy from a pricing perspective, what you're seeing in the marketplace, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Toshiya, and I'll remind everyone else. I know you know the industry well, but pricing just doesn't move quickly in our markets overall, and nor is it the primary reason why a customer chooses our products. As we've mentioned before, our pricing strategy hasn't changed. Of course, we're always regularly monitoring the market and pricing our products appropriately. As we've talked about now for, I think, a couple of quarters, as we expected supply and demand to come more in balance, that we would expect pricing to revert back to how it's behaved over the last 10 or 20 years. Over the last six months or so, that's what we've seen. So somewhat of a low single-digit decline is what we're expecting out in time, and I wouldn't describe that as unusual. Thanks for the question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGo to the next caller, please. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. I wanted to ask about factory loadings. Dave, gross margin was down maybe 250 basis points. It's kind of implied to be down 250 basis points. Even if I strip out depreciation, it's down about 100 basis points for March. So it seems like utilization's coming down a bit. And CapEx also came in a little bit lower too for December. So the first question on that is, can you talk about loadings? Is March going to be the bottom in loadings, and we should see inventory begin to come down also in March? And then I had a follow-up on that too.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So no, thanks for the question. So step back. In Q3, at the end of Q3, we talked about this. As we have near our inventory levels, then we have adjusted our factory loadings accordingly. So in Q3, we did some of that, and that had an impact on gross margins and underutilization. Q4 adjustment was bigger than Q3. And now going into Q1, we're taking that adjustment further. So the Q1 adjustment on underutilization will be bigger. But we continue to have an upward bias on inventory as we continue to build the right buffers for the right parts to be ready on the other side of the cycle. So a follow-up?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI did, yeah. So then on CapEx, can you talk about that? It was a little lower. It's running actually quite a bit below the $5 billion run right now. So are you actually cutting CapEx now since you're bringing down factory loadings? Thanks.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nNo, we're not. In fact, CapEx came in, as expected, $5.1 billion, and we've been talking about $5 billion per year. So it was right on target. And you should expect, and we expect, to continue running at about $5 billion per year through 2026 as we complete the investment plans that we've been talking about.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat. Thanks, Tim. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Daneley with Citibank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Just a follow-up on the utilization rates. So, is the target, I guess, inventory level, has that not changed for you guys? And so, do you expect utilization rates to bottom in Q1, or do you think you might have some more inventory adjustments going into Q2 for TI?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. No, thanks, Chris. So broadly speaking, our inventory targets have not changed over the last six, nine months through this cycle. So we still have some ways to go, clearly less than we did six months ago. But we still have some ways to go on that front. At one point, I talked about $4 to 4.5 billion worth of inventory. So that's in the ballpark, and we just finished just shy of $4 billion. But as far as when underutilization bottoms, that's going to depend on revenue expectations. And at this point, as always, we only give one quarter at a time. So we'll see where we are 90 days from now, and we'll tell you about that.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll just add that our target inventory is set really by device. We look at things like how many customers are buying the product, what the buying patterns look like, and how long it takes us to manufacture the product. So it's really a bottoms-up plan built on that very, very specifically. So that's what drives that target overall. And we want to have inventory positioned to support growth over the long term. This is a side comment. So a follow-on, Chris?\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Equity Research Analyst, Citibank\n\nYeah, thanks, guys. I guess just a little bit of color on the end market commentary. Thanks for that. On the industrial side, it sounds like most of the downside is due to excess inventory, not demand. I was hoping you could confirm that. And then with automotive weakening, is there any reason why automotive wouldn't fall under the same issues that the industrial end market inventory would as well?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So I'll start, and Rafael, if you want to add anything. I would say that the demand signals that we get from customers are orders that they place, whether that's either directly or through consignment feeds. So that's the data that we can see. We actually can't see their inventory levels. We can anecdotally, as we see a market like personal electronics is down 30% to 40%.\nWe know handsets and PCs, that market hasn't gone down as much as that. So we know anecdotally that we're shipping below demand. So we believe that that's what's going on in industrial. We have customers who have told us that they have built inventory and plan to correct that. So having a real clear picture of what their demand looks like and their channel inventories look like isn't something that we can see directly overall.\nThe comment on automotive, we know that customers there did want to build inventory, and we believe that they're in a good position now. It wasn't surprising that we saw a sequential decline there. Thanks, Chris. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, and thanks for taking my question, guys. I just wanted to understand the linearity of the industrial and automotive declines. When you set out in the quarter, baked into your expectations, were you kind of looking at these two businesses both a little bit better than they came in, or was one a bit worse than the other versus your expectations? And then just in terms of the timing of the quarter, it looks like your finished goods inventory went up a bit more than your other buckets. And I just wanted to understand, is that just because later in the quarter customers were signaling some weaker trends, or is there any reason behind the dynamic there? Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me start with the second part of the question. And Dave, you want to take the first one, but.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nSure.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nNo, the second part, that's just a reflection of our ability to build those inventory buffers that we were talking about. What you're seeing there is on the finished goods side, as Dave alluded to earlier, that's one set of targets that we have. That's at the finished goods level. Remember, we have 100,000 different parts, and the vast majority of those are what we call catalog, which means they sell to many, many customers. So we want to build a certain finished goods level for each one of those parts. But we're also building at the chip level. Think of a chip can go into two, three, 10 different finished goods. So it works out well to have some chip-level inventory operationally. But you also want to have finished goods. So that's what you saw there. Yeah.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nAnd by end markets, Tom, our guidance, as you saw, where our revenues came in, we were, I think, less than 1% from the midpoint of the guidance range. So the business came in about as we expected, and nothing unusual versus our expectation in industrial or automotive overall. So thanks. Do you have a follow-up for that?\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat was a two-part question. That counts as two.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay. All right.\n\nTom O'Malley\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nAppreciate it, guys. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWe appreciate it. Thanks. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Just wanted to ask about the product side, the Analog versus Embedded. Embedded had a significantly better year, dropping 3% versus the Analog, down 15%. I know there's very different end market exposures for those, but were there other competitive dynamics, pricing dynamics, strategic focus dynamics, anything else to explain the difference between the performance of those two segments?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Ross, I think your instincts are spot on that the first lens to look at things is through the end markets. Embedded has heavied up in industrial and automotive, so revenues there were stronger for a longer period of time. The second consideration is that Embedded relies on foundry wafer supply more heavily. Most of our Analog business is done internally. So there, the constraints lasted longer and have now been resolved and are behind us. So that created some of the lag between there as well. And as you know, our CapEx plans and spend will have more of our wafers overall built internally, which is inclusive of Embedded. Do you have a follow-on?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, I do. And it's kind of a cyclical question. You guys are astute students of cyclicality of this whole industry. I think this is going to be, including your guide, the sixth quarter of negative year-over-year comps. Do you see anything that's TI-specific that's different this cycle? Pricing just got so good before. Now it's a bigger headwind. You kind of addressed the pricing dynamic a little bit before. But what's making this duration so much longer, and is any of it TI-specific?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Ross, I think I'll make a comment, and Rafael, if you want to add anything. All cycles are the same, and they're all different, right, as we've all studied them over time. What's clearly different this time is how the markets have behaved and the bifurcation. We saw personal electronics begin to weaken Q2 a year ago. And automotive, just we saw a sequential decline this last quarter. So in the other markets, somewhere in between. And then in addition, I think that we've had lots of other noise that's inside of the system, whether that's been pricing, as you mentioned. We've had non-cancelable, non-reschedulable orders and other longer-term contracts that have required customers to take product that they don't need. Whether companies are using distributors more heavily than others. So all of that adds noise into it.\nSo I think we just need to let that noise ring itself out over the cycle. And what we're focused on, of course, is investing in our competitive advantages, getting stronger. We believe that we're in a great position to continue to gain share over the long term.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. I just want to clarify for those who may be new on the call. When Dave talked about non-cancelable, non-returnable orders, that's not. We don't do that. Many of our competitors have done that. So that, in our view, distorts the market. That wasn't the case with us. And the second point, distributors, same thing. Our distributor footprint is much smaller than with many of our competitors. We're down to 25% or so of our revenue through distribution, so 75% direct, whereas many of our competitors are the opposite.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nSo great clarification.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Ross.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWe'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the CHIPS Act, how that's kind of flowing through both the Investment Tax Credit and then any thoughts you may have on timing of kind of grant issuances or things like that?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. No, happy to talk about that. First, let me address the ITC first, and then I'll go to the grant. The ITC investment tax credit, 25% credit on CapEx for manufacturing in the United States. We have accrued to date, over the last year and a half or so, $1.4 billion. We expect to get about $500 million of that later this year, probably in Q4, as far as the current law and regulations stipulate. We'll get the rest further down the road, mostly the following year and then after that. We'll continue to accrue that benefit, just again, 25% on anything we spend in the United States for manufacturing. That's the cash side and the balance sheet. On the P&L, we're already seeing the benefit as lower depreciation.\nThat benefit tends to be small, has been small so far, because, for example, some of that is for buildings that haven't even started to depreciate. But it will build up over time on that front. So that's the ITC. The grants, we submitted our application for those in December. And at this point, we will wait to hear from the Department of Commerce and see what happens there.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYou have a follow-on, Joe?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I did. So I think, obviously, that stuff will help the cash flow down the road. But your free cash flow is below the level of the dividend. Right now, I assume it's pretty important to keep paying the dividend. Where does that leave you in terms of share repurchases and other uses of cash?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. First, I would point you to our operating cash. Our business model is very strong. Our operating cash flow is very strong, and it supports our investment for growth through the cycle. So clearly, with the levels of CapEx that we have right now, that hits the free cash flow. But big picture, understand and look at the operating cash. Even in a depressed environment, with the revenue depressed, the operating cash flow is very strong. We also have a very strong balance sheet, and we just finished the year at $8.6 billion. When it comes to repurchases, I would take you to our objectives on capital management for cash return. Our objective is to return all free cash flow via dividends and repurchases.\nEach one of those has different objectives on dividends and repurchases, but we have a really good track record over many years of doing both of those.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat. Thank you, Joe.\nYep. Go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director in Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Up through Q3 of last year, the team had seen numerous consecutive quarters of increasing cancellations and push-outs, right? Typical customer behavior in a weak demand environment. I assume, given your commentary, that the team continues to see cancellations, push-outs, activity expanding into the December quarter. You're almost a month into March. You're still seeing cancellations and push-outs expanding or starting to maybe see some signs of stabilization?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Harlan, as you would expect, we have seen cancellations in the quarter, and Q4 had remained elevated. I wouldn't describe them as increasing, but just at higher levels. And we're still early inside of the quarter. I would say all of what's going on with cancellations and the backlog that we see is all comprehended in our guidance and our outlook. Do you have a follow-up?\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director in Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. And then, yeah, from a geographical perspective, China-headquartered shipments seen about 20% of your sales through the October quarter of last year. This geography has experienced the most significant decline during this downturn, right? It's down about 33% year-to-date up through Q3 of last year. Your total business was down 13%, right? Is this geography continuing to contribute to the weakness stepping into this year, or is the weakness more US and European-based?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. I would say when you look regionally this quarter, just from a dollar standpoint, you've got sequentially all the regions were down, with the exception of the rest of Asia. So, nothing unusual with China going on specifically there, overall. So again, when we look at our business, I think most of that is explained by the end markets. And certainly, we hadn't seen a recovery inside of China that I think most of us were expecting.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director in Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Okay. Thank you, Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGo to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Semiconductors Research Analyst, TD Cowen & Company\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about OpEx, given the extended softness. Any thoughts on getting more defensive with OpEx as the weakness lasts longer than expected? Or you grew OpEx 8% in 2023. Is that sort of the right level that you think you need to be investing in the business for the long-term growth? Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Big picture, we have a disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D and SG&A to the best opportunities. We've held a steady hand throughout a number of years, pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, post-pandemic, where we managed OpEx very well during that time and didn't get ahead of our skis. So we will continue with that disciplined process. Remember, of course, these investments, particularly industrial automotive, which is where we're biasing our investments. They're very long-term in nature. You're not going to what you save now would hurt your long-term revenue growth. So we're not going to do that. So we're going to maintain those investments for the long term.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYou have a follow-on, Josh?\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector and Semiconductors Research Analyst, TD Cowen & Company\n\nYeah. Thank you. I guess I wanted to ask about your fixed cost leverage. I mean, in the past, you've talked about, I think, 75% gross margin fall through on incremental revenue. Is that still the right metric we should be using, given revenues a good amount lower and depreciation is larger? I'd just be curious to hear if anything in the mechanics of that math has changed. And basically, when can the incremental 300mm capacity start flowing through the gross margins and be margin accretive? Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So the math is still the same. The fall through you should use is 70% to 75%. That is still a reasonable starting point. You then have to adjust for depreciation, as you alluded to. And our depreciation, I gave you an update on that 90 days ago, but I'll reinforce that in a second. But you have to adjust for that. And then there are always puts and takes on any given quarter. Like right now, it's under utilization, but at some point, that goes the other way.\nThroughout this time, as you pointed out, we will continue to benefit increasingly from more 300mm wafers, which have a cost advantage. So let me go back to depreciation just to make sure everybody has the right numbers. The same as what I said 90 days ago. For 2024, expect $1.5 to 1.8 billion. For 2025, expect $2 to 2.5 billion.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Josh. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, your revenue outlook for March basically gets us back to kind of pre-COVID, H1 2020 levels. Yet at the same time, your inventory is roughly double. And so, curious, how are you thinking about kind of normalized inventory over time? And also, how are you thinking about coming out of the trough? What kind of a gross margin recovery will look like, given where your inventory levels are today?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nSo that's a multi-part question with many angles to that. What I would tell you, high level, we're very comfortable with our inventory level. Right now, we're just shy of $4 billion. As I said earlier on the call, we have continued upward bias for at least one more quarter, probably a couple of quarters at least, an upward bias on that. But that is good inventory for catalog parts that sell to many customers that last a long time. So I feel really good about that. But we'll see how things play out on the other side of the cycle, and depending on demand and different things. But I would expect to continue holding relatively high levels of inventory.\nWe're just in a different position than we were even three or four years ago in terms of how much of our revenue and our parts are in industrial automotive, in catalog type of parts that last a long time. So our strategy is such that it makes sense to have that inventory. Our order fulfillment processes have also improved. We have TI.com and different tools that we can leverage to go direct to market. We have a much higher percent of our revenue now, 75% is direct. So all those factors play into having more inventory as a real leverage point that we can use to serve our customers even better.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYou have a follow-on, C.J.?\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah. Thanks, Dave. A quick follow-up to a prior question. I know you can't share too much, but your application clearly in for the CHIPS Act. I guess we should hear results between now and the summer. I guess, is there anything you can share on that front and perhaps how it's kind of impacting your thoughts on the capacity you're bringing online?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. No, unfortunately, no, there's nothing we can share. It's really up to the U.S. Department of Commerce. We sent our application, and we'll see where that goes. What I would say, just like I said before, is when we decided about a year ago to take our CapEx up from $3.5 billion per year to 5 billion per year and this tremendous plan to build more fabs in the United States, we comprehended CHIPS grant in that decision. So that was part of our thinking there. But at this point, yeah, that's all we can share on that front.\n\nCJ Muse\n\nSenior Managing Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nAll right.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, CJ. I think we've got time for one more caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, thank you. Guys, just trying to understand a little bit about why the customers may have reacted as they did, because we know your lead times have normalized well in advance of the rest of the industry. Do you think this is just simply a function of end markets took another leg down here? Do you think perhaps some of your customers were delaying their inventory adjustments until they saw lead times for the rest of the industry come down? Because we know that that's also, some of your competitors lagged your lead time normalization. Perhaps that was a factor here.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Chris, as you know, you can't pin it on one thing, especially, we've got well over 100,000 customers and 80,000 products that we're managing. As Rafael was talking about building inventory, we've got essentially all of our catalog products or almost all of our catalog products now immediately available on TI.com. And our objective with inventory and the capacity we're putting in place is to have our customer service metrics remain high, which means keeping lead times stable.\nSo I think in some markets, we've seen customers that have told us that they were planning and have built their capacity and their inventories to grow at 25% in the coming year. And they showed up, and their plans changed, and they're only going to grow 10%, right? So they told us they won't be ordering product for some time as they equalize those numbers. They're still going to have healthy growth. But it's hard to put that across all of those 100,000 customers into one short, concise statement. Do you have a follow-on?\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, fair enough. And if you could help us with the impact of the underutilization right now, how much of a headwind is that providing right now on a cost-to-sales basis? And then on the other side of this, when we finally get to a recovery, what will be the right way to model this? Will there be a bigger snapback as some of the underutilization comes off, or do we just kind of go back to sort of those mid-70s incremental margins and the way back up?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So what I would tell you first, we don't quantify underutilization, but you can fairly reasonably back into it just looking at our numbers, our midpoint or our range, our midpoint, and then consider the expected depreciation increase. And it'd be relatively straightforward for you to back into something reasonable for Q1 on the underutilization impact there. Now, after that, it's all going to depend on revenue and revenue expectations because, of course, depending on what those are in the second half of the year, let's say 90 days from now, then that will be a big factor in determining how the factories will run.\nBut the bigger picture is all this deployment of CapEx that we're doing is all on 300mm, which has a 40% cost advantage versus 200mm. As several question people asked earlier, it has ITC benefits on that. So it's coming in at 25% discount on the ITC, and we'll see how much we get on grant. So the fall through on those investments for many, many years will be very positive, I would say. So with that, Dave?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYep. Thank you, Rafael. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to sharing our capital management update next Thursday, 1 February 2024 at 10:00AM Central Time, as I mentioned earlier. And a replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

I'm Dave Paul, head of investor relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website.\nThis call will include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings. For a more complete description.\nToday, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into Q3 revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management as well as share the guidance for our Q4 2023.\nStarting with a quick overview of the quarter, revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion flat sequentially and a decrease of 14% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 16%, embedded processing grew 8%, and our other segment declined 32% from the year ago quarter.\nNow I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by market. During the quarter, automotive growth continued, and industrial weakness broadened similar to last quarter. I'll focus on a sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid single digits with weakness broadening across nearly all sectors. The automotive market continued to grow and was up mid single digits. Personal electronics was up about 20% off a low base, and next, communications equipment was down upper teens, and finally, enterprise systems grew upper single digits. Given where the market is now, it's a good time to remind everyone of our plan and areas of strategic investments. First, our confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content per system, especially in industrial and automotive, remains high, and we're well positioned in these markets.\nSecond, our long-term 300mm manufacturing roadmap provides our customers with geopolitically dependable capacity to support these build outs and enable future growth. We continue to expect associated capital expenditures to be about $5 billion per year through 2026. In addition, we made good progress on our inventory replenishment consistent with our long-term objectives to support growth and provide high levels of customer service. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion, or 62% of revenue from a year ago. Gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings. As a reminder, LFAB related charges transitioned to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit margin decreased 690 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $923 million, up 7% from a year ago and about as expected on a trailing twelve month basis. Operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 20% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter, or 42% of revenue, and was down 29% from the year ago quarter.\nNet income in the third quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $6.5 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.9 billion over the last twelve months. Free cash flow on a trailing twelve month basis was $1.6 billion.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $50 million of our stock. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 5%, marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. This action reflects our continued commitment to return free cash flow to our owners over time. In total, we have returned $5.6 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.9 billion of cash and short term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion, and days were 205, down two days sequentially. Inventory was up $179 million in the third quarter, less than half the increase versus the prior quarter as we near our desired inventory levels.\nTherefore, we began to lower factory starts in Q3, which results in additional charges to the income statement. This impact is comprehended in our outlook for Q4. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.93 to 4.27 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to 1.57 as we continue to operate in a weak environment.\nLastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. As you are looking at your models for 2024, based on current tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain above what it is in 2023. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions, in order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions. Please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up. Operator, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon (Bernstein Resear\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one I did want to ask about gross margins. So I mean depending on what I assume for OpEx next where I'm getting something like 250 basis points of compression, maybe more. I know you talked a little bit about how some of that is the impact of utilization. Can you give us some feeling for I guess like the magnitude of the different drivers utilization, lower revenue, depreciation, pricing, and how we ought to be thinking about that trajectory as we get into the next year. Like.\nIs there more to go, I guess, is what I'm asking?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So, thanks, Stacy. Let me try to help you with that. Of course, we, for the forecast, we give a range on revenue and earnings, EPS, not the pieces. But let me go through some of what I said for third quarter, which applies for fourth quarter and beyond.\nSo for third quarter, like I said in the prepared remarks, in third quarter gross profit decreased primarily due to revenues as the first driver. Then, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with plant capacity expansion, namely depreciation is the main one there, and reduce the factory loadings, and that's the underutilization component. Then, as I also said in the prepared remarks, inventory, which is the other side of the coin, as we near desired levels of inventory, we began lowering factory starts in the third quarter. So, there was an impact in third quarter due to that on the income statement. There'll be a bigger impact in fourth quarter due to that. Beyond that, we're not forecasting. But of course, that will depend on revenue expectations well into next year. Do you have a follow up?\n\nStacy Rasgon (Bernstein Resear\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment\n\nI do. Thanks. So you gave us a little color on the end market behavior in Q3. Can you give us some thoughts on even qualitatively what to expect by end market into Q4 and particularly for auto? It sounds like auto in Q3 was still strong. Do you still see that strength in continuing in the Q4 and the year end?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Stacy, I'll take that. You know, when you look at the guidance, it would suggest, and we believe that we continue to operate in a weak environment in general, and if there was something significant that was changing from one quarter to the next, as our typical practice, you know, we highlight that, and we just don't have anything to specifically call out for in the fourth quarter. So thanks, and we'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I also had a question on autos. It sounds like it's holding in there despite this broadening strike. And I guess the question is, are more of your customers on consignment in that business or is the split in autos about the same as that, you know, 2/3, 1/3 versus the rest of the company. And I asked because I'm wondering sort of what you're seeing on the, you know, disty side that you would sell into autos. Do you see bookings at least weakening? That would be more consistent with what we're seeing in, you know, terms of this strike and you know, some of the weak macro numbers that we see.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nSure, yeah. And you know, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it was up auto was up mid single digits sequentially, and it was up 20% when you look year-on-year. So obviously that growth had continued in general. I would say that a market like automotive and personal electronics will have larger customers. Those larger customers tend to be biased to more consignment. So we would have that probably more in automotive than if I contrast it to a market perhaps like industrial. But overall, as you know, we've moved to having closer direct relationships with customers, which would include.\nThe customers that we have in automotive. I think we service pretty close to 1,000 or so different automotive OEMs. There is quite a bit of broadness in who we serve there. Have a follow on Tim?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do. Dave? Yeah. So what would it take for you to think about cutting CapEx? And I asked because the plan was put into place when, you know, revenue was quite a bit higher than where it is today. Is there kind of a line in the sand for revenue where you would reconsider the plan? I know you've actually increased the plan. Well, you know revenues continue to weaken. But is there some threshold around, you know, is there some. If it weakens to this point you would consider cutting CapEx? Just, you know, wondering. Any comments on those things?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me comment on that. We're very pleased with the progress on our manufacturing expansion. They will provide geopolitically dependable capacity to support customer growth for the coming decade. And as you know, semiconductor content continues to increase and to provide us the ability to grow at that 10% growth rate that we talked about at the last capital management call. If the market requires that, we'll continue to make those investments. So we continue to expect $5 billion of CapEx per year in 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. So you should count on that.\nLet me also give everyone as a reminder, these CapEx numbers are gross, meaning they do not include benefits from the ITC or grants from the CHIPS Act. So we're actively working through the grant application process with the CHIPS Program Office, which we believe will be meaningful to our manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah, and will help support semiconductor growth for decades to come. And funding from the CHIPS Act grant was comprehended in our decision making for these investments.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat, thank you Tim. We'll go to the next caller please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for asking. Question in Q3. I think it was the first time in a few years that you guys just came in at the midpoint of your guidance. Usually you beat it by 2, 3, 4%, something like that. So I guess my question is anything strange in the linearity in the quarter either by end market, just aggregate bookings, any color on that you could provide.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nNothing strange.\nRoss, I'd say that revenue built as we went through the quarter, and I'd say just in general it's reflective of.\nA weak environment that we're operating in, which is obvious from the guidance that we're giving. You have a follow on?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nI did. On the end market side of things, you said automotive was up about 20% year-over-year. I know oftentimes you go between giving sequentials or year-over-year, but could you give us year-over-year by the end market, please?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nCertainly, certainly. Yeah. So industrial market was down mid-teens. I mentioned automotive was up about 20%, personal electronics was down about 30%, comms equipment was down about 50%, and enterprise system was down about 40%. So I think consistent with that weaker environment that we talked about. So thank you Ross. And we'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you guys could elaborate a little bit on the pricing environment. I think many of us have been picking up evidence of the pricing environment, particularly in Asia, intensifying over the past couple of months or a couple of quarters. You don't really give pricing as a reason for gross margins to be down sequentially, year-over-year. But what kind of role is pricing playing? Has your strategy changed at all, whether it be on the analog side or MCU side?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, so thanks for that question. Always helpful to be able to clarify that. First, I'll just start with pricing doesn't move quickly in our markets.\nNor is it a primary reason that customers choose our products. So we're typically agreeing to pricing that's out six months or on an annual basis for the following year. And so we're continuing to move through that. Our pricing strategy, as we mentioned before, hasn't changed. So we're regularly monitoring what's going on with pricing. We always have a goal to remain competitive, and certainly as supply and demand has come into balance or more closer to balance, we've said for some time that we would expect that pricing to behave like it has over the last couple of decades, meaning low single digit decline. So as we move out in time, that's what we're beginning to see. So really no changes other than going back to what we've seen over the last couple of decades. You have a follow on?\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, I do. Thanks Dave. So I guess over the past 12 months OpEx is up about 10%, revenue is down about 10%. So as we think about calendar 2024, I was hoping you could give us a hint as to how to think about OpEx. And Dave, I think you used to give or you had given multi-year guidance on depreciation. How should we, to the extent there are any updates, how should we think about 2024 and 2025 depreciation? Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, thanks for the question. I'll address both OpEx and depreciation. So on OpEx.\nWe've held a steady hand on OpEx for many years, and we'll continue to do so. So as an example to illustrate the point, from 2017 through 2021 we ran at about $3.2 billion of OpEx, and then in 2022 it ticked up to $3.4 billion, and now we're running at about $3.7 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. So you can see the steady hand and just a bit of an increase over the last few years. And that's as we have held a steady hand with our hires, new college hires, and as we make investments to continue to strengthen the company in the case of R&D, the broad portfolio in the case, you know, with sales and ti.com on the reach of our channels, then on depreciation. So our CapEx expansions are unchanged. We talked about that, addressed it with previous callers.\nSo $5 billion of CapEx per year for the next two to three and three years beyond that as we have been talking about. Now when it comes to depreciation, as time has passed, we have more clarity on what to expect on depreciation. So for Q4 2023, let me start with Q4 2023, we expect depreciation to increase on a quarterly basis at about the same rate as what we have been seeing throughout 2023. So essentially we're going to end the year just shy of $1.2 billion, maybe $1.19 billion, $1.18 billion, $1.17 billion, somewhere in that, in that range for the year. As an update for 2024, we expect depreciation to be between $1.5 and 1.8 billion, and for 2025 to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nVery helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWe'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi, thank you. I had a question on factory loadings and inventory. So correct me if I'm wrong. I thought the thinking up until now has been we got to be ready for the upturn. And so we're building inventory for that. And you have highlighted that over several quarters. Look, we're not, we don't have a target. But you did raise the target in terms of how much inventory you want to carry. So this change, which I want to make sure I'm reading it right, that you're taking an underutilization charge because you've reached a desired level of inventory, is that a reflection that your expectation for the recovery is changing? That is, you're expecting a slower ramp in revenues than what you perhaps were thinking a couple of quarters ago.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me start. Dave, if you want to chime in, but we have.\nTargets for where we want inventory levels to be. And that goes by product and by state of finish of those products. So, for example, of the 80,000 different products that we have.\nMore than the vast majority of those are catalog, meaning they sell to many, many customers. They last for a long, long time. So we can have so many years of inventory at the chip level or finished goods level, in many cases at both levels. And that's based on our internal process to set those. So those are the. And in aggregate, that's added up to $4 to $4.5 billion. And that's what we've been kind of guiding to and we've been talking about. But what really matters is what happens at the very specific level on a part by part number. So as we have near those levels, and you see our inventory levels have increased about $500 million per quarter for two quarters and then this last quarter, $179 million. So clearly this is a deceleration on that growth.\nThat's on purpose because as we near those levels, then we have slowed down the factory start. That goes primarily with the fab, but also with the assembly test operations. Then that slowdown will continue into Q4. So they reverse. The other side of slowing your factory load is the underutilization charges. So as we near those levels, we are ready to be on the other side of this cycle for the upturn. Of course, it's not just inventory. Capacity is really the bigger driver. You know, what we've been doing on that now for a number of years and where we're investing. Inventory really bridges that gap as an upturn happens until you get your factories really cranking at higher levels.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. I'll just add and bring back to, you know, our capital management that we've been saying, you know, for I think over a decade now, our objective with inventory, you know, is to maintain high levels of customer service, keep our lead time stable, keep product availability really high. So as we talked about earlier, you know, ti.com, really essentially all of our catalog products are available for immediate shipment. Lead times are stable, and so we are prepared for that next upturn when it does come. You have a follow on, Ambrish?\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Quick one, Dave. Just looking at the year-over-year, we're in the fourth quarter double-digit year-over-year decline, and I look back many years. There haven't been other cycles where we have had multiple quarters of negative, but not that many times we've seen a double-digit kind of four or five quarters. Just wanted your perspective on what you folks are seeing this cycle versus, and I know no cycle is the same, but just kind of give just help investors think about how to think about that double-digit four quarters. It could be potentially longer year-over-year decline. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nSure. Yeah. And I think we all know, as being students of studying the cycles over the years, they're all the same and they're all different at the same time, and they're unique. The one thing that is unique, of course, with this cycle is how the markets have behaved differently. We've seen bifurcation and really lined up very well with when markets recovered. So, you know, PE was the first to recover and was very strong early on. The other markets followed very shortly after that. And automotive was last. As you remember, many automotive manufacturers struggled to restart their factories, and people weren't going to showrooms when we were in the midst of the pandemic. So really, as we've seen things begin to roll over, personal electronics was first. It was then followed by the other markets. And yet we still have automotive that's hanging in there.\nSo I think that's the one thing that's unique, and I think as we've learned and studied the cycles, our product portfolio has changed as well over time. But the best time to be preparing for the upturn is before it shows up. So that's what we've been busy doing, and we think we're in a great position to.\nSupport the next upturn and to continue to gain share. Thank you, Ambrish. We'll go to the next caller.\nPlease.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to automotive just to make sure that I understood what you said. Do your comments imply that you're seeing a largely seasonal environment in Q4 with no changes in terms of orders to traditional or EV customers? And if that is the case, if I understood it correctly, isn't that surprising given the macro headwinds that sector is facing?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nVivek, your question was on third quarter or on fourth quarter?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nI think when you were asked before, you said that if there was anything abnormal, you would have mentioned it. So I assume that because you didn't mention it, that it is normal.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So yeah, what I said is if there was something that we needed to explain the outlook or unusual or however you want to describe it, we would do that. So I, you know, I'm not, I'm stopping at that point intentionally, and you know, we'll finish up the quarter and report out what happens in fourth quarter.\nDo you have a follow up?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYeah. On depreciation, what is driving the revision? Because your CapEx doesn't seem to be changing. And then kind of part B of that is if I take that year-on-year delta, Rafael, I think it's about $400 to 500 million or so incremental in 2024. So at the current revenue run rate, that's a 2 to 3 point headwind to gross margin. I just wanted to make sure that I got those two points right.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So for 2024 I said $1.5 to 1.8 billion.\nThat is down from what you probably had before, $2 billion. For 2025, I said $2 billion to 2.5 billion. So that is down from $2.5 billion, which we had said before. The reason, you know, as you pointed out, CapEx is not changing. So that's not the reason. It's just as time has passed, we have more clarity on what to expect. For example, depreciation on tools that doesn't start until the tool is not only received but installed and then qualified. And that's when depreciation starts. So that doesn't happen immediately. As we have learned more as to how that process works with all the number of tools that we're receiving for the various factories, we're providing an update on depreciation.\nThank you.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThe gross margin headwind is that. Did I have the calculation right? It's a two to three point headwind on gross margins.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nWell, so you know, we've given you the tools to calculate gross margin. So let me remind everybody what that is. First is revenue. So you pick the revenue that you believe is going to happen for the next several years. And this works on a quarterly basis. But of course in any quarter there are a lot of puts and takes, but better to do it over longer horizons. So you start with revenue, then you follow that through at 70% to 75%, which, by the way, that is reflective of the great, not only geopolitically dependable capacity that we're putting in place, but it is all that new fab capacity is 300mm, so has a structural cost advantage, not to mention that we're getting ITC and grant benefits, as that is installed in the United States.\nSo then you follow that through at 70% to 75%. Then you need to account for the added depreciation. So this year it's probably going to be close to $1.2 billion. And then next year I just gave you $1.5 to 1.8 billion. So if you want to pick a point between that, then you get your added depreciation for 2024. And then, you know, at a high level, that's it. But of course, in any given quarter, even in any given year, but especially in a given quarter, you have puts and takes. And one of them that we're seeing right now is the underutilization. But that right now is a headwind. But that can also be a tailwind when we're on the other side and we're increasing loadings.\nThat, what does that? You know, what that does is that then it comes back the other way. Right, but that's more of a tactical comment that happens in some quarters. Hopefully that answers your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Vivek. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes, thank you. I wonder if you could walk us through the calculation on the underutilization charge. I mean, I think it seems like with over 200 days of inventory, you would see the cost impact of that in six months, but you're pulling it forward. Can you just talk about how you determine how much to pull forward?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, well, so it's an accounting process, and it's essentially when you're below what's considered normal utilization, that percent that you're below that normal. And that is generally determined by wafers. In the fab, it's wafer starts and outs. In the assembly test operation, it's your, the number of units that you're producing, and you divide that by the capacity that you can get. The maximum capacity, you establish a normal, which is where you normally expect to be. That could be 85%, 90%, 95%, depending on the situation. And whenever you're below that, then you take that percent that you're below, and then you take those, those fixed costs and go straight to the P&L instead of going into inventory. So some of those costs, we call them fixed costs, some of them are depreciation. But it's not only depreciation.\nElectricity, for example, is largely fixed. You use about the same amount of electricity whether a tool is running production or not, as long as it's plugged in. So you take that into account, and then at the end of the day you're not creating money. When you do that, you just essentially put it on the balance sheet or the P&L. And in this case it's going directly into the P&L as an in-quarter charge because that portion of the capacity is not producing. Now, one more comment that gives us tremendous operating leverage on the other side of that. Right? Because think about fixed costs. On the way down they hurt you, but on the way up they're fixed.\nRight.\nSo from a cash standpoint, on the way up you don't spend any more and then you get just tremendous cash fall throughs on the revenue, particularly when it's 300mm capacity at very low cost.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nFollow on, Joe.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, separately, on the comm infrastructure business, seemed quite soft both quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. I know that business isn't a focus for you guys, but can you talk about what's driving that weakness?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, you know, and.\nLast year was about 7% of our revenue, Joe. So, you know, we can find great opportunities in comms equipment. We continue to invest. We just don't think it has the secular growth that other markets like industrial automotive have. So we continue to make investments there. And as we've talked about that market over the years, it's one that just tends to be choppy. We believe that they're continuing to.\nAdjust their inventory levels as we work our way through this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, you know, it's down 50%, so that's a pretty significant drop. So, yeah, so again, long term we think it's a great market and we're positioned well there, but it will have these types of moves overall. Okay, thank you, Joe. Go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Stifel\n\nYes, thank you, Dave. Thank you, Rafael. So you talked about operating in a weak environment. Could you also give us some color on bookings trends, you know, maybe even, you know, the current run rate versus where you think consumption is? Just trying to understand and you know, goes back to Ambrish's question about you know, four consecutive quarters of double digit declines. So yeah, any color on bookings trends will be really helpful.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So you know, as I mentioned, I think as part of another question on revenue order linearity, there is nothing unusual inside of that.\nYou know, secondly we, you know, obviously we're describing the environment as being weak, and we don't have a system that tells us, you know, are we shipping above or below demand. You know, the strongest signal that we get is orders from customers. Now as we talked about earlier, a market like personal electronics was the first market to go into the downturn. We've had a couple of quarters of growth inside of that market. Now it's up off of a very weak base but we are seeing that as a trend.\nIf you compare that to the industrial market, you know, we had seen that, let's say, you know, let's call it about half of the sectors begin to weaken a couple of quarters ago. It was really this quarter that we saw that that weakness is broadening. So you know, customers, we believe inside of markets like that, inside of markets like OEM equipment that we said they're adjusting their inventories as such.\nSo again, that provides us the opportunity both strategically with building the capacity and more tactically, building, putting in place the inventory to be able to support the next upturn because it will certainly come. You have a follow on?\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Stifel\n\nYes, thank you, Dave. Very helpful follow-on for Rafael. Rafael, thank you for the depreciation numbers for the next few years. Do you also have an update for us on the timing of the offsets to the depreciation, especially in relation to ITC and the CHIPS Act, and anything new there?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nSo nothing new frankly. The ITC.\nThe expectation is similar, which is about.\nYou know, 25% credit on everything that is spent. All CapEx in the US for fabs. So what we said back in February is that that's going to be roughly $4 billion of the $20 billion or so that for CapEx the 5 billion 4x. So roughly about $4 billion of that we're going to get back on ITC, about one year offset, of that we have already accrued $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. So, you'll see that under on our balance sheet, on their long-term assets, a portion of that we will get sometime next year, probably by fourth quarter next year, is when we expect to get that cash. So that's when the cash will start flowing in. As I mentioned in an earlier call on an earlier question, we are actively applying for the grant.\nSo that's going to be in addition to the ITC. We're not counting on that. We don't have any numbers on that because you have to apply, you have to wait until the Department of Commerce makes that decision. But we are.\nWe're planning on receiving and the funding from the CHIPS Act grant was comprehended in our decision, and we firmly believe we are very well positioned to receive those funds, and we're a great candidate for that, and we believe there will be meaningful to our manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah to support semiconductor growth and the objectives of the CHIPS program office.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat, thank you, Tore. We'll now go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, thank you. Good afternoon. China headquartered shipments were about 20% of sales through H1 2024. This geography has experienced the most significant decline. I think it was down like 33%, 35% year-over-year in the first half of this year. Much of your China business is focused on industrial. Is this geography continuing to contribute to the weakness here in Q4, and what other geographies are you seeing that is contributing to this broadening out of sort of the weak industrial trends?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, so let me. I'll speak to what we saw, you know, in the third quarter and just in general, including industrial in China, continued to remain weak. So, I think if we're having this call, you know, a year ago or so, as China came out of COVID, I think most of us would have expected there to be more significant rebound, which just hasn't materialized. So yeah, and you know, I think when you look at, on a regional basis compared with a year ago, the only region that was up was Japan. So, the other regions were down. And so, again, just describe that weakness as being very broad in nature. Follow on, Harlan.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, thank you. So your embedded business continues to hold up relatively well, right?\nTrailing 12 months, it's up 8% year-over-year. You've talked about the positive strategy changes in embedded last quarter. You also cited some constraints. I assume that those constraints have fully normalized. So do you anticipate embedded continuing to hold up or do you anticipate this segment starting to weaken from here with some of the capacity constraints potentially easing?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, as we talked about before, you know, we had focused on changing the product strategy that we had inside of Embedded. I'd say we're very pleased with the results that we have so far. Our first objective was to stabilize that business, and we continue to invest in it because we believe it has long-term growth potential, and contribution to free cash flow. So we're very pleased with where we're going. I think more tactically, as we talked about last quarter, we saw that business does rely more heavily on foundry suppliers. We began to see those, you know, that capacity begin to free up for us. And I think that was different because we had capacity in place to service Analog, our own capacity there overall, so, yeah.\nSo again we think that business long term is going to be a great driver for us in the future. So thank you, and I think we've got time for one more caller.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nSemiconductor and Artificial Intelligence Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave, can you remind us what's in the other segment besides calculators and perhaps why that end market was down so much more than the others? I know it's very seasonal from calculators, but there was a big drop year-over-year.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So besides calculators, we have our DLP or digital light processor products that are in there. So those products are continuing to make their way through inventory correction overall. And calculators had a weaker back to school this season. Do you have a follow-on?\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nSemiconductor and Artificial Intelligence Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nYeah, perhaps something that hasn't come up in a while, but lead times, you know, we were dealing with this golden screw issue for a while where there were, you know, quite a number of parts or quite a big part of the, let's say, all the available SKUs that had very extended lead times. With revenue down as much as it is, I'm guessing that that's mostly resolved and lead times are like sort of two to four weeks for most things at this point. But if you could level set me on that, the degree to which there are still extended lead times, that'd be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So, I may have mentioned this earlier, but you know, almost all of our catalog products are available on ti.com for immediate shipment. And so as we approach our desired level of inventory, we've got product that is positioned both in finished goods as well as in wafer form to be able to restock that. Of course, lead times therefore are, you know, at what I described normal levels and continue to be consistent. And you know, there's probably no time that we don't with so many different products and so many different customers will have hotspots, but they're very few and far between, and our ability to close those is.\nWe've got, you know, flexible manufacturing. Most of our production is fungible. So with that, I'll ask Rafael to wrap up the call for us.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right, let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers, and technology is the foundation of our company. Ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing, and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and with one as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWelcome to the Texas Instruments third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website.\nThis call will include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.\nToday, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third quarter revenue results, with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management, as well as share the guidance for our fourth quarter 2023.\nStarting with a quick overview of the quarter, revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, flat sequentially, and a decrease of 14% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 16%, Embedded Processing grew 8%, and our Other segment declined 32% from the year-ago quarter.\nNow I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by market. During the quarter, automotive growth continued, and industrial weakness broadened. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance, as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid single digits, with weakness broadening across nearly all sectors. The automotive market continued to grow and was up mid single digits. Personal electronics was up about 20% off a low base, and next, communications equipment was down upper teens. Finally, enterprise systems grew upper single digits. Given where the market is now, it's a good time to remind everyone of our plan and areas of strategic investments. First, our confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content per system, especially in industrial and automotive, remains high, and we're well positioned in these markets.\nSecond, our long-term 300mm manufacturing roadmap provides our customers with geopolitically dependable capacity to support these buildouts and enable future growth. We continue to expect associated capital expenditures to be about $5 billion per year through 2026. In addition, we made good progress on our inventory replenishment, consistent with our long-term objectives to support growth and provide high levels of customer service. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.\nRafael?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion, or 62% of revenue from a year ago. Gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings. As a reminder, LFAB related charges transitioned to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit margin decreased 690 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $923 million, up 7% from a year ago, and about as expected on a trailing twelve month basis. Operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 20% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter, or 42% of revenue, and was down 29% from the year ago quarter.\nNet income in the third quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $6.5 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.9 billion over the last twelve months. Free cash flow on a trailing twelve month basis was $1.6 billion.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $50 million of our stock. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 5%, marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. This action reflects our continued commitment to return free cash flow to our owners over time. In total, we have returned $5.6 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. At the end of the third quarter, total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion and days were 205, down two days sequentially. Inventory was up $179 million in the third quarter, less than half the increase versus the prior quarter.\nAs we near our desired inventory levels, therefore, we began to lower factory starts in the third quarter, which results in additional charges to the income statement. This impact is comprehended in our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $3.93 to 4.27 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to 1.57 as we continue to operate in a weak environment.\nLastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14. As you are looking at your models for 2024, based on current tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain about what it is in 2023. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value. In the long term, we continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon (Bernstein Resear\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment",
    "content2": "Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I did want to ask about gross margins. I mean, depending on what I assume for OpEx next, where I'm getting something like 250 basis points of compression, maybe more. I know you talked a little bit about how some of that is the impact of utilization. Can you give us some feeling for, I guess, like the magnitude of the different drivers, utilization, lower revenue, depreciation, pricing, and how we ought to be thinking about that trajectory as we get into next year. Like is there more to go? I guess is what I'm asking.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Thanks, Stacy. Let me try to help you with that. Of course, for the forecast, we give a range on revenue and a range on EPS, not the pieces. Let me go through some of what I said for third quarter, which applies for fourth quarter and beyond. For third quarter, like I said in the prepared remarks.\nIn third quarter, gross profit decreased primarily due to revenues as the first driver. Then, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion, namely depreciation is the main one there, and reduced factory loadings, and that's the underutilization component. As I also said in the prepared remarks, inventory, which is the other side of the coin, as we near desired levels of inventory, we began lowering factory starts in the third quarter. There was an impact in third quarter due to that on the income statement. There'll be a bigger impact in fourth quarter due to that. Beyond that, you know, we're not forecasting, but of course that will depend on revenue expectations well into next year. Do you have a follow up?\n\nStacy Rasgon (Bernstein Resear\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of U.S. Semiconductors and Semiconductor Capital Equipment\n\nI do. Thanks. You gave us a little color on the end market behavior in Q3. Can you give us some thoughts on even qualitatively what to expect by end market into Q4, and particularly for auto? It sounds like auto in Q3 was. Do you still see that strength continuing into Q4 and the year end?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Stacy, I'll take that. You know, when you look at the guidance, it would suggest, and we believe, that we continue to operate in a weak environment in general. If there was something significant that was changing from one quarter to the next, as our typical practice, we highlight that, and we just don't have anything to specifically call out for in the fourth quarter. Thanks, and we'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks a lot, Dave. I also had a question on autos. It sounds like it's holding in there despite this broadening strike. I guess the question is, are more of your customers on consignment in that business, or is the split in autos about the same as that, you know, 2/3, 1/3 versus the rest of the company? I ask because I'm wondering sort of what you're seeing on the, you know, disty side that you would sell into autos. Do you see bookings at least weakening? That would be more consistent with what we're seeing in terms of this strike and, you know, some of the weak macro numbers that we see.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nSure, yeah. You know, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, auto was up mid single-digits sequentially, and it was up 20% when you look year-on-year. Obviously, you know, that growth had continued. In general, I would say that, you know, a market like automotive and personal electronics will have larger customers. Those larger customers tend to be biased to more consignment. We would have that probably more in automotive than if I contrast it to a market perhaps like industrial. Overall, as you know, we've moved to having closer direct relationships with customers, which would include.\nThe customers that we have in automotive. I think we service pretty close to 1,000 or so different automotive OEMs. There is quite a bit of broadness in who we serve there. You have a follow on, Tim?\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nI do, Dave. Yeah. What would it take for you to think about cutting CapEx? I ask because the plan was put into place when, you know, revenue was quite a bit higher than where it is today. Is there kind of a line in the sand for revenue where you would reconsider the plan? I know you've actually increased the plan. Well, you know, revenues continue to weaken. Is there some, like, tree around, you know, is there some—if it weakens to this point, you would consider cutting CapEx? Just, you know, wondering. Any comments there? Thanks.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me comment on that. You know, we're very pleased with the progress on our manufacturing expansion. They will provide geopolitically dependable capacity to support customer growth for the coming decade. As you know, semiconductor content continues to increase, and to provide us the ability to grow at that 10% growth rate that we talked about at the last capital management call. If the market requires that, we'll continue to make those investments. We continue to expect $5 billion of CapEx per year in 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. You should count on that.\nLet me also give everyone as a reminder these CapEx numbers are gross, meaning they do not include benefits from the ITC or grants from the CHIPS Act. We're actively working through the grant application process with the CHIPS Program office, which we believe will be meaningful to our manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah, and will help support semiconductor growth for decades to come. Funding from the CHIPS Act grants was comprehended in our decision making for these investments.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Tim. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ross Seymour with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi guys, thanks for asking a question. In the third quarter, I think it was the first time in a few years that you guys just came in at the midpoint of your guidance. Usually you beat it by 2, 3, 4%, something like that. I guess my question is anything strange in the linearity in the quarter, either by end market, just aggregate bookings, any color on that you could provide?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nNothing strange.\nRoss, you know, I'd say that revenue built as we went through the quarter, and I'd say just in general it's reflective of a weak, you know, a weak environment that we're operating in, which is obvious from the guidance that we're giving. You have a follow on?\n\nRoss Seymore\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nI did. On the end market side of things, you said automotive was up about 20% year-over-year. I know oftentimes you go between giving sequentials or year-over-years, but could you give us year-over-years by the end market, please?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nCertainly, certainly.\nYeah.\nIndustrial market was down mid teens. I mentioned Automotive was up about 20%, personal electronics was down about 30%, comms equipment was down about 50%, and enterprise system was down about 40%. I think consistent with that weaker environment that we talked about. Thank you, Ross. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you guys could elaborate a little bit on the pricing environment. I think many of us have been picking up evidence of the pricing environment, particularly in Asia, intensifying over the past couple of months or a couple of quarters. You do not really give pricing as a reason for gross margins to be down sequentially year-over-year. What kind of role is pricing playing? You know, has your strategy changed at all, whether it be on the analog side or MCU side?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, thanks for that question. Always helpful to be able to clarify that, you know. First, I'll just start with, you know, pricing doesn't move quickly in our markets. It's, you know, nor is it a primary reason that customers choose our products. We're typically agreeing to pricing that's out six months or on an annual basis for the following year, so we're continuing to move through that. Our pricing strategy, as we mentioned before, hasn't changed. We're regularly monitoring, you know, what's going on with pricing.\nWe always have a goal to remain competitive and certainly, you know, as supply and demand has come into balance or more closer to balance, you know, we've said for some time that we would expect that pricing to behave like it has over the last couple of decades, meaning, you know, low single digit decline. As we move out in time, that's what we're beginning to see. Really no changes other than going back to what we've seen over the last couple of decades. You have a follow on?\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, I do. Thanks, Dave. Over the past 12 months, OpEx is up about 10%, revenue is down about 10%. As we think about calendar 2024, I was hoping you could give us a hint as to how to think about OpEx. Dave, I think you used to give or you had given multi-year guidance on depreciation. How should we, to the extent there are any updates, how should we think about 2024 and 2025 depreciation? Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, thanks for the question. I'll address both OpEx and depreciation. On OpEx.\nWe've held a steady hand on OpEx for many years and will continue to do so. As an example, to illustrate the point, from 2017 through 2021 we ran at about $3.2 billion of OpEx, then in 2022 it ticked up to $3.4 billion, and now we're running at about $3.7 billion on a trailing twelve month basis. You can see the steady hand and just a bit of an increase over the last few years. That's as we have held a steady hand with our hires, new college hires, and as we make investments to continue to strengthen the company. In the case of R&D, the broad portfolio; in the case, you know, with sales and ti.com on the reach of our channels; then on depreciation. Our CapEx expansions are unchanged. We talked about that, addressed it with previous callers.\n$5 billion of CapEx per year for the next 2023 and three years beyond that, as we have been talking about. Now, when it comes to depreciation, as time has passed, we have more clarity on what to expect on depreciation. For fourth quarter, let me start, fourth quarter of 2023, we expect depreciation to increase on a quarterly basis at about the same rate as what we have been seeing throughout 2023. Essentially, we're going to end the year just shy of $1.2 billion, maybe $1,190 million, $1,180 million, $1,170 million, somewhere in that range for the year. As an update, for 2024, we expect depreciation to be between $1.5 and 1.8 billion, and for 2025 to be between $2 and 2.5 billion.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nVery helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWe'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Thank you. I had a question on factory loadings and inventory. Correct me if I'm wrong. I thought the thinking up until now has been we got to be ready for the upturn, and so we're building inventory for that. You have highlighted that over several quarters. Look, we don't have a target, but you did raise the target in terms of how much inventory you want to carry. This change, which I want to make sure I'm reading it right, that you're taking an underutilization charge because you've reached a desired level of inventory, is that a reflection that your expectation for the recovery is changing? That is, you're expecting a slower ramp in revenues than what you perhaps were thinking a couple of quarters ago.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nLet me start. Dave, if you want to chime in, but we have.\nTargets for where we want inventory levels to be. That goes by product and by state of finish of those products. For example, of the 80,000 different products that we have.\nMore than the vast majority of those are cataloged, meaning they sell to many, many customers. They last for a long, long time. We can have so many years of inventory at the chip level or finished goods level, in many cases at both levels. That's based on our internal process to set those. In aggregate, that's added up to $4 to 4.5 billion. That's what we've been kind of guiding to, and we've been talking about. What really matters is what happens at the very specific level and a part by part number. As we have near those levels, you see our inventory levels have increased about $500 million per quarter for two quarters, and then this last quarter, $179 million.\nClearly, this is a deceleration on that growth, and that's on purpose because as we near those levels, we have slowed down the factory start. That goes primarily with the fab, but also with the assembly and test operations. That slowdown will continue into fourth quarter. The reverse, the other side of slowing your factory load, is the underutilization charges. As we near those levels, we are ready to be on the other side of this cycle for the upturn. Of course, it's not just inventory. Capacity is really the bigger driver. You know what we've been doing on that now for a number of years and where we're investing, but inventory really bridges that gap as an upturn happens, until you get your factories really cranking at higher levels.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYes, I'll just add, bringing back to our capital management that we've been saying for, I think, over a decade now, our objective with inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service.\nKeep our lead time stable, keep product availability really high. As we talked about earlier, you know, ti.com, really essentially all of our catalog products are available for immediate shipment. Lead times are stable, and we are prepared for that next upturn when it does come. You have a follow on, Ambrish?\n\nAmbrish Srivastava\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, quick one, Dave. Just looking at the year-over-year, we're in the fourth quarter, double-digit year-over-year decline. I look back many years, there have been other cycles where we have had multiple quarters of negative, but not that many times we have seen a double-digit kind of four or five quarter. Just want your perspective on what you folks are seeing this cycle versus, and I know no cycle is the same, but just kind of give, just help investors think about how to think about that double-digit four quarters, it could be potentially longer year-over-year decline. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nSure. Yeah. I think we all know as being students of studying the cycles over the years, they're all the same and they're all different at the same time, and they're unique. The one thing that is unique, of course, with this cycle is how the markets have behaved differently. We've seen bifurcation, and it really lined up very well with when markets recovered. You know, PE was the first to recover and was very strong early on. The other markets followed very shortly after that, and automotive was last. As you remember, many automotive manufacturers struggled to restart their factories, and people weren't going to showrooms when we were in the midst of the pandemic. Really, as we've seen things begin to roll over, personal electronics was first. It was then followed by the other markets, and yet we still have automotive.\nThat's hanging in there. I think that's the one thing that's unique. I think as we've learned and studied the cycles, our product portfolio has changed as well over time. The best time to be preparing for the upturn is before it shows up. That's what we've been busy doing. We think we're in a great position to.\nSupport the next upturn and to continue to gain share. Thank you, Ambrish. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to automotive just to make sure that I understood what you said. Do your comments imply that you're seeing a largely seasonal environment in Q4 with no changes in terms of orders to traditional or EV customers? If that is the case, if I understood it correctly, isn't that surprising given the macro headwinds that sector is facing?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nVivek, your question was on third quarter or on fourth quarter.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nWhat is being, I think when you were asked before, you said that if there was anything abnormal, you would have mentioned it. I assume that because you didn't mention it, it is normal.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, what I said is that if there was something that we needed to explain the outlook or unusual or however you want to describe it, we would do that. I, you know, I'm not, I'm stopping at that point intentionally. You know, we'll finish up the quarter and report out what happens in fourth quarter. Yeah. Follow up.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYeah. On depreciation, what is driving the revision because your CapEx does not seem to be changing? Part B of that is if I take that year-on-year delta, Rafael, I think it is about $400, $500 million or so incremental in 2024. At the current revenue run rate, that is a 2 to 3 point headwind to gross margin. I just wanted to make sure that I got those two points right.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. For 2024, I said $1.5 to 1.8 billion, and that is down from what you probably had before, $2 billion. For 2025, I said $2 to 2.5 billion, so that is down from $2.5 billion, which we had said before. The reason, you know, as you pointed out, CapEx is not changing, so that's not the reason. It's just as time has passed, we have more clarity on what to expect. For example, depreciation on tools does not start until the tool is not only received but installed and then qualified, and that's when depreciation starts. That does not happen immediately. As we have learned more as to how that process works with all the number of tools that we're receiving for the various factories, we're providing an update on depreciation.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThe gross margin headwind is that. Did I have the calculation right? It's a two to three point headwind on gross margins.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nWell, so you know, we've given you the tools to calculate gross margin. Let me remind everybody what that is. First is revenue. You pick the revenue that you believe is going to happen for the next several years. This works on a quarterly basis. Of course, in any quarter there are a lot of puts and takes, but better to do it over longer horizons. You start with revenue, then you follow that through at 70% to 75%, which, by the way, is reflective of the great, not only geopolitically dependable capacity that we're putting in place, but all that new fab capacity is 300mm, so has a structural cost advantage, not to mention that we're getting ITC and grant benefits as that is installed in the United States.\nYou follow that through at 70% to 75%. Then you need to account for the added depreciation. This year it's probably going to be close to $1.2 billion. Next year I just gave you $1.5 to 1.8 billion. If you want to pick a point between that, then you get your added depreciation for 2024, and then, you know, at a high level, that's it. Of course, in any given quarter, even in any given year, but especially in a given quarter, you have puts and takes. One of them that we're seeing right now is the underutilization. That right now is a headwind, but that can also be a tailwind when we're on the other side and we're increasing loadings. What that does is that then it comes back the other way.\nRight. You know, that's more of a tactical comment that happens in some quarters. Hopefully that answers your question.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYes, thank you. I wonder if you could walk us through the calculation on the underutilization charge. I mean, I think it seems like with over 200 days of inventory, you would see the cost impact of that in six months, but you're pulling it forward. Can you just talk about how you determine how much to pull forward?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, well, it's an accounting process and it's essentially when you're below what's considered normal utilization. That percent that you're below that normal, and that is generally determined by wafer. In the fab, it's wafer starts and outs. In the assembly test operation, it's the number of units that you're producing, and you divide that by the capacity that you can get, the maximum capacity. You establish a normal, which is where you normally expect to be. That could be 85%, 90%, 95%, depending on the situation. Whenever you're below that, you take that percent that you're below, and then you take those.\nThose fixed costs go straight to the P&L instead of going into inventory. Some of those costs, we call them fixed costs, some of them are depreciation. It is not only depreciation. You have electricity, for example, which is largely fixed. You use about the same amount of electricity whether a tool is running production or not, as long as it is plugged in. You take that into account, and at the end of the day, you are not creating money. When you do that, you just essentially put it on the balance sheet or the P&L, and in this case, it is going directly into the P&L as an in-quarter charge because that portion of the capacity is not producing. One more comment, that gives us tremendous operating leverage on the other side of that. Right. Because think about fixed costs.\nOn the way down they heard of it, but on the way up they're fixed. Right. From a cash standpoint, on the way up you don't spend any more, and then you get just tremendous cash fall throughs on the revenue, particularly when it's 300mm capacity at very low cost.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nDo you have follow on, Joe?\n\nJoe Moore\n\nSemiconductor Industry Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Yeah, thank you. Yeah. Separately, on the comm infrastructure, business seemed quite soft both quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. I know that business isn't a focus for you guys, but can you talk about what's driving that weakness?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, you know.\nLast year was about 7% of our revenue, Joe. You know, we can find great opportunities in comms equipment. We continue to invest, we just don't think it has the secular growth that other markets like industrial, automotive have. You know, we continue to make investments there. You know, as we've talked about that market over the years, it's one that just tends to be choppy. We believe that they're continuing to.\nAdjust their inventory levels as we work our way through this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, you know, it's down 50%. That's a pretty, pretty significant.\nYeah, again, long term we think it's a great market and we're positioned well there. You know, it will have these types of moves overall. Okay, thank you, Joe. Go to the next caller please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Stifel\n\nYes, thank you, Dave. Thank you, Rafael. You talked about operating in a weak environment. Could you also give us some color on bookings trends, maybe even the current run rate versus where you think consumption is? Just trying to understand. It goes back to Ambrish's question about four consecutive quarters of double-digit declines. Yeah, any color on bookings trends will be really helpful.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah.\nYou know, as I mentioned, I think as part of another question on revenue order linearity, there is nothing unusual inside of that.\nYou know, secondly, we, you know, obviously we're describing the environment as being weak, and we don't have a system that tells us, you know, are we shipping above or below demand? You know, the strongest signal that we get is orders from customers. Now, as we talked about earlier, a market like personal electronics was the first market to go into the downturn. We've had a couple of quarters of growth inside of that market. Now it's up off of a very weak base.\nWe are seeing that as a trend. If you compare that to the industrial market, you know, we had seen that, let's say, you know, let's call it about half of the sectors begin to weaken a couple of quarters ago. It was really this quarter that we saw that that weakness is broadening. You know, customers, we believe inside of markets like that, inside of markets like Tom's Equipment that we said, they're adjusting their inventories.\nAs such, that provides us the opportunity both strategically with building the capacity and more tactically putting in place the inventory to be able to support the next upturn because it will certainly come. You have a follow on?\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Stifel\n\nYes, thank you, Dave. Very helpful follow on for Rafael. Rafael, thank you. For the depreciation numbers for the next few years, do you also have an update on the timing of the offset to the depreciation, especially in relation to ITC and the CHIPS Act, and anything new there.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nNothing new, frankly, the ITC.\nThe expectation is similar, which is about.\nYou know, 25% credit on everything that is spent, all CapEx in the US for fabs. What we said back in February is that that's going to be roughly $4 billion of the $20 billion or so for CapEx, the $5 billion times four. Roughly about $4 billion of that we're going to get back on ITC, about one year offset of that. We have already accrued $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. You'll see that on our balance sheet under long-term assets. A portion of that we will get sometime next year, probably by fourth quarter next year, is when we expect to get that cash. That's when the cash will start flowing in. As I mentioned in an earlier call, on an earlier question, we are actively applying for the grant.\nThat's going to be in addition to the ITC. We're not counting on that. We don't have any numbers on that because you have to apply, you have to wait until the Department of Commerce makes a decision. We are.\nWe're planning on receiving the funding from the CHIPS Act grant. That was comprehended in our decision, and we firmly believe we are very well positioned to receive those funds. We're a great candidate for that, and we believe they will be meaningful to our manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah to support semiconductor growth and the objectives of the CHIPS program office.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nGreat, thank you, Tori. Go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, thank you. Good afternoon. China headquartered shipments were about 20% of sales through the first half of this year. This geography has experienced the most significant decline. I think it was down like 33%, 35% year-over-year in the first half of this year. Much of your China business is focused on industrial. Is this geography continuing to contribute to the weakness here in Q4, and what other geographies are you seeing that is contributing to this broadening out of sort of the weak industrial trends?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, let me, I'll speak to what we saw in the third quarter and just in general, including industrial in China, continued to remain weak. I think if we're having this call a year ago or so, as China came out of COVID, I think most of us would have expected there to be a more significant rebound, which just hasn't materialized. Yeah. You know, I think when you look at it on a regional basis compared with a year ago, the only region that was up was Japan. The other regions were down. Again, just describe that weakness as being very broad in nature. You have follow on, Harlan?\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Your embedded business continues to hold up relatively well, right? Trailing 12 months, it's up 8% year-over-year. You've talked about the positive strategy changes in embedded last quarter. You also cited some positive, some constraints. I assume that those constraints have fully normalized. Do you anticipate embedded continuing to hold up, or do you anticipate this segment starting to weaken from here with some of the capacity constraints potentially easing?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, as we talked about before, you know, we had focused on changing the product strategy that we had inside of embedded. I'd say we're very pleased with the results that we have so far. Our first objective was to stabilize that business, and we continue to invest in it because we believe it has long-term growth potential and contribution to free cash flow. We're very pleased with where we're going. I think more tactically, as we talked about last quarter, we saw that business does rely more heavily on foundry suppliers. We began to see that capacity begin to free up for us. I think that was different because we had capacity in place to service analog, our own capacity there overall.\nYeah, so again, we think that business long term is going to be a great driver for us in the future. So, thank you. I think we've got time for one more caller.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nSemiconductor and Artificial Intelligence Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for squeezing me in, Dave. Can you remind us what's in the other segment besides calculators, and perhaps why that end market was down so much more than the others? I know it's very seasonal from calculators, but there was a big drop year-over-year.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So besides calculators, we have our DLP or Digital Light Processing products that are in there. So those products are continuing to make their way through inventory correction overall. And calculators had a weaker back-to-school this season. Do you have a follow-on.\n\nWilliam Stein\n\nSemiconductor and Artificial Intelligence Equity Research Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nYeah, perhaps something that hasn't come up in a while, but lead times, you know, we were dealing with this golden screw issue for a while where there were, you know, quite a number of parts or quite a big part of the, let's say, all the available SKUs that had very extended lead times with revenue down as much as it is. I'm guessing that that's mostly resolved. Lead times are like sort of two to four weeks for most things at this point. But if you could level set me on that, the degree to which there are still extended lead times, that'd be really helpful. Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nSure. Yeah. So, and I may have mentioned this earlier, but you know, almost all of our catalog products are available on ti.com for immediate shipment. And so as we approach our desired level of inventory, we've got product that is positioned both in finished goods, as well as in wafer form to be able to restock that. Of course, lead times therefore are, you know, but I describe normal levels and continue to be consistent. And you know, there's probably no time that we don't. With so many different products and so many different customers will have hotspots, but they're very few and far between, and our ability to close those is very, we've got, you know, flexible manufacturing. Most of our production is fungible. So with that, I'll ask Rafael to wrap up the call for us.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nCFO, Texas Instruments\n\nAll right, let me wrap up by reiterating what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objective, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners who will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be part of and with one as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation."

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter.\nNext, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the Q3 of 2023. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter, revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially, and a decrease of 13% year over year. Analog revenue declined 18%, Embedded processing grew 9%, and our Other segment declined 10% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our Q2 revenue by market. During the quarter, we experienced continued weakness across all markets except automotive. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was about flat. Next, the automotive market was up low single digits.\nPersonal electronics was up low single digits after several quarters of sequential declines. Next, communications equipment was down mid-teens. Finally, enterprise systems was down mid-single digits. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, Q2 revenue was $4.5 billion, down 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion, or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures, and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 540 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $938 million, up 12% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.6 billion, or 19% of revenue. Operating profit was $2 billion in the quarter, or 44% of revenue, and was down 28% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.87 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.\nCash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the quarter and $7.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $3.2 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $80 million of our own stock. In total, we have returned $6.5 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remained strong with $9.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $500 million of debt and issued $1.6 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory dollars were up $441 million from the prior quarter to $3.7 billion, and days were 207, up 12 days sequentially.\nFor Q3, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.36 to 4.74 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to 1.92. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press Star 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the Star keys. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThanks for taking my question. I had a high-level question, which is, when I compare TI's sales growth right down almost 13%, 14% in the near term, down double digits versus peers, it's significantly below. When I look at your trailing 12-month free cash flow of sub-17%, if my model is right, that is the lowest since 2010. So at what point will TI say that something needs to change in the strategy to help close the gap on the growth side and to help free cash flow margins get back to the trend line? So I understand that, obviously, you're not optimizing the model for just one year, but now we have seen just consistent decline in free cash flow per share, which is your preferred metric. So at what point should we start to see free cash flow get back to historical trends?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, so thanks, Vivek. Let me start, and Dave, if you want to chime in. But big picture, step back to what we told you during capital management, and the investments that we're making are long-term in nature, as you alluded to in your question, and we are going to enable revenue growth for the company for the next 10 to 15 years. Okay, so that's how we're thinking about it, and that's where we're making these investments on CapEx, in particular, about $5 billion per year for the next four years. We are committed to those investments. We're excited to make those investments regardless of the short-term fluctuations of revenue. Of course, lower revenue means lower operating cash, which now with the CapEx, that's what you're seeing on the free cash flows. It's not unexpected.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, and maybe I'll just add that, Vivek, as you know and have followed us for some time, one of our competitive advantages is manufacturing and technology. So these CapEx investments really are strengthening that advantage over time. It's fairly obvious that those investments will allow us to produce products at significantly lower cost to service demand. And controlling those assets in today's world is increasingly important. So customers can see the investments that we're making, not only with that, the other systems that we've got to make it easier to do business with us, combined with the inventory we're putting in place to support their growth. And customer reaction is extremely positive to that. So we believe these will be great investments for all of us long-term. You have a follow-on?\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYeah, thank you. I guess maybe to say, ask the same question, but in a different way, right? And with respect, I mean, TI had the same strategy two or three years ago also, but we saw sales grow worse than peers last year, and sales are again growing worse than peers this year. So it's not a one-quarter or two-quarter phenomenon. Sales have been undergrowing your peer growth for almost two years now, and CapEx is growing while sales are declining. So that's why I'm questioning whether the strategy is still right, whether the results are actually justifying the strategy.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I'll start, Rafael, If you want to add. Again, we've talked about market share doesn't move quickly inside of our markets. I think that depending on the peer you're comparing to, oftentimes the market exposure can explain a good portion of it. There's other factors like how much distribution is someone using. As you know, we've transitioned from mostly using distribution to mostly having revenue come direct. So there was inventory that needed to be burned out of the channel as we made that transition. So there's multiple factors. I think going forward, our confidence in being able to continue to gain share is extremely high. Customer reaction to the capacity that they know they need to have, wanting to know that they've got the capacity runway, not from someone's manufacturing supplier, but directly from someone that makes their products, really resonates with customers.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nWe'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. My first one is on your Q3 guidance. You're guiding revenue up 1% sequentially. Dave, you called out automotive as the one end market that continues to be healthy. But anything to point out or any standouts as you think about the sequential trajectory from Q2 to Q3, or is it a continuation of what you saw in Q2?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, I'll just point out that this last quarter, we saw a weakness across the board in our markets, with the exception of automotive, like you've called out. Just to point out that that continued asynchronous behavior. We had PE weaken back in Q2 a year ago, and the other markets followed, but obviously, the exception of that with automotive continued to be strong. It's up over 20% year on year. So definitely very strong growth there. As we look into Q3, we're not expecting to see any significant change in our end markets compared to this last quarter. You have a follow-on?\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI do, thanks. So inventory on your balance sheet was up, I think, 13% sequentially. Days grew to 207. I know on your capital management call, you revised up the upper range of your target to more than 200. I also appreciate, Dave, the transition from distilled to direct. But at what point do you think you need to cut production or cut utilization rates and start to manage down inventory? Are you still comfortable with where things are today?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, no, thanks for the question, Toshiya. Yes, we are comfortable where we are. As a reminder, our objective for inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service and minimize obsolescence. I would point you to slide 13 at our capital management call. That shows the semiconductor cycle over many years, over about 30-some years, and what that informs us on what could happen in the future. We're planning for the long-term growth through those cycles, not in any one quarter or even any one year. Of course, inventory levels always depend on demand expectations. For the time being in the near term, they will likely have an upward bias.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, just to clarify, you're still running your fabs full at this point?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nUtilization this last quarter was lower than the previous quarter. That was largely a function of adding capacity.\n\nToshiya Hari\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nThank you, Toshiya. Next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, just to follow up on that, you said inventories have an upward bias. So that means inventory dollars and days you expect to increase again in Q3?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nWell, the days depend on revenue, of course. But on the dollars, it has an upward bias. So it's very likely that the dollars will go up in Q3. Of course, and you know this, right? But inventory is on the balance sheet at one point in time, but it's meant to support the future growth. And 200 days is about a couple of quarters' worth of inventory in various stages of finish.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHow many quarters is it going to keep going up for, though?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThat's going to depend on revenue expectations beyond now and then the decisions that we make on the factory. We forecast one quarter at a time. Just know that our thinking is long-term in nature, as I mentioned to Toshiya in the previous call. We're managing through the cycles, right? So not what's going to happen in one quarter or even two quarters, but we think it's going to happen over longer than that on inventory. On capacity, we're adding capacity that's going to support us for many years, right? So it's going to give us plenty of headroom. One more comment on inventory, just for those who maybe have not listened to us very often, but you know this, our inventory has very low obsolescence.\nThe bulk of it is for catalog parts that the inventory itself lasts years, in fact, up to 10 years on the shelves. But the product life cycles are very long with our customers, and we have, in many cases, tens or dozens of customers that buy the product. So the risk of obsolescence is very low on this inventory.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nOkay, thank you, Stacy. We'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein Research\n\nOh, was that my?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\n, That was your second. Yeah, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, thanks, guys. And by the way, thanks for having a nice, concise conference call. It's unique, and semis much appreciated. My first question is just on lead times and shortages. Given all the capacity you're adding in the inventory, can we pretty much say that TI lead times are the lowest, at least among peers, and the shortages are all gone? Are we pretty much, I guess, \"back to normal\"? And I mean, are there any metrics that you could share with us sort of now versus three or six months ago on the improvement there?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, Chris, how I would frame it today is we've got the vast majority of our products are available on ti.com for immediate shipment. As Rafael talked about, whenever the upturn does come, we'll have product available as well as capacity behind that to be able to support that demand. Now, if a customer wants to give us an order at lead time, those lead times over the cycle haven't changed that much. So they can place that order, or if they need it inside of that, they can, for the vast majority of the products, have it available. Now, we do have hotspots. We'll probably always have a place where we have a demand and supply imbalance. But those hotspots are closing and closing pretty quickly. As Rafael talked about, we're bringing on capacity every quarter.\nSo that just gives us more flexibility to be able to meet the customer demand, but it does vary beyond what we've got on hand. You have a follow-on?\n\nChris Danely\n\nManaging Director and Senior Semiconductor Analyst, Citigroup\n\nYeah, earlier in the call and in a bunch of the calls, you keep talking about your advantages in manufacturing, and given you have more internal manufacturing and more 300 millimeters than the competitors. I guess, are you guys getting a little more aggressive on price? Are you able to price below the competition? Is this something that has happened recently? Some of your competitors have, I guess, \"complained\" about TI getting more aggressive in price recently. I just wanted your response to that.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. Our pricing strategy hasn't changed. Of course, we regularly monitor the pricing of all of our products, and we may maintain the goal to continue to gain share over time. But there's nothing unusual going on with pricing today. I'll point out the fact that when we opened up our Fab 1, we had 75% of the tools needed inside of that factory. There was hand-wringing back then, if you remember, that we were going to do something unnatural. What we talked about was putting in place that capacity to support growth, and that's what it did. Thank you, Chris. We'll go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah, thank you. Good afternoon. Up until the March quarter, the team had seen three consecutive quarters of increasing cancellations and push-outs, right? Sort of the typical sort of customer behavior in a weak demand environment. Did the team continue to see cancellations and push-out activity expanding in the June quarter, or have you guys, or have you, or are you seeing signs of stabilization?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, the way I'd describe that is the cancellations remain at elevated levels. We believe that customers are continuing to work down inventories to get that more in line with their demand. You have a follow-on?\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah, thanks for that. So your embedded business continues to hold up very well, right? I think trailing 12 months, it's up 9% year over year versus your analog business, which is down 7%. I know part of it is due to the strategy, the refocusing of the MCU businesses over the past few years, more general purpose catalog focus, right? But it also seems to be reflecting this broader trend in the industry. If I look at the SIA data, if I look at you and your other MCU competitors, where industry MCU trends year over year are holding up much, much better versus analog. I just wanted to get the team's perspective on why the large delta in performance analog versus embedded.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, yeah. Thanks for that question, Harlan, and how you framed it. I would say at a top level, the changes that we have made to our product portfolio, the design in that, and the customer response to those products as we've put them out in the marketplace continues to be very strong. Our confidence that that business will grow and gain market share over the long term is extremely high based on that. And as we've talked about before, we're putting in place to be able to support that growth for embedded internally. And that is a position that we haven't been in quite some time. Near term, I would say, besides things stabilizing, we've experienced greater supply constraints over the last two years as embedded has previously had to rely on foundries to supply that demand. And so those constraints are alleviating.\nI think that that's just something that you see across the industry. Thank you, Harlan. We'll go to the next caller.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the decision. I mean, I understand the inventory is not going to be obsolete, but it's eventually going to kind of steal from your future ability to scale gross margins. So I mean, at the current run rate, you're kind of building at like a $23 billion run rate, and it's going to only increase next year. So what's the harm in pulling it back a bit? I'm just trying to understand the interim here, just pulling back utilizations and not building so much inventory.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nIn the big scheme of things, our goal here is to support revenue growth. It's not, frankly, to optimize short-term fluctuations in gross margins. Those are not irrelevant, of course, but it's just the focus is on supporting revenue growth in the short term, midterm, and long term. And inventory supports short-term to midterm fluctuations, right, that we can mitigate with having plenty of inventory. And the incremental cost of inventory is really low, as we talked about, on the obsolescence side, also on the variable cost nature of what goes into inventory. So it's just things that we keep in mind when trying to make those decisions.\n\nBlayne Curtis\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThen I just wanted to ask on gross margins. I mean, I know you don't give perfect color, but it seems like it's down at least 150 basis points sequentially. Maybe consumer's a mix. But I'm just kind of curious, is it just depreciation layering in, or is there any other puts and takes on gross margin?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nSo I assume you're talking about Q3. So yeah, our guidance, and as you pointed out, we only give top line and EPS, but our guidance, best estimate that we have in our gross margins—or I'm sorry, that guidance embeds the revenues flat in that particular case, and it embeds the resulting depreciation and other related costs from added capacity over time. On a year-on-year basis, I know you asked sequentially, but just a reminder, on a year-on-year basis, keep in mind that last year we had the Lehi acquisition fab cost in restructuring, and now it is in COR in cost of revenue as of December of last year, when it moved.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah, so year-on-year, think change in revenue: the increase in, or moving of, the cost from restructuring into most of that in the cost of revenue.\nAnd depreciation.\nAs well as depreciation. So thank you, Blayne. And we'll go to the next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to follow up on the previous one and ask about, we understand the depreciation flow through it. That is what it is. But could you maybe talk through some of the near to medium-term milestones when the 300-millimeter increased output could start to benefit gross margin and sort of help offset the depreciation headwinds? Thank you.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Just what I would tell you is depreciation; the way we depreciate equipment is over five years. Buildings is much longer. Usually, they average about 30 years or so. But consider that that equipment lasts a lot longer than five years, right? We have factories today that are running on 50 years plus. And some of that has that upgraded equipment. But broadly speaking, that equipment lasts for decades, not the five years where we depreciate it. So it's probably an unfair comparison to try to put the 300 benefit next to the depreciation and expect an offset in the short term. I would suggest you think of it from a cash standpoint. We're investing. That CapEx is cash. Forget about the depreciation. CapEx is where we're investing. That's going to enable growth by adding that internal capacity, which, as Dave alluded to earlier, that is geopolitically dependable capacity.\nWe're putting as many as four fabs in Sherman, two in Richardson, two in Lehi in Utah, and then assembly test facilities in Asia, primarily Malaysia, and Philippines, for example. So that's going to put us in a really great position to grow the top line for a long time. And then what happens there is that that yields a lot of operating cash for the company that then we can either redeploy or return to the owners of the company after those investments.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nDo you have a follow-on, Josh?\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nDirector of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, sure. Thank you. I recognize the language was similar last quarter regarding the end market commentary, but did anything change, get any better or worse intra-quarter? And in particular, personal electronics grew. You've talked in the past about it sort of being a Q4 cycle. Is it safe to say that that's sort of bottom now? Thank you.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. Again, I think that overall, we have continued to see that asynchronous behavior as we started back a year ago. And so that has continued. PE, again, we started to see weakness in Q2. So we've completed now. It actually grew first to second. So we've got several quarters of decline. It was up slightly sequentially. And again, we're not expecting much change in our end markets as we look forward, so. Okay. Thank you. And let's go to our last caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last caller comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYes, thank you. Good evening. I guess just following up on the last few questions, perhaps you could differentiate a little bit about where you think your customers are still burning through inventory as compared to end demand. And as you noted, the PE segment started to see weakness earlier. We heard from some others that it's no longer an inventory issue. It's more of a demand issue. Perhaps you could talk to that for some of your other end markets and where we could see incremental weakness if customers still need to bring down inventory further.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nSure. Yeah. Chris, I think if you look across the end markets broadly, you could say that all of them showed weakness, reflective of customers reducing inventories with the exception of automotive. Even inside of that, of course, if you look at industrial, all the sectors aren't identical, meaning you've had strength in aerospace, green infrastructure, and other sectors like that. And PE is the same way. Not all of the sectors were as weak or as strong as others. But broadly, you could say it was across each of those markets. Do you have a follow-on?\n\nChris Caso\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nI do. Thanks. And maybe with a follow-on, I'll hit on the segment that has remained strong, auto. And when this downturn began, I believe your commentary was that auto had remained stable then. You thought that eventually it would come to auto just because it always has in the past. So far, it hasn't. I think it surprised a lot of us, the resilience on that. Has your view changed about the resilience of the auto market? Do you still expect that that has to correct at some point? And if not, why do you think it's different?\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVP and Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments\n\nYeah. So it wouldn't surprise us if it corrected. I don't think anyone can declare certainty on those types of things in the future. But I think that customers will build inventory. I've got 37 years of experience in the industry now, and that's the way the markets have behaved in the past. So that's generally a good guide in the future, but I think you can't pound the table and make absolutes. But certainly, I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case. So with that, we'll hand it over to Rafael to wrap us up.\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nSVP and CFO, Texas Instruments\n\nThanks, Dave. Let me wrap up by emphasizing what we have said previously. At our core, we're engineers, and technology is the foundation of our company. But ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objectives, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners. We will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever-changing. And we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor. When we're successful, our employees, customers, communities, and owners all benefit. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir.\nThis call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website.\nThis call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.\nToday, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide some insight into first quarter's revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the second quarter of 2023.\nStarting with a quick overview of the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.4 billion, a decrease of 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 14%, Embedded Processing grew 6% and our Other segment declined 16% from the year ago quarter. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive.\nAs mentioned last quarter, a component of the weaker demand was inventory reductions by our customers, which we expect to continue in the second quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by market. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time.\nFirst, the industrial market was about flat. The automotive market was up mid-single digits. Personal electronics declined about 30% as we continued to see broad-based weakness. Next, communications equipment was down mid-teens. And finally, enterprise systems was down about 30%. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?\n\nRafael Lizardi\n\nVice President, Corporate Controller, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, down 11% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin decreased 480 basis points.\nOperating expenses in the quarter were $929 million, up 14% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.5 billion or 18% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter or 44% of revenue and was down 25% from a year ago quarter.\nNet income in the first quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guide.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $7.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenses were $982 million in the quarter and $3.3 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $4.4 billion.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $100 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.5 billion in the past 12 months.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with $9.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. In the quarter, we issued $1.4 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $10.2 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.2%. Inventory dollars were up $531 million from the prior quarter to $3.3 billion. And days were 195, up 38 days sequentially.\nFor the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.88. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nVice Present & Head of Investor Relations, Texas Instruments, Incorporated.\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?",

I'm Dave Pahl, head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi.\nFor any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website.\nThis call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.\nFirst, you likely saw last week, we announced that Haviv Ilan will become president and CEO on April 1 and that Rich Templeton will continue as our chairman. I'm sure you want to join me in congratulating both of them.\nSecondly, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. Next week on Thursday, February 2, at 10 a.m. Central time, we'll have our capital management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insights into our business and our approach to capital allocation. This will include an update of our 300-mm capacity expansion plans to support the increasing confidence that we have in our long-term growth.\nMoving on, today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. I'll then provide an annual summary of our revenue breakdown by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the first quarter of 2023.\nStarting with a quick overview: Revenue was $4.7 billion, a decrease of 11% sequentially and 3% from the same quarter a year ago. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. A component of the weaker demand was customers working to reduce their inventories. In the first quarter, we expect a weaker than seasonal decline with the exception of automotive, as we believe customers will continue to reduce inventory levels.\nTurning to our segments, fourth quarter Analog revenue declined 5% year over year and Embedded Processing grew 10%. Our \"Other\" segment declined 11% from the year-ago quarter.\nNow I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. I'll focus on sequential performance again this quarter, as it's more informative at this time.\nFirst, the industrial market was down about 10%.\nThe automotive market was up mid-single digits with strength in most sectors.\nPersonal electronics was down mid-teens with broad-based weakness.\nNext, communications equipment was down about 20%.\nAnd finally, enterprise systems was also down about 20%.\nLastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2022. We break our end markets into six categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The six end markets are industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators.\nAs a percentage of revenue for 2022, industrial was 40%; automotive about 25%; personal electronics, 20%; communications equipment, 7%; enterprise systems, 6%; and other was 2%.\nIn 2022, industrial and automotive combined made up 65% of TI's revenue, up about three percentage points from 2021 and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technologies to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets.\nRafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?\n\nRafael R. Lizardi\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs Dave mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4.7 billion.\nGross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion, or 66% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 320 basis points.\nOperating expenses in the quarter were $863 million, up 9% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.4 billion, or 17% of revenue.\nRestructuring charges were $48 million in the fourth quarter and were associated with the LFAB factory preproduction costs. As production started at the beginning of December, these costs then transitioned to cost of revenue, where they will be reflected moving forward. In addition, depreciation has begun on these assets.\nOperating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter, or 47% of revenue. Operating profit was down 13% from the year-ago quarter.\nNet income in the fourth quarter was $2 billion, or $2.13 per share. Earnings per share included an 11-cent benefit for items that were not in our original guidance.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.\nCash flow from operations was $2 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion, down 6% from a year ago.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $848 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. We also increased our dividend per share by 8% in the fourth quarter, marking our 19th year of dividend increases.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. In the quarter we issued $800 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.93%.\nInventory was up $353 million from the prior quarter to $2.8 billion, and days were 157, up 24 days sequentially.\nNext to summarize the benefits of the CHIPS Act, we accrued about $350 million on our balance sheet under long-term assets in fourth quarter, in addition to the $50 million accrued in the third quarter. These accruals are due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow through our income statement as lower depreciation, and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future.\nNow let's look at some of these results for the year.\nIn 2022, cash flow from operations was $8.7 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion, or 14% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2022 was $5.9 billion, or 30% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value.\nTurning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.90.\nWe now expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of IR & VP, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. (Operator Instructions) Operator?",

I'm Dave Pahl, head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi.\nFor any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded, and you'll be able to get it via replay on our website.\nThis call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description.\nToday, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third quarter's revenue results, with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022.\nStarting with a quick overview of the third quarter: Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $5.2 billion, an increase of 1% sequentially and 13% year over year. Analog revenue grew 13%. Embedded Processing grew 11%, and our \"Other\" segment grew 20% from the year-ago quarter.\nNow I'll provide some insight into third quarter revenue by market. This quarter, I'll focus on our sequential performance as it's more informative at this time.\nFirst, personal electronics declined mid-teens as we continued to see the weakness we described in the second quarter.\nIndustrial was about even sequentially as we saw weakness begin to broaden in the industrial market.\nThe automotive market remained strong and was about 10%.\nNext, communications equipment was up high-single digits.\nAnd finally, enterprise systems was up mid-single digits.\nTurning to our expectations for the fourth quarter we expect that most of our end markets will decline sequentially, with the exception of the automotive market.\nLastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February capital management call and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. Customers especially value the geopolitically dependable footprint of our manufacturing additions. We are now in production in RFAB2 and expect production in LFAB later this year. In addition, construction of SM1 and SM2 in Sherman, Texas, continues as planned.\nRafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.\n\nRafael R. Lizardi\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone.\nAs Dave mentioned, third quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion, or 69% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 110 basis points.\nOperating expenses in the quarter were $862 million, up 8% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.3 billion, or 16% of revenue.\nRestructuring charges were $77 million in the third quarter and are associated with the LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year. These charges will move to cost of revenue as we start production. The assets associated with the acquisition of the factory will begin to depreciate at the same time.\nMoving on, operating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter, or 51% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $2.3 billion, or $2.47 per share. Earnings per share included a 2-cent benefit for items that were not in our original guidance.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.\nCash flow from operations was $2.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $790 million in the quarter and $3.1 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1 billion of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.1 billion in the past 12 months. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 8%, marking our 19th consecutive year of dividend increases. We also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $15 billion. These actions reflect our commitment to return our free cash flow to our owners.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we issued $700 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.8%.\nInventory dollars were up $205 million from the prior quarter to $2.4 billion, and days were 133, up 8 days sequentially and below desired levels.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $2.11. This outlook comprehends the market conditions that Dave previously mentioned.\nWe continue to expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%. As you are looking at your models for 2023, without additional changes to tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain about what it is in 2022, with a similar quarterly profile.\nLet me now make a few comments on the CHIPS Act that was recently signed-in to law. The combination of the investment tax credit, the grant, as well as funding for research and development, will help make the U.S. semiconductor industry more competitive.\nWe accrued about $50 million on the balance sheet in third quarter due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow some statement as lower depreciation, and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions.\nWe will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow growth over the long-term.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of IR & VP, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Rafael.

And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the third quarter of 2022.\nStarting with a quick overview of the quarter: Revenue in the quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 6% sequentially and 14% year-over-year, driven by growth across markets. Analog revenue grew 15%. Embedded Processing grew 5%, and our \"Other\" segment grew 19% from the year-ago quarter.\nNow let me comment on the environment in the second quarter to provide some context of what we saw with our customers and markets. As we spoke about in our last earnings call, April started out weak from COVID-19 restrictions in China. As those restrictions began to ease towards the latter part of May and into June, customers began to pull product generally consistent with their prior demand forecast at the start of the quarter.\nMoving on, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by market from the year-ago quarter. First, the industrial market was up high-single digits, and the automotive market was up more than 20%. We saw weakness throughout the quarter in personal electronics, which grew low-single digits. Next, communications equipment was up about 25%. And finally, enterprise systems was up mid-teens.\nRafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.\n\nRafael R. Lizardi\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion, or 70% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 240 basis points.\nOperating expenses in the quarter were $836 million, up 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.2 billion, or 17% of revenue.\nRestructuring charges were $66 million in the second quarter and are associated with the LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year.\nOperating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter, or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 23% from the year-ago quarter.\nNet income in the second quarter was $2.3 billion, or $2.45 per share.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and $2.8 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock. In total, we have returned $6.2 billion in the past 12 months.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. We retired half a billion dollars of debt in the quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.7%.\nInventory dollars were up $139 million from the prior quarter to $2.2 billion. And days were 125, down two days sequentially and below desired levels.\nAccounts receivable for this quarter ended at $2.2 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago. This increase primarily reflects the higher proportion of shipments made near the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in China and customers began pulling product.\nFor the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.3 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $2.23 to $2.51. This outlook comprehends the weaker demand we see, particularly from customers in the personal electronics market. We expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%.\nLastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February capital management call and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. We broke ground on the Sherman manufacturing complex in May, and work continues at RFAB2 and LFAB to prepare for production output.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Dave.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of IR & VP, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Rafael.

Revenue in the quarter was $4.9 billion, an increase of 2% sequentially and 14% year over year, driven by growth in industrial and automotive, as well as enterprise systems. Analog revenue grew 16%, Embedded Processing grew 2%, and our \"Other\" segment grew 27% from the year-ago quarter.\nNow let me comment on the environment in the first quarter to provide some context on what we saw with our customers and markets. Overall, the quarter came in about as we expected across product segments, end markets and geographies.\nThe market environment in the first quarter was similar to what we've observed for the last several quarters. Customers continued to be selective in their expedite requests, focusing on products that completed a \"matched set\" rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior was not specific to any product family, end market or geography.\nMoving on, I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by end market from the year ago quarter. First, the industrial and automotive markets were each up about 20% and both were driven by broad-based growth across sectors. Personal electronics was down mid-single digits off a strong compare. And next, communications equipment was up about 10%. And finally, enterprise systems was up about 35% off of a weak compare, and the growth was primarily from data centers and enterprise computing.\nRafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?\n\nRafael R. Lizardi\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.4 billion, or 70% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 500 basis points. As a reminder, we had about $50 million of additional utility expenses in cost of revenue related to the winter storm in the year-ago quarter.\nOperating expenses in the quarter were $813 million, about flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.2 billion, or 17% of revenue.\nRestructuring charges were $66 million in the first quarter and are associated with the LFAB purchase we closed in October of last year.\nOperating profit was $2.6 billion in the quarter, or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 32% from the year-ago quarter.\nNet income in the first quarter was $2.2 billion, or $2.35 per share, which included a 2-cent benefit that was not in our prior outlook.\nLet me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $443 million in the quarter and $2.6 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.5 billion.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $589 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $5 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow.\nOur balance sheet remains strong, with $9.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.8 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%.\nInventory dollars were up $150 million from the prior quarter, to $2.1 billion, and days were 127, up 11 days sequentially but still below desired levels.\nFor the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.84 to $2.26. This outlook comprehends an impact due to reduced demand from COVID-19 restrictions in China which are affecting our customers' manufacturing operations.\nWe continue to expect our annual operating tax rate for 2022 to be about 14% and our effective tax rate to be about a point lower.\nIn closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDave Pahl\n\nHead of IR & VP, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and 2021 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web.\nThis call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description.\nFirst, let me provide some information that's important for your calendars. We plan to hold a call for our capital management update on February 3 at 10 a.m. Central Time. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and our approach to capital allocation.\nFor today's call, let me summarize what Rafael and I will be reviewing. I'll start with fourth quarter revenue results, including some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. I'll then provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, some insights into onetime items and our guidance for first quarter 2022.\nStarting with fourth quarter results and the market environment. The company's revenue grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in the industrial and automotive markets. Analog revenue grew 20% year-over-year, and Embedded Processing grew 6%. our Other segment grew 35% from the year-ago quarter. Let me now comment on the current environment to provide some context of what we're seeing with our customers and markets.\nOverall, the quarter came in stronger than we expected. The strength was across most product families, end markets and geographies. The market environment is similar to what we reported 90 days ago. Lead times for the majority of our products remained stable, but hotspots continue to exist. However, customers continue to be selective in their expedite requests, increasingly focusing on products that complete a matched set rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior is not specific to any product family end market or geography. Discussions with customers confirm a high level of interest in our commitment to expanding our internal manufacturing capacity road map, including 300-millimeter wafer fabs; RFAB 2 and LFAB; our recently announced plans for a multi-fab site in Sherman, Texas; and the associated assembly test expansions. These investments, to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, will provide lower cost and greater control of our supply chain. And while there is a growing recognition that the near-term supply/demand imbalance will end at some point, the secular growth of semiconductor content per system will continue to increase, and this requires a robust manufacturing capacity road map for 2025 and beyond.\nMoving on, I'll now provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market for the year-ago quarter. First, the industrial market was up about 40%, driven by broad-based strength across all sectors. The automotive market was up high single digits with strength in most sectors. Personal electronics was down upper single digits, off a strong compare from a year ago. Next, communications equipment was up about 25%. Finally, Enterprise Systems was up about 50% off a weak compare from a year ago, driven primarily by data center and enterprise computing. And lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2021.\nWe break our end markets into 6 categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The 6 end markets are: industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for the year, industrial was 41%; automotive, 21%; personal electronics, 24%; Communications Equipment, 6%; Enterprise Systems, 6%; and Other was 2%. In 2021, industrial and automotive combined made up 62% of TI's revenue, up about 5 percentage points from 2020 and up from 42% from 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are [easingly] turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content for application, which will drive faster growth compared to the other markets.\nRafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?\n\nRafael R. Lizardi\n\nCFO and Senior VP of Finance & Operations, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.4 billion or 69% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased, primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 440 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $793 million, up 1% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were 18% of revenue. For the year, we have invested $1.6 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. We are pleased with our disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow our top line over the long term.\nRestructuring charges were $54 million in the quarter. This expense is driven by the Lehi wafer fab purchase we closed in October. Operating profit was $2.5 billion or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 38% from the year-ago quarter.\nNet income in the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion or $2.27 per share, which included a $0.04 cost that was not in our prior outlook, primarily due to the purchase I discussed earlier. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation.\nCash flow from operations was $2.4 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion in the quarter, which included about $900 million for the LFAB purchase. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.3 billion, up 15% from a year ago.\nIn the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends. We have increased our dividend per share by 13%, marking our 18th year of dividend increases. For the year, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with $9.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%. Inventory days were 116, up 4 days sequentially and remained below these higher levels. Now let's look at some of these results for the year.\nIn 2021, cash flow from operations was $8.8 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion or 13% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2021 was $6.3 billion or 34% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value.\nTurning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TI revenue in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion and earnings per share in the range of $2.01 to $2.29. We expect our 2022 annual operating tax rate to continue to be above 14% and our effective tax rate about 1 percentage point lower than that. This is based on current tax law and would be about the same as we saw in 2021.\nNext, let me help you model our expectation for expenses for the LFAB purchase. As we have said, we expect to have about $75 million of cost per quarter until we start production, which is still expected in early 2023. These costs continue to be mostly reflected in the restructuring line on the P&L, so it will be visible each quarter to you and therefore, part of our operating profit results. Once the facility begins production, this cost will move and be primarily reflected in cost of revenue.\nAs I close, let me explain why we're so excited about this capacity investments as they strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage. First, we have significant 300-millimeter capacity coming online with RFAB 2 and LFAB in 2022 and 2023.

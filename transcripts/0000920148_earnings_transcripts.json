More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Christin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2025 financial results and progress on our strategy. During the quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth and margin improvement, leading to double-digit EPS growth. Our financial results reflect continued momentum in our Diagnostic Laboratories and Central Laboratory businesses.\nAt an Enterprise level, revenue increased to $3.6 billion representing 9% growth compared to last year. Margin for the quarter improved 100 basis points, driven by Diagnostics. Adjusted EPS grew 19% and we generated strong free cash flow of $281 million.\nMoving to our business segments. Diagnostics revenue increased 8.5% primarily due to strong organic growth of 6%. Margin improved 110 basis points, driven by strong organic demand and Invitae. Invitae was accretive in the quarter, and will be slightly accretive for the full year. BLS revenue increased 8% or 5% constant currency. Central Laboratories growth was strong at 10% or 7% constant currency, more than offsetting softness in early development. BLS margin grew 20 basis points and the quarterly book-to-bill was 0.9 with the trailing 12 months remaining strong at 1.09.\nIn response to the lower-than-anticipated revenue in early development, we are beginning to divest our restructure through site consolidation approximately $50 million of annual revenue. We will focus these actions on noncore areas, which will result in a more streamlined business and slight improvement to operating income. Julia will provide more details on our results and full year 2025 outlook in just a moment. We continue to make progress on our strategy to be the partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories to lead in high-growth therapeutic areas and to use science and technology to accelerate growth, to enhance the customer experience and to improve operational efficiency across our business.\nStarting with health systems and regional local laboratories, we've added a significant number of strong strategic relationships over the past several years. Through these partnerships and acquisitions, we've expanded our patient provider network, and we strengthened our presence in key markets. These partnerships have increased access to our broadcast menu. They've improved patient care and have driven efficiencies for our customers.\nThis quarter, we signed an agreement to acquire Select Pinnacle Laboratory Assets of Empire City laboratories, which serves the New York Tristate area. We signed an agreement to acquire Select Assets of Laboratory Alliance of Central New York, a pathology reference laboratory. In parallel, we signed an agreement with Cross Health to manage their inpatient labs. We expect these transactions to close in the first quarter of 2026. We continue to make progress on the acquisition of select assets of the outreach business from community health systems across 13 states, which we expect to close by year-end. We completed our acquisition of select oncology and clinical testing assets from BioReference Health. This acquisition further solidifies Labcorp's position as an industry leader in oncology. We continue to have a very robust pipeline of opportunities, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.\nAdditionally, we are expanding our business in high-growth specialty areas, including oncology, women's health, neurology and autoimmune diseases. These are areas where science, clinical need, the use of genetic testing and innovation are accelerating. We are experiencing strong growth across these segments, which also increases demand in our core test menu as physicians rely on Labcorp for comprehensive diagnostic solutions. In the quarter, we introduced several innovative tests and capabilities. We expanded our leading oncology and genetic testing portfolio. OmniSeq INSIGHT, our comprehensive genomic profiling test for solid tumors in support of therapy selection now evaluates ovarian tumors for HRD. PGDx elio tissue complete used for therapy selection for pan solid tumors became the first and remains the only tissue-based tumor profiling test with CE Marking under the European Union's in vitro diagnostic regulation. This enhances our global tissue profiling capabilities in support of clinical trials.\nGeneoscopy received FDA approval for a simplified ad home collection method for [indiscernible], for colorectal cancer screening. As a commercial partner, we will be expanding access to this test to patients and providers. We also expanded access to our Invitae genetic cast through [ Epic ], enabling streamlined ordering and results delivery for [ Epic ] customers.\nIn neurology, where we have one of the most comprehensive test menus in the industry, we expanded our leadership position. We introduced the first blood-based test cleared by the FDA to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in specialty care settings. In early 2026, we're planning to offer the only FDA-cleared blood test to rule out Alzheimer's-related amyloid pathology in the primary care setting. Separately, we continue to experience strong momentum in our consumer business.\nIn the quarter, we launched several consumer-initiated tests through Labcorp OnDemand, including test for lead exposure, [ ApoB ] for heart health, and a panel for healthy aging. Labcorp partnered were [ ProHealth ], a consumer experience platform for health systems to help close care gaps and to deliver better experiences for patients.\nMoving now to review our use of science and technology to accelerate growth, to enhance the customer experience and to improve operational efficiency. This quarter, we launched Labcorp Test finder, a generative AI tool developed with Amazon Web Services to improve test selection for providers and health systems. It allows clinicians to easily search for lab tests using plain language, streamlining decision-making and improved care. In our core laboratory operations, we're investing in digital and AI capabilities to improve in areas such as pathology, psychology and microbiology. Through a collaboration with Roche, we have digitalizing pathology workflows using slide scanners to enhance diagnostic speed and scalability. We've also deployed a new FDA-cleared AI platform for digital psychology that enables remote viewing and rapid analysis of cell-based samples, improving turnaround times.\nFinally, we're using AI and automation to accelerate microbiology workflows to reduce turnaround times. These are just a few examples where we are using technology, robotics and AI. We look forward to discussing others in the future.\nIn summary, we delivered a strong quarter and made meaningful progress on our strategy. We have momentum as we finish 2025 and move into 2026. Our focus remains in driving value for both our customers and shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Julia to discuss our financial results and 2025 outlook in greater detail.\n\nJulia A. Wang\n\nCFO & Executive VP\n\nThank you, Adam. Now let me start with a review of our Q3 financials. And my remarks today will focus on our adjusted financial results. Please see our earnings press release and supplemental financial presentation for detail on our [ DAS ] results. Revenue for the quarter was $3.6 million, an increase of 8.6% compared to last year, driven by organic growth of 6.2%, the impact from acquisitions of 1.7% and foreign currency translation of 0.7%.\nAdjusted operating income in the quarter was $513 million, or 14.4% of revenue compared to $441 million or 13.4% of revenue last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and operating margin was primarily driven by organic demand, including the strong performance of Invitae. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track in the quarter which offset typical increases in personnel costs.\nThe adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% compared to 22.8% last year. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for full year 2025 to be approximately 23%. Adjusted EPS was $4.18 in the quarter, up 19% from last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $281 million compared to $162 million last year. The $119 million increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher cash earnings. For the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue.\nDuring the quarter, the company invested $268 million in acquisitions and partnerships, paid out [ $16 ] million in dividends and repurchased $25 million of stock. At quarter end, we had $598 million in cash, while total debt was $5.6 billion. Our debt leverage as of quarter end was 2.4x, gross debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA and slightly under the low end of our targeted leverage range of 2.5x to 3x.\nNow I will review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, an increase of 8.5% compared to last year with organic growth of 6.3% and acquisitions of 2.2%. Total volume increased 4.7% compared to last year, with organic volume contributing 3.5% as we continued to execute our strategy and start of strong demand. Acquisitions contributed 1.2%. Price/mix increased 3.7% versus last year. Organic price mix was 2.8% as we benefited from mix, primarily due to the annualization of Invitae as well as an increase in [indiscernible]. Acquisitions contributed 1%. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was [ $460 ] million or 16.3% of revenue compared to $387 million or [ 15.2% ] of revenue last year. Adjusted operating margin was up 110 basis points. Adjusted operating income and operating margin increased, primarily driven by organic demand, including the strong performance of Invitae, coupled with high salability from weather year-over-year.\nNow I will review the segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services, or BLS. Revenue for the quarter was $799 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 5.3% and foreign currency translation of 3%. We continue to perform well in Central Lab. In constant currency, Central Labs revenue was up 7% in the quarter. Early Development revenue was up 1.1% lower than expected due to delayed study starts. In response to the lower than anticipated revenue in Early Development, we are beginning to divest our restructure through site consolidation, impacting approximately [ $50 ] million in annual revenue in noncore areas. We expect this absence to result in a more streamlined business with a slight improvement in operating income.\nBLS adjusted opening income for the quarter was $132 million or 16.5% of revenue compared to $121 million or 16.4% of revenue last year. Adjusted operating income grew 9% year-over-year, driven by organic demand. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $8.6 million, and we expect approximately $2.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Our segment quarterly book-to-bill was 0.89. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill remains strong at 1.09.\nNow I will discuss our updated 2025 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2025, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, utilizing free cash flow for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.\nBeginning with the segment. Diagnostics continues to execute well in the marketplace. We have maintained the midpoint [ worst-care ] guidance and narrowed the growth range to 7.2% to 7.8%, which assumes approximately 4.5% organic revenue growth. In BLS, we expect to grow 5.7% to 7.1% versus prior year. We have lowered the midpoint by 40 basis points versus prior guidance due to the unfavorable impact of currency. In constant currency, we have maintained the midpoint [indiscernible] prior guidance as strength in Central Lab is offsetting softness in early development. We continue to expect the Central Lab to grow in the mid-single digits for the full year. We now expect early development to grow low single digits for the full year with Q4 presenting the most challenging year-over-year comparison.\nWe updated the 2025 enterprise revenue growth guidance range to 7.4% to 8%. We lowered the midpoint by 40 basis points due to timing of acquisition revenue, which are held at the enterprise and the unfavorable impact from currency. We continue to expect full year enterprise margins to increase with margins improving in both Diagnostics and BLS in 2025 versus 2024. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is [ $16.15 to $16.50 ] with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of 12%. As compared to prior guidance, we have narrowed the range and raised the midpoint by approximately $0.05. Our free cash flow by this range is $1.165 billion to $1.285 billion. We narrowed the rent and raised the midpoint by $25 million versus prior guidance, given our strong cash flow generation year-to-date.\nIn closing, our quarterly performance reflects strong execution of strategy and the continued efforts of our teams across the organization. As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you in the coming quarters.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Christin, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today to discuss our second quarter financial results and progress on our strategy.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered double-digit top line growth and solid margin expansion. Our financial results reflect continued strength of our Diagnostics Laboratories business and momentum in our Biopharma Laboratory Services business. Enterprise revenue reached $3.5 billion, representing 10% growth versus last year.\nDiagnostics revenue grew 9%, reaching $2.7 billion, driven equally by organic growth and acquisitions. Margin improved slightly, including the impact of Invitae. And Invitae continues to perform very well and remains on track.\nBLS delivered strong revenue performance and grew 11% or 8% constant currency to $785 million, while margins improved 50 basis points. Central Laboratories grew 8% or 4% constant currency and early development grew 20% or 18% constant currency. Importantly, the quarterly book-to-bill was strong at 1.18, with a trailing 12-month of 1.11.\nEnterprise margin improved 20 basis points and adjusted earnings per share of $4.35 grew 10% year-over-year. Based upon our performance year-to-date and our expectations for the second half of the year, we are raising our enterprise guidance. Julia will provide more details on our results and full year 2025 outlook in just a moment. But first, I'll highlight how our strategy is continuing to enable our growth and our leadership in the industry.\nFirst, in our Diagnostics Laboratories segment, one of our objectives is to be the partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. By focusing on these customers, we've expanded our presence in hospitals. We've strengthened customer relationships and we've brought in patient access in key geographies, which helps improve patient outcomes and also accelerate growth.\nThrough technology solutions, such as Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant, we've been able to provide data and analytics and important insights to our customers. Many of these customers are thought leaders in specialty areas and our collaboration with them mutually benefits our collective scientific expertise.\nIn the quarter, we announced acquisitions and partnerships with several health systems and regional local laboratories, including acquiring key clinical and [ ancomic ] pathology assets from Incyte Diagnostics in the Pacific Northwest.\nExtending our long-term agreement with UHealth, the University of Miami Health System, to serve as their preferred laboratory partner, progressing our acquisition of select oncology and clinical testing assets for BioReference health. The transaction is on track to close in the second half of 2025.\nAnd subsequent to quarter end, we announced an agreement to acquire select assets of the outreach business from community health systems across 13 states. CHS is one of the largest health care companies in the United States. Looking ahead, we have a strong deal pipeline, and we look forward to sharing our progress in the coming quarters.\nSecond, we continue to launch new and innovative tests in our specialty focus areas, including oncology, women's health, neurology and autoimmune diseases. This focus has helped to accelerate our growth in those categories as well as across our core testing portfolio as physicians utilize our broad test menu to meet the comprehensive needs of these patients.\nWe have leading expertise, both scientifically and in the marketplace in these areas, which also complements our BLS business. We partnered with many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as they develop novel therapeutics as well as products which require companion diagnostics.\nIn the second quarter, we made important progress, launching innovative tests in specialty areas and introducing new capabilities to our customers. We expanded our oncology portfolio with new solutions for cancer detection, diagnosis and monitoring. Key launches include expansion of our MRD portfolio through Labcorp's Plasma Detect, a liquid biopsy test that assesses colon cancer recurrence risk, and [ PGDx elio ] Plasma Focus Dx, the first and only FDA-authorized pan-solid tumor liquid biopsy test for targeted treatment guidance.\nWe continue to advance our leading position in Alzheimer's disease and plan to offer Fujirebio's FDA-cleared biomarker test that aids in diagnosing the disease in the coming weeks.\nWe also expanded our consumer offerings. We launched several consumer-initiated tests to Labcorp on-demand, including tests that measure an individual's cortisol and [indiscernible] levels. We also introduced a new and improved [ OVA ] app, providing women with a single platform to support their health journey.\nWe introduced Labcorp Whole Health Solutions for functional medicine, integrative medicine and primary care practices. The solution offers specialized test panels and a test menu of more than 1,000 scientifically got biomarkers for cardiometabolic health, hormones, micronutrients, longevity and wellness.\nFinally, our Central Laboratory business added digital pathology capabilities, including advanced image scanning to preserve critical sample data and AI-powered solutions to provide analysis on large data sets instantly. These enhancements complement our existing global anatomic pathology capabilities, our full-service tissue-based testing and our companion diagnostic development across cancer, mass and other diseases.\nAnd third, we are focused on enhancing customer and employee experiences and leveraging technology to drive ongoing operational and process efficiencies. We're using digital technologies and AI to drive improvements in areas such as Net Promoter Score, our LaunchPad initiatives and margins. We expect to see continued benefits as we incorporate technology across our business.\nTo summarize, we delivered very strong results in the quarter and continued to make significant progress on our strategy. We remain committed to delivering sustained value to our customers, our employees and our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Julia to discuss our financial results and 2025 outlook in further detail.\n\nJulia A. Wang\n\nCFO & Executive VP\n\nThank you, Adam. As Adam just shared in the opening remarks, we delivered strong underlying performance from both segments in the quarter as we have continued to win in the marketplace and execute against our strategy. The strong quarter, combined with favorable foreign exchange rate, enables us to raise our full year guidance.\nNow let me start with a review of our Q2 financials. Revenue for the quarter was $3.5 million, an increase of 9.5% compared to last year, driven by organic growth of 5.4%, the impact from acquisitions of 3.5% and foreign currency translation of 0.6%. Operating income for the quarter was $395 million or 11.2% of revenue, which is 15.1% on an adjusted basis.\nDuring the quarter, we had $69 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and nonpatent initiatives. Excluding these items and amortization of [ $68 million ], adjusted operating income in the quarter was $532 million or 15.1% of revenue compared to $480 million or 14.9% of revenue last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was due to organic demand as we leveraged well on our revenue growth. Our LaunchPad initiatives continues to be on track in the quarter, which offset typical increases in personnel costs. Despite a 30 basis point headwind from Invitae, adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points.\nThe adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.1% compared to 23% last year. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for full year 2025 to be approximately 23%. Net earnings for the quarter were $238 million or $2.84 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS was $4.35 in the quarter, up 10.4% from last year as we leveraged well our revenue growth. Operating cash flow was $621 million in the quarter compared to $561 million a year ago. Capital expenditures totaled $78 million in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx expenditures to be approximately 3.8% of revenue.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $543 million compared to $433 million last year. This $110 million increase in free cash flow was driven by higher earnings and the timing of capital expenditures. During the quarter, the company invested $25 million in acquisitions and partnerships, paid out $16 million in dividends and repurchased $200 million of stock.\nAt quarter end, we had $647 million in cash, while total debt was $5.6 billion. Our debt leverage as of quarter end was 2.5x gross debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the low end of our targeted leverage range of 2.5x to 3x.\nNow I will review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.7 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year, with organic growth of 4.5% and acquisitions of 4.5%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.1%. Total volume increased 4.9% compared to last year, with organic volume contributing 3.4% as we continued to execute our strategy and drive strong demand. Acquisitions contributed 1.5%.\nPrice/mix increased 4% versus last year due to organic growth of 1.1% and acquisitions of 3%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.1%. Organic price/mix was up due to [indiscernible] as we benefited from an increase in tax procession and lab management agreements. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $483 million or 17.6% of revenue compared to $442 million or 17.5% of revenue last year. Adjusted operating margin was up 10 basis points.\nWe continue to be pleased with the progress we are making in Invitae, which will annualize next quarter. Invitae remains on track to achieve 10% revenue growth and to be slightly accretive for full year 2025. Excluding the impact of Invitae, margins would have been up approximately 50 basis points.\nNow I will review the segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services of BLS. Revenue for the quarter was $785 million, an increase of 11% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 7.8% and foreign currency translation of 3.2%.\nIn constant currency, Central Labs revenue was up approximately 4%, while early development was up approximately 18%. The growth in early development was primarily driven by a relatively easy compared to prior year as well as timing of study starts. We still expect both businesses to grow in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis for the full year, with early development facing more challenging year-over-year comparisons particularly in the fourth quarter.\nBLS adjusted operating income for the quarter was $123 million or 15.7% of revenue compared to $107 million or 15.2% of revenue last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased, primarily driven by organic demand and [indiscernible] efficiencies.\nWe ended the quarter with a backlog of $8.7 billion, and we expect approximately $2.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nOur segment quarterly book-to-bill was strong at 1.18, bringing the trailing 12-month book-to-bill to 1.11. The [indiscernible] was driven by several large star deal awards in Central Labs.\nNow I will discuss our updated 2025 full year guidance, which assume foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2025, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, utilizing free cash flow for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Our guidance has taken into account various scenarios as the macro and regulatory landscape continues to evolve.\nWe are raising guidance for enterprise revenue, adjusted EPS and free cash flow, primarily driven by currency as well as the underlying strength of our businesses. We raised the 2025 enterprise revenue guidance by [ 70 ] basis points at the midpoint and narrowed the growth range to 7.5% to 8.6% when compared to 2024.\nDiagnostics continues to execute well in the marketplace. We raised Diagnostics revenue guidance by 40 basis points at the midpoint and narrowed the growth range to 7% to 8%.\nIn BLS, we increased the midpoint by 280 basis points due to the favorable impact of foreign currency, and narrowed the growth range to 6.1% to 7.5%.\nWe continue to expect full year enterprise margins to increase, with margins improving in both Diagnostics and BLS in 2025 versus 2024. For Diagnostics, we expect margin expansion in the second half of the year versus prior year. For BLS, we expect margins to be stronger in second half than first half, albeit overlapping a stronger prior year comparison.\nOur guidance range for adjusted EPS is $16.05 to $16.50, with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of 12%. As compared to our prior guidance, we have narrowed the range and raised the midpoint by approximately $0.23, benefiting from both currency and strengthening our underlying businesses.\nOur free cash flow guidance range is $1.125 million to $1.275 million. We raised the midpoint by $25 million versus prior guidance. And due to normal seasonality, we expect to generate the majority of free cash flow in the second half of the year.\nIn closing, we continue to be encouraged by the strong performance across both business segments this quarter. The results reflect the effective execution of our strategy, the resilience of our operations and the dedication of our teams across the organization. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

We have no obligation to provide any updates to these working statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Christin, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today to discuss our First Quarter 2025 financial results and progress towards advancing our strategic priorities. Performance in the first quarter was solid with 5% revenue growth or 6% on a constant currency basis across the enterprise. The performance was driven by 6% growth in our Diagnostics Laboratories business where there was a strong rebound in volume in March after impact from weather in January and February. Our strong managed care access and our payer contracts continue to serve us well in the marketplace.\nAdjusting for Invitae and weather, the margin in the Diagnostics business improved 50 basis points. Invitae continues to perform very well and remains on track to achieve 10% revenue growth and to be slightly accretive to earnings for the full year.\nOur Biopharma Laboratory Services segment grew 3%, excluding currency. Margin for BLS was strong, improving 80 basis points and the quarter book-to-bill was also strong at 1.13 with a trailing 12-month of 1.07. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.84 were up 4% year-over-year. It is certainly a very dynamic environment, and our team is closely evaluating the ongoing shifts in the macroeconomic and regulatory landscapes. We are pleased with the outcome of the court's decision and the challenge of the LVT rule. We believe in the best interest of bringing new innovative tests to patients as quickly as possible. We are also contingency planning for various tariffs and regulatory scenarios. We have developed duplicative, flexible supply chains, and we are in communications with our customers and suppliers.\nWhile we do anticipate some impact, our guidance range includes what we believe to be the most likely scenarios at this time. The essential nature of our work has enabled us to be successful through many different economic cycles over time, and we will continue to focus on serving the needs of our customers and driving growth, all while delivering value for shareholders, as we advance our mission to improve health and to improve lives.\nBased upon our performance and outlook, we have reaffirmed our revenue and free cash flow guidance while increasing the midpoint of our EPS guidance by $0.05 per share, with an implied growth at the midpoint of approximately 10% for the year. We also continue to expect margin expansion in each segment for the full year. Julia will provide more details on our results and the 2025 outlook in just a moment. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities, a big partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories by launching new tests in important high-growth therapeutic areas by harnessing science, innovation and advanced technology to bring valuable services and capabilities to our customers while improving operational efficiency.\nIn the first quarter, Labcorp became the partner of choice for several health systems and regional local labs. These partnerships enable us to accelerate growth and to expand into important geographies and therapeutic areas. In January, we announced a strategic collaboration with New Jersey-based Inspira Health to manage the operations of the health systems hospital laboratories and to serve as the primary lab for the physician network. In March, we announced an agreement to acquire select assets of Bioreference Health, oncology and related clinical testing services. This transaction will extend our leadership in oncology. We also completed the acquisition of select assets of North Mississippi Health Services, Ambulatory Outreach Laboratory business and we became a referral lab for its 7 hospitals and clinical laboratories. Looking ahead, we have a strong business development pipeline, and we look forward to sharing additional growth opportunities with you in the coming quarters.\nWe also continue to incorporate the power of science of innovation and advanced technology across the organization. We are focused on bringing new tests into four strategic areas: oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease and neurology. These areas have significant unmet needs for patients and are expected to grow up to 3x faster than other therapeutic areas and they are proving to do so. Having the latest innovative test in these areas enables us to successfully capture more volume across testing for those patients.\nFor example, in the quarter, we introduced Labcorp Plasma complete, a groundbreaking liquid biopsy test to aid in personalized cancer treatment decisions. This advancement significantly expands Labcorp's extensive ecology portfolio. We made significant strides, bringing Invitae's genetic testing solutions to our customers by launching patient affordability and access tools by introducing 2 additional genetic risk panel tests. Labcorp OnDemand launched several new consumer initiatives tests including electrolytes, GGT, hepatitis A and total testosterone for women.\nSubsequent to the quarter, we introduced HPV and STI self-collection options in Labcorp patient service centers and physician offices. These solutions help overcome barriers to a single health screening by providing convenient private testing options. And in April, we launched our [ PTA beta ] amyloid ratio test, a powerful new blood-based biomarker test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This first of its kind immunoassay further expands our leading portfolio for Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Launching test in these important areas will enable us to outpace the growth in the overall market over time.\nWe're also using AI and technology to enhance our customer experience and to bring forward new operational efficiencies to improve our margins. For example, earlier this month, Labcorp received a modern health care 2025 Innovators Award for Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant, a digital solution integrated into electronic health records that supports providers with real-time access to comprehensive laboratory data, instants and self-service capabilities. This award recognizes us as a leader in driving innovation that improved care and achieves measurable results. We also launched eClaim Assist a next-generation digital platform that introduces smarter workflows to improve efficiencies in billing, payer alignment and denials. We will continue to find operational efficiencies and through technology in all aspects of our business. Lastly, we released the Labcorp Corporate Responsibility Report which highlights our significant progress in key areas such as reduced water withdrawal and improved fuel efficiency. We invite you to review the report on our Investor Relations website.\nIn summary, our business continues to perform well, and we are making strong progress against our strategy. We believe that Labcorp will continue to be successful and will lead the way with our relentless focus on science, innovation and advanced technology. We remain committed to providing value to our customers and our shareholders alike.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Julia.\n\nJulia A. Wang\n\nCFO & Executive VP\n\nThank you, Adam. Let me start with a review of our Q1 financials. Revenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of 5.3% compared to last year, driven by organic growth of 2.1% and the impact from net acquisitions of 3.7%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.5%. Operating income for the quarter was $326 million or 9.7% of revenue which is 14% on an adjusted basis. During the quarter, we had $73 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad savings. Excluding these items and amortization of $17 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $469 million or 14% of revenue compared to $453 million or 14.3% of revenue last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. The 20 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin included headwinds from Invitae and the weather, excluding which enterprise margins would have been up 60 basis points.\nThe adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.5% compared to 23% last year. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate for full year 2025 to be approximately 23%. Net earnings for the quarter were $213 million, or $2.62 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.84 in the quarter, up 4% from last year. Operating cash flow was $19 million in the quarter compared to a use of [ $13 ] million a year ago. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to the timing of working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $126 million in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect cash flow expenditures to be approximately 3.8% revenue. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of [ $180 ] million compared to a use of $164 million last year. The first quarter is typically the company's lowest quarter for free cash flow. We continue to expect free cash flow for the full year to be $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion.\nDuring the quarter, the company invested $211 million in acquisitions and partnerships and paid out $62 million in dividends. At quarter end, we had $369 million in cash, while total debt was $5.6 billion. Our debt leverage as of quarter end was 2.5x, gross debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at the low end of our targeted leverage of 2.5x to 3x.\nNow I will review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 6% compared to last year, with organic growth of 1.6% and net acquisitions of 4.7%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.3%. Organic growth was impacted by approximately 190 basis points from weather and 1 fewer revenue days, which is timing related within the year. Total volume increased 3% compared to last year as organic volume contributed 0.9%, while acquisitions net of divestitures contributed 2.1%. Organic volume also includes the negative impact from weather and 1 fewer revenue day.\nPrice/mix increased 3% versus last year due to organic growth of 0.7% and acquisitions net of divestitures of 2.6%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.3%. Organic price/mix was up due to mix as we benefited from an increase in test per accession and lab management agreement. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $428 million, or 16.3% of revenue compared to $418 million or 16.9% of revenue last year. Adjusted operating margin was down 60 basis points due to Invitae and weather. Excluding these items, adjusted operating margin would have been up approximately 50 basis points. As the benefit of organic demand and LaunchPad savings was partially offset by higher personnel costs. Invitae remains on track to be slightly accretive for full year 2025.\nNow I will review the segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services or BLS. Revenue for the quarter was $721 million, an increase of 1.5% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 2.6%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 1.1%. Excluding currency, early development revenue growth was approximately 5%, while Central Labs revenue growth was approximately 2%. As expected, the Central Labs growth rate was low in Q1 2025 as we had a large amount of COVID vaccine and therapeutic revenue in Q1 of 2024. Our segment quarterly book-to-bill was strong at 1.13, bringing the trailing 12-month book-to-bill to 1.07.\nBLS adjusted opening income for the quarter was $107 million or 14.8% of revenue compared to $100 million or 14.1% of revenue last year. Adjusted operating income margin increased due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $8.2 billion, and we expect approximately $2.6 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nNow I will discuss our updated 2025 to full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effected as of March 31, 2025, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance only includes the impact from [ current and paid ] capital allocation, utilizing free cash flow for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We are operating in a dynamic macro environment, and there are a series of regulatory developments that we continue to monitor closely. Our guidance has taken into account various scenarios of the ever-changing tariff and regulatory landscape.\nBased on what we believe to be the most likely scenario at this time and the resilience of our businesses, we are reaffirming our enterprise revenue and free cash flow guidance while raising the midpoint of adjusted EPS. Enterprise revenue growth guidance remains 6.7% to 8% compared to 2024. Diagnostics continues to perform well. Consistent with prior guidance, we expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 6.5% to 7.7% compared to 2024. We still expect BLS revenue to grow 3% to 5% compared to 2024. This includes the negative impact of 30 basis points from foreign currency. Prior guidance included a negative impact of 140 basis points. We continue to expect enterprise margins to be up with margin improvement in both Diagnostics and BLS in 2025 versus 2024, driven by top line growth and LaunchPad savings.\nOur guidance range for adjusted EPS is $15.70 to $16.40 with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of 10%. As compared to prior guidance, we have narrowed the range and raised the midpoint by $0.05. Our free cash flow guidance range is $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion, all changed from prior guidance. And due to normal seasonality, we expect it to be weighted towards second half of the year.\nIn summary, we had a solid first quarter with a dynamic macro environment. We expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free capital generation that will be used for acquisitions that support our strategy and supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Christin. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review our 2024 performance and share our outlook for 2025. Today, I'm also joined by Julia Wang. Julia joined us as Executive Vice President and CFO this past December. As you know, Julie has succeeded Glenn Eisenberg, following his retirement announcement. Julia and I have hit the ground running, and Julia's experience in both diagnostics and pharmaceuticals, combined with their strong financial expertise have already been very valuable to Labcorp.\nIn 2024, our market-leading diagnostics and biopharma laboratory services businesses made meaningful advances in our strategy through organic growth, transformative acquisitions and through continued commitment to science, innovation and technology. Looking back in 2024, we executed well on our strategic priorities. We furthered our role as a trusted partner to hospitals and health systems into regional local laboratories by closing or signing 10 transactions. We advanced our position in key high-growth markets, including oncology, women's health, neurology and autoimmune disease. And we introduced new important diagnostic tests to meet significant unmet medical needs.\nWe expanded our leadership in genetic testing solutions through our acquisition of select assets of Invitae. Our clients now have access to Invitae's cutting edge science and genetic testing solutions to guide personalized treatment recommendations for oncology and rare disease patients. We advanced the development of plasma detect, an assay that uses whole genome sequencing and a proprietary machine learning analysis to detect MRD. Plasma detect is in 12 global trials across several tumor types.\nWe expect to move into clinical use in 2025 in the U.S. with an early experience program for academic medical centers, beginning with colorectal cancer. We launched Labcorp Global Trial Connect, a suite of central laboratory solutions aimed at increasing the speed of clinical trials at investigator sites.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter financial results. We performed very well across diagnostic laboratories and biopharma laboratory services, driven by strong underlying demand and advancements in science and technology solutions to better serve the needs of our customers. Revenue in the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Diagnostics and biopharma revenue each grew by approximately 10% in the quarter. Enterprise margins were down 40 basis points due to the expected impact of Invitae, which we referenced in our previous earnings call.\nAdjusted EPS of $3.45 was up 5% year-over-year. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $665 million. As we look ahead to 2025, we expect enterprise revenue growth of 6.7% to 8% and improving margins across both Diagnostics and biopharma. We -- we also expect an adjusted EPS range of $15.60 to $16.40 which represents an implied midpoint growth rate of 10%. We Additionally, we expect free cash flow to grow in line with our earnings. In just a moment, Julia will provide more details on our results and our 2025 guidance.\nTurning to highlights of our enterprise strategy in the quarter. First, we advanced our leadership position as a partner of choice for hospitals and health systems and regional local laboratories. In November, we completed the acquisition of the select assets and molecular testing location of lab works, enabling broader access to comprehensive testing and laboratory services in Alabama. In December, we completed the acquisition of Select Outreach Laboratory services for valid health in the Appalachian region. In January, subsequent to quarter end, we announced a strategic collaboration with New Jersey-based Inspira Health to manage the operations of the health systems hospital laboratories and to serve as the primary lab for spares physician network.\nAs we look ahead to 2025, our pipeline remains strong, and we look forward to supporting more health systems and to expanding access to Labcorp's world-class diagnostic solutions. We also made several advancements in science, innovation and technology in the quarter. As part of our focus on autoimmune disease, we launched a multiple sclerosis monitoring profile used to monitor neurofilament light chain serum and GFAP values in multiple sclerosis patients.\nWorking with the CDC, we announced the commercial availability of an H5 birth flu molecular test. And we announced the availability of the first companion diagnostic assay to identify gastric cancer patients eligible for targeted treatment for people with advanced cancer of the stomach. In addition, we continue to help consumers manage their health and well-being through Labcorp on demand. We launched several consumer-initiated tests in the quarter, including homocystine for heart health, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E.\nWe announced several enhancements to Global Trial Connect, including sample tracking with earlier visibility into samples chain of custody and electronic requisition, a fully digital solution that improves workflows, efficiency and document management. We also experienced continued adoption of Labcorp Diagnostics assistant by health system clients and their physicians. Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant brings together lab result data, clinical guidelines and EHR data to inform clinical decisions at the point of care.\nNew capabilities like Smart trends combine information from the client's EHR with all of the patient's lab results available through Labcorp regardless of ordering provider, and it brings it into a single integrated view. Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant and Global Trial Connect, are just 2 examples of how we're harnessing our innovative testing capabilities, our vast data assets and technology to support clinical trials and patient care.\nIn closing, 2024 was a strong year for Labcorp as we continue to execute against our enterprise strategy, and we are well positioned for continued growth in 2025. I want to thank our 70,000 employees for their hard work and dedication as we pursue our mission to improve health and improve lives. In fact, we are just made to Fortune Magazine's World's most Admired Companies list for 2025, a testament to the efforts of our team and their dedication to our mission.\nFinally, I want to personally thank Glenn for his contributions to the company during his 10-year successful run as CFO. Glenn and I have worked side-by-side since I joined as CEO, and I truly enjoyed having him serve as a key member of our Executive Committee. Glenn is a remarkable CFO and a remarkable executive. He remains as a special adviser to me through the end of April to ensure a smooth, collaborative transition that positions Lab book to further accelerate our strategy in 2025. Please join me in wishing Glenn and his family, all of the best in his retirement.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Julia.\n\nJulia Wang\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations & Public Relations\n\nThank you, Adam. Hello, everyone. I want to start by sharing that I'm really excited to be with you all today. My experience across broader health care, including diagnostics and drug development has been very helpful as I jump started in my new role. I have been truly inspired by the strength of our business fundamentals, our passionate employees and the tremendous impact that Labcorp has on the patients that we serve each and every day.\nNow I'm going to focus my comments on our financials, starting with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we have also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\nRevenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of 9.8% compared to last year, driven by organic growth of 5.4%, the impact from net appreciation of 4% and foreign currency translation of 0.3%. Operating income for the quarter was $217 million, or 6.5% of revenue, which is 12.7% on an adjusted basis. During the quarter, we had $120 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and large [indiscernible] initiatives.\nIn addition, we have $16 million of expense for the transition service agreements related to the spin of Fortrea, with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding fixed items and amortization of $17 million. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was $423 million or 12.7% of revenue compared to $395 million or 13% of revenue last year. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. The 40 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin was due to invent. Our LaunchPad initiative delivered savings for the full year, in line with our long-term target of $100 million to $125 million per year.\nThe adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.4% compared to 19.5% last year. The higher adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We expect our adjusted tax rate for 2025 to be approximately 23%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $144 million or $1.70 per diluted share -- adjusted EPS was $3.45 in the quarter, up 5% from last year.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations was $777 million in the quarter compared to $580 million a year ago. The increase in cash flow was primarily due to higher cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $112 million in the quarter. For the full year, capital expenditures were 3.8% of revenue in line with prior year, and we expect this to be consistent in 2025.\nFree cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $665 million. During the quarter, the company invested $88 million in acquisitions, paid out $16 million in dividends and repurchased $75 million of stock. For the full year, free cash flow from continuing operations was $1.1 billion. The company invested $839 million in acquisitions, paid out $243 million in dividends and repurchased $250 million of stock.\nWe continue to have a robust pipeline of potential application opportunities that meet our financial criteria and will supplement our organic growth. In addition, we continue to believe that our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy. The company currently has approximately $1.3 billion of share repurchase authorization.\nAt year-end 2024, we had $1.5 million in cash while total debt was $6.3 billion. This higher balances are due to the prefunding of maturing debt. The company paid down $1 billion of debt that matures on February 1, 2025. Our debt leverage as of year-end is 2.2x net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\nNow I will review our segment performance, beginning with diagnostics laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, an increase of 10.2% compared to last year, with organic growth of 5.1% and and net acquisitions of 5.2%. The base business was up 11.4% compared to the business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 6.2%.\nTotal volume increased 6.8% compared to last year. Base business volume grew 7.5% and compared to the Base business last year as organic volume increased 4.7%, while acquisitions contributed 2.9%. Price/mix increased 3.4% versus last year due to organic business growth and acquisitions, partially offset by lower coating. Base business organic price mix was up 1.5% compared to the business last year due to mix, as we benefited from an increase in tax proposition and lab management agreements.\nDiagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $360 million or 13.9% of revenue. compared to $354 million or 15.1% of revenue last year. Adjusted operating margin was down 120 basis points due to making and the unfavorable impact of days and weather. Excluding these items, adjusted operating margin would have been up approximately 50 basis points. As the benefit of organic demand and launch pad savings was partially offset by higher personnel.\nAs we look to 2025, we anticipate Invitae will perform in line with our expectations. That is we expect at revenue growth to be approximately 10% annually. -- and to be slightly accretive for full year 2025.\nNow I will review the segment performance of Biopharma laboratory services. Revenue for the quarter was $767 million, an increase of 10.4% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 8.9% and and foreign currency translation of 1.5%. Central Lab continued its strong performance with revenue growth of 10%. Early development also demonstrated strong year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, up 12%, [indiscernible] the prior year with a soft comparison.\nWhile farmer adjusted operating income for the quarter was $131 million or 17% of revenue compared to $109 million or 15.7% of revenue last year. Adjusted operating income and margins increased due to organic demand and large savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $8 billion. We expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.17%, with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.0.\nNow I will discuss our 2025 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2024, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, utilizing free cash flow for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 6.7% to 8% compared to 2024. This includes a headwind from foreign currency translation of approximately 50 basis points. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 6.5% to 7.7% compared to 2024. This guidance assumes roughly half of the revenue growth, comes from organic growth and half comes from the annualization of acquisitions completed in 2024.\nWe expect biopharma revenue to grow 3% to 5% compared to 2024. This guidance includes a headwind from foreign currency translation of 140 basis points. We expect both central labs and early development to grow at a mid-single-digit constant currency growth rate for the year. We expect enterprise margins to be up, with margins improving in both Diagnostics and biopharma in 2025 versus 2024, driven by top line growth and LaunchPad savings. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $15.60 to $16.40 with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of 10%. Our free cash flow guidance range is $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. And due to normal seasonality, we expect it to be weighted towards second half of the year.\nIn summary, we are encouraged by the underlying strength of our business. As we move into 2021, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that support our strategy and supplement our organic growth, while also returning cash flow to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nLastly, I want to thank Glenn as he has been a tremendous resource during this transition. I have been really impressed by the passion and the quality of our team, and I look forward to advancing the market-leading position of the company in an extremely impactful industry.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Christin, and good morning, everyone. It's really a pleasure to be here with you today. We look forward to sharing our strong results for the quarter, our updated 2024 outlook and progress on our strategy. Let's turn now to our financial results.\nIn the second quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.94 and free cash flow from continuing operations was $433 million. Enterprise revenue increased 6% compared to the second quarter of 2023. Diagnostics revenue was up 8%, driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. Central Laboratories growth was strong at 9%, partially offset by a decline in early development of 15%, resulting in biopharma laboratory services up 1%. The book-to-bill for early development was strong, with higher orders and lower cancellations, and we expect the business to be back to growth towards the end of the year.\nAdjusted EPS were up 15% and enterprise margins were up slightly. Margins in biopharma increased, while margins in Diagnostics were flat which reflects the impact of a cyber event that affected a large partner. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities through the following: Being a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories, harnessing science and innovation to develop and launch new tests in important therapeutic areas, and by utilizing data and technology to bring important services and capabilities to our customers.\nWe are confident in the success of Labcorp in the months and quarters ahead with strong growth in diagnostics and biopharma laboratory services. Glenn will provide more details on our results and 2024 outlook in just a moment. The 2024 outlook reflects the anticipated close of Invite next week.\nIn the second quarter, Labcorp continued to advance in our strategic growth areas. First, we continue to maintain a leadership position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. Following the quarter end, Labcorp entered into a comprehensive strategic collaboration with Naples Comprehensive Healthcare located in Florida to manage its inpatient lab operations and to serve as the primary lab later this summer.\nWe're also on track to close the previously announced acquisition of select assets of BioReference Health Diagnostics business by the end of the third quarter. We continue to have a very strong business development pipeline, and we look forward to sharing more of those details in the future.\nWe also announced the acquisition of select assets of Invitae, a leading medical genetics company. We're excited about Invitae's complementary cutting-edge science genetic testing solutions and technology, which aligns strategically with our focus on specialty testing and oncology. Together, we will work with our customers to utilize genetic insights to develop new treatments and to deliver personalized care in oncology and in select rare diseases.\nUpon closing the transaction, we anticipate the first 12 months will provide revenue of $275 million to $300 million. And the first year will be dilutive by approximately 3%. We've included $120 million of revenue in 2024 and the vast majority of dilution in 2024. We expect it to be accretive for 2025 and with top line growth of more than 10% per year. We have a very strong integration team in place with members from both Labcorp and Invitae. We will move quickly and thoughtfully to reduce costs without impacting the great science and the great customer experience that Invitae provides today.\nAlso, we anticipate Invitae will benefit from the full scale and breadth of Labcorp's platform as a global leader in laboratory services. We have great respect for Invitae's capabilities and team, and we look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Labcorp.\nAs we advance our growth strategy, we continue to make great strides and expanding our testing solutions. In April, Labcorp received FDA approval as the amenitarian-use device for its companion diagnostic to determine patient eligibility for treatment with Pfizer's gene therapy for hemophilia B. This is expected to expand Labcorp's leadership in [indiscernible] medicine and in gene therapy.\nWe introduced the first trimester screening test to assess preeclampsia risk during pregnancy. It is the only test of its kind available in the United States available for order by physicians for their patients. including those with a low to average risk for preeclampsia or first-time pregnancies. Roughly 1 in 25 presidencies in the United States is affected by the condition. And with this test, Labcorp is the only lab that can detect preeclampsia risk across all trimesters of pregnancy.\nWe announced several new strategic service offerings with our precision oncology portfolio. extending our leadership in oncology. Our comprehensive genomic profiling service, Labcorp Tissue Complete is now available through our laboratory network centers in Geneva and Shanghai to support global PINNACLE trials. We've also added OmniSeq Insight circulating tumor DNA to a portfolio of comprehensive genomic profiling services. Together, these solutions support customers as they advance of therapeutic development programs.\nLastly, we continue to expand Labcorp on-demand our consumer-initiated testing offering with the launch of several new tests in May and June, including standard drug, complete drug comprehensive testosterone, HIV and complete heart health. We also continue to focus on creating easy-to-use digital technology signutions for our customers. In the quarter, we launched a suite of solutions referred to as Global Trial Connect, aimed at increasing the speed and efficiency of clinical trials. This solution differentiates Labcorp in the market and has been well received by our customers.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our team of more than 65,000 employees around the world. Together, we are focused on our customers achieving our financial commitments and making meaningful progress on our strategy, we have strong momentum and significant growth opportunities ahead of us.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\nRevenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 6.2% compared to last year, primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing and foreign exchange. The base business grew 6.9% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 4.5%. Operating income for the quarter was $295 million or 9.2% of revenue or 14.9% on an adjusted basis.\nDuring the quarter, we had $100 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. In addition, we had $23 million of expense for the transition service agreements related to the spin of Fortrea with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding these items and amortization of $62 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $480 million or 14.9% of revenue. compared to $448 million or 14.8% last year. The increase in operating income and margin was due to the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings that were partially offset by higher personnel expenses.\nOur LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $100 million to $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to 23.9% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings and additional R&D tax credits. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%.\nNet earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $206 million or $2.43 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.94 in the quarter, up 15% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $561 million in the quarter compared to $162 million a year ago. The increase in cash flow was due to cash earnings and working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $128 million in the quarter or 4% of revenue. This compares to $103 million or 3.4% in the prior year.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $433 million. During the quarter, the company invested $34 million in acquisitions, paid out $60 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of stock. The Board of Directors has approved an increase in its share repurchase authorization by $1 billion to a total of $1.4 billion. At quarter end, we had $265 million in cash, while debt was $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.4x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We have $2 billion of debt maturing over the next 12 months, and we expect to refinance it later this year.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year, with organic growth of 4.7% and acquisitions net of divestitures contributing 3.2% and partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.1%. The base business grew 8.9% compared to the base business last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 5.7%. Total volume increased 5.7% compared to last year. Base business volume grew 6.3% compared to the base business last year as organic volume increased 3.5% while acquisitions contributed 2.9%.\nPrice mix increased 2.1% versus last year due to an organic base business increase that was partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price/mix was up 2.2% compared to the base business last year. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $442 million or 17.5% of revenue, compared to $410 million or 17.5% last year. Adjusted operating income was up due to organic demand, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Operating margins were flat but would have been up approximately 20 basis points, were it not for the impact of a cyber event that affected a large partner.\nNow I'll review the segment performance in biopharma laboratory services. Revenue for the quarter was $707 million, an increase of 1.1% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 1.2%, partially offset by foreign currency translation of 0.1%. The revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 9%, while early development was down 15% due to the higher than normal cancellations and lower orders in prior periods. However, we did see a sequential improvement in early development, gross orders and cancellations, which we expect will lead to higher revenues in the second half of the year and deliver year-over-year growth beginning in the fourth quarter.\nBiopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $107 million or 15.2% of revenue compared to $105 million or 15% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.9 billion and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. The trailing 12 months book-to-bill held at 1.00 compared to last quarter and is expected to increase in the second half.\nNow I'll discuss our updated 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2024, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. The acquisition of select assets of Invitae, which is expected to close next week, is now included in our guidance for 2024.\nFor the remainder of the year, we expect Invitae to add approximately $120 million in revenue. lower adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.40 and reduced cash flow by approximately $150 million, primarily due to onetime costs related to retention, severance and integration as well as an increase in working capital. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 6.4% to 7.5% compared to 2023 versus prior guidance, we are increasing the midpoint 135 basis points with Invitae contributing approximately 100 basis points of the growth.\nWe continue to perform well in Diagnostics. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 6.9% to 7.9% compared to 2023. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 200 basis points due to stronger base business demand and invite, which is expected to contribute around 130 basis points of the growth. We expect Biopharma revenue to grow 3.7% to 5% compared to 2023. The decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 35 basis points is due to early development, partially offset by continued strength in central labs. We expect early development to have a slower recovery than previously anticipated, but with year-over-year growth still expected to begin in the fourth quarter.\nWe expect enterprise margins to be flat versus the prior year despite the negative impact from Invitae of approximately 40 basis points. Diagnostics margins are now expected to be down due to the inclusion of Invitae of approximately 60 basis points. We continue to expect margins in biopharma to be up year-over-year.\nOur guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.30 to $14.90. We have decreased the midpoint of guidance by $0.30, driven by the expected dilution from Invitae of approximately $0.40 and partially offset by a $0.10 increase in the underlying business. The free cash flow guidance range is now $850 million to $1 billion and includes approximately $150 million of a cash use from Invitae, which is primarily due to onetime costs. Excluding Invitae, the free cash flow guidance range is unchanged from prior guidance.\nIn summary, LabCorp is well positioned for profitable growth, both organically as well as through acquisitions. We're excited about the acquisition of Invitae from both a strategic and financial perspective. Strategically, this strengthens our position in key long-term specialty testing growth areas of oncology and select rare diseases. From a financial perspective, while it's dilutive in 2024, we expect it to be accretive in 2025 and deliver a very attractive return on investment as we profitably grow the business. In addition, Labcorp continues to generate strong free cash flow that will be used for acquisitions while returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program.\nOperator, we'll now take questions."

Welcome to the Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings' First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christin O'Donnell, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChristin O'Donnell\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to LabCorp's First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, both of which are discussed during today's call.\nAdditionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2024 guidance and the related assumptions, the recently completed spinoff of [indiscernible] Holdings, Inc., the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings, benefits and synergies from the LaunchPad initiative and from acquisitions and other strategic transactions and partnerships, the planned holding company reorganization and opportunities for future growth.\nEach of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nAll right. Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2021 results and progress on our strategy. But before I do that, I want to address the recent announcement that LabCorp was selected as the winning bidder for select assets of Invitae.\nThis transaction will advance our strategy to launch and scale specialty testing in areas such as oncology and rare diseases. These are strong assets in important disease areas and strategically with our focus on specialty testing. Invitae has strong science, a great NGS platform and strong talent. Upon completion of the transaction, LabCorp expects approximately $275 million to $300 million in annual revenue, with the vast majority in specialty areas, such as oncology and rare diseases.\n[indiscernible] price for the transaction is $239 million. We expect the transaction to be dilutive to adjusted earnings by approximately 2% to 3% in the first full year. We expect the transaction to be accretive in year 2 and to exceed our cost of capital in year 3.\nNow I'll move to the quarter. LabCorp delivered strong top line performance in the first quarter driven by growth in both of our businesses, Diagnostic Laboratories and biopharma laboratory services. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities through being a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories through launching key new tests in important therapeutic areas and by harnessing science, technology and innovation to bring new tests services and capabilities to our customers around the world.\nLet's turn now to our first quarter financial results. In the first quarter, revenue totaled $3.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share was $3.68. Enterprise revenue for the quarter increased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2023, with Diagnostics revenue up 4% and Biopharma revenue up 8%. Biopharma's growth was driven by strength in central laboratories, partly offset by early development research labratories. Enterprise-based business margins are up compared to the prior year. Higher margins in Biopharma were partially offset by Diagnostics margins. We expect margins in both businesses to be up for the full year. The overall strength in our business enabled us to narrow the range and raised the midpoint of our EPS full year guidance to $14.90 despite a negative impact from currency.\nGlenn will provide more details on our results and 2024 outlook in just a moment. In the first quarter, LabCorp advanced key growth initiatives that support our strategy. We began 2024 with positive momentum, reinforcing our position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. We continue to be active on the acquisition front.\nWe closed 3 transactions in March, including health system agreements with base state health in Massachusetts and Providence in California and a regional lab acquisition in California. In March, we also entered into an agreement to acquire select assets of BioReference health diagnostics business. This transaction will increase access to LabCorp's high-quality clinical laboratory services.\nThese new assets are focused on clinical diagnostics and reproductive and women's health. Our business development pipeline remains strong. Building on the success of our acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we continue to incorporate the power of science, technology and innovation across the organization. This commitment is demonstrated by how we've expanded our test menu this quarter. We advanced our leadership in neurodegenerative disease with the launch of our [indiscernible] 217 blood-based biomarker test that aids in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the monitoring of patients undergoing treatment with new therapies.\nIt's also available to be used in clinical trials. In addition, earlier this month, we announced the launch of our GFA blood biomarker test for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases and neurological injuries. Following the launch of our ATN profile last fall, these 2 significant advances in the company's testing portfolio extend our leadership in a rapidly accelerating field of blood-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.\nWe continue to accelerate our leadership in oncology. We launched LabCorp plasma detect, the first clinically validated whole genome sequencing MRD solution for early-stage colon cancer to identify patients at increased risk of reoccurrence after surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy. LabCorp plasma detect developed by our PGDx laboratory is a significant achievement that enhances our liquid biopsy portfolio and strengthens our position at the forefront of driving better patient outcomes in oncology.\nWe introduced a weight loss management test portfolio in the quarter, a suite of tests that supports individuals and physicians with accessible and convenient testing options to guide weight loss management decisions and treatment, including lifestyle modifications, GLP-1 medications or barioptic surgery. LabCorp OnDemand introduced a magnesium test and a micronutrient test to measure key vitamin and mineral levels to support individual wellness. We also announced an STI pass for MGen. MGen can be as widespread as chlamydia and gonorrhea. This test includes a reflex to identify resistance to macrolides, a commonly used treatment addressing high antibiotic resistance and treatment failures associated with the infection.\nIn April, we received emergency use authorization from the FDA for our Mpox PCR test, a home collection kit. The test is the first [indiscernible] collection kit authorized by the FDA to aid in the diagnosis of infection with Mpox. Physicians can order for patients 18 years of age or older who are suspected of Mpox infection. In addition, we launched our electronic requisition digital capability to help biopharma customers and investigator sites, improve protocol compliance by reducing errors queries, holes and data revisions. Earlier this month, we released our latest corporate responsibility report, which highlights the significant progress that we're making as we pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives in a sustainable way. We invite you to take some time to review the report that can be found on our Investor Relations website. As part of our earnings release this morning, we also announced our intention to create a new holding company named LabCorp Holdings Inc. to more closely align with our brand and better position us as a global organization. I'd like to thank our team of more than 67,000 employees around the world. Their ongoing commitment has once again earned us recognition of Fortune's World's most Admired Companies list. We're extremely proud of this recognition. In summary, we continue to make progress against our strategy and to achieving both near-term and longer-term goals. We remain focused on our position as leaders in science, technology and innovation, and driving further value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\nRevenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 4.6% compared to last year. primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The base business grew 6.7% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 70%. Organically, in constant currency, the base business grew 4.3%. Operating income for the quarter was $321 million, 10.1% of revenue or 14.3% on an adjusted basis.\nDuring the quarter, we had $49 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. In addition, we had $22 million of expense for transition service agreements related to the spin Fortrea, with the corresponding income recorded in other income. Excluding these items and amortization of $60 million, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $453 million or 14.3% of revenue compared to $448 million or 14.7% last year.\nThe margin decline was due to lower COVID testing. Base business margins were up as the benefit demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. Our LaunchPad continues to be on track to deliver $100 million to $125 million of savings this year, consistent with our long-term target. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23% compared to 22.1% last year.\nThe higher adjusted tax rate was primarily due to a stock-based compensation benefit in the prior year. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $228 million or $2.69 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EPS were $3.68 in the quarter, up 7% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was a use of $30 million in the quarter compared to $186 million generated a year ago. The reduction in cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, primarily related to deferred taxes and the timing of working capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaled $134 million in the quarter or 4.2% of revenue.\nThis compares to $78 million or 2.6% in the prior year, which was impacted by the then pending spin Fortrea. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was a use of $164 million. The first quarter is seasonally the company's lowest quarter for free cash flow.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow for the full year to be between $1 billion to $1.15 billion. During the quarter, the company invested $259 million in acquisitions and paid out $62 million in dividends. At quarter end, we had $99 million in cash, while debt was $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.5x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 4.1% compared to last year, with organic growth of 1.8% and acquisitions net of contributing 2.2%. The base business grew 6.8% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 70%. Organically, in constant currency, the base business grew 4.4%.\nTotal volume increased 3.4% compared to last year. Base business volume grew 4.9% compared to the base business last year as organic volume increased 2.7%, while acquisitions contributed 2.2%. Price/mix increased 0.6% versus last year due to an organic base business increase that's partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price/mix was up 1.7% compared to the base business last year.\nDiagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $418 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to [ $448 ] million or 18.5% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to a reduction in COVID testing, while base business income was up as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. The decrease in adjusted operating income margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing, the negative impact from weather and the mix impact from lab management agreements, which we expect to improve over time. Now I'll review the segment performance of biopharma laboratory services. Revenue for the quarter was $711 million, an increase of 7.5% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 5.1% and foreign currency translation of 2.4%. The revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 13%, while early development was down 4% due to continued higher-than-normal cancellations and lower orders. While cancellations are higher than normal, we have seen a sequential improvement from last quarter.\nBiopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $100 million or 14.1% of revenue compared to $74 million or 11.1% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.9 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. The trailing 12 months book-to-bill was 1.00, which we expect to increase throughout the year.\nNow I'll discuss our updated 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2024, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 4.8% to 6.4% compared to 2023.\nCompared to prior guidance, this is a narrowing of the range with the same midpoint despite a 50 basis point headwind from currency. We continue to perform well in Diagnostics and are narrowing the full year guidance range and increasing the midpoint. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 4.8% to 6% compared to 2023. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 140 basis points, primarily due to stronger base business demand as well as acquisition revenue that is now forecasted in this segment, where it was previously only included in the enterprise guidance prior to the closing of the transactions.\nWe expect biopharma revenue to grow 3.7% to 5.7% compared to 2023. The decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 180 basis points is due to currency. This guidance includes the year-over-year positive from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points versus 220 basis points in the prior guidance. An improvement in the outlook for Central Labs is expected to be offset by early development. We continue to expect margins in Diagnostics and Biopharma to be up in 2024 versus 2023, driven by top line growth and LaunchPad savings. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.45 to $15.35. We have narrowed the range and increased the midpoint of guidance by $0.05, driven by improvement in Diagnostics, partially offset by the change in currency. The free cash flow guidance range is $1 billion to $1.15 billion, unchanged from prior guidance. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that support our strategy and supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Christin and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to discuss our fourth quarter 2023 results and our guidance for 2024.\nLabCorp delivered a strong finish to what was a transformational year for the company. Looking back, we executed well on our strategic priorities. We successfully integrated the lab operations of Ascension, one of the largest health systems in the United States. We completed the spin-off of Fortrea our former clinical development and commercialization services business. We announced 6 new laboratory partnerships, reinforcing our position as a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. And we launched new innovative tests in our focused specialty areas across the business.\nAs we begin 2024, we have momentum in both Diagnostic laboratories and Biopharma laboratory services. We expect to drive continued growth by expanding our base business, finalizing and integrating acquisitions and partnerships by advancing our position in science, technology and innovation. We will continue to focus and lead in oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease and neurology.\nNow turning to the fourth quarter results. LabCorp performed well driven by strong Base Business revenue growth in both Diagnostics and Biopharma. In the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.30 and free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin-related items was $422 million. Enterprise revenue increased 4% compared to fourth quarter 2022 with diagnostics growing 3%, led by Base Business growth of 8%, and Biopharma growing 7% due to strong performance in central laboratories more than offsetting softness in early development research laboratories.\nEnterprise Base Business margin was flat compared to the prior year despite being constrained by the mix impact from recently closed hospital partnerships. Looking forward to 2024, we expect strong enterprise revenue growth of 4.7% to 6.5%. We expect margin improvement across both Diagnostics and Biopharma, and we expect adjusted EPS of $14.30 to $15.40, an implied growth rate at the midpoint of 10%. We also expect free cash flow to grow in excess of earnings.\nIn a moment, Glenn will provide more details on our results and our 2024 guidance. Turning to our enterprise strategy. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see positive momentum from our health systems and regional local lab partnership strategy. LabCorp continues to demonstrate that we are a partner of choice with several new health systems and region local laboratory relationships. This is primarily due to our leadership in science and technology, our dedication to patients and our commitment to quality and efficiency. We announced a strategic partnership with Bay State Health in Western Massachusetts to acquire its outreach laboratory business and select operating assets. We completed the acquisition of select assets from Legacy Health. LabCorp now manages Legacy's inpatient hospital laboratories, serving patients throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington state. And we entered into an agreement to acquire ambulatory lab draw stations and a stat lab from province medical groups in California.\nLooking ahead, our M&A pipeline is robust and we remain focused on integrating and expanding our health system and regional local laboratory partnerships. These partnerships are typically accretive in the first year, with margins expanding over time during the integration and they return their cost of capital within just a few years.\nTurning now to our progress in science, technology and innovation. In the fourth quarter, Ovia Health by Labcorp announced it will offer a fertility and family-building benefit. This benefit is the first of its kind that will allow employers and health plans to offer customizable solutions to employees and members to support their family building needs. LabCorp announced the availability of an ATM profile, the first blood-based test that combines 3 well research blood markers to identify and assess biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.\nLast month, we announced the launch of the new FDA-cleared blood test for risk assessment and clinical management of severe preeclampsia. LabCorp and [indiscernible] announced a strategic collaboration to advance decentralized clinical trial capabilities for Pharma, Biotech and Medical Device sponsors. The collaboration is expected to increase patient diversity and inclusion to decrease site burden and to accelerate enrollment in clinical study time lines.\nFinally, for our central laboratory customers, we introduced a new sample shopping application to provide enhanced near real-time visibility of specimens within the central lab. This phase is the first of many that will be launched for LabCorp customers. The application allows users to view events in the central lab specimen sample journey for each assigned protocol and to customize how their data is structured.\nTurning now to the year ahead. We are focused on advancing our growth drivers that outlined in our September 2023 Investor Day. We plan to continue to be a partner of choice for health systems and regional local laboratories. We will continue to develop, license and ultimately scale specialty testing, including companion diagnostics. We will work to bring our specialty testing to other parts of the world, which increases our global reach by leveraging our scale. For example, we're enabling our central laboratories in China and Geneva to perform liquid biopsy tests for clinical trials. And we are well positioned for long-term success with cell gene therapy and consumerism.\nWe see tremendous opportunity for growth as we continue to focus on bringing new innovation, technology and markets and products to market. In closing, 2023 was a strong and transformative year for LabCorp. We executed our strategy at exceptional scale pace. I want to thank our more than 60,000 employees for their hard work and dedication to customers around the world. This enabled us to enter 2024 with considerable momentum that we intend to capitalize on to drive further value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees as we pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. Going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2024 full year guidance. For reference, we have also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year primarily due to organic Base Business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The Base Business grew 7.4% compared to the Base Business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 73%. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 5.2%.\nThe Operating loss for the quarter was $123 million due to an impairment charge of $334 million related to our early development research laboratories business as we've experienced soft biotech markets. In addition, we had $125 million of special charges related to acquisitions, coated and the spin-off of Fortrea. Excluding these items and amortization, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $395 million or 13% of revenue compared to $413 million or 14.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to lower COVID testing. Base Business margins were in line with last year as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were offset by higher personnel and stranded costs and the mix impact of recently completed hospital partnerships. Our Launchpad and stranded cost reduction initiatives delivered around $125 million of savings this year consistent with our long-term target of $100 million to $125 million per year.\nThe adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.5% compared to 25.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings and the benefit from increased R&D tax credits. We expect our adjusted tax rate for 2024 to be approximately 23%. Fully diluted EPS for the quarter was a loss of $1.95 due to the early development impairment charge. Adjusted EPS were $3.30 in the quarter, up 8% from last year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $580 million in the quarter compared to $607 million a year ago. The reduction in cash flow was due to lower COVID testing.\nCapital expenditures totaled $165 million in the quarter. For the full year, capital expenditures were 3.7% of revenue, and we expect this to be approximately 3.5% in 2024. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $414 million. The company invested $155 million in acquisitions and paid out $61 million in dividends. While we did not use any cash for share repurchases during the quarter, we completed the accelerated share repurchase program, which reduced our share count by approximately 1.1 million shares in the quarter.\nAt the end of the year, we had $530 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. For the full year, free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin-related costs, was $888 million. The company invested $672 million on acquisitions, paid out $254 million in dividends, repurchased $1 billion of stock and paid down $300 million of maturing debt. We continue to have a robust pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities that will supplement our organic growth. In addition, we continue to believe that our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy.\nAt year-end, we had $537 million in cash with debt of $5.1 billion. Our leverage was 2.5x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 2.6% compared to last year, with organic growth of 0.8% and acquisitions contributing 1.8%. The Base Business grew organically by 5.7% compared to the Base Business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 73%. Total volume increased 2.4% compared to last year as organic volume grew 0.3%, which was constrained by lower COVID testing, while acquisition volume contributed 2.1%. Base Business volume grew 5.2% compared to the base business last year as organic volume increased 3.1% while acquisitions contributed 2.2%. Price/mix increased 0.2% versus last year due to an organic Base Business increase that was mostly offset by lower COVID testing. Base Business organic price/mix was up 2.6% compared to the Base Business last year.\nDiagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $354 million or 15.1% of revenue compared to $387 million or 16.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to a reduction in COVID testing. Base Business operating income was up due to the benefit of higher organic demand, acquisitions and LaunchPad savings, which were partially offset by higher personnel costs, including health care-related costs. The decrease in margin was due to the reduction in COVID testing and the mix impact from recently closed hospital partnerships, which we expect to improve over time.\nNow I'll review our segment performance of Biopharma Laboratory Services. Revenue for the quarter was $695 million, an increase of 7.1% compared to last year due to an increase in organic revenue of 4% and foreign currency translation of 3.1%. The 7.1% revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 12% while early development was down 2% due to higher-than-normal cancellations.\nBiopharma adjusted operating income for the quarter was $109 million or 15.7% of revenue compared to $95 million or 14.7% last year. Adjusted operating income and margin increased due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel and stranded costs. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $8.2 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Book-to-bill for the quarter was $1.26 with the trailing 12 months at 1.04.\nNow I'll discuss our 2024 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2023, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 4.7% to 6.5% compared to 2023. This includes the favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 60 basis points. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be up 3.2% to 4.8% compared to 2023. The impact from lower COVID testing of around $130 million is expected to be offset by the annualization of acquisitions that were completed in 2023.\nWe expect biopharma revenue to grow 5.5% to 7.5% compared to 2023. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency translation of 220 basis points. We expect central labs and early development to both grow within the segment guidance range. We expect margins in diagnostics and Biopharma to be up in 2024 versus 2023 driven by top line growth and LaunchPad savings. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $14.30 to $15.40 with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of approximately 10%. While we do not guide to quarterly performance, it's worth noting that first quarter earnings will be below typical quarterly seasonality due to weather disruption in January that we expect will impact earnings by $0.10 to $0.15 in the quarter.\nFree cash flow is expected to be between $1 billion to $1.15 billion, with an implied growth rate at the midpoint of approximately 21%. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth and strong free cash flow generation that will be used for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Christin O'donnel, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChristin O'donnell\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet.\nWith me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.\nAdditionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions; future business strategies, expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative, acquisitions and other transactions and opportunities for future growth.\nEach of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Christin. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our third quarter performance, and I'll discuss our strategy, which we reviewed at our recent Investor Day. In the third quarter, Labcorp delivered strong year-over-year growth across the enterprise with acceleration in our Diagnostic Laboratories and Biopharma Laboratory service businesses. Our growth is fueled by our ability to execute well and to deliver greater value for our customers through our leadership in science, innovation and technology.\nWe see strength in our businesses. We have enhanced financial flexibility and a clear strategic focus, all of which enable us to end the year with significant momentum. Labcorp will continue to drive growth by expanding our base business, finalizing and integrating our hospital and health system in our local and regional laboratory transactions and by advancing our leadership in high-growth strategic areas, including specialty testing.\nMoving to our third quarter results. In the third quarter, revenue of $3.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $3.38 and free cash flow from continuing operations excluding spin-related items, was $227 million. Enterprise revenue increased 7% compared to the prior year. Diagnostics laboratory-based business revenue continued exceptional year-over-year growth with a 16% increase, driven by organic growth and progress in our hospital and health system strategy including Biopharma Laboratory Services had a strong growth in the third quarter of 8%. Enterprise base business margin was down 50 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to the mix impact of Ascension. We continue to expect full year base business margins to be flat to slightly up versus prior year, implying an increase in fourth quarter margins year-over-year. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results as well as our 2023 outlook in just a moment.\nTurning now to our enterprise strategy in the third quarter. We have significant momentum in our health system and local and regional laboratory partnership strategy. I believe the momentum is due to our leadership in science and technology and our dedication to patients and in our commitment to quality and efficiency. With the most recent partnership announcement, we strengthened our presence and scale in the Northeast and West Coast.\nIn the Northeast, we advanced 3 partnerships during the quarter. In July, we finalized our strategic relationship with Jefferson Health, one of the largest and most prominent health systems serving the Greater Philadelphia area and Southern New Jersey. reports a strategic partnership with Tufts Medicine, a leading health system in Massachusetts. Patients and providers of Tufts Medicine now have improved access to standardized laboratory testing throughout the Tufts Medicine system. We recently finalized our initial agreement with Tufts Medicine and we've reached agreement to expand the relationship to manage Tufts Medicine inpatient hospital laboratories later this year.\nAnd earlier this month, we announced a strategic relationship with Baystate Health, in which we would acquire its outreach laboratory business and select operating assets, including laboratory service centers operated throughout Western Massachusetts.\nOn the Northwest, we announced a comprehensive lab relationship with Legacy Health in Portland, where we'll acquire select assets of its outreach laboratory business and manage its inpatient hospital laboratories.\nWe also finalized our acquisition of Providence, Oregon's outreach laboratory business in September. The app and the breadth of opportunity and the quality of our pipeline is robust, and we are optimistic about continued expansion. These partnerships meet our financial criteria, including being accretive in the first year and return your cost of capital within 3 years. While the first year margins are typically lower than Labcorp's historical margin levels, there is a clear path to improvement.\nTurning now to our advancements in innovation and technology. In late September, Labcorp became the first company to broadly offer an ATN profile, a blood-based test that combines 3 well research blood biomarkers to identify and to assess biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid plates, calpangals and neurodegeneration, targeted for patients who are being evaluated from mild dementia. This new test builds on Labcorp's leadership in neurodegenerative testing options and gives physicians an easily accessible and interpretable blood test to assess pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.\nTurning to women's health. We announced a new consumer offering for menopause in the quarter. Labcorp's on-demand menopause test aims to help women understand symptoms and hormonal factors related to menopause, so they can have more informed conversations with their providers.\nFinally, our Biopharma Laboratory services team opened 2 new international facilities in China, a new kit production facility and an immunology and immunotoxicology laboratory.\nBefore I turn the call over to Glenn, as we discussed at Investor Day, we are excited about the future of Labcorp and our strong financial outlook. On a CAGR basis through 2026, we expect overall enterprise revenue growth of 5% to 8%, including 1.5% to 2.5% from acquisitions. For Diagnostics Laboratories, we expect organic growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. We expect Biopharma Laboratory Services to grow organically between 4.5% to 7.5%. We are focusing on 2 significant drivers of near-term growth and differentiation as we move towards those target ranges.\nThe first is to be the partner of choice for health systems and local or regional laboratories. And the second is to develop to license and ultimately, to scale specialty testing, including companion diagnostics. I mentioned the momentum that we have in our health system strategy earlier. We've announced [ 5 ] new agreements this year. Additionally, specialty testing, we are focused on 4 primary areas: oncology, women's health, autoimmune disease and neurology, which we anticipate will outpace the growth of other therapeutic areas. The development of specialty tests and companion diagnostics makes us attractive partners to Health Systems and Biopharma as they continue to develop more therapies and higher specialty areas.\nOur scale and our geographic presence will be differentiators for both growth initiatives. We are also well positioned for long-term success in cell and gene study, expanding into the consumer market and international growth through our innovative speciality testing and Biopharma business. All of this will culminate the top line performance that we expect will exceed $14 billion by the end of 2026.\nTo close, our team of over 60,000 global employees is executing Labcorp's global strategy at scale and on an exceptional pace. We closed -- as we closed 2023, we will continue to capitalize on the momentum that we've created and drive further value creation for our shareholders. This year has been transformational for Labcorp. We are focused on our growth strategy, and we plan to finish strong as we pursue our mission to improve health and to improve lives.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\nRevenue for the quarter were $3.1 billion, an increase of 6.6% compared to last year, primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing. The base business grew 14% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 87%. Organically, in constant currency, the base business grew 10.8%, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth. Ascension annualized on September 30.\nOperating income for the quarter was $252 million or 8.3% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $56 million of amortization and $116 million of restructuring charges and special items due to the spin of Patria, COVID, acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $424 million or 13.9% of revenue compared to $491 million or 17.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing. The margin decline was also negatively affected by the mix impact from the Ascension lab management agreement.\nExcluding these items, margins would have been flat as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were offset by higher personnel expense. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the 3-year period ending 2024.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared to 19.4% last year. The increase in the adjusted rate was primarily due to higher R&D tax credits realized last year. We continue to expect the fourth quarter and full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nNet earnings for the quarter from continuing operations were $184 million or $2.11 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.38 in the quarter, down 16% from last year due to lower COVID testing earnings as base business adjusted EPS was up approximately 10%.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations was $276 million in the quarter, which was burdened by approximately $56 million of spin-related items. Operating cash flow of $276 million is up from $253 million a year ago due to higher cash earnings.\nCapital expenditures totaled $105 million, up from $83 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $171 million, which was burdened by approximately $56 million of spin-related items. The company invested $380 million in acquisitions, paid out $64 million in dividends and used $1 billion for an accelerated share repurchase program that we expect will be completed by year-end.\nAt quarter end, we had around $725 million in cash while debt was $5.4 billion. Our leverage was 2.7x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics Laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 6.2% compared to last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 3.4% and acquisitions of 3%. The base business grew organically by 12.8% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 87%. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 6% of the growth.\nTotal volume increased 2.3% compared to last year as acquisition volume grew 3.4%, primarily offset by organic volume of minus 1.1% due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 7.2% compared to the base business last year as organic increased 3.6% for volume, while acquisitions also contributed 3.6%.\nPrice/mix increased 3.9% versus last year, primarily due to an organic base business increase partially offset by lower COVID testing. Base business organic price/mix was up 9.2% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 6%.\nDiagnostics Laboratories adjusted operating income for the quarter was $386 million, or 16.5% of revenue compared to $440 million or 19.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to a reduction in COVID-19 testing, while the margin was also affected by the mix impact from Ascension.\nBase business margin, excluding the mix impact of Ascension was up approximately 30 basis points as the benefit of organic growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense.\nNow I'll review our segment performance of Biopharma laboratory services. Revenue for the quarter was $719 million, an increase of 7.9% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in organic revenue of 4.9% and foreign currency of 3.3%. The 7.9% revenue growth was driven by continued strength in Central Labs, which was up 9%, while early development was up 5.7%. While early development is no longer constrained by NHP availability, it has experienced higher than normal cancellations and lower orders primarily due to small biotech funding.\nBiopharma Laboratory Services adjusted operating income for the quarter was $109 million or 15.2% of revenue compared to $105 million or 15.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating margin was due to stranded costs as a result of the spin of Fortia, which is timing related. Excluding stranded costs, margins were up in the third quarter, as the benefit of top line growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel costs. We expect margins in the fourth quarter to be up sequentially and year-over-year.\nWe ended the quarter with a backlog of $7.8 billion, and we expect approximately $2.4 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Trailing 12 months book-to-bill was 1.12.\nNow I'll discuss our 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2023, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. In addition, the guidance includes the impact from the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was funded with proceeds from the spin.\nWith regard to our 2023 full year guidance, we've narrowed the ranges but have maintained the same midpoint from our prior guidance for enterprise revenue, earnings and cash flow. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.9% to 2.7% compared to 2022. This increase reflects the base business growing 11.5% to 12.2%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 85% to 86%. We expect Diagnostics Laboratories revenue to be up 1.5% to 2% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 14.1% to 14.6%, which includes approximately 5% growth from Ascension. The base business has improved from our prior guidance as acquisition-related revenue that was forecasted at the enterprise level is now reflected in the segment as we've closed those transactions. We continue to expect Diagnostics Laboratories based business margin to be up slightly in 2023 versus 2022, including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension.\nWe expect Biopharma laboratory services revenue to grow 3.1% to 4% compared to 2022. Excluding the change in currency translation of negative 20 basis points, the midpoint of the guidance range remains unchanged from our prior guidance. We expect the revenue growth rate to continue to improve in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect margins for the full year to be flat to slightly up, while the fourth quarter is expected to see both sequential and year-over-year improvement.\nOur guidance range for adjusted EPS is $13.25 to $13.75, unchanged at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin-related items, is expected to be between $850 million to $950 million, also unchanged from our prior guidance at the midpoint.\nIn summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the spin-off of Fortrea and its treatment as discontinued operations and general economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative, acquisitions and other transactions and opportunities for future growth.\nEach of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Chad. Good morning, everyone. Before I cover our second quarter results, I want to first thank Chad for his leadership in Investor Relations over the last several years. Chas will be moving into the role of Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis effective in August. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Kristin O'Donnell, an accomplished leader in our finance organization, who has been appointed to Vice President of Investor Relations. Both Chad and Kristin will be in attendance at our upcoming Investor Day on September 14, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person.\nBeginning this quarter, LabCorp is reporting results without the inclusion of Fortrea, which is now an independent publicly held company as a result of our successful spin on June 30. Moving forward, we'll report our laboratory services business under 2 segments, LabCorp Diagnostics Laboratories and LabCorp biopharma laboratory services.\nBiopharma Laboratory Services consists of 2 businesses: our central laboratories business, which represents about 70% of segment revenue and early development research laboratories, which although smaller, is also a leader in the market.\nIn the second quarter, LabCorp delivered exceptional year-over-year growth in our Diagnostics Laboratories base business and generated strong growth in central laboratories. Early development research laboratories continue to be constrained by industry-related supply chain issues that we expect to be resolved in the third quarter. We entered the second half of the year with clear operational focus and enhanced financial flexibility to advance our strategy. We see strong momentum in the base business and are excited about the growth opportunities before us.\nNow let's discuss our second quarter performance. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $3.42, and free cash flow from continuing operations was $177 million. Our business is performing well with overall revenue increasing 4% compared to prior year. Base business revenue grew 13% to prior year. Diagnostics Laboratories base business revenue grew 16%, driven by both strong base business volume and Ascension.\nFor Biopharma Laboratory Services, Second quarter revenue grew 3%, driven by Central Laboratories business, which grew 9%, partially offset by early development research laboratories, which was down 7% due to NHP supply constraints. We expect early development research laboratories to grow in the second half of the year versus prior year, and we do not expect impact from NHP supply constraints for the rest of the year.\nEnterprise base business margin was slightly down compared to the prior year due to the impact of Ascension, which we discussed previously. Diagnostic Laboratories base business margin increased versus prior year if you exclude extension. And biopharma laboratory services margins expanded, benefiting from central laboratory strong volume increases. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results as well as our updated 2023 outlook in just a moment.\nAs we mentioned at the top of the call, we completed the spin of Fortuna business on June 30. We I want to thank both the LabCorp and Forteo teams for their tireless efforts in achieving this milestone that positions us to better meet customer needs and delivers immediate value to our shareholders. We announced that we'll begin an accelerated $1 billion share repurchase program.\nWe'll pay off $300 million in recurring debt and we'll utilize the remainder of the $1.6 billion dividend to LabCorp from Fortrea to be returned to shareholders through additional future share purchases and/or cash dividends. The completion of the spin brings the growth opportunities of our laboratory businesses into full focus.\nWe are poised to leverage our deep science, technology and innovative laboratory network to drive growth, and to deliver superior solutions to our customers. We are also in a very strong position operationally to advance our laboratory business. Here are several recent examples where we progressed our enterprise strategy in the second quarter. We continue to drive growth through health care system partnerships.\nEarlier this month, we finalized our strategic relationship with Jefferson Health, one of the largest health systems serving the Greater Philadelphia area in Southern New Jersey. This new collaboration will focus on future research and innovations to improve health outcomes.\nIn May, we announced the next step in our long-standing relationship with Providence Health and Services to acquire its outreach laboratory business and select assets in Oregon. This transaction builds on our more than 20-year history with the Providence family of organizations.\nFinally, earlier in July, we announced a comprehensive lab relationship with legacy Health important Oregon. Under this agreement, Labcorp will acquire select assets of its outreach laboratory business, including laboratory facilities and equipment and manage legacy's inpatient hospital laboratories. These relationships create immediate value for hospital systems for patients, for communities, while also providing significant growth opportunities for Labcorp. The partnerships meet our criteria of being accretive to earnings and cash in the first year. Although the margins are typically lower than the company average early on, they do improve over time.\nWe are also pleased with our progress integrating hospital partnerships and acquisitions. For example, with Ascension, which we announced in 2022, we continue to see reduced employee turnover and improved performance due to our partnership. This scalable model connects our 2 mission-driven organizations to provide care teams with information to make the best possible decisions for patients.\nWe continue to look for regional laboratory acquisitions in geographies where we can increase access to diagnostics and expand capabilities. As an example, this week, we completed our acquisition of certain assets of Enzo Biochem's Clinical Laboratory division in New Jersey, which serves the New York Price health care communities. We have a very robust pipeline of potential hospital local laboratory acquisitions and we'll continue to focus energy and resources on this important opportunity for growth.\nAdditionally, we're investing in innovation and technology that supports diagnostic and drug development testing across disease areas, including cancer, Alzheimer's and other diseases. In May, we commercially launched a new liquid biopsy test, enabling target therapy selection for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The LabCorp plasma-focused test allows oncologists to better evaluate tumor cells and manage the care patients through a precision therapy plan.\nAdditionally, our portfolio of kids solutions from the acquisition of PDDX is gaining momentum with major health systems and academic centers. Our solutions can enable operational and financial efficiencies that are making us a key partner for hospital and health systems as they execute on their precision medicine programs.\nRecently, we were first laboratory to launch a test for PTL-181 in plasma, an important blood past for potential Alzheimer's patients demonstrating symptoms of dementia. Our teams are at the forefront of Alzheimer's testing as the number of people impacted by this disease is expected to double over the next 2 decades.\nIn April, we broke ground on the expansion project of our new central laboratory facility in Japan. When complete at the end of 2024, the facility will enhance our central laboratory testing capabilities to support drug development. We also opened 2 new facilities in China, a new kit production facility in Suzhou and an immunology and immunotoxicology lab in Shanghai.\nIn addition, we delivered impactful digital solutions to help our customers understand, manage and improve their health. As part of our commitment to improving the customer experience, we launched an advanced e-commerce platform to improve consumer engagement with LabCorp. The platform will support all of our businesses including LabCorp on Demand, which offers consumers access to many of LabCorp's innovative tests online nationwide.\nLastly, I speak on behalf of the entire management team, when I say that we are excited about our upcoming Investor Day on September 14 in New York City. This event will highlight our go-forward strategy, offer business overviews and provide a longer-term financial outlook. We have a value creation road map that we are excited to share.\nToday marks a new chapter in our company's history. We have a team of more than 60,000 global employees with United Focus. LapCorp's base business is performing very well. We're executing on our growth strategy, and we're leveraging LabCorp's financial strength as well as operational focus to improve health, to improve lives while also increasing shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. With the spin completed on June 30, we have treated Patria as discontinued operations in the second quarter.\nAll of my comments will reflect the current business and have been adjusted to exclude Portia in prior periods for comparative purposes. Revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of 3.8% compared to last year. primarily due to organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions, partially offset by lower COVID testing.\nThe base business grew 12.7% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 88% and as we performed an average of 3,000 PCR tests per day in the quarter. Organically, in constant currency, the base business grew 10.8% and benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 5% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition, while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth.\nOperating income for the quarter was $266 million or 8.8% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $52 million of amortization and $131 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to the spin of Fortria acquisitions and LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $448 million or 14.8% of revenue compared to $548 million or 18.7% last year.\nThe decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing. The margin decline was also negatively affected by the mix impact from the Ascension lab management agreement. Excluding these items, margins would have been up slightly as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense and increased R&D investments in oncology.\nOur Launchpad initiatives continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the 3-year period ending 2024. In addition, the company is implementing actions in the third quarter to take out $25 million of annualized stranded costs throughout the enterprise as a result of the spin.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% compared to 25.3% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to R&D tax credits. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nNet earnings for the quarter from continuing operations were $155 million or $1.74 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.42 in the quarter, down 15% from last year due to lower COVID testing earnings as base business adjusted EPS was up approximately 18%.\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations was $280 million in the quarter, which was burdened by approximately $65 million of spin-related items. Operating cash flow of $280 million is down from $548 million a year ago, primarily due to lower COVID testing earnings and spin-related items. In addition, higher working capital requirements that are timing related were partially offset by higher base business earnings.\nCapital expenditures totaled $103 million, down from $140 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was $177 million, including approximately $65 million of spin-related items.\nThe company invested $137 million in acquisitions and paid out $65 million in dividends. While the company did not repurchase shares in the second quarter, we announced a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we expect to put in place in the third quarter and be completed by year-end. At quarter end, we had $1.9 billion in cash, including the $1.6 billion dividend from Fortrea spin, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 2.6x gross debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics laboratories. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 3.8% compared to last year, driven primarily by organic growth of 1.8% and acquisitions of 2.2%. The base business grew organically by 13.5% compared to the base business last year, while COVID testing revenue was down 88%. The Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth.\nTotal volume increased 1.4% compared to last year as acquisition volume grew 2.5%, partially offset by organic volume of minus 1.1% due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 8.1% compared to the base business last year, including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.7%. The strong year-over-year growth rate was also aided by lower-than-normal volume in the second quarter of 2022 due to Omicron.\nPrice/mix increased 2.4% versus last year, primarily due to organic base business growth of 6.8%, partially offset by lower code testing of 3.9%. Base business organic price/mix was up 8% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 7%.\nDiagnostics Laboratories adjusted operating income for the quarter was $410 million or 17.5% of revenue compared to $516 million or 22.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing, while the margin decline was also negatively impacted by the mix impact from Ascension. Base business margin, excluding the mix impact of Ascension was up approximately 40 basis points as the benefit of organic growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense.\nNow I'll review our segment performance of biopharma laboratory services. Revenue for the quarter was $699 million, an increase of 3.1% compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in organic revenue of 2.1% and foreign currency of 1.5%. The increase in organic revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 5% due to the previously communicated NHP related supply constraints in our early development research laboratories business.\nAdjusted operating income for the segment was $105 million or 15% of revenue compared to $93 million or 13.7% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was due to organic demand and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel expense. We ended the quarter with backlog of $8 billion, and we expect approximately $2.5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nNow I'll discuss our 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2023, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. In addition, the guidance includes the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program with proceeds from the spin.\nExcluding Fortria, our current enterprise guidance for revenue, earnings and cash flow remains unchanged from our prior guidance given in April. Enterprise revenue is in line with diagnostic story slightly up while biopharma laboratory services is slightly down. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.5% to 3% compared to 2022. This increase reflects the base business growing 11.3% to 12.6% while COVID testing is expected to decline 85% to 89%.\nWe expect Diagnostics Laboratories revenue to be up 0.5% to 1.5% compared to 2022. This is a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint from our April guidance as the base business outlook has improved, partially offset by lower COVID testing. This guidance includes the expectation that the base business will grow 13.2% to 14.2%, which includes approximately 5% growth from Ascension.\nThe base business has improved from our April guidance based on stronger demand. We continue to expect Diagnostics Laboratories base business margin to be slightly up in 2023 versus 2022 and including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension.\nWe expect biopharma laboratory services revenue to grow 3% to 4.5% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 150 basis points. The midpoint of our guidance range is down approximately 75 basis points from the midpoint of our April guidance, but implies around 9.5% growth in the second half of the year as we expect favorable growth in both central laboratories and early development research laboratories.\nWe also expect that the segment margin will be flat to slightly up in 2023 compared to 2022. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS and is $13 to $14, which is consistent with our April guidance, excluding Fortria and including the impact from the accelerated share repurchase program. Free cash flow from continuing operations, excluding spin-related items, is expected to be between $800 million to $1 billion, in line with our prior guidance, excluding Fortria.\nIn summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we'll now take questions."

Welcome to Labcorp's Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Chas Cook. Sir, you may begin.\n\nChas Cook\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet.\nWith me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.\nAdditionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the proposed spinoff of the clinical development business, the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative, acquisitions and other transactions and opportunities for future growth.\nEach of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based on a use factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam Schechter.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nExecutive Vice President & President-Global Human Health, Merck & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It is great to be with you today to discuss the start of 2023 and the progress that we're making. Our first quarter results set the foundation for a strong 2023.\nPerformance this quarter was driven by very strong momentum across our diagnostic business, continued industry leadership in central laboratories solid fundamentals and staffing improvements and early development and a mixed quarter for clinical development.\nFor drug development, we expected the first half of 2023 to be more challenging than the second as the first half continues to be impacted by MHP shortages, the previously noted loss of an FSP contract and lower COVID-related work. We are on track to complete the spin of our clinical development business midyear, and we anticipate the business to accelerate in the second half of 2023, once Fortrea is officially launched. Customers have been positive about the transaction and our progress with some short-term customer delays as well as a slightly slower backlog burn rate compared to previous years. Sometimes are waiting until after the transaction is complete to award new business, but our dialogue remains encouraging as we approach the close as evidenced by a renewal of an FSP contract with a large pharma customer this quarter.\nIn the first quarter, revenue totaled $3.8 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $3.82 and free cash flow was $27 million. Overall, our base business is performing well. Excluding COVID testing revenue, enterprise-based business revenue grew 10% in the first quarter versus the same period of prior year. Since 2019, prior to COVID, both diagnostics and drug development based businesses have grown revenue at approximately 7% CAGR. The Diagnostics Base Business revenue grew 20% year-over-year in the quarter. This strong top line performance continues to be driven by both routine and esoteric testing as well as a benefit from hospital deals, including our Ascension partnership.\nFor drug development, first quarter revenue declined 4% versus prior year. Drug Development ended the quarter with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.27. Enterprise Base Business margins were lower than prior year. However, we still anticipate slight margin expansion for 2023. As we continue the Ascension integration, we overcome NHP supply issues, and we realized benefits from the LaunchPad initiative.\nWe are continuing to implement cost controls across both businesses to offset inflationary pressures. Finally, COVID PCR testing volumes declined during the quarter, more than expected, totaling more than 870,000 tests performed and averaging 10,000 tests per day. We expect COVID testing to continue to decline. Glenn will provide additional detail on our quarterly results as well as our 2023 outlook in just a moment.\nMoving now to an update on the planned spin of our Clinical Development Business. We are on track to complete the spin midyear, subject to the regulatory approval process. We have confidence in the funding that has been established despite short-term pressures. Fortrea will benefit from the leadership of Tom Pike as CEO. We plan to announce the leadership team and the Fortrea Board of Directors in the near future. We encourage you to visit fortrea.com to learn more. Upon completion, we will create 2 strong independent companies through a tax-free transaction. Both Labcorp and Fortrea will emerge from a transaction with the ability to better meet customer needs to drive sustainable and profitable growth and to deliver attractive shareholder returns.\nI'll now move to our enterprise strategy. We are laying the groundwork for the future by executing against our strategic initiatives. We continue to integrate Ascension assets and operations in the first quarter. Labcorp is now managing laboratories in nearly 100 Ascension hospitals. Ascension Health System laboratories and other deals including our previously announced strategic relationship with RWJ Barnabas Health are strong proof points of our ability to generate growth through future health care system partnerships. Health systems are adapting to financial pressures, inflation, labor shortages and other challenges, and they are seeking the right laboratory partner amidst these headwinds. We are working with our health system partners to develop tailored, innovative and cost-effective solutions that meet the unique needs of their patients and providers. Last month, we entered into agreement with Enzo Biochem to acquire the assets of its Clinical Laboratory division.\nToday, we are in active discussions to expand relationships and execute new engagements with other partners. The pipeline for hospital and local lab acquisition and investment is robust. And we look forward to updating you on existing and new partnerships throughout the year.\nTurning to oncology. We partnered with ImmunoGen on an immunohistochemistry sponsored testing program to increase access for patients of ovarian cancer. Additionally, Labcorp added HER2 low reporting to the IC test for breast cancer. This test is the only FDA-approved companion diagnostic of HER2 status for patients with metastatic breast cancer, impacting patient eligibility for treatments and therapies that can improve outcomes. Labcorp also entered into a strategic collaboration with care to provide clinicians greater access to precision oncology decision support. This collaboration builds on our capabilities to improve access to high-quality care for cancer patients in their community cancer care providers.\nWe continue to expand our digital health platform, Labcorp OnDemand. We launched 3 new tests in the first quarter, including a PSA prostate cancer screening desk, a hepatitis B immunity test and a fatigue test for people with chronic fatigue systems, including post-COVID fatigue.\nBefore I wrap up, we are looking forward to 2 upcoming events that will provide investors more color on our near- to midterm future. We have a Fortrea Investor Day, tentatively scheduled for June 6, and in which we'll discuss the exciting opportunities ahead. We expect the Form 10 to be available in advance of the meeting. Additionally, we are planning a Labcorp Investor Day which is tentatively scheduled for September.\nLabcorp is strong today and will emerge from the completion of the upcoming spend even stronger. Our diagnostics laboratory, early development research laboratory and central laboratory businesses are market leaders with solid fundamentals. We are executing against our long-term strategy that will position these businesses for continued growth in the future. I want to take a moment to thank our team for their continued contributions to Labcorp and our customers. The team is generating strong base business performance while preparing for a transformational transaction midyear. And more than 80,000 strong, our team works every day to find new ways to harness science, innovation and technology for the betterment of our stakeholders. Labcorp is well positioned to progress our mission to improve health and improve lives while generating attractive returns for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we have also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\nRevenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 3.1% compared to last year, due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency. This was partially offset by organic base business growth and the impact from acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 84% compared to COVID-testing last year, while the business grew 9.8% compared to the base business last year. Organically, in constant currency, the base business grew 9.2% benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. As a reminder, the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition while the lab management agreement is treated as organic growth.\nOperating income for the quarter was $341 million or 9% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $69 million of amortization and $83 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions, LaunchPad initiatives and the proposed spin of Fortrea. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $494 million or 13.1% of revenue compared to $794 million or 20.4% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income was due to lower COVID testing demand. The margin decline was also negative affected by the mix impact from the Ascension TSA and NHP-related constraints. Excluding these items, margins would have been up slightly as the benefit of demand and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by higher personnel expense, inflationary costs and increased R&D investments in oncology.\nOur LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings over the 3-year period ending 2024. The tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 23.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the benefit from increased R&D tax credits. We continue to expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $213 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $3.82 in the quarter, down 37% from last year due to lower COVID test and earnings as base business adjusted EPS was up 10%. Operating cash flow was $121 million in the quarter compared to $356 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower COVID test and earnings and spin-related costs, partially offset by higher base business earnings.\nCapital expenditures totaled $94 million, down from $117 million last year. For the full year, we continue to expect that capital expenditures will be approximately 3.5% of base business revenue. Free cash flow for the quarter was $27 million, and the company paid out $64 million in dividends. The first quarter is generally the company's softest quarter for free cash flow. We continue to expect our full year free cash flow to be between $1 billion to $1.2 billion.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 2.9% compared to last year, driven by organic revenue being down 4.7%, which was due to COVID testing, partially offset by acquisitions of 2%. COVID testing revenue was down 84% compared to COVID testing last year, while the base business grew organically by 17.5% compared to the base business last year.\nThe Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth, while the impact of weather and revenue days benefited growth by approximately 2%. Total volume decreased 3.3% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 5.6%, partially offset by acquisition volume of 2.3%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing. Base business volume grew 11% compared to base business last year, including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.6% and favorable weather and revenue days of approximately 2%. The strong year-over-year growth rate was also impacted by lower-than-normal volume in the first quarter of 2022 due to Omicron.\nPrice/mix increased 0.4% versus last year as the base business improved 6.6% and was partially offset by lower COVID testing of 5.7%, currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%. Base business price/mix was up 8.8% compared to base business last year, benefiting from the Ascension Lab management agreement of approximately 7%.\nDiagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $442 million or 18.5% of revenue compared to $683 million or 27.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing, which carried a margin of approximately 50% for the quarter. Going forward, we expect a lower margin for COVID testing but still above the segment average. Base business margin was up approximately 80 basis points, driven by organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel expense and the mix impact from the Ascension TSA.\nNow I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to last year, primarily due to decreased organic revenue of 2.4% and foreign currency of 1.5%. The decrease in adjusted organic revenue was negatively impacted by approximately 8% due to NHP-related constraints, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work and the previously mentioned FSP contract loss. The early development business was the most constrained by these items. Excluding these impacts, organic base business revenue for the segment grew approximately 6%, with early development up 17%, Central Lab up 6% and clinical development up 3%.\nReported first quarter drug development revenues on a compounded annual basis grew 6.9% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $124 million or 8.8% of revenue compared to $169 million or 11.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to NHP-related constraints, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work and the FSP contract loss, which negatively impacted margins by approximately 350 basis points. Excluding these items, margins would have increased primarily due to demand and LaunchPad savings being partially offset by higher personnel expense, inflationary costs and a write-off of receivables related to small biotech customers. We ended the quarter with backlog of $16.6 billion, and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nNow I'll discuss our updated 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2023, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Also, our guidance assumes that Fortrea will be part of Labcorp for the full year. Following its spin currently anticipated in the middle of the year, we expect to provide updated guidance. We expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1.5% to 4% compared to 2022. This is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 25 basis points. This increase reflects the base business range increasing to 9.5% to 11%, while COVID testing guidance range has been lowered to minus 80% to 90%. We continue to perform well in diagnostics and are taking up our full year guidance range.\nWe expect Diagnostics revenue to be down 0.5% to up 2% compared to '22, this is an increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 100 basis points, primarily due to stronger base business volume. This guidance includes the expectation that the Base Business will now grow 12.5% to 14%, which has approximately 5% growth due to Ascension. We expect Diagnostics Base Business margin to be up in 2023 versus 2022, including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension.\nWe expect Drug Development revenue to grow 3.5% to 5.5% compared to 2022. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 150 basis points due to slower-than-expected backlog conversion, primarily due to investigator site constraints and lower-than-expected first quarter orders. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 60 basis points. At the midpoint of our guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 6.8%, primarily due to organic growth. We also continue to expect that the drug development margin will increase slightly in 2023 compared to 2022.\nOur guidance range for adjusted EPS is $16.25 to $17.75. This is a tightening of the range from our prior guidance, while the midpoint is unchanged. We -- this guidance reflects lower earnings from COVID testing, while Base Business adjusted EPS is expected to increase 15% at the midpoint.\nFree cash flow guidance is $1 billion to $1.2 billion, unchanged from our prior guidance. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our base business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to continue to decline through the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders through a share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

Welcome to the Q4 and Full Year 2022 Labcorp Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chas Cook, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nChas Cook\n\nVP of IR, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available, via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation, with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures, to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call. Additionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2023 guidance and the related assumptions, the proposed spinoff of the Clinical Development business, the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiatives, acquisitions and other transactions and opportunities for future growth.\nEach of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change. Now I'll turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you today to discuss our fourth quarter results, as well as the progress that we've made towards our strategy. 2022 ended strong for Labcorp with accelerated revenue growth in Diagnostics, and continued strong underlying fundamentals in Drug Development. Drug development continues to have a tough year-over-year comparison, mostly due to less COVID-related work.\nIn 2022, we took decisive actions to navigate a challenging operating environment. We advanced our strategy with the announcement of the planned spin of our Clinical Development business, and we closed several important hospital laboratory partnerships. I'll now discuss our fourth quarter performance.\nIn the quarter, revenue totaled $3.7 billion. Adjusted earnings per share was $4.14 and free cash flow was $536 million. The Base Business remains strong. On a constant currency basis, excluding COVID testing revenue, enterprise base business revenue grew 6%, in the fourth quarter versus prior year. Growth in Diagnostics based business revenue in the fourth quarter was strong due to both routine and esoteric testing and revenue from the Ascension partnership.\nCOVID PCR testing volumes declined during the quarter as expected, totaling 1.4 million tests performed and averaging 16,000 per day.\nLooking forward, our Diagnostic business will accelerate with 10.5% to 12.5% Base Business growth, benefiting by around 5 percentage points with a full year of our Ascension partnership. For Drug Development, fourth quarter Base Business revenue in constant currency declined 1%, versus prior year. Early development and Clinical Development both grew but were offset by lower central laboratory revenue, due mostly to COVID-related work.\nDrug Development ended the quarter with a strong trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.27. Looking forward, we expect the momentum to continue in Drug Development orders, and we expect that site enrollment in kits return will continue to increase throughout the year. We also anticipate the Drug Development business to return to 5% to 7% growth with a stronger second half than first half due to early development and the annualization of an FSP contract loss.\nFinally, in the quarter, the Board authorized a $1 billion increase to the company's share repurchase program, bringing our remaining total share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results and will review full year 2023 guidance, in just a moment.\nMoving now to an update on the planned spin of our Clinical Development business. We have been pleased with the positive response from customers and employees, and we remain on track to complete the spin in mid-2023, subject to satisfying certain customary conditions. Recently, we unveiled Fortrea as the name of the Clinical Development business post spin. You can learn more by visiting fortrea.com. Also, in January, Tom Pike joined Labcorp as President and CEO, of our Clinical Development business. Tom will serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Fortrea, upon completion of the spin.\nTom brings significant CRO experience, including serving as CEO of a public CRO. He has worked with many of our customers, and he knows the business well. We welcome Tom and look forward to working with him, as we continue making progress towards the completion of the spin. Upon completion through a tax-free transaction, we will have 2 strong independent companies Labcorp and Fortrea, which will emerge to the transaction with the ability to better meet customer needs, to drive sustainable and profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns. In the coming months, we plan to announce the Board of Directors of Fortrea, including the Lead Independent Director and other members of the executive leadership team.\nWe also intend to host an Analyst Day in advance of the spin, and I look forward to working with Tom on timing.\nI'll now move to our enterprise strategy. We made significant advances on our strategy in 2022. We accelerated and closed several hospital and health system partnerships and acquisitions, during the year. Most recently, we completed the integration of certain Ascension assets and operations. Labcorp now provides laboratory management services for nearly 100 hospitals across the Ascension hospital system. We are pleased with the smooth transition, and we want to thank our partners at Ascension, for enabling our teams to help deliver the best patient care possible.\nIn addition to Ascension, we entered strategic relationships with RWJBarnabas Health, AtlantiCare, Prisma Health and St. Dominic's during the year. The pipeline for hospital and local laboratory acquisition and investment is robust, and will be a key area of opportunity for growth in 2023 and beyond. We also made progress in using digital technology and data to deliver better outcomes for patients. By significantly improving our web, mobile and digital channels, we've made it easier for customers to access critical data and health information.\nUsing digital technology and artificial intelligence, we are reimagining our result reports to provide deeper insights, scientific expertise and clinical information to guide patient care. Additionally, we're encouraged by increased customer adoption of Labcorp's Diagnostic assistant, a tool that equips positions with the information they need to improve care. Also, our investment in call center automization is improving the customer experience by enabling patients and providers to get answers faster, through self-service features.\nTurning to oncology. We continue to expand our oncology capabilities to serve clinicians and Drug Development customers. In the fourth quarter, we launched a liquid biopsy test called Labcorp Plasma Focus. This test is used to match cancer patients with FDA-approved therapies, using the patient's circulating tumor DNA taken from a blood drop. This is the first new product coming from Labcorp's acquisition of Personal Genome Diagnostics in 2022. Today, Labcorp offers customers and patients access to the most comprehensive oncology portfolio in the market.\nOur teams are evaluating and executing our growth opportunities in areas such as neurodegenerative, autoimmune and liver disease. As well as cell and gene therapy and more. In 2022, our team supported over 5,000 clinical trials work at over 90% of new FDA approvals and launched over 130 new tests. In the area of neurodegenerative disease, for example, we launched new tests to assist the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. We anticipate more innovative launches in 2023.\nFinally, we made progress in our direct-to-consumer business. In 2022, we introduced Labcorp OnDemand, a platform aimed at providing consumers with easy and convenient access to our leading diagnostic tests. We now offer over 45 tests that cover over 100 biomarkers to help consumers monitor their health, stay current with wellness screening, plan for families and manage a broad range of chronic [culturation]. The progress we made this year is a direct result of the commitment of our employees who fuel our confidence in the outlook for 2023. We are recognized by Forbes' list of the world's best large employers in 2022, and we also earned the top score into 2022 Disability Equality Index. Attracting and retaining the best talent is key to our success, and we remain focused on being an employer of choice and destination for talent. As I look to 2023, I'm optimistic about the growth and strategic opportunities before us. Our business fundamentals remain strong, and we are well positioned for the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with our 2023 full year guidance.\nFor reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website. Revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 9.4% compared to last year, due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency. This was partially offset by organic Base Business growth and the impact from acquisitions.\nCOVID testing revenue was down 79% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 4.8% compared to the Base Business last year. Organically in constant currency, the Base Business grew 4.7%, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement, which contributed approximately 4% of the organic growth. While the outreach business that we acquired from Ascension is treated as an acquisition. The lab management agreement is treated as organic growth.\nOperating income for the quarter was $91 million or 2.5% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $61 million of amortization and $88 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions, LaunchPad initiatives and the proposed spin of Fortrea. In addition, the company recorded $270 million of goodwill and other asset impairment, primarily related to the early development business, due to short-term labor and supply constraints. This impairment represents approximately 2% of Labcorp's goodwill and intangible assets. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $510 million or 13.9% of revenue compared to $902 million or 22.2% last year.\nThe decrease in adjusted operating income and margin, was due to a reduction in COVID testing. The benefit from LaunchPad savings and lower personnel expense were essentially offset by lower COVID-related demand and inflationary costs. Our LaunchPad initiative continues to be on track to deliver $350 million of savings, over the 3-year period ending 2024. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 24.6% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings, as well as the benefit from increased R&D tax credits and year-end true-ups for completed tax returns. We expect our 2023 full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 24%.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $76 million or $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.14 in the quarter, down from $6.77 last year, due to lower COVID testing earnings. Operating cash flow was $654 million in the quarter compared to $698 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower COVID test and earnings, partially offset by higher Base Business earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $118 million, down from $150 million last year. For the year, capital expenditures were 3.5% of Base Business revenue, and we expect that to continue into 2023.\nFree cash flow in the quarter was $536 million, bringing our full year free cash flow generation to $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we invested $150 million on acquisitions paid out $64 million in dividends and repurchased $300 million of stock, representing approximately 1.4 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $532 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. The Board recently approved an additional $1 billion for share repurchases, taking our total available authorization to approximately $1.5 billion.\nFor the full year, we invested $1.2 billion on acquisitions, paid out $195 million in dividends and repurchased $1.1 billion of stock. We continue to have a robust pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities, that will supplement our organic growth. In addition, we continue to believe that our shares are undervalued, and that our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy.\nAt year-end, we had $430 million in cash, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 1.9x gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Excluding COVID testing earnings, our leverage was around 2.5x, in line with our targeted range of 2.5 to 3x.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 12.8% compared to last year, primarily due to organic revenue being down 14.3%, which was due to COVID testing, partially offset by acquisitions of 1.7%. COVID testing revenue was down 79% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew organically by 8.6% compared to the Base Business last year.\nThe Ascension lab management agreement contributed approximately 7% of the growth, while the negative impact of weather and fewer revenue days constrained growth by approximately 1.2%. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 6.9%. Total volume decreased 11.8% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 13.8%, primarily offset by acquisition volume of 2%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing. Base Business volume grew 3% compared to Base Business last year including the benefit from acquisitions of 2.4% but was constrained by unfavorable impact from weather and fewer revenue days of approximately 1.2%. Price/mix decreased 1% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 6.4%, currency of 0.3% and acquisitions of 0.2%, partially offset by Base Business growth of 5.9%.\nBase Business price/mix was up 7.6% compared to Base Business last year, benefiting from the Ascension lab management agreement of approximately 7%. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $387 million or 16.9% of revenue compared to $776 million or 29.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing. As the COVID margin was approximately 50% for the quarter, down from approximately 70% last year.\nWe expect the COVID margin to be approximately 50% through the duration of the public health emergency, at which point we would expect the margin to decline but still be above, the segment average. Base Business margin was down approximately 30 basis points due to the impact from Ascension, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. Excluding Ascension, margin would have been up approximately 50 basis points.\nNow I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 4.1% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign currency of 3.1%. Organic Base Business revenues declined 1.4% compared to last year, due to the negative impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these impacts, organic Base Business revenue grew 3.7%. The central lab business continued to be the most constrained by these impacts. Central lab-based business revenues were down 11.5%. However, excluding these impacts, organic constant currency revenue was up 4.7%, while on a comparable basis, early development was up 3.4% and Clinical Development was up 3.2%.\nReported fourth quarter, Drug Development revenues on a compound annual basis grew 5.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $209 million or 15% of revenue compared to $206 million or 14.2% last year. The increase in adjusted operating income and margin was due to LaunchPad savings and lower personnel costs, partially offset by lower COVID-related demand, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and inflationary costs.\nWe ended the quarter with backlog of $16.3 billion, and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog, to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. Now I'll discuss our 2023 full year guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2022, for the full year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted for acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Also, our guidance assumes that Fortrea will be part of Labcorp for the full year. Upon its spin currently anticipated in the middle of the year, we expect to provide updated guidance.\nWe expect Enterprise revenue to grow 1% to 4% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 8.5% to 10.5%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 75% to 90%. This assumes a PCR volume range of 5,000 to 12,000 tests per day, on average for the year. We expect Diagnostics revenue to be down 2% to up 1.5%, compared to 2022. This guidance includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 10.5% to 12.5%, which has approximately 5% growth due to Ascension.\nAt the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 6.4%, including the benefit from Ascension of approximately 2%. We expect Diagnostics Base Business margin to be slightly up in 2023 versus 2022, including the unfavorable mix impact from Ascension.\nWe expect Drug Development revenue to grow 5% to 7% compared to 2022. This guidance includes the positive impact from foreign currency of 20 basis points. At the midpoint of our guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 7.2%, primarily due to organic growth. While we have increased the number of NHP vendors with multiyear agreements to secure supply, lead times are projected to negatively impact Drug Development revenue between $80 million to $100 million, early in the year. As a result, we expect Drug Development first quarter revenue growth to be lower than the average for the year. We also expect Drug Development margin to increase in 2023 compared to 2022, with the first quarter coming in comparable to the first quarter of 2022, due to the early development supply constraint. Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $16 to $18 compared to $19.94 in 2022. Adjusted EPS is expected to be lower compared to 2022, due to COVID testing while Base Business adjusted EPS at the midpoint of guidance implies approximately 13% growth.\nFree cash flow guidance is $1 billion to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in 2022. The decline in cash flow was due to lower COVID testing. In summary, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business. While COVID testing volumes are expected to continue to decline through the year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth, while also returning capital to shareholders, through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

Welcome to the Labcorp Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chas Cook. Sir, please begin.\n\nChas Cook\n\nVP of IR, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Labcorp's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.\nAdditionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2022 guidance and the related assumptions; the proposed spin-off of the Clinical Development business; the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions; future business strategies; expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative, acquisitions and other transactions; and opportunities for future growth.\nEach of the forward-looking statements is subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today to discuss our progress and our performance in the third quarter. I'll start with a few high-level comments about the quarter, then provide a brief update on the planned spin of our Clinical Development business before turning to our quarterly results and progress against our strategy.\nDiagnostics performed very well with Base Business revenue growth of 3.7% over the last year and a 4% CAGR versus 2019. With Ascension in the fourth quarter, we expect full year revenue growth of 6% to 7%. Drug Development Base Business fundamentals remain strong. And our expected full year CAGR of almost 8% since 2019 is consistent with how we expect the business to perform. There are what we believe to be temporary issues that impacted our Drug Development performance in the quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail when outlining our results.\nTurning now to the spin of our Clinical Development business. We are off to a strong start since announcing the planned spin back in July. We were quick to establish a spin management office made up of dedicated people and external advisers with significant spin transaction experience.\nIn addition, working with advisers, we're in the process of identifying members of the executive team, the CEO and the Board of Directors of the new company. And finally, we are making good progress to finding their transition service agreements and preparing the audited financial statements.\nWith the progress to date, we are targeting completion of the spin with an accelerated time frame of mid-2023, subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including those related to the tax-free nature of the separation and the SEC process. Upon completion, we will create 2 strong independent companies through a tax-free transaction. We are excited by the opportunities this spin represents for the Clinical Development business. The new company will have the enhanced strategic flexibility and operational focus to grow, invest, pursue its priorities and address market opportunities.\nFurther, we believe both Labcorp and the new Clinical Development business will emerge from this transaction with the ability to better meet customer needs, drive sustainable and profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns. We plan to provide more information on our progress, including key leadership appointments, in the coming months.\nI'll now turn to third quarter performance. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share was $4.68, and free cash flow was $270 million. Base Business organic revenue for the enterprise, excluding COVID testing revenue, is up 1.4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This demonstrates the strength of our underlying business, particularly in Diagnostics, in a very challenging operating environment marked by rising labor costs, labor shortages and other inflationary pressures.\nIn Diagnostics, Base Business revenue increased about 4% year-over-year due to an uptick in demand in both routine and esoteric testing. We continue to see momentum in our hospital system business. And later, I'll give an update on the Ascension integration, which is off to a very good start.\nIn Drug Development, quarterly Base Business revenue in constant currency is flat versus the prior year. This is driven by a tough year-over-year comparison with less COVID-related work and the impact from the conflict in Ukraine. In central laboratories, there were timing-related challenges when looking at kits out, those that we sent to investigator sites; and kits returned, those that investigators sent back to us to be analyzed. We believe investigators ordered significantly more kits than normal in the third quarter last year to overcome supply issues. This was in addition to the kits for COVID trials.\nThe pace of investigators returning kits has not rebounded as quickly as we expected. We believe this is largely due to COVID-related impacts and the macro environment, and that will return to normal levels over time. Both demand and orders in central laboratories continue to be very strong.\nIn early development, we have strong demand for trial work as well as adequate capacity. However, the impact from our business was due to labor constraints. We are hiring as fast as we can. But like in many parts of the economy, finding labor has been difficult.\nDrug Development Base Business margins for the quarter were 15%, an expansion from last quarter but lower than anticipated due to the revenue in central laboratories and labor shortages in early development. We continue to see a healthy order flow and backlog in Drug Development, and the segment ended the quarter with a 1.25 trailing 12-month book-to-bill.\nAcross Diagnostics and Drug Development, our margins were negatively impacted by rising labor costs and other inflationary pressures. We are taking cost actions, and we're focused on improving margins. In addition, LaunchPad savings continue to help offset the impact of near and expected midterm headwinds. Glenn will provide more detail on our quarterly results in just a moment.\nCOVID PCR testing volumes continued to decline during the quarter, totaling 2.2 million tests performed and averaging 24,000 per day. As we enter the winter amid concerns about rising COVID, flu and RSV cases, we're maintaining adequate supply and capacity to accommodate current and future testing needs. Also, our scientists stand ready to respond as new variants arise.\nI'll now move to our enterprise strategy against which we're executing well by harnessing science, innovation and technology and capitalizing on key opportunities to help us deliver for all stakeholders. Earlier this month, we announced the completion of transactions that established our comprehensive laboratory relationship with Ascension. Our strategic collaboration includes an agreement for Labcorp to manage hospital labs in 10 states and to acquire certain lab assets.\nAt its core, the collaboration expands access to Labcorp's comprehensive capabilities and laboratory services for communities served by Ascension. I'm pleased to report that the transition and the integration are going well, and we are now performing thousands of tests across the health system. This was a big undertaking, and I'd like to thank employees and leadership from Ascension and Labcorp who make the changeover as seamless as possible.\nIn addition to the Ascension agreement, we're focused on accelerating our hospital and health systems business. We completed our acquisition of the outreach lab business and related assets of New Jersey-based RWJBarnabas Health during the quarter, and that integration is also progressing well. Our hospital and local lab acquisition and investment pipeline is very robust, and we see major opportunity now through 2023.\nTurning to oncology. We're furthering our position as a leader in this space through the addition of new testing and screening capabilities. We continue to see benefits from the Personal Genome Diagnostics, an omni [gene] portfolios, including their leading liquid biopsy, tissue-based diagnostics and kitting solutions. We have the broadest portfolio and capabilities in oncology diagnostics today, and we are well positioned for growth.\nWe are also pursuing relationships that accelerate our growth and enhance our portfolio. This quarter, the company formed a strategic partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center Foundation in Spain to increase access to early-phase oncology clinical trials. We also entered a collaboration with Becton, Dickinson and Company to help match patients with critical and potentially life-changing treatments for cancer and other diseases.\nIn addition to our progress in oncology, Labcorp is relentlessly focused on innovating and delivering our customers valuable solutions across all areas to help them achieve their goals. We enhanced our neurology offering in the quarter through the launch of a pan-neoplastic and other neuro autoimmune panels, Together with our previously announced test for brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease, these panels round out our portfolio and give us a leadership position in neuro biomarkers to support customers.\nThe company has seen growing demand for our at-home testing and collection options through Labcorp OnDemand, and our consumer product pipeline is strong. Our FDA authorization, combination COVID, flu, RSV at-home collection test continues to be important with the rise of respiratory virus cases expected this fall and through the winter.\nLastly, Labcorp's commitment to its employees continues to be recognized. We recently were named by the Forbes to its list of World's Best Employers, and we also earned a top score on the 2022 Disability Equality Index.\nIn summary, our base business fundamentals remain strong, and we are well positioned to deliver sustained long-term value and growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our third quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\nRevenue for the quarter was $3.6 billion, a decrease of 11.2% compared to last year due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency translation. This was partially offset by organic Base Business growth and the impact from acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 70% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 0.7% compared to the Base Business last year. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 1.4%.\nOperating income for the quarter was $469 million or 13% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $65 million of amortization and $54 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisitions, the proposed spin of the Clinical Development business, facility rationalization and other LaunchPad initiatives. Excluding these items, the adjusted operating income in the quarter was $589 million or 16.3% of revenue compared to $907 million or 22.3% last year.\nThe decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing and the impact from acquisitions. The benefit from organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings were essentially offset by higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 16.2%. The adjusted tax rate was 22.8% compared to 24.4% last year. The lower adjusted tax rate was primarily due to benefits from increased R&D tax credits. We now expect our annual adjusted tax rate going forward to be approximately 24%. Net earnings for the quarter were $353 million or $3.90 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.68 in the quarter compared to $6.82 last year.\nOperating cash flow was $374 million in the quarter compared to $767 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to lower cash earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $104 million, down from $118 million last year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5% of Base Business revenue.\nFree cash flow was $270 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we invested $459 million on acquisitions, paid out $65 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of stock, representing 1.5 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had over $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to believe that our shares are undervalued, and our share repurchase program is an important part of our capital allocation strategy.\nAt quarter end, we had $400 million in cash, while debt was $5.3 billion. Our leverage was 1.7x gross debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Excluding COVID testing earnings, our leverage was 2.5x, in line with our targeted range of 2.5 to 3x.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 15.7% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 16.4%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.9%. COVID testing revenue was down 70% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 3.7% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the third quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.3%, primarily due to organic growth.\nTotal volume decreased 10.3% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 10.9%, partially offset by acquisition of 0.6%. The decline in volume was due to COVID testing as Base Business volume grew 3.1% compared to the Base Business last year. Price/mix decreased 5.4% versus last year, primarily due to an organic decline of 5.5%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.3%. The lower organic price/mix was due to COVID testing. Base Business price/mix was up 0.6% compared to Base Business last year, benefiting from higher esoteric test mix.\nDiagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $440 million or 19.9% of revenue compared to $775 million or 29.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing as lower COVID volumes caused margins to decline to approximately 50% for the quarter. We expect this margin level to continue through the rest of the year, which would put full year margin at approximately 60%. Base Business margins were flat versus last year as organic growth and LaunchPad savings were offset by higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs.\nNow I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 3.7% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign exchange translation of minus 3.4%. While acquisitions contributed 0.5% of growth, organic Base Business revenues declined 0.7% compared to last year due to the negative impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these impacts, organic Base Business revenue grew 3.8%.\nThe central lab business continues to be the most impacted by lower COVID-related revenues and the impact from Ukraine-Russia crisis. Central lab Base Business revenues were down 9.8%. However, excluding these items, organic constant currency revenue was up 4.1%. While on a comparable basis, early development was up 8.6% and Clinical Development was up 2.3%.\nIn addition, Clinical Development was impacted by the loss of an FSP contract outside the U.S. earlier this year, affecting third and fourth quarter revenue growth. However, recent wins, including a large Phase IV market access program, will support a return to higher growth in 2023. Reported Drug Development revenues grew 3 -- or 6.1% on a compounded annual basis compared to 2019.\nAdjusted operating income for the segment was $211 million or 15% of revenue compared to $226 million or 15.5% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to the reduction of COVID-related work in the Ukraine-Russia crisis. Excluding these issues, margins would have been up approximately 100 basis points compared to last year as the benefit from organic growth and LaunchPad savings were partially offset by inflationary costs and the negative mix impact from acquisitions. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion, and we expect approximately $4.7 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nNow I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of September 30, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.\nWe expect enterprise revenue to decline 6% to 7.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 275 basis points, primarily due to the slower pace of central lab kits shipped and kits received, early development labor constraints, lower COVID testing, the delay in the Ascension transaction and currency. This guidance now includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 3% to 4%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 57% to 59%.\nWe expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 10% to 11.5% compared to 2021. This guidance reflects a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint as the benefit from Ascension will be mostly offset by lower COVID testing demand. Diagnostics Base Business revenue is expected to grow 6% to 7%, an increase of 150 basis points at our midpoint due to Ascension now being reflected in the segment outlook, while it was in our enterprise guidance prior to closing the transaction.\nAt the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 5%. Note that Ascension will be dilutive to Diagnostics AOI margin of approximately 100 basis points in the fourth quarter, but we expect margins to improve going forward as they are fully integrated.\nCOVID testing is now expected to decline 57% to 59%. We expect PCR volume to be between 15,000 to 20,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. We are currently tracking at approximately 15,000 PCR tests per day. We expect Drug Development revenue to decline 1.5% to 2.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 450 basis points, primarily due to the slower pace of kits shipped and kits received in central labs, labor constraints in early development and further currency translation headwinds.\nWe expect the Base Business to decline 1% to 2% compared to 2021. Foreign currency translation negatively impacts our growth rate by 280 basis points. In addition, the growth rate is constrained by lower COVID-related work in the Ukraine-Russia crisis. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 7.7%.\nOur guidance range for adjusted EPS is $19.25 to $20.25, a narrowing of our prior guidance range of $19 to $21.25. At the midpoint, our guidance is lower by $0.38 due to lower COVID testing. In the Base Business, the decreased revenue outlook for Drug Development is being offset by additional cost control measures and the low effective tax rate.\nFree cash flow guidance is now $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion, down from our prior guidance of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. The decline in the cash outlook is due to lower projected cash earnings and higher working capital requirements. The lower cash earnings include the expected decrease in adjusted net earnings, the proposed spin and acquisition-related costs as well as the timing of cash tax payments.\nThe higher working capital requirements, which are timing-related, primarily relates to Drug Development receivable collections as the company continues to work to improve days sales outstanding. Said differently, DSOs remained flat over the past quarter, but our guidance had assumed improvement in the second half of the year.\nIn summary, our Diagnostics business continued to perform well, while our Drug Development business fundamentals remain strong in a challenging environment. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the fourth quarter, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline from the third quarter. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we'll now take questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nThank you. Chas Cook, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nChas Cook\n\nVP of IR, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Labcorp's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both a press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which includes a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call as well as a presentation on additional information on the spin-off of the clinical development business.\nAdditionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2022 guidance and the related assumptions; the proposed spin-off of the clinical development business; the impact of various factors on the company's businesses, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions; future business strategies; expected savings and synergies, including from the LaunchPad initiative and from acquisitions; and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nMore information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Chas, and good morning, everybody. Today, we announced we are pursuing the spin of our clinical development business, and we released our second quarter results. It's an exciting day for Labcorp, and we have a lot to cover.\nSo I'll start with the spin. We are pursuing the spin of our clinical development business to shareholders through a tax-free transaction. This transaction will create 2 leading, independent and global public companies that will each be well positioned to innovate, grow significantly and enhance shareholder value. This announcement marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for our businesses and is a testament to our team's growth mindset, resilience and determination over the last several years.\nThe decision to spin off the clinical development business resulted from our Board and management team's ongoing review of opportunities, including discussions with third parties, that best position us for growth, success with our customers and shareholder value creation. When we announced the conclusion of our strategic review in December of last year, we determined that the company's structure was in the best interest of stakeholders at that time. We reiterated that management and the Board were committed to continuing to evaluate all avenues for enhancing customer and shareholder value. We have now determined that spinning off the clinical development business is the best path forward to achieve this objective.\nThe planned spin will position our businesses to thrive as 2 independent companies with greater strategic flexibility and operational focus to innovate, to pursue their distinct priorities and to better meet customer needs and capture growth opportunities. Each company will benefit from its own capital structure, enhanced investor alignment through a more targeted investment opportunity and a differentiated value proposition.\nEach will be well capitalized and positioned to generate substantial top and bottom line growth with strong free cash flow and attractive returns. We expect this transaction to drive significant value for shareholders as we'll provide investors with the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of 2 leading global businesses in the health care sector.\nThis transaction allows Labcorp to move forward as a strong, global, innovative laboratory services business with significant growth potential. The Labcorp business will include routine and esoteric labs, central labs and early development research labs. In 2021, these businesses supported testing for 82% of the therapeutics submitted to the FDA, tested patients from over 100 countries and performed over 650 million tests globally. Each is a leader in their respective markets.\nThe combination of these businesses creates a cohesive global provider of laboratory-focused services with complementary resources, significant scale and a diverse customer base poised to grow in a global addressable market of over $150 billion.\nLabcorp's customers will continue to benefit from its deep scientific expertise, our innovative mindset, our vast health data and insights as well as our advanced global laboratory network. With a more focused platform for growth, we expect Labcorp will be able to capture upside as we advance innovations to deliver on our customers' future needs.\nOver the last 4 quarters, the lab businesses delivered total revenue of $12.7 billion or $10.5 billion excluding COVID testing revenue. These businesses grew at a 5.5% CAGR from the second quarter 2019 and the second quarter of 2022, excluding COVID testing revenue.\nGoing forward, Labcorp is expected to deliver mid-single-digit annual revenue growth, and we remain firmly committed to our capital allocation strategy and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.\nThe clinical development business will continue to be a leading global provider of Phase I through Phase IV clinical trial management, market access and technology solutions, serving a broad customer base, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations. It will be positioned to compete and to win in a growing and dynamic market, including extending its leadership in oncology, cell and gene therapy, rare diseases and other emerging therapeutic areas.\nThe clinical development business will be able to implement a capital structure that is tailored to support its growth strategy and enhance stakeholder value. Importantly, we expect the clinical development business will retain access to Labcorp's vast health and clinical data set through an arrangement to support clinical development customers with the ability to tap into Labcorp's unique data and capabilities.\nThe clinical development business will be poised to capitalize on its innovation and technology platform to drive significant growth. Over the last 4 quarters, the clinical development business delivered total revenue of $3 billion. This business grew at an 8% CAGR from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2022.\nGoing forward, the clinical development business is expected to deliver high single-digit revenue growth. We will have a strong balance sheet and significant financial flexibility. I want to emphasize that each business has delivered strong performance, and we expect that Labcorp and the clinical development business will be poised for even greater growth as independent, more focused companies. We expect to close the transaction in the second half of next year, and we look forward to sharing more about its progress in the future.\nI'll now move to cover the company's second quarter performance and provide an update on progress against our strategy before turning it over to Glenn. The Base Business in the quarter continued to perform well despite ongoing impacts from COVID, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and foreign exchange rates.\nIn the quarter, revenue totalled $3.7 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $4.96, and free cash flow was $429 million. In Diagnostics, Base Business revenue for the quarter was up 3.9% versus the prior year due to increased demand for both routine and esoteric testing. The Base Business CAGR was 4.3% from 2019 pre-COVID, demonstrating strong, continued underlying performance.\nDrug Development revenue was flat in constant currency data in the quarter versus last year, with growth in early development and clinical development offset by central labs. Central labs was impacted by the significant slowdown in COVID-related work and the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\nOn a CAGR basis, in 2019, pre-COVID, the Drug Development Base Business grew 9%. Margins in Drug Development improved in the quarter to 14.7% and are expected to continue to increase throughout the year. Glenn will provide more detail on our second quarter results in a moment.\nNow I'll provide a brief update on our efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and most recently, assist in the monkeypox outbreak. COVID PCR volumes totalled 2.8 million for the second quarter, averaging 31,000 per day. Time to results remained 1 day on average. With respect to the monkeypox outbreak, in collaboration with the CDC and FDA, we became the first national laboratory to begin testing for monkeypox using the CDC test.\nI'll now turn to progress against our strategy. In addition to today's announcement, we've made significant progress against our strategy by putting science, innovation and technology at the center of all we do. The company introduced multiple innovative and high-quality diagnostics to consumers and physicians in the quarter.\nWe continued to expand our at-home test offerings through Labcorp OnDemand, including a first-of-kind blood collection device for diabetes risk screening. In addition, we launched an FDA-approved men's rapid fertility test. For brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease, in July, we were first to begin offering a test that can help physicians diagnose conditions, including concussions, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\nFinally, we expanded our central labs kit production capabilities to improve delivery and address growing demand across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We announced the planned expansion of our central labs presence and drug development capabilities in Japan in collaboration with BML.\nTurning to oncology. We continue to deepen our leadership position by expanding our cancer-related diagnostics screening and testing portfolio and by partnering with our pharmaceutical clients. During the second quarter, we launched a new skin cancer test that gives doctors actionable insights to help determine the best treatment options. The test is also expected to be used to support clinical trials.\nFor patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, we're collaborating with Lilly and using Labcorp's OmniSeq INSIGHT genomic test to help physicians make more informed and personalized treatment decisions.\nMoving now to new and ongoing partnerships and acquisitions. During the second quarter, we acquired select outreach business assets and agreed to provide ongoing technical support to Prisma Health's hospital laboratories. We completed our acquisition of select clinical outreach business assets from AtlantiCare in New Jersey. We reached an agreement to acquire the clinical outreach business and related assets of RWJBarnabas Health, also in New Jersey. And the previously announced relationship with Ascension is progressing through normal regulatory approvals. We continue to have a very strong pipeline of health system and regional acquisition possibilities, and we look forward to announcing more in the future.\nIn summary, we continue to deliver solid results, improve our performance and execute on our strategy to create long-term value for all stakeholders. We're encouraged by momentum heading into the second half of the year and by the strategic opportunities for Labcorp's growth and impact in the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our second quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\nOverall, the company performed well in the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $3.7 billion, a decrease of 3.7% compared to last year due to lower COVID testing and the negative impact from foreign currency translation. This was mostly offset by organic Base Business growth and acquisitions net of divestitures. COVID testing revenue was down 42% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 1.2% compared to the Base Business last year. Organically, in constant currency, the Base Business grew 1.6%.\nOperating income for the quarter was $526 million or 14.2% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $66 million of amortization and $64 million of restructuring charges and special items, primarily related to acquisition and integration costs, facility rationalization and other LaunchPad initiatives.\nExcluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $656 million or 17.7% of revenue compared to $840 million or 21.9% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%. The adjusted tax rate was also 24.7% compared to 25.1% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be comparable with last year at approximately 25%.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $359 million or $3.87 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS were $4.96 in the quarter compared to $6.13 last year. Operating cash flow was $572 million in the quarter compared to $487 million a year ago. The increase in operating cash flow was due to higher cash earnings and favourable working capital.\nCapital expenditures totalled $143 million, up from $97 million last year, primarily due to timing. As a result, free cash flow was $429 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we invested $100 million on acquisitions, paid out $67 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of stock, representing 1.7 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 4.7% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 5.7%, partially offset by acquisitions of 1.2%. COVID testing revenue was down 42% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 3.9% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 4.3%, primarily due to organic growth.\nTotal volume decreased 2.7% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 3.1% partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.4%. COVID testing volume was down 45% compared to COVID testing last year, while Base Business volume grew 3.4% compared to the Base Business last year. We continue to see Base Business volumes improve as we're now up 0.6% on a compounded basis compared to the second quarter of 2019.\nPrice/mix decreased 2% versus last year, primarily due to an organic decline of 2.6%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.8%. The lower organic price/mix was primarily due to COVID testing as the Base Business was relatively flat. Base Business price/mix benefited from esoteric growing faster than routine testing, but was negatively impacted by payer mix.\nDiagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $516 million or 22.9% of revenue compared to $663 million or 28% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing. COVID testing margins were down compared to last year due to lower testing demand while the company continued to maintain capacity. In addition, margins were negatively impacted by COVID testing payer mix.\nBase Business margins were lower due to higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. Going forward, we expect the second half Base Business margins to be up year-over-year due to improved demand and labor efficiency.\nNow I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 2.9% compared to last year, primarily due to foreign currency translation of 2.6% and lower COVID testing of 0.6%.\nOrganic Base Business growth was negatively impacted by lower COVID-related work, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and lower pass-throughs. Excluding these impacts, organic Base Business revenues grew in the mid- to high single digits.\nBase Business revenues compared to Base Business last year declined 2.3%, but was up 0.4% on a constant currency basis. Early development experienced good growth as did the clinical business, which was constrained by lower pass-throughs.\nCentral labs was down year-on-year but up 6.7% on a compounded basis versus the second quarter of 2019. The decline year-over-year included the impact from lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis. We expect central labs revenue to be up in the second half year-over-year based on the strength of its backlog.\nDrug Development segment revenue was up [8.8%] on a compounded basis relative to the second quarter of 2019 primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $213 million or 14.7% of revenue compared to $221 million or 14.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID-related work, the Ukraine-Russia crisis and inflationary costs. These impacts were partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. In addition, personnel expense was lower due to cost reduction actions and variable compensation.\nIn the second half, we expect top line growth and continued cost reductions to drive margin expansion such that the full year Base Business margin will be comparable to 2021. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion, and we expect approximately $4.8 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nNow I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our first half performance and outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of June 30, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.\nWe expect enterprise revenue to decline 2% to 6% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 50 basis points due to the change in currency. This guidance now includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 5% to 7.5%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 50% to 60%.\nWe expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 9% to 13% compared to 2021. This is an increase at the midpoint by 250 basis points driven by our updated expectations for COVID testing. COVID testing is now expected to decline 50% to 60%, while our Base Business is expected to grow 4% to 6%, unchanged from our prior guidance. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 4.5%, primarily driven by organic growth.\nWe expect Drug Development revenue to grow 1.5% to 3.5% compared to 2021. This is a decrease at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 475 basis points. The decline includes 130 basis point change from foreign currency translation as well as the impact from lower COVID-related revenues and lower pass-through revenues.\nCompared to last year, the guidance range of 1.5% to 3.5% growth includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 230 basis points. This guidance also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 2% to 4% compared to 2021. Excluding lower COVID-related work and the Ukraine-Russia crisis, the constant currency growth rate would be in the high single digits compared to 2021. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 is 9.3%, primarily driven by organic growth.\nOur guidance range for adjusted EPS is now $19.00 to $21.25, an increase at the midpoint of $0.50 compared to our prior guidance. This increase is primarily due to the impact from COVID testing. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.\nIn summary, the company had a solid quarter. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the remainder of the year, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline relative to the first half of this year. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and dividends.\nOperator, we will now take questions."

Welcome to the Labcorp's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chas Cook, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChas Cook\n\nVP of IR, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Labcorp's First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our businesses and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.\nAdditionally, we are making forward-looking statements.

Schechter\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Chas, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, we continued to advance our strategy through science, innovation and technology. We delivered a solid first quarter despite Omicron, which had a significant impact across both businesses in January and continued to impact drug development outside the U.S. throughout the quarter. We remain focused on growth opportunities while continuing to take actions to mitigate inflation.\nIn the Base Business, each month of the quarter was progressively better than the previous one. This positions us well for continued success throughout the year. In the quarter, revenue totaled $3.9 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.11, and free cash flow was $239 million. Diagnostics Base Business volume increased 4.4% versus last year as both routine and esoteric testing saw a significant uptick after an initial slowdown in January.\nIn Drug Development, our book-to-bill remains strong at 1.23 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our backlog increased to $15.2 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year. COVID-related vaccine work was lower versus a year ago across the segment, with the largest impact in clinical trial testing solutions, or CTTS, which primarily consists of our central laboratories operations. While we continue to see some impact from Omicron and the conflict in Ukraine throughout the quarter, overall Drug Development recovered nicely in March, giving us confidence in our 2022 performance and guidance.\nTurning now to COVID-19. Our PCR volume was approximately 70,000 per day for the quarter. Testing rates have since declined, and we expect the decline to continue for the remainder of the year. Time to results for COVID PCR tests is currently 1 day on average. We are maintaining our ability to process 300,000 PCR tests per day, pending supplies and labor, to help the country remain prepared for potential new waves of infections or new variants as a public health emergency persists.\nI'll now highlight examples of progress on our strategy. In oncology, we are fortifying our leadership position by harnessing the scope and the scale of our comprehensive capabilities. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of PGDx, and the integration is going smoothly. PGDx' portfolio of liquid biopsy and tissue-based products enhances our leading oncology capabilities and puts us at the forefront of helping to drive better outcomes for people with cancer. We believe that PGDx' kitted solutions will allow Labcorp to expand genomic profiling globally and help our pharmaceutical clients identify more personalized treatments for patients.\nIn addition, we recently announced a new collaboration with Xcell Biosciences to advance the development of cell and gene therapy research. This follows our previous investment in company and is designed to help clients more effectively bring innovative cell and gene therapies to market.\nNext, Labcorp continues to intensify its customer focus and embed data and digitalization throughout the business. In February, we launched our innovative Labcorp OnDemand digital health platform. We have a pipeline of tests focused on preventive wellness and health monitoring, women's health and family planning and men's health, and we plan to add to those throughout the year.\nSeparately, we introduced a new risk scoring test this quarter for people with advanced liver fibrosis due to NASH. This test helps provide an assessment of the risk of liver disease progression and allows for earlier intervention that can support better patient outcomes. And we became the first U.S. commercial laboratory to offer quantitative tests for detecting and measuring unintentional gluten consumption, which can help with the management of celiac disease.\nLabcorp continues to be committed to pursuing short- and long-term, high-growth opportunities. During the quarter, we entered into and expanded several strategic relationships with hospitals and health systems. Last month, we announced our strategic relationship with Prisma Health, the largest health system in South Carolina. As a part of the arrangement, Labcorp agreed to acquire select outreach business assets and provide ongoing technical support to their hospital laboratories. This allows us to offer Prisma's patients and providers the benefit of enhanced care across multiple clinical areas.\nWe also expanded our relationship with AtlantiCare in New Jersey in the quarter by agreeing to acquire select assets of the organization's clinical outreach business. In addition, we've agreed to purchase the outreach business of St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi. This builds on our 2020 acquisition of the outreach program of Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System.\nAs I previously reported in February, we entered into a comprehensive laboratory relationship with Ascension, one of the U.S. health care's largest systems. The long-term relationship will include our management of hospital labs in 10 states as well as the purchase of select outreach laboratory business assets, and we continue to make progress on planning efforts for this collaboration. As expected, these transactions are scheduled to close later this year.\nOur pipeline of acquisition and investment targets remains robust, and that should result in a very active 2022. We're committed to investing in our employees and continuing to operate responsibly so that we can provide the highest quality services to patients and to customers. We recently issued our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report, which offers insight into the following: our practices and processes to manage our company with integrity; our sustainability journey, including our pursuit of a science-based target to reduce carbon emissions; our commitment to provide employees with an environment in which they can thrive; and our efforts to help address the world's most pressing health care challenges in the communities where we live and work. The report is available through our Investor Relations website, and I'd encourage you to read it to better understand Labcorp's progress and commitments in these important areas.\nIn addition, we continue to take other actions designed to enhance shareholder value. This quarter, we are providing additional information about the quarterly revenue contribution of each Drug Development business unit. And earlier this month, Labcorp initiated a quarterly dividend and announced a cash dividend of $0.72 per share of common stock payable in the second quarter of this year.\nTo sum up, our Base Business continued its recovery across Diagnostics and Drug Development progressively in the quarter despite some headwinds. We continue to execute well against our strategic priorities, and our current momentum in the Base Business, combined with our recent hospital systems, business development announcements sets us up well for success throughout the year.\nSo with that, Glenn will take you through the details of our first quarter results.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our first quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment and conclude with an update on our full year guidance. For reference, we've also included additional business information that can be found in our supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website.\nRevenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 6.3% compared to last year due to lower organic revenue as the negative impact from foreign currency translation was offset by acquisitions. COVID testing revenue was down 43% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 4.5% compared to the Base Business last year.\nOperating income for the quarter was $688 million or 17.6% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $67 million of amortization and $39 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $794 million or 20.4% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 28.4% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 23.4% compared to 24.5% last year. The lower adjusted rate was primarily due to the geographic mix of earnings and stock compensation. We continue to expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be comparable with last year at approximately 25%, excluding any impact from potential tax reform.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $492 million or $5.23 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.11 in the quarter compared to $8.79 last year.\nOperating cash flow was $356 million in the quarter compared to $1.2 billion a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, primarily impacted by COVID testing, and higher working capital requirements, which were mostly timing-related.\nCapital expenditures totaled $117 million compared to $95 million last year. As a result, free cash flow was $239 million in the quarter. We continue to expect to generate between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion of free cash flow for the full year.\nDuring the quarter, we invested $455 million on acquisitions. We were also in the market repurchasing approximately 600,000 shares as part of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed April 1. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.\nNow I'll review our segment performance. Given the enterprise-wide strategic focus on oncology, we are reclassifying our oncology investments in R&D spending. These investments that are not supporting current revenue are being reclassified from our segments to corporate unallocated. This represented $4 million of corporate unallocated expense in the quarter.\nIn our supplemental deck, we have also included additional business information for both segments. For Diagnostics, we provided a breakout of Base Business esoteric versus routine testing revenue as well as payer mix. For Drug Development, we included revenues for its 3 businesses: early development, or ED; clinical trial testing solutions, or CTTS; and clinical development and commercialization services, or CDCS. In addition, we've provided quarterly book-to-bill, quarterly net orders and pass-throughs.\nI'll begin the segment review with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 11% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 11.5%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.5%. COVID testing revenue was down 43% compared to COVID testing last year, while the Base Business grew 5.6% compared to the Base Business last year. Relative to the first quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 3.7%, primarily due to organic growth.\nTotal volume decreased 5% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 5.3% partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.3%. COVID testing volume was down 38% compared to COVID testing last year, while Base Business volume grew 4.4% compared to the Base Business last year. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, Base Business volume levels were relatively flat as the decline we experienced in January due to Omicron rebounded in February and in March.\nPrice/mix decreased 6% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 6.3% partially offset by acquisitions of 0.2% and organic Base Business growth of 0.1%. Base Business price/mix was up 1.2% compared to the Base Business last year, benefiting from an increase in tests per session, esoteric testing growing faster than routine testing and acquisitions.\nDiagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $683 million or 27.8% of revenue compared to $992 million or 36% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to a reduction in COVID testing. COVID testing margins were down compared to last year due to lower testing demand, while the company continued to maintain capacity. Base Business margins were down slightly due to higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings.\nNow I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 1.5% compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth of 4.3% and acquisitions net of divestitures of 0.1%, partially offset by lower COVID testing of 1.7% and foreign currency translation of 1.2%. Base Business revenue compared to Base Business last year grew 3.3% or 4.5% on a constant currency basis. The growth was led by ED. We also experienced good growth in CDCS, although constrained by Omicron and the conflict in Ukraine. CTTS was relatively flat as traditional Base Business growth was offset by lower COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic work as well as the conflict in Ukraine.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Drug Development, Base Business revenue was 10.7%, primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $169 million or 11.6% of revenue compared to $234 million or 16.3% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to lower COVID testing, reduced COVID vaccine and therapeutic work, the impact from the conflict in Ukraine, higher personnel expense and other inflationary costs, which were partially offset by organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings. While margins were down in the quarter, we continue to expect margins to be up for the full year compared to 2021 as the segment benefits from top line growth, targeted price increases and LaunchPad savings. We ended the quarter with backlog of $15.2 billion, and we expect approximately $4.9 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nNow I'll discuss our updated 2022 full year guidance, which reflects our solid first quarter performance and outlook and assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of March 31, 2022, for the remainder of the year. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends.\nWe expect enterprise revenue to decline 1.5% to 5.5% compared to 2021. This is a narrowing of the prior range, with the midpoint growth rate increasing 50 basis points. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 8% to 10%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 70%.\nWe expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 11.5% to 15.5% compared to 2021. This is a narrowing of the prior range and an increase at the midpoint by 100 basis points. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 4% to 6%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 70%. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4.5%, primarily driven by organic growth.\nWe expect Drug Development revenue to grow 6% to 8.5% compared to 2021. This is a reduction at the midpoint of 100 basis points primarily due to the 70 basis point change in foreign currency translation from the prior guidance. In addition, the guidance change reflects the conflict in Ukraine, which was partially offset by the benefit of the acquisition of PGDx. This guidance range of 6% to 8.5% growth over last year includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 110 basis points compared to last year. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 6.5% to 9% compared to 2021. We expect to benefit from growth in all 3 businesses, led by ED and CDCS. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11%, primarily driven by organic growth.\nFor adjusted EPS, we are narrowing our guidance range and increasing the midpoint by $0.38 compared to the prior guidance. Our guidance range is now $18.25 to $21. Free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion.\nFor additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of our 2022 first quarter results and full year guidance compared to our 2019 results.\nIn summary, the company had another quarter of solid performance. We expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business for the remainder of the year, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline. We expect to continue to use our free cash flow generation for acquisitions that supplement our organic growth while also returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and our newly initiated dividend.\nOperator, we will now take questions.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nI'd like to turn the call over to Chas Cook, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nChas Cook\n\nVP of IR, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to Labcorp's Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. As detailed in today's press release, there will be a replay of this conference call available via telephone and Internet. With me today are Adam Schechter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn Eisenberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.labcorp.com, we posted both our press release and an Investor Relations presentation with additional information on our business and operations, which include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial measures discussed during today's call.\nAdditionally, we are making forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimated 2022 guidance as well as the longer-term outlook and the related assumptions of each the impact of various factors on the company's business, operating and financial results, cash flows and/or financial condition, including the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic and market conditions, our responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, future business strategies, expected savings and synergies and opportunities for future growth. Each of the forward-looking statements are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control. More information is included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the SEC. We have no obligation to provide any updates to these forward-looking statements even if our expectations change.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam H. Schechter\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Chas. Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you today.\nLabcorp is carrying on our mission to improve health and improve lives by harnessing the power of science, technology and innovation. In doing so, we're able to execute against our strategy, to deliver strong results for stakeholders and to effectively respond to global challenges like the pandemic.\nOur company rounded out an historic 2021 with another strong quarter that sets the stage for further success in 2022 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $4.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share reached $6.77, and free cash flow was $548 million. For the full year, revenue was $16.1 billion, adjusted EPS totaled $28.52, and free cash flow reached $2.6 billion.\nOur Base Business continued its progress during the quarter, with Diagnostics and Drug Development revenue growing 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively. In Diagnostics, Base Business organic volume increased as esoteric and routine procedures continued their year-over-year growth. Drug Development ended the year with a solid trailing 12-month net book-to-bill of 1.25 and a strong backlog of $15 billion, representing a $579 million increase in the third quarter. Also decentralized clinical trial awards were up 62% over the prior year.\nMoving to the pandemic. Our ongoing response remains an example of how innovation can drive success. For nearly 2 years, Labcorp has dedicated significant resources to [extending] the spread of the virus. We are proud of the progress we've made thus far, though the rise of variants like Omicron and surges and infection rates make it clear that our work is not over.\nWe continue to leverage Labcorp's comprehensive capabilities to expand testing access, to identify and monitor new variants and to advance vaccine and therapy development. In the fourth quarter, COVID testing volumes were greater than anticipated. We have performed over 74 million tests for COVID to date, of which approximately 8.6 million were in the fourth quarter. This heightened demand continued into the new year, although volume is significantly less now than in December or in January.\nTime to results for COVID PCR test remained 1 to 2 days on average even during the latest surge. As we've done throughout the pandemic, we are keeping capacity levels high to quickly respond to spikes and testing needs. We are continuing to invest in equipment, elevated staffing levels and our supply chain. In addition, we remain prepared and staffed to support additional drug development work for vaccines, including boosters, or additional therapies.\nThe company's COVID-related innovations in the quarter included the rollout of observed self-collection for COVID PCR testing at over 1,000 patient service centers. And at the start of the fourth quarter, we announced the receipt of FDA Emergency Use Authorization for a combined COVID and flu at-home collection kit. These offerings are reflective of our work to make COVID testing faster, easier and more accessible.\nI'll now turn to our enterprise strategy, where we made significant progress in 2021. I'll provide a few highlights that will give you a sense of our growth and our forward momentum. In oncology, we made significant strides in fortifying our position as a leader by expanding diagnostic offerings and clinical trial opportunities. At the same time, we followed through on our commitment to improve cancer care access.\nLast year, we formed our Oncology business unit, and we introduced our Enterprise Oncology offering. Genomic profiling of tumors is key to identifying the best targeted therapy for cancer patients. In December, we announced our agreement to acquire Personal Genome Diagnostics, or PGDx. The company has a strong portfolio of innovative liquid biopsy and tissue-based products, which complement our existing capabilities.\nThrough PGDx-kitted solutions, we can provide oncologists access to tumor profiling at the hospitals where the patients are treated or centralized to one of our laboratories. These solutions may also enable us to expand tumor profiling globally to help our pharmaceutical sponsors find the right novel treatment for patients. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of this year.\nOther exciting expansions of our oncology test menu included Clones, the first and only FDA-cleared test for monitoring residual blood cancer; and OmniSinsight, a pan-cancer tissue-based sequencing test for people with late-stage solid tumors. All of these offerings can help physicians make more informed decisions about treatments for their patients and help bring new medicines to market for cancer.\nIn 2021, we intensified our customer focus and embedded technology and data throughout our business. This included improvements to the patient experience in our service centers. These upgrades focused on creating a seamless journey from appointment scheduling to service center visits to easier access to results.\nOur acquisition of Ovia Health enhanced our position as an important source of information for women's health, which we support through diagnostics, genetic and specialty testing expertise as well as clinical trials. We will continue to identify opportunities to enhance Ovia Health's innovative platform that provides family planning, pregnancy and parenting support.\nAdditionally, we began to deploy Labcorp Diagnostics Assistant. This new tool delivers a detailed view of a patient's lab history along with clinical insights directly to the point of care to inform diagnostic decisions. We opened an automated kit production line in Belgium in the spring. And in the fourth quarter, we opened an integrated laboratory in Singapore, which strengthens our bioanalytical services in the Asia Pacific region.\nAnd just this month, we announced the launch of Labcorp On Demand, which builds on the success of Pixel by LabCorp. This suite of health tests and services offers easy and convenient access to a wide variety of trusted tests. It's another way that Labcorp is meeting people where they are and offering more options for people to stay healthy.\nWe pursued numerous opportunities throughout the year that have long-term and high-growth potential. We did tuck-in deals and strategic acquisitions, including OmniSeq, Ovia Health, PGDx and Myriad Autoimmune Vector Test, which analyzes biomarkers to measure rheumatoid arthritis.\nYesterday, we announced a comprehensive strategic agreement with Ascension, one of the largest health systems in the United States. Through our new long-term relationship with Ascension, we will manage its hospital-based laboratories in 10 states, and we will purchase select assets of its Outreach Laboratory business for approximately $400 million. We expect the first year annualized revenues to be between $550 million and $600 million from the combined hospital business and lab asset acquisition.\nWhile operating margins are expected to be less than segment margins initially, they are expected to improve each year. The transaction is expected to be accretive to our earnings and cash flow in year 1 and and should return its cost of capital by year 2. This is a notable opportunity for us and one of the most significant deals of its kind in the sector. It expands our clinical services in several states across the country, and it builds on our strong track record of building similar relationships.\nThe deal with Ascension also underscores our ability to help health systems manage industry-wide shifts. As part of the collaboration, we will explore clinical trial and oncology opportunities that enhance patient access. We look forward to this new partnership and ultimately to welcoming new colleagues to Labcorp.\nWe also reached agreements with other hospitals and hospital systems, including Minnesota-based North Memorial Health. We continue to be excited about our robust M&A pipeline and expect more activity in the coming months.\nIn 2021, we provided the highest-quality service to customers and patients, and we made meaningful investments in our people. In fact, Labcorp has consistently been recognized for the impact of our work and for the value we place on our employees. We were recently named again the Fortune Magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies. And for the fifth consecutive year, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation designated Labcorp as The Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality. We were also named one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2022 by Newsweek.\nImportantly, in 2021, management and the Board of Directors worked with outside advisers, thoroughly reviewed our structure and capital allocation. As part of the comprehensive review of our structure, we had extensive discussions with third parties, and the Board considered a wide range of options, including significant acquisitions, divestitures, spinning off businesses as well as spinning and merging those businesses with strategic partners. The Board unanimously concluded that the company's existing structure is in the best interest of all stakeholders at this time.\nThat said, we continue to believe that Labcorp shares are not fully valued in the marketplace. To that end, we announced several actions designed to further enhance shareholder value. Among them are the initiation of a dividend starting in the second quarter of 2022 as well as a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, $1 billion of which is being repurchased on an accelerated basis.\nWe are also implementing a new LaunchPad business process improvement initiative that targets $350 million in savings over the next 3 years. And today, in addition to giving 2022 guidance, we will also share a longer-term outlook. And beginning with first quarter results, we will provide additional business insights through enhanced disclosures.\nMoving forward, we are committed to profitable growth through investments in science, innovation and new technology. As we execute on our strategy, management and Board will continue to evaluate all avenues for enhancing shareholder value.\nIn conclusion, our strong Base Business performance, coupled with formidable progress against our strategic priorities in 2021, sets us up for long-term success. This gives us great confidence in our longer-term growth-oriented bright outlook, which Glenn will take you through, along with our 2022 guidance. I am proud of what the team at Labcorp accomplished together in 2021, and I am excited for all that's to come this year and into the future as we continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders.\nNow I'll turn it over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn A. Eisenberg\n\nCFO & Executive VP, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings\n\nThank you, Adam. I'm going to start my comments with a review of our fourth quarter results, followed by a discussion of our performance in each segment, our 2022 full year guidance and then conclude with our longer-term outlook through 2024.\nRevenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, a decrease of 9.7% compared to last year, due to declines in organic revenue of 10.3% and divestitures of 0.1%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.6% and favorable foreign currency translation of 10 basis points. The 10.3% decline in organic revenue was driven by a 15.3% decrease in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5% increase in the company's organic base business.\nOperating income for the quarter was $731 million or 18% of revenue. During the quarter, we had $93 million of amortization and $79 million of restructuring charges and special items. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $902 million or 22.2% of revenue compared to $1.4 billion or 31.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing. Excluding COVID testing, the Base Business compared to the Base Business last year experienced higher adjusted operating income and margins due to organic growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs.\nThe tax rate for the quarter was 19.3%. The adjusted tax rate, excluding restructuring charges, special items and amortization, was 24.6% compared to 24.8% last year. Going forward, we continue to expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding any impact from potential tax reform.\nNet earnings for the quarter were $553 million or $5.75 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS, which exclude amortization, restructuring charges and special items, were $6.77 in the quarter, down from $10.56 last year. Operating cash flow was $698 million in the quarter compared to $775 million a year ago. The decrease in operating cash flow was due to lower cash earnings, partially offset by favorable working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $150 million compared to $99 million last year. And as a result, free cash flow was $548 million in the quarter compared to $675 million last year. During the quarter, we used $1 billion of our cash flow for our accelerated share repurchase program and invested $171 million on acquisitions.\nNow I'll review our segment performance, beginning with Diagnostics. Revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 16.9% compared to last year due to organic revenue being down 17.8%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.7% and favorable foreign currency translation of 20 basis points. The decrease in organic revenue was due to a 21.8% reduction from COVID testing, partially offset by a 4.1% increase in the Base Business. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for the Base Business revenue was 5%, primarily due to organic growth.\nTotal volume decreased 8.7% compared to last year as organic volume decreased by 8.9%, partially offset by acquisition volume of 0.3%. The decrease in organic volume was due to a 14.6% decline in COVID testing, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in the Base Business. Price/mix decreased 8.2% versus last year due to lower COVID testing of 7.2% and lower Base Business of 1.6%, partially offset by acquisitions of 0.5% and currency of 0.2%.\nDiagnostics organic base business revenue growth was 7.2% compared to its Base Business last year, with 8.1% coming from volume, partially offset by a 1% decline from price/mix. The price/mix decline was primarily due to the recovery of our Canadian business, which carries a lower average requisition price. Diagnostics adjusted operating income for the quarter was $776 million or 29.6% of revenue compared to $1.2 billion or 39.1% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was due to a reduction in COVID testing.\nCOVID testing margins were down compared to last year, primarily due to a volume decline of approximately 50% while the company continued to maintain capacity. Base Business margins were higher compared to last year due to organic Base Business growth and LaunchPad savings, partially offset by higher personnel costs. Diagnostics achieved its goal to deliver approximately $200 million of net savings from its 3-year LaunchPad initiative.\nNow I'll review the performance of Drug Development. Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to last year due to organic base business growth of 7.9% and acquisitions of 0.3%, partially offset by lower COVID testing performed through its centralized business of 4% and divestitures of 0.3%. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, the compound annual growth rate for Base Business revenue was 9.9%, primarily driven by organic growth. Adjusted operating income for the segment was $206 million or 14.2% of revenue compared to $248 million or 17.8% last year. The decrease in adjusted operating income and margin was primarily due to lower COVID testing.\nIn the Base Business, higher personnel and other inflationary costs as well as investments in oncology capabilities were partially offset by organic growth and LaunchPad savings. We continue to exclude the enterprise component of Drug Development bonus expense, which is reflected in corporate unallocated and totaled $11 million for the quarter. While margins were down in the quarter, they were up for the full year compared to 2020, and we expect margins to continue to increase in 2022.\nFor the trailing 12 months, net orders and net book-to-bill remained strong at $7.3 billion and 1.25, respectively. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $15 billion, an increase of 8.7% compared to last year. And we expect approximately $5 billion of this backlog to convert into revenue over the next 12 months.\nNow I'll discuss our 2022 guidance, which assumes foreign exchange rates effective as of December 31, 2021, for the full year. In addition, the guidance includes the softness we experienced in January due to Omicron, which we expect will rebound through the rest of the quarter. The enterprise guidance also includes the impact from currently anticipated capital allocation, with free cash flow targeted to acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends, which we will initiate in the second quarter.\nWe expect enterprise revenue to decline 1.5% to 6.5% compared to 2021. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 7.5% to 10%, while COVID testing is expected to decline 60% to 75%. We expect Diagnostics revenue to decline 11.5% to 17.5% compared to 2021. This guidance range includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 3.5% to 6%. COVID testing revenue is expected to decline 60% to 75%. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 4.4%, primarily driven by organic growth in both volume and price mix.\nWe expect Drug Development revenue to grow 7% to 9.5% compared to 2021. This guidance includes the negative impact from foreign currency translation of 40 basis points. This guidance range also includes the expectation that the Base Business will grow 7.5% to 10% compared to 2021. Given the amount of capacity we have within Diagnostics, we've assumed that no COVID testing will be performed in Drug Development central lab business in 2022. We expect to benefit from broad-based growth in all 3 businesses, helping drive continued margin improvement in the segment. At the midpoint of our Base Business guidance range, the compound annual growth rate compared to 2019 would be 11.3%.\nOur adjusted EPS guidance is $17.25 to $21.25 compared to 2021 adjusted EPS of $28.52. The adjusted EPS guidance reflects the expectation of lower COVID testing in 2022, while the Base Business continues to profitably grow. Free cash flow is expected to be between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion compared to $2.6 billion in 2021.\nNow I'll discuss our longer-term outlook, which reflects our current view of the business from 2022 to 2024. We expect enterprise Base Business organic revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4% to 7% compared to 2021. We also expect revenue growth from acquisitions to represent additional annual growth of 2% to 3%. We expect Diagnostics Base Business organic revenue to grow at a 2.5% to 4.5% CAGR compared to 2021. This outlook is higher than historical growth driven by a continued recovery in our Base Business relative to 2021, broad-based growth, including hospitals and health systems, and the lower incremental impact of PAMA in the outlook period.\nWe expect Drug Development Base Business organic revenue to grow at a 7% to 10% CAGR compared to 2021. This outlook is higher than our historical growth, and we have added capacity and inorganic investments in the last few years in our faster-growing early development and late-stage clinical businesses.\nAs we continue to emphasize profitable growth, we expect enterprise margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points on average annually through the outlook period compared to 2021, which was approximately 14.5%. This margin expansion is due in part to the company's LaunchPad initiative, which is expected to deliver $350 million of cost savings over the time period to help offset inflationary costs.\nAnd finally, we expect adjusted EPS to grow at an 11% to 14% CAGR compared to 2020 -- '19 adjusted EPS of $11.32. We continue to use 2019 as the base year comparison for earnings growth to better reflect the earnings power of the company, excluding COVID testing. The adjusted EPS outlook reflects the expectation that both base businesses will continue to profitably grow organically. In addition, we expect to benefit from capital allocation directed towards accretive acquisitions and share repurchases while keeping within our targeted gross debt leverage of 2.5 to 3x.\nFor additional comparison purposes, we've also included in the supplemental deck on our Investor Relations website a view of 2021 fourth quarter and full year results, 2022 guidance and our longer-term outlook.\nIn summary, the company had another quarter of strong performance. We remain focused on performing a critical role in response to the global pandemic while also growing our Base Business. For 2022, we expect to drive continued profitable growth in our Base Business, while COVID testing volumes are expected to decline through the year. In addition, our longer-term outlook is expected to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth driven by top line growth, margin improvement and capital allocation.\nOperator, we'll now take questions."

Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO. We issued third quarter 2025 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our investor website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately one month.\nAs a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements certainly predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website and at sec.gov. Actual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nWe have posted historical financial statements with corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, if applicable. And our third quarter 2025 conference call slides on our website under quarterly results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and discuss performance from our two operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and comment on our views for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nI'm pleased to report third quarter revenues, Clear Aligner volumes and non-GAAP operating margins are all above our outlook. Our Q3 results reflect year-over-year growth in Clear Aligner volumes, driven primarily by EMEA and APAC and Latin American regions as well as strong sequential growth from APAC and Latin American regions, driven primarily by Teens and Kids category. Our Q3 Systems and Services revenues were down year-over-year and sequentially as expected, given Q3 capital equipment seasonality.\nQ3 non-GAAP operating margin of 23.9% was above our outlook of approximately 22%. While activity in the orthodontic and dental markets remains mixed, especially in North America, the initiatives we're taking to drive consumer demand and patient conversion, including working with our DSO partners are delivering results, and we continue to focus on execution of these go-to-market programs.\nIn addition to the breadth and depth of our global business and product portfolio and consumer preferences for the Align brand are unique advantages that provide balance in a dynamic global market. In fact, the year-over-year Clear Aligner volume growth rate improved from Q2 to Q3 for our top 10 country markets except for Canada.\nFor Q3, total revenues of $996 million increased 1.8% year-over-year and decreased 1.7% sequentially. Q3 Clear Aligner revenues of $806 million increased 2.4% year-over-year and were up slightly sequentially. Q3 Clear Aligner volume of 648,000 cases increased roughly 5% year-over-year and was up slightly sequentially. Q3 Imaging systems and CAD/CAM services revenues of $190 million decreased slightly year-over-year and was down 8.6% sequentially.\nFor Q3, Systems and Services revenues decreased sequentially as expected primarily due to seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Systems and Services revenues decreased slightly, primarily due to lower volumes, offset somewhat by increased scanner services and exocad CAD/CAM sales.\nQ3 revenues also reflect strong growth from the iTero scanner leases, an important option for doctors that enables greater access to our advanced digital technology. At the end of Q3, the installation of active iTero systems, which includes sales and leasing continues to expand, and there are over 120,000 units globally, a 12% year-over-year increase. From a regional perspective, Q3 scanner sales increased sequentially in North America among GPs as well in Latin America and APAC regions. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 scanner sales increased in EMEA and Latin American regions.\nITero Lumina with iTero multi-direct capture technology such a new standard with effortless scanning and superior visualization, helping doctors transition to our advanced imaging systems. For Q3, iTero Lumina represented over 90% of our full system units, and we're still driving adoption and utilization through and upgrades as well as new full systems installations.\nToday, we announced a series of new product innovations for iTero Digital Solutions, a comprehensive ecosystem that includes inter-oral scanners, integrated software tools designed to transform dental consultations into a modern multimodal oral health assessment that helps doctors and their teams deliver exceptional chairside experiences supporting Invisalign treatment conversion. These new capabilities span key practice workflows that underline the Align digital workflow. From AI-enabled X-ray assessment to dynamic personalized visualization and patient engagement tools at chairside to expand compatibility with 3D printers and milling machines. These new innovations simplify workflows, improve doctor-to-patient communications, increased patient acceptance and drive practice growth. More information on these innovations is available in today's press release and our webcast slides.\nFor Exocad, Q3 revenues increased sequentially and year-over-year. During Q3, we began piloting Exocad ART in several countries in Europe. And based on the initial learnings, we're expecting to expand to more countries in 2026. Exocad ART stands for Advanced Restorative Treatment, a module with exocad dental CAD software that bridges orthodontics and restore the dentistry. It enables orthodontists, dentists and dental labs to integrate tooth alignment with restorative procedures and deliver better function, less invasive restorations and longer lasting and aesthetically superior treatment outcomes. Exocad ART further extends the value of the Align Digital platform with comprehensive digital workflows and integrated solutions from Invisalign, iTero and Exocad.\nFor Clear Aligners, Q3 worldwide volumes were up 0.5% sequentially and up 4.9% year-over-year. For Q3, 88,000 doctors globally submitted Invisalign cases an all-time record, driven primarily by the GP channel. In addition, Q3 reflects a new all-time high for the number of doctors submitting Invisalign case starts for teens and kids. On a sequential basis, Q3 Clear Aligner volumes reflect strength from the international adult and teen patients as well as North American DSO adult patients, partially offset by the North American retail, Dr. [indiscernible]. Year-over-year, Q3 Clear Aligner volume reflects strong growth across the APAC and EMEA regions, offset somewhat by North America. Q3 Clear Aligner volumes increased year-over-year for both orthodontists and GPs driven by growth across adults, teens and kids and continued strength by DSOs.\nFrom a product perspective, for Q3, we had strong year-over-year growth from Invisalign First, DSP touch-up cases, Invisalign Palatal expander, retention, including DSP as well as continued mix shift from non-comprehensive Clear Aligner products.\nFor the Americas, Q3 Clear Aligner volumes were down year-over-year, primarily due to North America, partially offset by continued growth in Latin America. Despite lower volumes, increased adoption of several products, including Invisalign First for Teens and Kids, Invisalign DSP touch-up cases, including retention and the Invisalign Palatal Expander system continued.\nWe also saw double-digit growth year-over-year from North America DSOs. Given the economies of scales and more effective optimal cost structures inherent in their business model, we anticipate that our DSO partners will continue to grow their Invisalign business and are one of the best examples of how to incorporate our digital technology and workflows to accelerate practice growth. To offset a financial barrier for patients interested in Invisalign treatment, a line in Healthcare Finance Direct, or HFD are partnering to increase the affordability of treatment. HFD is a preferred patient financing partner and provides our Invisalign trained doctors with greater options to support their patients and enhance their practices. Among DSOs and doctors enrolled in HFD enrollment is growing, and we have noticed an incremental lift in Invisalign treatment that we expect will continue.\nIn the EMEA region, Q3 Clear Aligner volumes grew double digits year-over-year, driven by increased submitters and utilization in the orthodontic channel with strength in teens, kids and adult categories. This performance reflects continued adoption of non-comprehensive products, including moderate DSP touch-up cases, including retention and Invisalign Palatal expander as well as Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 and Invisalign First within our comprehensive portfolio. During the quarter, we saw strong double-digit DSO growth in EMEA on a year-over-year basis.\nFor the APAC region, Q3 Clear Aligner volume grew double digit year-over-year, reflecting increased [ submitters ] and utilization across both the GP and orthodontics channel, across teens and growing kids led by China. Invisalign First continues to contribute to year-over-year growth, where the growing patient portfolio provides a significant opportunity in the region with some of the highest rates of complex malocclusion. DSO performance has also -- is also up double digits on a year-over-year basis, led by China and Japan. In addition, Q3 strong retention performance on a year-over-year basis reflects increasing submitters and utilization across both the GP and orthodontist channel.\nIn Q3, over 256,000 teams and growing kids started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners. This number represents a 14.7% sequential increase, primarily due to strength in APAC, North America and Latin America, partially offset by softer performance in EMEA due to seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, case starts increased 8.3%, driven by growth in APAC, EMEA and Latin America, partially offset by North America.\nFrom a product standpoint, Invisalign First and Invisalign Palatal expander or IPE, continued to drive growth year-over-year across all regions. During the quarter, we achieved a record number of teen and kids cases shipped in a quarter, representing a record 40% mix of total Clear Aligner cases shipped. For Q3, the number of doctors submitting cases starts for teens and kids was up 3.8% year-over-year, led by continued strength from doctors treating young kids or growing patients with Invisalign First aligners and Invisalign Palatal expander.\nDuring Q3, we continued to roll out the Invisalign Palatal expander system and Invisalign System with Mandibular Advancement featuring Occlusal Blocks or what we call MAOB. IPE offers a more hygienic and comfortable alternative to traditional metal expanders that has proven clinically effective at achieving the expansion doctors want for their patients. MAOB is designed to create Class II skeletal and dental malocclusions in growing patients ages 10 to 16 by simultaneously advancing the mandible and aligning the teeth. By integrating solid occlusal blocks into Clear Aligners, MAOB offers greater durability and vertical opening for early mandibular advancement, precision wings that guide to lower jaw forward and SmartTrack material and SmartForce features for predictable tooth movement.\nToday announced ClinCheck Live plan. It's a new feature in Invisalign digital treatment planning that automates the generation of initial doctor ready treatment plans in 15 minutes. This advancement represents a major technical milestone for the Align Digital platform that can reduce the Invisalign treatment planning cycle from days to minutes. ClinCheck Live plan is built on Align's proprietary data and algorithms derived from decades of research and development and the experience of doctors who have treated more than 21 million Invisalign patients worldwide. With ClinCheck Live plan, doctors have the option to treatment plan in the moment and can receive a fully customized initial ClinCheck treatment plan in about 15 minutes after submitting an eligible case with Flex Rx. Doctors then have the option to review the proposed tooth movements and approve the case while the patient is still in the office. This can enable the doctor to receive and approve the treatment plan faster, which can lead to the patients starting Invisalign faster, ultimately increasing the office efficiency and improving the patient experience.\nOver the past few years, Align has introduced a range of new treatment planning tools to enhance consistency, doctor control, and speed and treatment planning. I often refer to these innovations as touchless ClinCheck or ClinCheck in minutes to emphasize the potential for the software to totally transform the treatment planning experience for doctors and their patients. To that end, we continue to make great progress in automation with machine learning and AI-powered technologies that are the foundation of our next-generation treatment planning offerings. I'm excited by our continued progress and Immeasurable impact we are beginning to see. The use of Invisalign Flex Rx has doubled every year and to date, over 1 million Invisalign cases have been submitted through Flex Rx for personalized treatment plans. In addition, we now have over 100 Invisalign Palatal expander clinical cases published in the Align Global Gallery, both unprecedented milestones for new product introductions in the orthodontic market.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nChief Financial Officer & SVP-Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $995.7 million, down 1.7% from the prior quarter and up 1.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q3 revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $11.7 million or approximately 1.2% sequentially and were favorably impacted by approximately $15.6 million year-over-year or approximately 1.6%.\nQ3 Clear Aligner revenues were $805.8 million, slightly up primarily due to favorable foreign exchange and a price increase in the U.K. on August 1, partially offset by product mix shift to lower prices, lower-priced countries and products. Favorable foreign exchange impacted Q3 Clear Aligner revenues by approximately $9.8 million or approximately 1.2% sequentially. Q3 Clear Aligner average per case shipment price was $1,245, a $5 decrease on a sequential basis primarily due to slightly more pronounced product mix shift to lower-priced countries and products, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and a price increase in the U.K. On a like-for-like basis, Q3 Clear Aligner ASPs for the U.S. and EMEA were up sequentially.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Q3 Clear Aligner revenues were up 2.4%, primarily from higher volume, price increases and favorable foreign exchange, lower net deferrals, partially offset by higher discounts and product mix shift to lower-priced countries and products. Favorable foreign exchange impacted Q3 Clear Aligner revenues by approximately $13 million or approximately 1.6% year-over-year. Clear Aligner average per case shipment price was $1,245, down $30 on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to discounts and product mix shift to lower price countries and products, partially offset by price increases and favorable foreign exchange. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 decreased $19.5 million or 1.6% sequentially and decreased $78.7 million or 6.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as additional aligners are shipped under each sales contract.\nQ3 Systems and Services revenues of $189.9 million were down 8.6% sequentially, primarily due to lower scanner on sales and scanner system sales, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and higher nonsystem sales. Q3 Systems and Services revenues were down 0.6% year-over-year primarily due to lower scanner system sales, partially offset by higher scanner on sales, higher nonsystem sales and favorable foreign exchange. Foreign exchange favorably impacted Q3 Systems and Services revenues by approximately $1.8 million sequentially or approximately 1%.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.6 million or approximately 1.4%. Systems and Services deferred revenues decreased $7.9 million or 4% sequentially and decreased $30.9 million or 13.9% year-over-year, due in part to shorter duration of service contracts selected by customers on initial scanner system purchases.\nMoving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 64.2%, down 5.7 points sequentially and down 5.5 points year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring and other noncash charges, impairment on assets held for sale, depreciation expense on assets to be disposed of other than by sale and excess inventory write-off, partially offset by operational efficiencies. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of 0.4 points sequentially and 0.6 points on a year-over-year basis. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of the above-mentioned restructuring and other noncash charges, gross margin for the third quarter was 70.4%, down 0.1 points sequentially and flat year-over-year.\nClear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 64.9%, down 5.2 points sequentially primarily due to restructuring and other noncash charges, Foreign exchange favorably impacted Clear Aligner gross margin by approximately 0.4 points sequentially. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was down 5.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to the restructuring and other noncash charges, partially offset by operational efficiencies. Foreign exchange favorably impacted Clear Aligner gross margin by approximately 0.6 points year-over-year.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was 61.3%, down 8.2 points sequentially primarily due to excess inventory write-off. Foreign exchange favorably impacted the Systems and Services gross margin by approximately 0.4 points sequentially. Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was down year-over-year, primarily due to excess inventory write-off, foreign exchange favorably impacted the Systems and Services gross margin by approximately 0.5 points year-over-year.\nQ3 operating expenses were $542.9 million, down 0.4% sequentially and up 4.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were $2.2 million lower primarily due to lower consumer marketing spend, partially offset by restructuring costs. Year-over-year operating expenses increased $23.4 million, primarily due to restructuring costs and partially offset by lower consumer marketing spend. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $463.3 million, down 6.9% sequentially and 2% year-over-year.\nOur third quarter operating income of $96.3 million resulted in an operating margin of 9.7%, down approximately 6.4 points sequentially and down approximately 6.9 points year-over-year due to Q3 restructuring and other charges of $36.3 million, primarily related to post-employment benefit and other noncash items, including the impairment of assets held for sale, depreciation expense on assets to be disposed of other than by sale and impairment loss on inventory for an aggregate of $88.3 million. Operating margin was favorably impacted from foreign exchange by approximately 0.4 points sequentially and 0.5 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, impairments on assets held for sale impairment loss on inventory, depreciation expense on assets disposed of other than sale and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating margin for the third quarter was 23.9% up 2.6 points sequentially and up 1.8 points year-over-year.\nInterest and other income and expense net for the third quarter was an expense of $1.6 million compared to an income of $10.5 million in Q2 '25, primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations on open assets and liabilities. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 interest and other income and expense was unfavorable compared to an income of $3.6 million in Q3 2024, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange movements and lower interest income. The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 40.1% compared to 28.2% in the second quarter and 30.1% in the quarter of the prior year. The third quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the second quarter effective tax rate and the third quarter effective tax rate of the prior year, primarily due to the change in our jurisdictional mix of income due to restructuring, partially offset by lower U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings and changes in the newly enacted tax law. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 20% which reflects our long-term projected tax rate.\nThird quarter net income per share was $0.78, down $0.93 sequentially and down $0.77 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was favorably impacted by $0.02 on a sequential basis and $0.03 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.61 for the third quarter up $0.11 sequentially and up $0.26 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $1.0046 billion, up sequentially $103.4 million and down $37.3 million year-over-year. Of the $1.0046 billion balance, $190.8 million was held in the U.S. and $813.8 million was held by our international entities.\nDuring Q3, we repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock at an average share price of $136.77. These repurchases were made pursuant to the $200 million open market repurchase plan announced on August 5, 2025, which we expect will be completed in January of 2026. As of September 30, 2025, 928.4 million remains available for repurchase of our common stock under our previously announced April 2025 repurchase program.\nQ3 accounts receivable balance was $1.0994 billion down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 101 days, up approximately 2 days sequentially and up approximately 8 days as compared to Q3 2024 and primarily reflects flexible payment terms that are part of our ongoing efforts to support Invisalign practices.\nCash flow from operations for the third quarter was $188.7 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $19.8 million primarily related to investments in our manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures amounted to $169 million.\nI'd like to provide the following remarks regarding U.K. VAT and U.S. tariffs as of September 30. As previously disclosed in our Q3 earnings release and conference call on July 30, 2025, we stopped charging VAT to impacted customers in the U.K. As of August 1, 2025, our invoices no longer include the U.K. VAT rate of 20% for all Invisalign treatment packages that were ClinCheck approved as of August 1, 2025, and for refinement and replacement aligners, Vivera Retainers, PVS processing fees and additional aligners placed on or after August 1, 2025. At the same time, we simultaneously adjusted prices for our Clear Aligners and retainers to keep the overall price consistent. Currently, we do not expect a material change to our result of operations as a consequence of the latest U.S. tariff actions, and we refer you to our Q1 2025 press release and earnings materials as well as our Q2 2025 webcast slides which includes specifics regarding potential tariffs impacts of U.S. tariffs. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, such as foreign exchange, macroeconomic conditions and changes to our current applicable duties, including tariffs and other fees that could impact our business.\nWe provide the following business outlook for Q4. We expect Q4 2025 worldwide revenues to be in the range of $1.025 billion to $1.045 billion, up sequentially from Q3 of 2025. We expect Q4 Clear Aligner volume and Clear Aligner average selling price to be up sequentially from favorable geographic mix. We expect Q4 2025 Systems and Services revenues to be up sequentially, consistent with typical Q4 seasonality. We expect Q4 2025 worldwide GAAP gross margins to be 65.5% to 66%, up sequentially from higher revenue, lower restructuring and other charges noncash items, such as impairment loss on assets held for sale and impairment loss on inventory, partially offset by higher depreciation on assets disposed of other than by sale.\nWe expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 71%. We expect our Q4 2025 GAAP operating margin to be 15.3% to 15.8% up sequentially, primarily from lower restructuring and other charges, noncash items such as impairment loss on assets held for sale and impairment loss on inventory partially offset by higher depreciation on assets disposed of other than by sale. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 26%.\nFor fiscal 2025, we expect 2025 Clear Aligner volume growth to be mid-single digits and revenue growth to be flat to slightly up from 2024, assuming foreign exchange at current spot rates. We expect fiscal 2025 GAAP operating margin to be around 13.6% to 13.8%, down year-over-year due to higher restructuring and other charges and the incurrence of noncash charges expected to be approximately $145 million to $155 million primarily for the impairment loss on assets held for sale, depreciation on assets disposed of other than by sale and impairment loss on inventory, partially offset by lower legal settlement loss. Most of the onetime charges will be noncash with the expected cash outlay for 2025 estimated to be around $45 million. We expect the 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 22.5%.\nWe expect our investments in capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 to be approximately $100 million, capital expenditures primarily relate to technology upgrades.\nWe are nearing completion of the restructuring actions that are intended to sharpen operational focus, reduce ongoing costs and enhanced capital efficiency. For fiscal 2026, we expect these restructuring actions as well as other initiatives to improve our GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin by at least 100 basis points year-over-year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. In summary, I'm pleased with our third quarter results and encouraged by the sequential and year-over-year growth in the Clear Aligner segment as well as the continued expansion of our digital scanning solutions and footprint. While the North American retail doctor channel remains mixed, we continue to see strength in our other key geographies and areas of our portfolio, including teens and kids, and digital workflow innovation as demonstrated by continued strong double-digit year-over-year growth by our DSOs.\nOur investment in AI-powered treatment planning software, direct 3D printing of aligners and next-generation iTero Lumina scanning technology are key to helping doctors deliver better outcomes, more effectively and efficiently, while enhancing the patient experience. Looking ahead, we intend to remain flexible in navigating headwinds in the U.S. dental market and are committed to supporting our doctor customers with localized marketing, education and clinical support across all regions. We're making good progress against our strategic initiatives to drive long-term growth across our business, and we're excited about the opportunities to further expand our reach, deepen engagement with consumers and providers and deliver value to our shareholders.\nBefore we wrap up, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to the doctors around the world who continue to trust the Align team and our technology to transform smiles and change lives. Your partnership and commitment to patient care inspire us every day. We appreciate your continued support and confidence. I also want to thank our employees who continue to demonstrate agility, innovation and resilience in everything they do to deliver and extend our leadership in digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry.\nWith that, I thank you for your time today, and I'll turn it over to the operator.

Welcome to the Align Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technology. You may begin.\n\nShirley Stacy\n\nVice President of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.\nWe issued second quarter 2025 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 1 month.\nAs a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website and at sec.gov. Actual results may vary significantly and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nWe have posted historical financial statements with corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, if applicable, and our second quarter 2025 conference call slides on our website under quarterly results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technologies President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss performance from our 2 operating segments, system services and clear aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nOn our second quarter results were mixed. Total Q2 revenues at $1.012 billion reflect a solid year-over-year revenue growth for systems and services driven primarily by stronger-than-expected sales of iTero Lumina Scanner want upgrades, offset by lower-than-expected sales of full iTero Lumina Systems and a slight year-over-year decrease in clear aligners revenues, driven primarily by lower-than-expected volumes in Europe and North America. As a result, Q2 worldwide revenues and operating margins were below our Q2 outlook.\nDuring Q2, we continued to see strong consumer interest in Invisalign treatment as reflected by iTero scans and Invisalign doctor case submissions. However, we experienced uneven patient case conversion, which led to a lower than typical seasonal uptick in case starts, which historically occurred late in the quarter. As we assessed our Q2 results and the activity in our customers' offices, we believe it was impacted in part by U.S. tariff turmoil in and outside the United States and less affordable financing options for orthodontic treatment as well as for capital equipment purchases.\nRecent Dental industry surveys for the second quarter suggest that there was less overall patient traffic, fewer orthodontic case starts and patient hesitation toward elective procedures. 2025 marks the fourth consecutive year of orthodontic starts being down. And third-party resource reports indicate that practices that use both wires and brackets and clear aligners may often have shifted more of their case starts to metal braces in Q2. Uncertainty not only impacts the consumer purchasing decisions, but also the decisions that doctors make, especially practices, we still use wires and brackets and weigh the sum cost of their inventory and their available time over investing in digital solutions during times of financial uncertainty.\nAs we begin the third quarter and plan for the remainder of the year, our outlook anticipates the potential continued economic uncertainty and spending hesitancy that impacted demand for our clear aligners and new iTero Scanning Systems in the second quarter. Even though we know consumer interest in Invisalign treatment remains strong, we're continuing to drive engagement and effectiveness of commercial marketing programs that leverage our innovation and new product cycle across our clear aligners and scanners, especially those for teens and kids. And at the same time, we're evaluating actions to reduce costs and thoughtfully manage our investments.\nFor Q2, total revenues were $1,012.4 million, up $3.4 million sequentially and down 1.6% year-over-year. In our Systems & Services segment, Q2 '25 revenues were $207.8 million, an increased 13.9% sequentially and increased 5.6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting solid revenue driven by iTero Lumina, wind upgrades and increased services as more doctors transition to iTero Element 5D plus to the advanced iTero Lumina.\nThe iTero Lumina Scanner makes up a majority of iTero Scanner systems mix. For clear aligners, Q2 '25 worldwide volumes were up slightly sequentially and year-over-year. Year-over-year Q2 clear aligner volumes reflect growth across the APAC and EMEA regions, offset somewhat by the Americas regions. From a product perspective, Q2, we had a strong year-over-year growth from Invisalign First, DSP touch-up cases, Invisalign Pallet expander and retention, including DSP, and as well as continued mix shift to noncomprehensive clear aligner products. From a channel perspective, Q2 clear aligner volumes increased slightly year-over-year in both orthodontists and general practitioner or GP dentist channels, with strong year-over-year growth from dental service providers.\nGrowth in total submitters were primarily driven by strength in the orthodontic channel while increased utilization was led by the GP channel. Notably, we also achieved a record number of doctors shipped to for the second quarter. For the Americas, Q2 aligner volumes were down slightly year-over-year and reflects solid growth in Latin America segment offset by lower volumes in North America. Despite lower volumes, adoptions increased across several key product offerings, including Invisalign First for teens and Kids, Invisalign DSP touch-up cases and Invisalign Pallet expander system.\nIn the EMEA region, Q2 clear aligner volume grew year-over-year, driven by increased utilization across both orthodontists and GP dentist channels, with strength in the adult segment. This performance reflects continued adoption of noncomprehensive Invisalign offerings, particularly in moderate and DSP touch-up cases, including retention as well as Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3, and Invisalign First within our comprehensive portfolio.\nFor the APAC region, Q2 clear aligner volume grew year-over-year, reflecting increased submitters across both orthodontists and GP channels, across teens and kid patients led by China. From a product standpoint, Invisalign First was a key contributor to year-over-year growth, reflecting rising demand for early intervention solutions.\nIn Q2, over 223,000 teens and growing kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners, this number represents a 1.1% sequential decline, primarily due to softer performance in EMEA and APAC, despite the continued strength in the Americas. On a year-over-year basis, case starts increased 3%, driven by growth in APAC and EMEA and Latin America, partially offset by North America. From a product standpoint, Invisalign First was a key year-over-year growth driver across all regions. Additionally, the Invisalign Palate Expander system contributed to year-over-year growth in North America.\nDuring the quarter, we achieved a record number of teen cases for the second quarter. Additionally, we've surpassed a significant milestone. Over 6 million teens and kids have now been treated with the Invisalign system globally. For Q2, the number of doctors submitted case starts for teens and kids was up 3.5% year-over-year, led by continued strength from doctors treating young kids and growing patients with Invisalign First and Invisalign palate expanded.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nChief Financial Officer & SVP-Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1,012.4 million, up 3.4% from the prior quarter and down 1.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $26.4 million or approximately 2.7% sequentially and were favorably impacted by approximately $5.6 million year-over-year or approximately 0.6%.\nFor clear aligners, Q2 revenues of $804.6 million were up 1% sequentially, primarily from favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher discounts. Favorable foreign exchange impacted Q2 clear aligners revenues by approximately $21.6 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially.\nQ2 clear aligner average per case shipment price of $1,250 increased by $10 on a sequential basis, primarily due to the impact of favorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 clear aligner revenues were down 3.3%, primarily due to lower ASPs from discounts and product mix shift to lower-priced products, partially offset by a price increase. Favorable foreign exchange impacted Q2 clear aligner revenues by approximately $4.5 million or approximately 0.6% year-over-year. Q2 clear aligner average per case shipment price of $1,250 was down $45 on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to discounts and a product mix shift to lower-priced products, partially offset by a price increase in Q1 2025 and favorable foreign exchange.\nClear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2025, increased $1.4 million or 0.1% sequentially and decreased $65.5 million or 5.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as additional aligners are shipped under each sales contract. Q2 Systems & Services revenues of $207.8 million were up 13.9% sequentially primarily due to higher scanner system revenue and favorable foreign exchange. Q2 Systems & Services revenues were up 5.6% year-over-year, primarily due to an increase in scanner and wind upgrade revenue, higher nonsystem revenues and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower scanner system sales.\nForeign exchange favorably impacted Q2 Systems & Services revenue by approximately $4.8 million or approximately 2.3%, sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems & Services revenue were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1 million or approximately 0.5%. Systems & Services deferred revenues decreased $7.6 million or 3.7% sequentially and decreased $24.5 million or 10.9% year-over-year, due in part to the shorter duration of service contracts selected by customers on initial scanner system purchases.\nMoving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 69.9%, up 0.5 points sequentially and down 0.3 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of 0.8 points sequentially and 0.2 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 70.1%, down 0.5 points sequentially primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by freight savings. Foreign exchange favorably impacted clear aligner gross margin by approximately 0.8 points sequentially.\nClear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 0.7 points year-over-year due primarily due to lower ASPs, partially offset by freight savings. Foreign exchange favorably impacted clear aligner gross margin by approximately 0.2 points year-over-year. Systems & Services gross margin for the second quarter was 69.4%, up 4.7 points sequentially due to higher scanner system ASPs and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by tariffs. Foreign exchange favorably impacted the Systems & Services gross margin by approximately 0.7 points sequentially.\nSystems & Services gross margin for the second quarter was up 1.3 points year-over-year due to manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by tariffs and lower scanner ASPs. Foreign exchange favorably impacted the Systems & Services gross margin by approximately 0.1 points year-over-year.\nQ2 operating expenses were $545.1 million, down 0.7% sequentially and down 5.3% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were $3.9 million lower, primarily due to lower legal settlements not reoccurring in Q2 '25. Year-over-year operating expenses decreased by $30.5 million, primarily due to legal settlements not recurring in Q2.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, legal settlements and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $497.6 million, down 0.6% sequentially and down 0.4% year-over-year.\nOur second quarter operating income of $163 million resulted in an operating margin of 16.1%, up 2.7 points sequentially and up 1.7 points year-over-year. Operating margin was favorably impacted from foreign exchange by approximately 1.2 points sequentially and 0.2 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, legal settlements and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating margin for the second quarter was 21.3%, up 2.3 points sequentially and down 1 point year-over-year.\nInterest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was an income of $10.5 million compared to an income of $9.3 million in Q1 of '25, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange movement of $10.1 million, partially offset by lower interest income. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 interest and other income and expense were favorably compared to an expense of $3.2 million in Q2 of 2024, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange movements.\nThe GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 28.2% compared to 33.6% in the first quarter and 32.9% in the second quarter of the prior year. The second quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to discrete tax expenses related to stock-based compensation recognized in Q1 of 2025 that did not occur in Q2 of 2025. The second quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the second quarter effective tax rate of the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in U.S. taxes on foreign earnings, partially offset by a change in our jurisdictional mix of income. On a non-GAAP basis, effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, which reflects our long-term projected tax rate.\nSecond quarter net income per diluted share was $1.72, up $0.45 sequentially and up $0.43 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was favorably impacted by $0.26 on a sequential basis and $0.13 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.49 for the second quarter, up $0.36 sequentially and up $0.09 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2025, cash and cash equivalents were $901.2 million, up sequentially $28.1 million and up $139.7 million year-over-year. Of the $901.2 million balance, $193.5 million was held in the U.S. and $707.7 million was held by our international entities. During Q2 2025, we repurchased approximately 585,100 shares of our common stock at an average price of $164.14 per share, completing the $225 million open market repurchase initiated in Q1 of 2025. This completed our $1 billion stock repurchase program approved in January of 2023 in its entirety. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased $500 million of our common stock. Over the last 24 months, we have repurchased $1 billion of our common stock.\nIn April 2025, our Board of Directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock, none of which has been utilized. The April 2025 repurchase program is expected to be completed over a period of up to 3 years.\nQ2 accounts receivable balance was $1,116.2 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 99 days, up approximately 2 days sequentially and up approximately 10 days as compared to Q2 2024 and primarily reflects flexible payment terms that are part of our ongoing efforts to support Invisalign practices. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $128.7 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $21.5 million, primarily related to investments in our manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures amounted to $107.2 million.\nBefore I turn to our Q3 and fiscal 2025 outlook, Align is also announcing today that we expect to take a series of actions in the second half of fiscal 2025 to streamline operations and reallocate resources to better align with our long-term growth and profitability objectives. These actions are intended to sharpen operational focus, reduce ongoing costs and enhance capital efficiency.\nFirst, we expect to realign certain business groups and reduce our global workforce. Second, we are looking to optimize our manufacturing footprint and dispose of certain manufacturing capital assets as we transition to next-generation manufacturing technologies, increased automation and regionalized manufacturing to be closer to our customers. We expect these actions will incur onetime charges of approximately $150 million to $170 million in the second half of 2025, primarily for the write-down of assets, accelerated depreciation expense and restructuring charges. We expect approximately $40 million of these charges to be in cash, with the remainder in noncash charges.\nWe expect approximately $50 million to $60 million of these charges in Q3 of 2025. We expect these actions to deliver cost savings that will allow us to achieve a GAAP operating margin of approximately 13% to 14% and a non-GAAP operating margin of slightly above 22.5% in fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2026, we expect these actions to improve our GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins by at least 100 basis points year-over-year.\nWe are evaluating these difficult but we believe necessary actions to position us for sustainable long-term success and improve profitability. While these decisions may impact valued members of our team, we believe they are essential to ensure we are positioned for upcoming technology changes and remain agile and focused in a rapidly evolving market. We are committed to executing our strategy with discipline and purpose.\nIn addition to this, I'd like to provide the following remarks regarding the U.K. VAT and U.S. tariffs as of July 30. As previously disclosed in our Q1 2025 earnings release and conference call on April 24, 2025, we received a favorable ruling in which the Tribunal determined that our clear aligners are exempt from VAT. In June of 2025, HMRC filed a petition to appeal to the upper Tribunal to attempt to challenge the first Tribunal's decision. On July 15, HMRC was given permission to a PO and has until August 15 to do so. For impacted customers, effective August 1, 2025, Align invoices will no longer include the United Kingdom bat rate of 20% for all Invisalign treatment packages that are ClinCheck approved as of August 1, 2025. And for refinement and replacement aligners, Vivera Retainers, PBS processing fees and additional aligners orders placed on or after August 1, 2025. At the same time, we will simultaneously adjust prices for our clear aligners and retainers to keep the overall price consistent.\nThere are no material change to the expected impact of U.S. tariffs, and we refer you to our Q1 2025 press release and earnings material as well as our Q2 2025 webcast slides, which includes specifics regarding potential impacts of U.S. tariffs.\nAssuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, such as foreign exchange, macro economic conditions and changes to currently applicable tariffs that could impact our business, we expect Q3 2025 worldwide revenues to be in the range of $965 million to $985 million, down sequentially from Q2 of 2025. We expect Q3 2025 clear aligner volume to be down sequentially as a result of Q3 seasonality and Q3 2025 clear aligner ASPs to be slightly up sequentially from forward favorable foreign exchange at current spot rates, partially offset by a continued product mix shift to noncomprehensive clear aligner products with lower list prices. We expect Q3 2025 Systems & services revenues to be down sequentially because of Q3 seasonality.\nWe expect Q3 2025 worldwide GAAP gross margin to be 64% to 65%, down sequentially by approximately 5 to 6 points due to the incurrence of onetime charges expected to be approximately $45 million to $55 million primarily for the write-down of assets, accelerated depreciation expense and restructuring charges in Q3 of 2025 and lower clear aligner volume. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be flat from Q2 of 2025.\nWe expect Q3 2025 GAAP operating margins to be 10.5% to 11.5%, down sequentially by approximately 5 to 6 points due to the incurrence of onetime charges expected to be approximately $50 million to $60 million, primarily for the write-down of assets, accelerated depreciation expense and restructuring charges in Q3 of 2025 and lower clear aligner volume. We expect the majority of these charges to be noncash charges with approximately $5 million in cash charges. We expect Q3 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 22%.\nWe expect 2025 clear aligner volume growth to be in the low single digits and revenue growth to be flat to slightly up from 2024. We expect 2025 clear aligner ASPs to be down year-over-year due to the continued product mix shift to noncomprehensive clear aligners with lower list prices and continued growth in our emerging markets with products that may carry lower list prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange at current spot rates.\nWe expect 2025 Systems & Services year-over-year revenues to grow faster than clear aligner revenues. We expect the GAAP gross margin to be 67% to 68%, down year-over-year by approximately 2 to 3 points due to the incurrence of onetime charges expected to be approximately $115 million to $130 million, primarily for the write-down of assets, accelerating depreciation expense and restructuring charges in the second half of 2025 and lower clear aligner volume. We expect 2025 the non-GAAP gross margin to be flat to slightly lower than 2024 non-GAAP gross margin.\nWe expect the fiscal 2025 GAAP operating margin to be 13% to 14%, down year-over-year by approximately 1 to 2 points below the 2024 GAAP operating margin, due to the incurrence of onetime charges of approximately $150 million to $170 million, primarily for the write-down of assets, accelerated depreciation expense and restructuring charges in the second half of 2025. Most of the onetime charges will be noncash, with the expected cash outlay for 2025 estimated to be around $40 million.\nWe expect the 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 22.5%. We expect our investments in capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 to be between $100 million and $125 million. Capital expenditures primarily related to technology upgrades as well as maintenance.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. In the face of a challenging and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by global tariff volatility, ongoing inflation, elevated interest rates and unstable consumer confidence, we're navigating with a clear focus to control what we can and to continue to invest with discipline in the areas will define our future. In Q2, our customers reported reduced patient traffic, fewer orthodontic case starts and delayed case acceptance. But despite significant headwinds across the consumer discretionary spend landscape, our consumer interest metrics remain strong. Patients are still prioritizing care that delivers meaningful visible results. Even if timing and affordability concerns are reshaping how and when they choose to commit to treatment. .\nThose that have transitioned to clear aligner therapy and digital practices, including larger practices and DSOs are showing more resiliency and commitment to digital dentistry and orthodontics. This underscores the opportunity those who invest in customer trust, seamless experience and value-based innovation will be best positioned for the long run. We're doubling down on the levers within our reach, innovation, efficiency and execution. We're investing in next-generation technology and treatment platforms that meet today's patient expectations for fast, effective and personalized treatment while also providing value and growth opportunities for our doctor customers. We believe these innovations are not only improving outcomes in Invisalign practices, but also expanding our addressable market and strengthening our competitive differentiation. We're expanding our new product offerings to drive Invisalign volume growth in our business. Year-to-date, we've successfully introduced IPE and MAOB in over 70 markets and are expanding Invisalign DSP offerings and more markets in Europe and Latin America in the second half of the year. And on track to introduce DSP for the first time in major APAC markets beginning in 2026.\nWe are piloting integration of our x-ray diagnostics and our iTero Lumina Scanner and some select markets outside the United States. In Q3, we will pilot our ortho restorative offering to GP dentists through labs, where we help non-Invisalign train GPs who are interested in learning and offering Invisalign in their practice. Finally, our commercial and marketing teams are engaging practices with tools that improve case conversion at the point of care. Through digital channels, we're activating more prospective patients and connecting them directly to providers.\nIn the face of lower consumer confidence and delayed spending, our engagement with potential patients remains high, and we are continuing to refine and scale our integrated consumer marketing programs. In a fragmented choice heavy market, we're continuing to make it easier for providers to see with our solution, whether it's clinical training, financing tools or personalized marketing support, our strategy is simple. Surround our customers with the right support at every stage of their growth journey. We believe this commitment is helping drive greater adoption and turning onetime users into repeat champions.\nAt the same time, we recognize the importance of operating with discipline and taking steps now to mitigate the impact of potential continued headwinds and volatility in the market. We are considering actions that rightsized parts of our organization, aligning resources to current demand realities and eliminating redundancy to drive leaner, faster execution across our organization, especially in areas where we can integrate innovation teams and take global decision-making and support closer to our customers in each region. These tough decisions are being made to preserve our investment in core technologies and protect the teams building our long-term growth.\nWhile we believe in the macro economic uncertainty will likely persist in the near future, we're confident in our ability to adapt and lead. Our long-term strategic initiatives and opportunities remain intact, as does our commitment to focused execution into transforming treatment for doctors and patients.\nWith that, I thank you for your time, and I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.

Welcome to the Align Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technology. You may begin.\n\nShirley Stacy\n\nVice President of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO. We issued fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 1 month.\nAs a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website and at sec.gov. Actual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. We have posted historical financial statements with corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, if applicable, and our fourth quarter and full year 2024 conference call slides on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, System Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and comment on our views for 2025. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nI'm pleased to report that Q4 total revenues, Clear Aligner volumes, Systems and Services revenues were in line with our Q4 outlook, and both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins were better than our Q4 outlook. Q4 Clear Aligner ASPs were lower than our Q4 outlook due primarily to the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies from late October through December, as John will explain in his remarks.\nOn a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenues of $995 million increased 4%, reflecting 14.9% growth from Systems and Services revenues and 1.6% growth from Clear Aligner revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner volumes grew 6.1%, driven by increased shipments across all regions, with strength in EMEA, APAC and LatAm regions and stability in North America. From a channel perspective, Clear Aligner volumes in the ortho and GP channels were up a year-over-year basis, with a number of submitters and utilization amongst the highest in the past few years.\nOn a sequential basis, fourth quarter revenue growth of 1.8% reflects continued momentum from sales of iTero Lumina scanners and increased Invisalign Clear Aligner volumes in the EMEA region, especially from teens and growing patients as well as growth from the LatAm regions. Across the orthodontists and GP dentists offset by Clear Aligner seasonality in APAC, mostly in China, which had a strong teen quarter in Q3. For the Americas, Q4 Clear Aligner volumes reflect a seasonally soft orthodontic channel, offset somewhat by strength in the GP channel in the adult segment.\nFor the full year 2024, total revenues of $4 billion and Clear Aligner volumes of 2.5 million cases were both up 3.5% year-over-year. We delivered fiscal 2024 non-GAAP operating margin of 21.8%, above fiscal 2023 and in line with our 2024 outlook. As of Q4 '24, we achieved several cumulative milestones, including 272,000 active Invisalign trained practitioners, 19.5 million Invisalign patients, including over 5.6 billion teens and kids and over 2 billion clear aligners manufactured worldwide.\nFor clear aligners in Q4, year-over-year volume growth in the Americas reflects strength in Latin America as well as improving trends in North America, especially for GP dentists. In the EMEA region, Q4 year-over-year Clear Aligner volume growth reflects increased volumes from core Europe as well as strong growth from EMEA, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa markets. From a channel perspective, EMEA Clear Aligner growth reflects strength in both ortho and GP as well as teens, kids and adult patients. In APAC region, Q4 year-over-year Clear Aligner volume growth was driven by China and Japan, as well as strong growth from our emerging APAC countries led by India, Thailand and Korea. For Q4, APAC growth also reflects increased utilization and submitters in both doctor channels and growth in both patient segments. Q4, we had 85,700 doctors submitters worldwide, a record total in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting a sequential increase in clear aligner volume for adults and noncomprehensive cases.\nIn the adult clear aligner segment, we're pleased to see both year-over-year and sequential growth across all regions. In the teen and growing kids segments, approximately 216,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners during the fourth quarter, a decrease of 8.6% sequentially off a record Q3 teen season and an increase of 9.8% year-over-year, reflecting growth across regions, especially from Invisalign First in the APAC and EMEA regions. For Q4, number of doctors submitting cases starts for teens and kids was up 6.2% year-over-year, led by continued strength from doctors treating young kids or growing patients.\nFor fiscal 2024, Total Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and kids reached a record total of 868,000 Invisalign cases and shipped up to -- a year up to 7.7% compared to the prior year and comprising approximately 35% of the 2.5 million total Clear Aligner case shipments for the year. Teen-specific consumer marketing and sales programs, along with the continued momentum for Invisalign First for kids as young as 6 and Invisalign Palatal Expander systems help drive adoption globally.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to commercialize the Invisalign Palatal Expander with steady momentum for doctors submitters and shipments. In its first full year of availability in North America, Invisalign Palatal Expander adoption was followed by similar trajectory in Invisalign First, which launched in 2017. But Invisalign First did not require regional or country-specific regulatory approvals like Invisalign Palatal Expander is required. In Q4, we received the CE mark under the medical device regulation to market the Invisalign Palatal Expander system in most of Europe and also completed registration with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for the United Kingdom and overseas territory. Both approvals are for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens and adults with surgery or other techniques. These approvals mark a significant milestone in our efforts to enhance clinical outcomes and efficiency in orthodontics and enable us to commercialize the Invisalign Palatal Expander across most of the major EMEA region in 2025.\nWe are continuing to make progress in establishing the clinical efficacy and improved patient experience of Invisalign Palatal Expander, which recently made to cover of the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics, or JCO, and an article published by [ Dr. Jonathan Nicosisis ]. There have been multiple peer review studies published on the effectiveness of the Invisalign Palatal Expander as well as mandibular advancement. We also are receiving positive parental feedback, as reflected in the article, \"7 Reasons Parents Love the Invisalign Palatal Expander System.\" Overall, the Invisalign Palatal Expander system is gaining traction among orthodontists and patients due to its innovative design and user-friendly feature. As more clinical data becomes available and practitioners gain experience with the device and parents become informed, we believe adoption will continue to grow.\nQ4 non-case revenues were up year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth in retainers and our Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, including non-Invisalign patients at getting retainers. Non-case revenues, including our Vivera Retainers, retention aligners ordered to our Doctor Subscription Program, clinical training, education, accessories and e-commerce. DSP also includes Invisalign touch-up cases, which includes up to 14 stages and is currently available in North America and certain countries in Europe and was most recently launched in Brazil.\nFor Q4, total Invisalign DSP touch-up cases were up nearly 37% year-over-year to more than 27,000 cases. For fiscal 2024, total DSP touch-up cases shipped were over 100,000, up 37% compared to 2023. 224 clear aligner volume from DSO customers increased sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growth across all regions. The DSO business continues to outpace our retail doctors globally. And in the U.S., it's driven by our largest DSO partners, Smile Doctors and Heartland Dental, and also had strong growth in iTero scanner sales as DSO invested in their members' practices end-to-end digital workflows.\nIn December, we completed $30 million equity investment in Smile Doctors, the largest orthodontic focused DSO in the U.S. with more than 450 locations in 32 states. Smile Doctors has a rich history of developing and growing affiliated practices by providing tools and technology that allow their orthodontists to focus entirely on patient care, and we are continuously exploring collaboration with DSOs that share our vision of furthering the adoption of digital dentistry. Each DSO has a different strategy and business model. We're focused on working and with encouraging the DSOs aligned with our vision strategy and business model goals. Those DSOs that recognize the benefits of digital workflows enabled by our portfolio of products and services that make up the Align digital platform, including increased practice efficiency and profitability, as well as delivering a better patient experience for shorter cycle times and proximity to their customers.\nTurning to Systems and Services. Q4 was another strong quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 14.9%. On a sequential basis, Q4 Systems and Services revenues were up 5.2%. In Q1 '24, we launched the iTero Lumina with orthodontic workflows as a new stand-alone scanner or as a wand upgrade from our iTero Element 5D Plus scanner. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the ongoing adoption of iTero Lumina scanner, and we're looking forward to building on its success with the launch of the iTero Lumina scanner with restorative capabilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we began a limited market release of our restorative software on the iTero Lumina scanner, and doctor feedback has been outstanding. Our iTero Lumina innovation represents continuous advancement in our mission to deliver unparalleled value to customers and dental professionals worldwide. Doctors can continue to purchase the current version of iTero Lumina scanner today, knowing that it will automatically update to the new version free of charge once it becomes available at the end of March. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nChief Financial Officer & SVP-Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $995.2 million, up 1.8% from the prior quarter and up 4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. This reflects an increase in Clear Aligner volumes up 1.9% sequentially and 6.1% year-over-year and revenue growth from Systems and Services of 5.2% sequentially and 14.9% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, Q4 '24 revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $0.8 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially and were unfavorably impacted by approximately $0.9 million year-over-year or approximately 0.1%.\nFor Clear Aligners, Q4 '24 revenues of $794.3 million were up 0.9% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, geographic mix shift to higher-priced countries and lower net revenue deferrals, partially offset by product mix shift to lower-priced products and higher discounts. Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by approximately $0.7 million or approximately 0.1% from foreign exchange sequentially. Q4 '24 Clear Aligner per case shipment of $1,265 was lower by $10 on a sequential basis, primarily due to product mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by favorable geography mix and lower net deferrals. Even though FX had a minor impact on our reported quarter-over-quarter results, our Q4 guidance did not forecast any substantial change from the October spot rate foreign exchange rates. However, the U.S. dollar unexpectedly strengthened in November and December. If foreign exchange rates in October had remained constant for November and December, then Clear Aligner ASPs would have increased approximately $10 quarter-over-quarter, or the equivalent of $14 million.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Q4 Clear Aligner revenues were up 1.6%, primarily from higher volumes, lower net deferrals, price increases and higher non-case revenues, partially offset by lower ASPs, reflecting the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange of $0.7 million or approximately 0.1% product mix shift to lower-priced products and geographic mix. Q4 '24 Clear Aligner per case shipment of $1,265 was down $55 on a year-over-year basis due to the impact of U.K. VAT of $13, product and geographic mix and higher discounts, partially offset by lower net revenue deferrals and price increases.\nDuring Q4, we reached a favorable outcome with the U.K. tax authorities regarding cumulative assessments of approximately $100 million for unpaid VAT related to certain clear aligner sales made during the period of October 2019 through October 2023. In Q4, we received a full refund of this $100 million from U.K. tax authorities. This settlement also relieved us of any potential assessments for sales through mid-October 2023. As a result, we have approximately $7 million of VAT paid for periods up to December 2023 that are still in dispute. We expect a ruling by the U.K. courts in the first half of 2024 for this remaining VAT amount. This ruling will also give clarity whether a 20% VAT is required to be applied to all clear aligner sales in the U.K. going forward. We believe that clear aligners should continue to be exempt from that.\nClear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, decreased $51.3 million or 4.1% sequentially and decreased $92.1 million or 7% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped under each sales contract. Q4 '24 Systems and Services revenues of $200.9 million were up 5.2% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volumes, higher nonsystems revenue driven by iTero Lumina upgrades, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Q4 '24 Systems and Services revenue were up 14.9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher scanner volumes, higher ASP and increased nonsystems revenues, mostly related to upgrades and leasing rental programs. Q4 '24 Systems and Services revenue impact by foreign exchange was approximately $0.1 million, flat sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $0.2 million or approximately 0.1%.\nSystems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was down $4.1 million or 1.8% sequentially and down $40.3 million or 15.5% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of service revenues which are recognized ratably over the service period. The decline in deferred revenues, both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily reflects the shorter duration of service contracts applicable to initial scanner purchases.\nMoving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 70%, up 0.3 points sequentially and flat year-over-year. Overall, total gross margin was not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially or on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.2%, down 0.1 points sequentially due primarily to lower ASPs and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was down 1 point year-over-year due primarily due to lower ASP and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower additional aligners. Overall, Clear Aligner gross margin was not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially or on a year-over-year basis.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 69.4%, up 1.9 points sequentially due to lower manufacturing and freight costs, partially offset by lower scanner ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 4.7 points year-over-year due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower freight costs and service costs and higher scanner ASPs. Overall, Systems and Services gross margin was not impacted by foreign exchange sequentially or on a year-over-year basis.\nQ4 operating expenses were $552.8 million, up 6.4% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were $33.3 million higher due primarily to restructuring costs. Year-over-year operating expenses increased by $54.8 million, primarily due to restructuring, advertising and marketing expenses. Q4 restructuring charges related to severance for impacted employees were higher than anticipated.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $474.7 million, up 0.4% sequentially and up 6.3% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating income of $144.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 14.5%, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 3.4 points year-over-year. Operating margin was favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.1 points sequentially and unfavorably impacted by 0.2 points year-over-year.\nThe effective restructuring on GAAP operating margin was approximately 3.7 points. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 23.2%, up 1.1 points sequentially and down 0.6 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was an expense of $3.4 million compared to income of $3.6 million in Q3 '24, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange movements of $15.3 million, partially offset by higher interest income and gain on investments.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Q4 '24 interest and other income and expense was unfavorable compared to income of $1.3 million in Q4 2023, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange movements, partially offset by higher interest income and gain on investments. The GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 26.3% compared to 30.1% in the third quarter and 28.3% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves, partially offset by onetime deferred tax adjustments in certain foreign jurisdictions. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate of the prior year, primarily due to the release of certain tax position reserves, partially offset by onetime deferred tax adjustments in certain foreign jurisdictions. On a non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20%, which reflects our long-term projected tax rate.\nFourth quarter net income per diluted share was $1.39, down $0.16 sequentially and $0.25 compared to the prior year. Our Q4 '24 EPS was unfavorably impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar, which amounted to approximately $0.14 per diluted share to net foreign exchange losses related to the revaluation of certain balance sheet accounts. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 '24 net income per diluted share was $2.44 for the fourth quarter, up $0.9 sequentially and up $0.02 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $1,043.9 million, up sequentially $2 million and down $106.4 million year-over-year. Of our $1,043.9 billion balance, $188.7 million was held in the U.S. and $855.2 million was held by our international entities. During Q4 '24, we initiated a plan to repurchase $275 million of our common stock through open market repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, we had purchased approximately 0.9 million shares at an average price of $222.94 per share for an aggregate of approximately $202.9 million. The remaining $72.1 million of the $275 million was completed in January of 2025. As of January 30, 2025, $225 million remains available for repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program approved in January of 2023.\nAs Joe mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we completed a $30 million equity investment in Smile Doctors, the largest ortho-focused dental support organization in the U.S. Q4 accounts receivable balance was $995.7 million, down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 90 days, down approximately 3 days sequentially and up approximately 5 days as compared to Q4 last year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $286.1 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $23 million, primarily related to investments in our manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $263 million.\nBefore I turn to our Q1 and fiscal 2025 outlook, I'd like to provide the following context around pricing and potential new tariffs. On March 1, 2025, we will raise the list price of clear aligners by about 3% on average in the Americas and EMEA regions. At the same time, we will remove the $10 to $15 per order processing fee for all new clear aligner orders, all new clear aligner refinement orders from past cases and non-DSP Vivera cases. We expect the net effect from these 2 actions on ASPs to be 0 for 2025.\nWe currently manufacture clear aligners in Mexico and ship them to the U.S. primarily for our U.S. customers, with the remainder eventually shipping to other international locations. The U.S.-Mexico tariff situation remains very fluid, and we are unable to predict whether new tariffs will go into effect in the future. We are monitoring events closely. Our Clear Aligner COGS include material, labor, overhead and freight costs. We expect an incremental tariff, if implemented, to be applied to transfer prices from Mexico shipments to the U.S. These transfer prices would not include treatment planning costs, freight and other overhead and similar costs.\nAlign's global operations have evolved significantly over the past several years, and we have greater flexibility to support our global business. However, assuming a new 25% tariff on shipments to the U.S. from Mexico, we believe it still would be more economically viable to ship clear aligners from the U.S. -- to the U.S. for Mexico due to a variety of factors, including the incremental additional freight costs incurred, where we shipped from our Polish facility.\nRegarding China, we currently manufacture our products in China for the benefit of our customers in China. With that as a backdrop, assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, including foreign exchange and new tariffs, for Q1 2025 and fiscal 2025, we provide the following outlook. We expect Q1 worldwide revenues to be in the range of $965 million to $985 million, down sequentially from Q4, primarily due to the impact from foreign exchange rates at current spot rates and lower capital equipment sales, reflecting historical Q1 seasonality. We expect Q1 Clear Aligner volume to be up slightly sequentially and expect Q1 Clear Aligner ASPs to be down sequentially, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates as well as continued product mix shift to noncomprehensive clear aligners.\nIn addition to seasonality, we expect Q1 Systems and Services revenue to be down sequentially due to the timing of commercial availability of our iTero Lumina scanner with restorative software, which is expected at the end of March. We expect our Q1 2025 GAAP operating margin to be below Q1 2024 GAAP operating margin by approximately 2 points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates. We expect our Q1 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to be below Q1 2024 non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 1 point, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates.\nFor fiscal 2025, we expect 2025 year-over-year revenue growth to be in the low single digits, which reflects approximately 2 points of unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates. We expect 2025 Clear Aligner volume growth to be up approximately mid-single digits year-over-year compared to up 3.5% year-over-year in 2025. We expect 2025 Clear Aligner ASPs to be down year-over-year due to unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates and continued product mix shift to noncompetitive, noncomprehensive clear aligners.\nWe expect 2025 Systems and Services year-over-year revenues to grow faster than Clear Aligner revenues. We expect 2025 GAAP operating margin to be approximately 2 points above 2024 GAAP operating margin, and we expect 2025 non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 22.5%, which both reflect the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange at current spot rates, partially offset by the benefits from restructuring actions we took in Q4 to improve profitability and give us margin accretion in 2025, even as we scale our next-generation direct 3D printing fabrication manufacturing.\nWe expect our investments in capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 to be between $100 million and $150 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements, as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion.\nOverall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 results, particularly the year-over-year Clear Aligner volume growth, the record number of submitters, the continued momentum from our Systems and Services business and our operating margin improvement. After repurchasing $353 million of our Align common stock during 2024, we continued -- we concluded the year with no debt and approximately $1.044 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Our goal, as always, is to deliver value to our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call -- now I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. In closing, 2024 was a year of solid progress across the business. Record full year total worldwide revenues of $4 billion, record full year total worldwide System and Services revenue of $769 million, record teen shipments and growth in both teens and adult markets, record 130,400 doctors shipped to, 19.5 million total patients treated, with 5.6 million teens in kids. We ended the year with over $1 billion in cash and equivalents after repurchasing 1.5 million shares for $353 million.\nIn another year where the dental industry is down and we continue to grow, I feel good about where we ended the year, and I'm excited to kick off 2025 with a team focused on building the innovations introduced in 2024 that drive efficiency and growth for practices and that are committed in delivering the best customer and patient experiences in the industry. I want to highlight just a few of the Align innovations that we introduced in 2024 that we believe will continue to drive adoption and utilization.\nIn January 2024, we unveiled a breakthrough technology, the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner with 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller wand that delivers faster scanning, higher accuracy and superior visualization for greater practice efficiency and with orthodontic workflows. We look forward to introducing at the end of Q1 '25, the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner with software capabilities to enable efficient restorative and ortho restorative workloads to help general practitioner dentists deliver exceptional restorative outcomes.\nThe iTero scanner is the front end of the Align digital platform, designed to give doctors the capability to run simulations and communicate with patients so the patients can see their smiles and the time that it would take them to get that outcome. It's also a big part of our growth algorithm, and we've had good accretive margin on the iTero Lumina scanner product since its launch.\nWe also started rolling out ClinCheck in minutes, delivering treatment plans based on doctors building personalized treatment preferences for almost touchless digital workflows, which we'll expand to more doctors this year, bringing an unprecedented level of speed and customization to digital treatment planning.\nChanging the paradigm for how doctors can treat growing patients is 1 of our biggest opportunities. As we continue to deliver innovations that help doctors achieve more of a treatment at younger ages, potentially decreasing the amount of orthodontic treatment that younger and teen patients need overall. As we continue to commercialize the Invisalign Palatal Expander system, Align's first direct 3D-printed device that provides doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal and dental malocclusions in growing children, we anticipate introducing the next in a series of direct 3D-printed devices with a pilot for Invisalign First direct printed retainers in the first half of 2025. We have also have Invisalign mandibular advancement with the [ fuselblocks ] now in limited market release, giving doctors and patients a better option for Class II correction in younger patients while simultaneously strengthening their team.\nWe're also excited about the future of digital orthodontics focused on growth opportunities as a company while driving margin improvement and our unique ability to leverage aggregated and anonymized data from approximately 19.5 million Invisalign cases to continue to gain more knowledge about the science of orthodontics to move the industry forward. And while we're now in our 28th year, in the same way, we're just at the beginning. It's that motivating and exciting for the whole Align team.\nWith that, I thank you for your time today. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress over the coming quarters. Now I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Operator?",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technologies. You may begin.\n\nShirley Stacy\n\nVice President of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for our third quarter and for 2024 in total. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nOverall, I'm pleased to report solid second quarter results. Total Q2 '24 revenues of $1.285 billion were up 3.1% sequentially and 2.6% year-over-year, reflecting growth in both Clear Aligner volumes, in Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM services revenues. Q2 '24 total revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11.6 million or 1.1% sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately $18.1 million or 1.7% year-over-year. For Clear Aligners, Q2 '24 volumes increased 6.2% sequentially and 3.2% year-over-year, driven by growth from adult patients and strong teen case starts across the regions, led by strength in Asia Pacific, EEMA and Latin America.\nOur Q2 results also reflect a record number of doctors submitting cases and record doctors shipped to for the quarter. Q2 '24 Clear Aligner ASPs were down sequentially and lower than anticipated in our second quarter outlook due in part to greater impact of unfavorable foreign exchange across multiple currencies, especially the Japanese yen, euro and Brazilian real as well as discounts and products mix shift to lower ASP products. As a result, total Q2 revenues were slightly below expected range for our Q2 quarterly revenues. Notwithstanding these factors, non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 22.3%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year.\nFor Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM services, Q2 '24 revenues increased 9.2% sequentially and 16.1% year-over-year, reflecting continued adoption of our next-generation iTero Lumina scanner, which made up the majority of our equipment sales, iTero Lumina and wand upgrades, iTero Element, scanner trade-ins as well as increased iTero scanner leases. For Q2 '24 adult patient case starts were up 5% sequentially and 1% year-over-year, reflecting our highest number of adult shipments in 8 quarters, driven by strength in the GP channel led by North America and APAC dentist. In teen and growing kids segment, over 216,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners during the second quarter, an increase of 8.8% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year, reflecting growth across regions, especially from Invisalign First in the EMEA and APAC regions. In Q2, the number of doctors submitting teen or younger patient case starts was up 8% year-over-year, led by continued strength from doctors treating young kids, also known as growing patients.\nThe response from doctors and their patients to Invisalign Palatal Expander system continues to be positive. We believe that Invisalign Palatal Expander system is a better option for expanding and growing patients' narrow palate compared to traditional appliances used today. Invisalign Palatal Expander system is currently available in the U.S., Canada and Australia and New Zealand. We expect it to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approvals.\nNon-case revenues include our Vivera Retainers, which include retention aligners ordered through our Doctor Subscription Program, or DSP, as well as clinical training and education accessories and e-commerce. Q2 non-case revenues were up 3.5% sequentially and up 5.1% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth in retainers and DSP. For Q2, total Clear Aligner shipments include approximately 25,000 Invisalign DSP touch-up cases, a record-high quarter, up 37% year-over-year. DSP continues to drive growth and is currently available in North America and certain EMEA countries. During the quarter, we extended DSP into more countries in Europe, and we anticipate expanding into additional markets going forward. DSP is also now available in 14 stage touch-up, aligner offering across all markets where it's available. As a result, touch up cases increased significantly in Q2.\nQ2 '24 Clear Aligner volume and DSO customers increased sequentially year-over-year, reflecting growth across all regions. DSOs represent a large and growing opportunity to help drive adoption of digital technology across the dental industry. We have well-established relationships in many DSOs globally that recognize the benefits of digital workflows enabled by our portfolio of products and services that make up the digital platform, including increased practice efficiency and profitability, as well as delivering a better patient experience from shorter cycle times and customer proximity. Smile Docs and Heartland Dental are 2 of our largest DSO partners, and we are continuously exploring cooperation with the DSOs that can further the adoption of digital dentistry. Each DSO has a different strategy and business model, and our focus is working in encouraging DSOs aligned with our vision, strategy and business model goals.\nToday, Invisalign is the most recognized orthodontic brand globally, and Invisalign Clear Aligner treatment is faster and more effective than traditional metal braces, yet the underlying market opportunity remains huge and untapped. We continue to invest in consumer marketing and demand creation initiatives that raise awareness and drive potential patients to Invisalign practices globally. In Q2, we had more than 17 billion impressions and 50 million visitors to our websites globally. Below are additional highlights from Q2, and more information is available in our Q2 '24 earnings webcast slides.\nTo increase awareness and educate young adults, parents and teens about the benefits of Invisalign brand, we continue to invest and create campaigns and social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, WeChat, [ to young ] across the markets. Reaching young adults as well as teams and their parents also requires the right engagement to Invisalign influencers and creator-centric campaigns. In the Americas, our influence and social media campaigns featured Olympic athletes such as [ Rebecca Andras ] from Brazil, [ Andre De Grasse ] from Canada, [ Jordan Chiles ] from the United States and paralympic athlete [ Lizzi Smith ] from the United States. To bolster teen demand, we launched new activations with teen high school sports social media platform [ Overtime ], including several programs focused on showcasing elite high school athletes across boys, footballs, girls' basketball, girl soccer. We highlighted why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners and showcase their results.\nIn the EMEA region, we partnered with influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta, and launched our global consumer campaigns for teens and parents. In APAC, we continue to invest in consumer advertising across the region and expanded our reach in Japan and India via Meta and YouTube and partnered with key social media influencers. Finally, adoption of My Invisalign consumer patient app continued to increase with over 4 million downloads to date and over 384,000 monthly active users, an 8% year-over-year increase.\nUsage of our other digital tools also continued to increase. ClinCheck Live Update was used by almost 50,000 doctors on more than 692,000 cases, reducing time spent in modifying treatment plans by an average of 16.3%. Invisalign Practice App is increasing its adoption with 85,000 doctors who actively are using the app, and 5.9 million photographs were uploaded in Q2 via the Invisalign Practice App.\nYear-over-year growth in Q2 Systems and Services revenue were up 16.1% reflect higher scanner ASPs and [ nonsystem ] revenues driven by iTero Lumina wand upgrades, increased service revenues and a larger base of scanners sold. On a sequential basis, Q2 Systems and Services revenues were up 9.2%, reflecting higher scanner volumes, higher scanner ASPs and higher nonsystems revenues driven by iTero Lumina wand upgrades. iTero Lumina's new multi-direct capture technology replaces the [ Confoc ] imaging technology in earlier models and has a 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller and 45% lighter wand, delivering faster scanning speed, higher accuracy, superior visualization and a more comfortable scanning experience. Lumina is currently available with orthodontic workflows as a new stand-alone scanner or as a wand upgrade from iTero Element 5D Plus scanner.\nDuring the second quarter, we had a record number of competitive trade-ins demonstrating the continued success of the iTero Lumina scanner in the marketplace. We're also seeing a halo effect with Invisalign scans. We're pleased to see more doctors coming into the digital ecosystem with an increase in first-time Invisalign case emitters as well as return of lapse submitters. Overall, Q2, we're very pleased with the continued uptake of iTero Lumina scanner with ortho workflow and response from customers. We're looking forward to a limited market release for the restorative software Lumina in Q4, followed by full commercialization in Q1 '25.\nToday, we introduced the iTero Design Suite, offering doctors an intuitive way to facilitate designs for 3D printing of models, bite splints and restorations in practice. This software innovation is designed to help doctors increase their practice efficiencies and elevate patient experiences by shortening the time to treatment through an intuitive way to design for in-practice 3D printing. The aligned digital platform provides an innovative portfolio of customer-focused technologies that enables seamless end-to-end workflows for dental professionals. iTero Design Suite is now available through an early access program. Doctors using an iTero scanner can submit their interest via their scanner or MyiTero portal. Software is expected to be available later this year in selected markets. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nChief Financial Officer & SVP-Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.285 billion, up 3.1% from the prior quarter and up 2.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 '24 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $11.6 million or approximately 1.1% sequentially and were unfavorably impacted by approximately $18.1 million year-over-year or approximately 1.7%.\nFor Clear Aligners, Q2 revenues of $831.7 million were up 1.8% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, partially offset by lower ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 Clear Aligner revenues were flat primarily due to higher discounts, a product mix shift to lower ASP products and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, offset by lower net revenue deferrals, higher volumes and price increases. Q2 '24 Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $9.5 million or approximately 1.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $14.7 million or approximately 1.7%. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASP primarily reflects higher discounts, a product mix shift to lower ASP products and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in comprehensive ASPs primarily reflects higher discounts, a product mix shift to lower ASP products and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, mostly offset by lower net revenue, deferrals and price increases.\nFor Q2, Invisalign ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were down sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflects the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, higher net revenue deferrals and a product mix shift to lower ASP products, partially offset by price increases. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in noncomprehensive ASPs reflects higher discounts, a product mix shift to lower ASP products, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the unfavorable impact of a price adjustment in the U.K. to make the recently mandatory application of VAT to our aligners cost neutral to customers.\nOur Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product is available in North America, EMEA and in certain markets across APAC. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product and anticipate that adoption will continue to increase. Comprehensive Three and Three provides doctors the flexibility they want while allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront, with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period compared to our traditional Invisalign Comprehensive product and benefiting us with a more favorable gross margin.\nClear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet decreased $7.8 million or 0.6% sequentially and decreased $5.2 million or 0.4% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q2 '24 Systems and Services revenues of $196.8 million were up 9.2% sequentially primarily due to higher volumes, higher ASPs and nonsystems revenues, mostly related to upgrades. Q2 '24 Systems and Services revenues were up 16.1% year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs, increased nonsystem revenues, mostly related to upgrades in our leasing rental programs and higher service revenues. We are pleased to be able to leverage our operational and financial capabilities to provide different types of go-to-market models for our customers, such as leasing and rental options. In the end, we are focused on selling the way our customers want to buy.\nQ2 '24 Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.1 million or approximately 1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.4 million or approximately 1.7%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $20.4 million or 8.3% sequentially and down $43.4 million or 16.2% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of services revenues, which are recognized ratably over the service period. The decline in deferred revenues, both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily reflects the shorter duration of service contracts applicable to initial scanner purchases. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we are increasing the opportunities for customers to upgrade and make trade-ins in addition to our scanning, leasing and rental programs. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and our DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. The structural programs we have implemented across both of our operating segment benefit our customers by providing them with more options to choose what they need, in some cases, at a reduced price that may impact our ASPs. But the cost of service for us is lower and the benefit is then reflected in our gross margins.\nMoving to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 70.3%, up 0.3 points sequentially and down 0.9 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.3 points sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 70.8%, down 0.1 point sequentially due primarily to lower ASPs, partially offset by lower additional aligners and leveraged manufacturing spend. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 1.7 points year-over-year due primarily to lower ASPs and higher manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up Poland manufacturing facility and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was a record 68.2%, up 2.3 points sequentially, primarily due to higher ASPs and manufacturing efficiencies. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was up 3 points year-over-year for the reasons stated above. Q2 operating expenses were $575.6 million, up 5.9% sequentially and 6.3% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up by $31.9 million due primarily to about $31 million in legal settlements. Year-over-year operating expenses increased by $33.9 million, primarily due to legal settlements and higher employee compensation, partially offset by lower outside services, advertising and marketing expenses.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, restructuring, legal settlements and other charges, operating expenses were $499.5 million, down 1.3% sequentially and down 1.1% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $147 million resulted in an operating margin of 14.3%, down 1.2 points sequentially and down 2.9% year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted from foreign exchange of approximately 0.6 points sequentially and unfavorable -- impacted by 1.2 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, restructuring, legal settlements and other charges, operating margin for the second quarter was 22.3%, up 2.5 points sequentially and up 1 point year-over-year.\nInterest and other income expense net for the second quarter was an expense of $3.2 million primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange, compared to an income of $4.3 million in Q1 of '24 and an expense of $0.3 million in Q2 of '23. Recall that Q1 '24 included a nonrecurring gain on our equity investments. The GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.9% compared to 33.7% in the first quarter and 34.8% in the second quarter of the prior year. The second quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to discrete tax expenses recognized in Q1 of '24 that did not reoccur in Q2 of '24. And that benefit was partially offset by an increase in nondetectable expenses.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, which reflects our long-term projected tax rate. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.28, down sequentially $0.11 and down $0.18 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.11 on a sequential basis and $0.17 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.41 for the second quarter, up $0.27 sequentially and up $0.19 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities were $782.1 million, down sequentially $120.4 million and down $251.7 million year-over-year. Of our $782.1 million balance, $140 million was held in the U.S. and $642.1 million was held by our international entities. During Q2 '24, we repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $250.73 through $150 million of open market repurchases. As of June 30, 2024, $500 million remains available for repurchases of our common stock under the January 2023 repurchase program.\nDuring the quarter, we completed a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental, a multidisciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the United States. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $1.201 billion , up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 89 days, up approximately 3 days sequentially and up approximately 8 days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $159.8 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $53.5 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $106.4 million.\nNow turning to our outlook. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following business outlook for Q3 and fiscal 2024. For Q3 2024, we expect our Q3 worldwide revenues to be in the range of $980 million to $1 billion. we expect Clear Aligner volume to be down sequentially as a result of Q3 seasonality and Clear Aligner ASPs to be down sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange and product mix. We also expect Systems and Services revenues to be down sequentially because of Q3 seasonality. We expect our Q3 2024 GAAP operating margin to be below Q3 2023 GAAP operating margin and Q3 2024 non-GAAP operating margin to be flat to Q3 2023 non-GAAP operating margin.\nFor fiscal 2024, we expect fiscal 2024 total revenue growth to be up 4% to 6% year-over-year, due in part to lower Clear Aligner ASPs year-over-year from continued unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix. In addition, our revised revenue outlook reflects our anticipated commercial launch of iTero Lumina with restorative capabilities to occur in Q1 of 2025 instead of 2024, as previously anticipated. We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin to be slightly below 2023 GAAP operating margin and 2024 non-GAAP operating margin to be above 2023 non-GAAP operating margin. We expect investments in capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of continued expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. In summary, I'm pleased with our overall performance for Q2 and the growth we delivered across the business for Clear Aligner volumes as well as strong revenues from scanners and services. Notwithstanding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange on our revenues, we believe the end markets are stable overall, and we're committed to supporting our doctor customers in the future of digital innovation. Our purpose is to transform smiles and change lives with the goal of being the standard of care and orthodontics with Invisalign Clear Aligner treatment. Clinically, we believe that we can treat the vast majority of orthodontic cases today from the simplest to the most complex.\nClinical efficacy is no longer a question. We now focus on the treatment experience for patients and on efficiency and growth for our doctor customers. The orthodontic case start market is vastly underpenetrated, and there are millions of consumers who would benefit from digital orthodontics. We continue to evolve to better meet the needs of doctors potential patients who increasingly seek convenient, elevated digital experiences. Our digital platform of integrated technology, software and services has helped improve orthodontic treatment for millions by delivering seamless workflows and dental practices on mobile devices and through remote monitoring and are designed to help doctors and patients realize the benefits of a truly seamless end-to-end digital workflows and patient experiences. But the journey from analog to digital has proven difficult for practices. The orthodontic practice of the future requires full digital transformation to truly realize the promise of digital. And there is no other med tech company in the world that can help practices meet this challenge. With that, I thank you for your time today. We look forward to sharing our continued progress as we move the industry forward through digital orthodontics. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator?",

Welcome to the Align First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technology. You may begin.\n\nShirley Stacy\n\nVice President of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.\nWe issued first quarter 2024 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 1 month.\nAs a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website at sec.gov.\nActual results may vary significantly and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. We have posted historical financial statements with corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, if applicable, and our first quarter 2024 conference call slides on our website under Quarterly Results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, System Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance and comment on our views for the second quarter and 2024 in total.\nFollowing that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions. I'm pleased to report better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the first quarter and a solid start to the year. For Q1, total worldwide revenues were up 5.8% year-over-year, reflecting 3.5% growth from our Clear Aligner segment and 17.5% growth from Systems and Services.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Q1 revenue growth was up across all regions and was driven by strong Clear Aligner volumes, primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Year-over-year growth also reflects strength in the orthodontic channel with total Invisalign case starts from teens and younger patients, up 5.8% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum across all regions from Invisalign First, as well as Invisalign DSP touch-up cases.\nOn a sequential basis, Q1 total revenues were up 4.3%, reflecting a sequential increase in Clear Aligner revenues. Especially for North American orthodontists, as well as strong systems and services revenues, primarily driven by iTero Lumina and upgrades in North America. During the quarter, we achieved several significant milestones.\nWe completed the acquisition of Cubicure, a leader in direct 3D printing solutions, which is the foundation for our next generational aligner manufacturing. We successfully launched the iTero Lumina intraoral scanner, our next generation of digital scanning technology.\nWe launched the Invisalign pilot expander our IPE system in the U.S. and Canada and received regulatory approval for the Invisalign Palatal Expander in Australia and New Zealand. Q1 Systems and Services revenue year-over-year growth reflects nonsystems revenues driven by iTero Lumina wand upgrades and higher scanner volumes and increased services revenue from a larger base of scanners sold.\nOn a sequential basis, Q1 Systems and Services revenue were up 3.1%, reflecting growth from nonsystems revenues and higher scanner ASPs, partially offset by lower volumes due to seasonality, a strong fourth quarter. The iTero Lumina intraoral scanner is available now with orthodontic workflows as a new standard alone scanner or as a wand upgrade to iTero Element 5D Plus. The restorative workflow is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn the meantime, GP practices can benefit from the iTero Lumina's new multi-direct capture technology that replaces the confocal imaging technology in earlier models. The iTero Lumina intraoral scanner has a 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller and 45% lighter want, delivering faster scanning speed higher accuracy, super visualization and more comfortable scanning experience.\nOverall, we're really pleased with the launch of that iTero Lumina intraoral scanner. Customer feedback has been positive, and we're really excited about the feedback from doctors. So we've included some great verbatims in our webcast slides.\nQ1 total Clear Aligner revenues were up year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth across the regions from strong year-over-year volume growth across APAC markets, as well as the EMEA region. For the Americas region, Q1 Clear Aligner volume was consistent with prior year. For Q1, total Clear Aligner shipments were up 2.1% sequentially, reflecting seasonality with increased volumes in the Americas regions, offset somewhat by EMEA and APAC regions.\nFor Q1, Clear Aligner shipments include over 23,000 Invisalign Doctor subscription cases or DSP touch-up cases, primarily from North America ortho channel, an increase of approximately 49% year-over-year from Q1 '23.\nThe DSP touch-up cases are a component of the overall DSP program, which consists of retainers and touch up cases or aligners, and it continues to be an important offering for our customers and their patients. DSP is currently available in the United States, Canada, Iberia, Nordics, the U.K. and most recently, in Italy, France and Poland. We expect to continue expanding DSP into other country markets and EMEA in Q2 including a 14 stage touch-up aligner offering.\nFor non-case revenues, Q1 was up 7.5% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth from Avera retainers along with Invisalign DSP retainer revenues. In a teen market, nearly 200,000 teens and younger patients started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligners in Q1, up 5.8% year-over-year. This represents a record number of teen cases shipped, as compared to prior quarters, reflecting strength in APAC and EMEA.\nTeen starts were up sequentially, 1.2%, reflecting strength in EMEA and North America, offset by seasonally fewer team starts in China. While the team market tends to be less susceptible to consumer demand around discretionary spending and more resilient, than adult orthodontic case starts, we're pleased that in Q1, our Clear Aligner volumes for both adults and teens were up sequentially and year-over-year.\nWe believe the Invisalign Palatal Expander system is one of the most exciting innovations we've developed in our 27-year history and is a better option for expanding a growing patient's narrow pallet. Initial response from doctors and patients for Invisalign Palatal Expander system is positive.\nThe Invisalign Palatal Expander system is not a traditional Invisalign aligner. It's a series of direct 3D-printed orthodontic appliances, based on proprietary and patented technology that has 4 systems designed for skeletal expansion. Clinical data shows that Invisalign Palatal Expander system is safe, effective and proven to deliver scheduler expansion.\nSpecifically, our clinical data is based on 49 patients across the United States and Canada between the ages of 6.9 and 11 with a mean age of 8.8 years. In this group, the mean expansion of 6 millimeters was achieved with minimal tipping with ranges between 3.4 and 10.7 millimeters as measured using the change in intermodal with between the initial and post-expansion scans with a mean expansion efficacy of 97%.\nIn addition, we found that survey doctors agree the Invisalign Palatal Expander is less painful than traditional expanders and facilitates better oral hygiene compared to traditional metal expanders. Phase I or early intercepted treatment includes both skeletal, orthopedic and dental orthodontic arch expansion and makes up to 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year, combined with Invisalign First, aligner treatment, Invisalign Palatal Expanders provide doctors with a full early interceptive treatment solution that allows doctors to treat all Phase I patients.\nWe expect Invisalign Palatal Expander to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approvals. Today, Invisalign is the most recognized orthodontic brand globally, and Invisalign Clear Aligner treatment is faster and more effective than traditional metal braces. Yet the underlying market opportunity remains huge and untapped.\nWe continue to invest in consumer marketing and demand creation initiatives to raise awareness and drive potential patients to Invisalign practices globally. Below our several highlights from Q1 and more information is available in our Q1, '24 earnings webcast slides. In Q1 '24, we delivered 14.5 billion impressions and have 43 million visits to our websites globally.\nTo increase awareness and educate young adults, parents and teams about the benefits of the Invisalign brand, we continue to invest and create campaigns and top media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat and WeChat across markets, reaching young adults as well as teams and their parents also requires the right engagement to Invisalign influencers and creator-centric campaigns.\nOur teen and business drama free campaign was recently recognized by the Association of National Advertisers with a silver award in the REGI Awards for creative and strategic excellence. In the U.S., in addition to our ongoing influencer campaigns, we partner with athletes such as Maskrosby, TikTok Gen Z influencer, Overtime Meg and the famous fashion designer, Christine Yusik to create a compelling brand activation at the Super Bowl.\nOur campaigns delivered more than 6.1 billion impressions and 18.1 million unique visitors to our consumer websites across the Americas. In the EMEA region, we partner with influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta and launched our global consumer campaigns for teens and parents.\nOur campaigns delivered more than 1.6 billion media impressions and 8.9 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 6.6 billion impressions and 16 million visitors to our websites, a 109% increase year-over-year.\nWe expanded our reach in Japan and India via Meta and YouTube and partner with key influencers to reach consumers across social media. We saw increased brand interest from consumers as evidenced by a 285% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 129% increase in Japan.\nFinally, digital tools such as My Invisalign Consumer and Patient app continue to increase with 4 million downloads to date and over 381,000 monthly active users, 15% year-over-year growth rate. Q1 '24 Clear Aligner volume from DSO customers increased sequentially, reflecting growth in the Americas and the EMEA regions and increased year-over-year, reflecting growth across international regions.\nDental service organizations, or DSOs, represent a large and growing opportunity to help drive adoption of digital technology across the dental industry. We have established relationships with many DSOs globally, that recognize the benefits of digital workflows enabled by our portfolio of products and services that make up the Align Digital platform, including increased practice efficiency and profitability, as well as delivering a better patient experience from shorter cycle times and proximity to their customers.\nSmile Docs in Heartland Dental are some of the largest DSO partners and are continuously exploring collaboration with DSOs that can further adoption of digital dentistry. Each DSO has a different strategy and business model and our focus is on working with the encouraging DSOs aligned with our vision, strategy and business model goals.\nToday, we announced an additional $75 million equity increase in Heartland. Following the previous $75 million equity investment a year ago. Heartland is a multidisciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the United States. Their growth strategy includes Heartland's de novo dental practices, which feature modern technology, located in areas with a strong community need for dentistry. Where Heartland provides practices with opportunities for mentorship, leadership training and continuing education.\nIn the last 4 years, Heartland opened 240 state-of-the-art de novo practices across the U.S. and are planning to continue investing through more de novo openings. We have a shared sense of purpose with Heartland. Their mission is to help doctors and their teams deliver the highest quality digital dental care to the communities they serve.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nChief Financial Officer & SVP-Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $997.4 million, up 4.3% from the prior quarter and up 5.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. .\nOn a constant currency basis, Q1 '24 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $10 million or approximately 1% sequentially and were unfavorably impacted by approximately $4.8 million year-over-year or approximately 0.5%.\nFor Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $817.3 million were up 4.5% sequentially, primarily from higher ASPs and higher volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Clear Aligner revenues were up 3.5%, primarily due to higher volumes and ASPs and increased non-case revenues. For Q1, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and up year-over-year.\nOn a sequential basis, ASPs primarily reflect higher additional aligners and price increases and the variable impact of foreign exchange partially offset by a product mix shift to lower ASP products. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs primarily reflect higher additional aligners and price increases partially offset by a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher discounts and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nFor Q1, Invisalign ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were down sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect unfavorable country mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by the favorable impact from foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the decrease in noncomprehensive ASPs reflect the product mix shift to lower ASP products, unfavorable country mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by lower net revenue deferrals.\nAs a reminder, we announced about a 5% global price increase for some Invisalign products across most markets, effective January 1, 2024. This price increase did not include Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three products. Invisalign comprehensive 33 product is available in North America and in certain markets in EMEA and APAC, most recently launching in French territories and in the Middle East.\nWe are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive Three and Three product and anticipate it will continue increasing, providing doctors the flexibility that they want and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time, compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.\nQ1 '24 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by a favorable foreign exchange of approximately $8.4 million or approximately 1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.9 million or approximately 0.5%.\nClear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet decreased $26.7 million or 2% sequentially and increased $15.8 million or 1.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q1 '24 Systems and Services revenue of $180.2 million were up 3.1% sequentially, primarily due to increased nonsystems revenues, mostly related to upgrades and higher ASPs, partially offset by lower volumes.\nQ1 '24 Systems and Services revenue were up 17.5% year-over-year primarily due to increased nonsystems revenues, mostly related to upgrades, higher scanner volumes and higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold CAD/CAM and Services revenue for Q1 represents approximately 51% of our Systems and Services business.\nQ1 '24 Systems and Services revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.9% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $0.9 million or approximately 0.5%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $14.3 million or 5.5% sequentially and down $25.3 million or 9.4% year-over-year primarily due to the recognition of services revenues, which will -- which is recognized ratably over the service period.\nThe decline in deferred revenues, both sequentially and year-over-year reflects the shorter duration of service contracts with initial scanner purchases. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade and make trades, in addition to other scanner leasing and rental programs, developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and our DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold.\nWe're pleased to be able to leverage our technological innovations and operational capabilities and efficiencies to provide different types of go-to-market models to our customers, such as rentals and leasing, selling the way that our customers want to buy.\nMoving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 70%, approximately flat sequentially and year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.3 points sequentially and and unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.1 points on a year-over-year basis.\nClear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 70.9%, down 0.3 points sequentially due primarily due to higher manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher ASP. Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was down 0.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher manufacturing spend, partially offset by favorable ASP.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was 65.9%, up 1.1 points sequentially due to higher ASP partially offset by manufacturing variances. Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was up 4.3 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASP, lower service and manufacturing costs.\nQ1 operating expenses were $543.7 million, up 9.2% sequentially and 3.1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up by $45.7 million from higher incentive compensation and consumer marketing spend, partially offset by restructuring and other charges not recurring in Q1. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $16.5 million, primarily due to our continued investments in sales and R&D activities and higher incentive compensation.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions and restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $506.1 million, up 13.3% sequentially and up 3.2% year-over-year. Our first quarter operating income of $154.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 15.5% and down 2.5 points sequentially and up 1.3 points year-over-year.\nThe sequential decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to investments in our go-to-market teams and higher incentive compensation. The year-over-year increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage and proactively managing our costs, partially offset by unfavorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately 0.7 points.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions and restructuring and other charges, operating margin for the first quarter was 19.8%, down 4 points sequentially and up 1.3 points year-over-year. Interest and other income expense net for the first quarter was an income of $4.3 million, compared to an income of $1.3 million in Q4 of '23 and an income of $1.1 million in Q1 of '23, primarily driven by a gain on our equity investments and net interest income, and offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.\nThe GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.7% compared to 28.3% in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the fourth quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to discrete tax benefits recognized in Q4 of '23, partially offset by increased earnings in low tax jurisdictions in Q1 of '24.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 20%, which reflects our long-term projected tax rate. First quarter net income per diluted share was $1.39, down sequentially $0.24 and up $0.26, compared to the prior year. Our EPS was not impacted on a sequential basis from foreign exchange. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.09 on a year-over-year basis to foreign exchange.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.14 for the first quarter, down $0.28 sequentially and up $0.32 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and short term and long-term marketable securities were $902.5 million, down sequentially $78.2 million and down $18.9 million year-over-year. Of our $902.5 million balance, $217.5 million was held in the U.S. and $685 million was held by our international entities.\nIn January 2024, we received approximately 37,000 shares of our common stock upon final settlement of the $250 million accelerated share repurchase from Q4 of '23. In total, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares at an average price per share of $230.13 under the Q4 ASR contract.\nWe have 650 million available for repurchase of our common stock under our January 2023 repurchase program. During Q2 '24, we expect to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchase or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $950.7 million, up sequentially.\nOur overall days sales outstanding was 86 days up approximately 1 day sequentially and up approximately 3 days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $28.7 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $9.4 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $19.3 million.\nWe're continuing to use our healthy balance sheet to drive growth and profitability. During the quarter, we continued to make disciplined investments in our strategic growth drivers. We completed the acquisition of Cubicure, which will enable us to scale our 3D printing operations to eventually direct print millions of custom appliances per day, and we exited the quarter with a healthy cash flow position and no long-term debt, maintaining a strong position to support our additional $75 million investment in our DSO partner Heartland Dental and our $150 million stock buyback.\nNow turning to our outlook. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following framework for Q2 and fiscal 2024. For Q2 '24, we provide the following business outlook. For Q2 '24, we expect worldwide revenues to be in the range of $1.30 billion to $1.50 billion. We expect Clear Aligner volume to be up sequentially and Clear Aligner ASP to be down slightly sequentially, primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange.\nWe expect Systems and Services revenue to be up sequentially as we continue to ramp iTero Lumina in Q2 2024. We expect Q2 '24 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above Q1 '24 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins, respectively. For fiscal '24, we provide the following business outlook.\nWe expect fiscal '24 total revenue to be 6% to 8% versus 2023, which is higher than our prior outlook of up mid-single-digit growth compared to 2023. The increase in our 2024 revenue outlook reflects our Q1 results and continued execution of our growth strategies, we anticipate that the incremental revenue reflected in our 2024 outlook will be roughly split 50-50 between our 2 operating segments.\nWe expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner ASPs to be slightly up year-over-year. We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above the 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. We expect our capital -- our investments in capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. In summary, Q1 was a good start for the year. While I'm pleased with our results, I'm even more excited about Align's innovation in 2024 on our next wave of growth drivers that we believe will continue to revolutionize the orthodontic and dental industry in scanning software and direct 3D printing.\nOur focused execution of our product road map and innovation pipeline has resulted in the largest introduction of new products and technologies in our history, further advancing our software, scanning and 3D printing capabilities. We're excited about the potential for these strategic investments to enable a new phase of growth to transform the orthodontic industry again.\nThe iTero Lumina intraoral scanner has the potential to set a new standard of care for dental practices by simplifying the scanning of complex oral regions while offering superior chairside visualization and a more comfortable experience for patients, especially kids. The Invisalign Palatal Expander increases the clinical applicability of the Invisalign system to nearly 100% of orthodontic case starts.\nIt is a revolutionary removable 3D-printed appliance that is clinically proven to be safe and effective. It is less painful than traditional metal expanders and promotes better oral hygiene. And our recent acquisition of Cubicure, a pioneer of 3D printing solutions for polymer additive manufacturing brings a talented team and unique cutting-edge technology into a line to help us scale our 3D printing operations, providing ultimate design freedom and highly customized outcomes from a customer and patient standpoint as well as operational benefits to the business.\nWe see incredible opportunities in this business and continue to make the Invisalign system the standard of care in orthodontics. By continually innovating and developing digital technologies and services that enable more doctors to easily diagnose and treat patients with crooked teeth and help them retain their healthy beautiful smiles. We're increasing access to care for millions of people, who might not otherwise receive orthodontic treatment.\nWith that, I thank you for your time today. We look forward to sharing our continued progress in leading the digital transformation of the orthodontic and restorative dental industry. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator?",

I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO. We issued fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 1 month.\nAs a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events and product outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website and at sec.gov. Actual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, if applicable, and our fourth quarter and full year 2023 conference call slides on our website under quarterly results. Please refer to these files for more detailed information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, Systems, Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q4 financial performance and comment on our views for 2024. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nI'm pleased to report fourth quarter results with better-than-expected revenues and earnings. As of the end of Q4, we achieved several major milestones, including 17 million Invisalign patients treated, including 4.7 million teens, plus 4 million Vivera Retainer cases and over 100,000 iTero scanners sold. And for the full year -- fiscal year 2023, total revenues exceeded our prior outlook, and we delivered fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating margin above 21%.\nFor Q4, total revenues were up 6.1% year-over-year, reflecting increased systems and services revenues. Strength in Clear Aligner volumes for teens and international doctors as well as continued growth from Invisalign touch-up cases, under our Invisalign Doctor subscription program, or DSP. Our Q4 Systems and Services revenues were up year-over-year, primarily due to increased services, CAD/CAM and nonsystems revenues, including scanner leasing and rental programs and certified preowned scanner sales. Q4 total clear aligner shipments were slightly lower year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, Clear aligner volumes were down for the Americas and EMEA regions and were up for the APAC region. For Q4, Clear Aligner shipments include approximately 20,000 Invisalign DSP touch-up cases, primarily in North America, an increase of more than 60% year-over-year from Q4 '22. DSP continues to be well received by our customers and is currently available in the U.S. and Canada, Iberia and Nordics and most recently, the U.K. We're excited that DSP is proving helpful to doctors and their patients as we continue to expand the program. For fiscal 2023, total Invisalign DSP touch-up cases shipped were 73,000, up 85% year-over-year. For non-case revenues, Q4 was up 13.3% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth from Vivera Retainers along with Invisalign DSP retainer revenues.\nOn a sequential basis, Q4 total revenues were down slightly, 0.4%, primarily reflecting anticipated seasonally lower teens case starts, especially in the U.S. ortho channel and unfavorable foreign exchange offset somewhat by increased revenues from system and services as well as an increase in clear aligner volume for adults and noncomprehensive cases and stronger volumes from Canada and the EMEA region. Q4 total aligner shipments were slightly lower sequentially. On a sequential basis, Clear Aligner volumes were down for the Americas and APAC regions and were up sequentially for the EMEA region. The December gauge practice analysis tool that collects and consolidates data from approximately 1,000 orthodontic practices across the U.S. and Canada reported year-over-year decline for new patients, total exams and total starts, particularly among teens and kids. It also shows a year-over-year decline for wires and brackets and total clear aligner starts with Invisalign case starts better than the Clear Aligner brand. And the teen segment for Q4, a 197,000 teens in younger patients started treatment with Invisalign Clear Aligner Systems, up 6% year-over-year and were a record number of teen cases shipped compared to prior fourth quarters. Q4 teens starts were down sequentially, consistent with historical seasonality, primarily in China as well as seasonally fewer teen starts in North America compared to Q3.\nFor fiscal 2023, total Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and younger patients reached a total of 809,000 cases, up 8% compared to the prior year and made up 34% of total clear aligner shipments. During Q4, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the Invisalign pallet expander system, we call it IPE, Invisalign Pilot Expander for commercial availability in the United States. The FDA 510(k) clearance is for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens and adults. Full early intervention treatments such as Phase I or early interceptive treatment, makes up about 20% of the orthodontic case starts each year and is growing. Together with Invisalign First Aligners, IPEs provide doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal, dental malocclusions and growing children.\nThe addition of mandibular advancement features to Invisalign aligners also provides doctors with more options for treating skeletal, dental Jon balances and bite correction and for their growing patients during their teenage years. Essentially, we now have an Invisalign digital treatment solution for every phase of treatment. IP is currently available on a limited basis in Canada and the United States, and we recently received regulatory clearance in Australia and New Zealand where we anticipate commercialization in Q2. We expect IP to be available in other markets pending future applicable regulatory approvals. We're also launching ClinCheck Smile video, the next generation of into digitalization with AI-assisted video that is expected to be available to all doctors who use the Invisalign practice app and ClinCheck treatment planning software. This new tool is designed to help improve patients' understanding and of the confidence in Invisalign treatment and is based on Itera inter-oral scanners and doctors ClinCheck plan for Invisalign treatment. ClinCheck smile video simulates the doctor's ClinCheck treatment plan with a short video of a patient's face, and they talk and smile, which helps patients visualize their potential new smile and can lead to a higher patient treatment acceptance. We expect to roll out ClinCheck Smile video in Q1 '24 in North America and EMEA, followed by APAC later in the year.\nBefore I turn the call over to John for our fourth quarter financial review, I want to share one more exciting news. Today, we introduced the latest innovation in the iTero family of inter-oral scanners. The iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner designed to meet the needs of doctors and their patients by offering smaller and with unparalleled data capture capabilities for effortly scanning by clinical members. The iTero Alumina Inter-oral scanner is a breakthrough technology. With 3x wider field of capture and a 50% smaller [indiscernible] that delivers faster scanning, higher accuracy and superior visualization for greater practice efficiency. iTero alumina quickly, easily and accurately captures more data while delivering exceptionally scanned quality and photorealistic images that eliminate the need for inter-oral photos altogether. Doctors can now scan at twice the speed with a wide field of capture, multi-angled scanning and large capture distance, meaning they can capture more dentition in greater detail throughout the scanning process. To date, Align has filed over 30 patent applications covering technology related to the iTero alumina inter-oral scanner. I believe iTero Lumina has the potential to set a new standard of care for dental practices by simplifying the scanning of complex oral regions while offering superior chairside visualization and more comfortable experience for patients, especially kids.\nInitial doctor feedback has been very positive, noting that iTero alumina scanner is much faster, clear, less invasive for their patients and the imaging and visualization translates to better communications and patient experience. The iTero Lumina inter-oral scanner is available now with orthodontic workflows and will be available in the second half of 2024 restorative workflows, although we expect that GP practices can benefit now from the new scanning technology. A global broadcast to unveil iTero Lumina and provide attendees with insights and detailed information from our iTero team and early customer users is planned for February 15. Registration will open on February 1 and the link has been provided in our financial slides as well as in today's press release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nChief Financial Officer & SVP-Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $956.7 million, down 0.4% from the prior quarter and up 6.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q4 '23 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $12.8 million or approximately 1.3% sequentially and were favorably impacted by approximately $13.8 million year-over-year or approximately 1.5%. For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $781.9 million were down 1.6% sequentially, primarily from lower volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 clear aligner revenues were up 6.9% and primarily due to higher ASPs and non-case revenues slightly offset by lower volumes. For Q4, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and up year-over-year.\nOn a sequential basis, ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, higher sales credits and higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, price increases and favorable impact from foreign exchange partially offset by higher discounts in product mix to lower ASP products. For Q4, ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in ASPs reflect the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher net revenue deferrals, partially offset by price increases and lower discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in ASPs reflect price increases, the impact from favorable foreign exchange and higher additional aligners, partially offset by a product mix shift to lower ASP products and higher discounts.\nLast quarter, we announced a about a 5% global price increase for some Invisalign products across most markets effective January 1, 2024. We Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 product is available in North America and certain markets in EMEA and APAC, most recently launching in China, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 products and anticipate it will continue to increase, providing doctors the flexibility they want and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.\nQ4 '23 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $10.7 million or approximately 1.4% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $12 million or approximately 1.6%. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $14.9 million or 1.2% sequentially and $74.6 million were up 6.1% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q4 '23 systems and services revenues of $174.8 million were up 5.8% sequentially primarily due to higher ASPs and an increase in CAD/CAM and services revenue, partially offset by lower volumes and were up 2.9% year-over-year, primarily due to higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and increased nonsystem revenues related to our CPO and leasing rental programs mostly offset by lower ASPs and scanner volume.\nCAD/CAM and services revenues for Q4 represent approximately 50% of our Systems and Services business. Q4 '23 Systems and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.1 million or approximately 1.2% sequential. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenue were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.9 million or approximately 1.1%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet were down $4.3 million or 1.6% sequentially and down $13.1 million or 4.8% year-over-year, primarily due to the recognition of services revenue which is recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins and purchase certified preowned scanners in certain markets. developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold. Moving on to gross margin.\nFourth quarter overall gross margin was 70%, up 0.9 points sequentially and up 1.5 points year-over-year. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 70.5% up 0.9 points sequentially and up 1.2 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.4 points sequentially and favorably impacted by approximately 0.4 points on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.1% up 0.4 points sequentially primarily due to lower manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher freight costs. Clear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 0.3 points year-over-year, primarily due to higher ASPs and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher manufacturing spend and print costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.8%, up 3.8 points sequentially due to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher service and freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was up 6 points year-over-year due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower ASPs.\nBefore I go into the details, I want to note that during Q4 '23, we incurred a total of $14 million of restructuring and other charges, primarily related to post-employment benefits. Q4 operating expenses were $498 million, roughly flat sequentially and down 1.4 points year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly due primarily due to restructuring and other charges, offset by lower employee compensation. Year-over-year, operating expenses decreased by $7.1 million primarily due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs, partially offset by employee-related costs and slightly higher restructuring charges. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $446.7 million, down 2.5% sequentially and down 2.8% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating income of $171.5 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.9%, up 0.6 points sequentially and up 5.4 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.6 points sequentially primarily due to foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to operating leverage and proactively managing our costs as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.6 points.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation restructuring and other charges, the amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisition, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 23.8%, up 2 points sequentially and up 5.5 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was an income of $1.3 million compared to a loss of $4.2 million in the third quarter and income of $2.7 million in Q4 2022, primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.3%, higher than the third quarter effective tax rate of 25.1% and lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate of 63.8% and in the prior year. The fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to onetime benefit related to tax guidance issued in Q3, partially offset by lower U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in Q4. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology.\nFourth quarter net income per share was $1.64, up sequentially $0.06 and up $1.10 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.07 on a sequential basis and favorably impacted by $0.08 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.42 for the fourth quarter, up $0.28 sequentially and up $0.69 year-over-year. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents in short and long term marketable securities were $980.8 million, down sequentially $321.2 million and down $60.8 million year-over-year. Of our $980.8 million balance, $196.1 million was held in the U.S. and $784.7 million was held by our international entities. In October 2023, we purchased approximately 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $190.56 per share through a $250 million except share repurchase. And in November and December 2023, we purchased approximately 466,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $214.81 per share through a $100 million open market purchase, both under Align's current $1 billion stock repurchase program. We have $650 million remaining available for repurchase of our common stock under this stock repurchase program.\nQ4 accounts receivable balance was $903.4 million, slightly down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, flat sequentially and year-over-year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $46.9 million, Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $33.4 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $13.5 million.\nNow turning to our outlook. Assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, we provide the following framework for Q1 and fiscal 2024. For Q1 2024, we expect our worldwide revenues to be in the range of $960 million to $980 million, up slightly from Q4 of 2023. We expect Clear Aligner volume and ASPs to be up slightly sequentially. We expect Systems and Services revenue to be down slightly sequentially, although less than the historical seasonal decline, given the launch of the iTero Lumina for ortho workflows in Q1 2024. We expect our Q1 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above Q1 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. For full year, we expect fiscal 2024 total revenues to be up mid-single digits over 2023. We expect fiscal 2024 Clear Aligner and Systems and Services revenues to grow year-over-year in the same approximate range as our 2024 total revenues. We expect fiscal 2024 clear aligner ASPs to be up slightly year-over-year primarily due to price increases and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by a higher mix of noncomprehensive products, which have lower ASPs. We expect fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above the 2023 GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating margin, respectively. We expect our investments in capital expenditures for the fiscal 2024 to be approximately $100 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued expansion.\nIn summary, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results, and I am especially proud of our continued focused execution of our product road map and innovation pipeline. We are committed to delivering on our strategic growth drivers of international expansion, patient demand, orthodontist utilization and GP dentist treatment to extend our leadership in digital orthodontics and dentistry. I believe that the next wave of innovation that we are introducing into the market will further differentiate align and allow us to continue to increase our share of the large untapped market opportunity of 22 million annual orthodontic case starts as well as an additional 600 million consumers who could benefit from a healthy, beautiful smile using Invisalign clear aligners.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. In closing, while I'm pleased with our better-than-expected fourth quarter results and start to the year, I'm even more excited about Align innovation in 2024 and our next wave of growth drivers. When I spoke to you about a year ago, I discussed the innovations that we are planning to bring to market that we continue to revolutionize the orthodontic and dental industry and scanning software and direct 3D printing. We are delivering on that promise. With the introduction of iTero Lumina powered by multidirect capture technology, we are pushing the boundaries of what inter-oral scanners can do. iTero Lumina is a combination of years of research and development to offer visualization capabilities that support doctors, clinical decisions while also enhancing their patients comfort and overall treatment experiences. Building on more than 20 years of expertise in revolutionizing imaging technologies, the iTero Lumina scanner elevates the standard in digital scanning to achieve exceptional clinical outcomes and increased practice efficiency. The iTero scanner is at the forefront of digital dentistry.\nWith the closing of our acquisition of CubiCure, a pioneer of direct 3D printing solutions for polymer additive manufacturing, we will enable the next generation of 3D printed products, helping to create more unique configurations for aligners that are more sustainable and also efficient solutions. We also expect it to extend and scale our printing materials and manufacturing capabilities for our 3D printed product portfolio, which now includes the Invisalign pilot expander system. And with the introduction of IPE, we have expanded the clinical applicability of the Invisalign system to nearly 100% of the orthodontic case starts. The ability to direct 3D print, IPE will eventually lead to other direct printed products with the goal of direct 3D printed an Invisalign clear aligners, which we hope to achieve in the next couple of years. As a company, Align has multifaceted competitive advantage, technology innovation, where we invest up to $300 million in R&D per year to bring in some of the most disruptive products in digital dentistry and orthodontics to the market in a highly regulated industry. A direct sales force that consists of 5,000 highly trained specialists, a doctor center model because we understand the importance of doctor-directed care, a $1 billion brand trusted by over 17 million patients worldwide and global scale and manufacturing to deliver millions of customized Clear Aligner parts every day. We are extremely pleased with our latest innovations and commercialization of products to better serve our doctor customers and their patients. Our belief in the future business overall is unwavering.\nBefore we turn the call over to the operator, I want to address an important matter regarding DTC or directed consumer clear aligners in our industry. Align has always believed that a doctor-centered model for orthodontic treatment is the safest for patients, and we're always looking for new and better ways to support doctors as they work to create better smiles for their patients. Recent news regarding the bankruptcy of a DTC clear aligner company has led many consumers to reach out to Invisalign providers to address their unmet needs, including helping those DTC patients with incomplete treatments. To support these former DTC patients who are seeking help from Invisalign providers and practices, in Q4 we introduced a program in the U.S. and select other markets, offering up to a 50% off Invisalign case submission in Vivera Retention to help offset any additional cost to finish their treatment. We want to help everyone achieve a healthy beautiful smile and strongly recommend that individuals who have impacted by this matter, seek the advice of a licensed orthodontist or dentists. Our concierge team is always available to answer questions and help connect consumers with Invisalign practices.\nWith that, I'll thank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technologies. You may begin.\n\nShirley Stacy\n\nVice President of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO. We issued third quarter 2023 financial results today via Business Wire, which is available on our website at investor.aligntech.com. Today's conference call is being audio webcast and will be archived on our website for approximately 1 month.\nAs a reminder, the information provided and discussed today will include forward-looking statements, including statements about Align's future events, products and outlook. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve risks and uncertainties and that are described in more detail in our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on our website and at sec.gov.\nActual results may vary significantly, and Align expressly assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We have posted historical financial statements, including the corresponding reconciliations, including our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, if applicable. And our third quarter 2023 conference call slides on our website under quarterly results. Please refer to these files for more detail.\nNote, as of Q3 Invisalign DSP touch-up cases and associated revenues have been reclassified to the noncomprehensive Clear Aligner segment and are now reflected in our reported Clear Aligner case volumes, revenues and business metrics. Prior to this quarter, they were not reported in the non-case category. Unless otherwise stated, all metrics include DSP touch-up cases and reported Clear Aligner volumes.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments: Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q3 financial performance and comment on our views for the remainder of the year. Following that, we'll come back and summarize a few key points, and we'll take questions. .\nOur third quarter results reflect lower-than-expected demand in a more difficult macro environment than we experienced in the first half of 2023. Dental practices and industry research firms have reported deteriorating trends, including decreased patient visits and increased pacing cancellations, along with fewer orthodontic case starts overall, especially among adult patients. The September Gaidge report, which reflects more than 1,200 North American ortho practices shows deceleration for orthodontic treatment and new orthodontic patient appointments were down 8.7% year-over-year, and ortho case starts were down 6.9% year-over-year, the biggest decrease in over a year.\nDespite these headwinds, total Q3 worldwide revenues of $960 million were up 7.8% year-over-year with growth across all regions. For Q3, we had record Clear Aligner shipments to teenage and younger patients, which increased 10% sequentially and 8.4% year-over-year, driven by continued strength from Invisalign First. Q3 year-over-year revenue growth also reflects improvement in APAC, offset by more pronounced summer seasonality in EMEA and North America. Our Q3 Systems and Services revenues were up 4.9% year-over-year despite continued challenges for capital equipment, primarily due to higher iTero scanner volumes in the Americas and APAC regions, reflecting certified preowned or what we call CPO sales, scanner leasing and rental programs as well as increased services revenue.\nQ3 systems and services revenues were down sequentially, primarily due to a weaker capital equipment cycle as well as lower nonsystems revenues. This was partially offset by higher scanner volumes in the Americas, reflecting the increased mix of iTero 5D Plus scanners, including more trade and trade ups for DSO customer in Q3.\nQ3 non-case revenues were up 13.5% year-over-year, primarily due to continued growth from Vivera retainers and increased adoption of Invisalign Doctor subscription program, or DSP, our monthly subscription-based Clear Aligner program, which includes retainers, low-stage touch up and Clear Aligner treatment. For Q3, we shipped over 19,000 DSP touch-up cases, primarily in North America, an increase of more than 70% year-over-year from Q3 '22. DSP continues to be well received by our customers and is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Iberia and the Nordics. We are excited about the DSP is proving helpful to doctors and their patients. We're continuing to expand the program in EMEA and with certain DSO partners in Q4.\nFor Q3, total Clear Aligner volumes were down 3.3% sequentially and up 2.3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting weaker-than-expected demand for orthodontic treatment, especially for adult patients. As I said earlier, despite soft consumer trends, our teen and younger patient business was strong across all regions, up both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to continued adoption of Invisalign First for kids as young as 6 years old.\nIn terms of Invisalign submitters, the total number of doctors shipped for Q3 increased sequentially to approximately 85,200 doctors, the highest number in 2 years, driven by the Americas and APAC regions. From a channel perspective, orthodontist submitters were up year-over-year, especially from doctors submitting teenage cases, offset by fewer GP dentists year-over-year, particularly in the Americas.\nOn a geographic basis, Q3 Clear Aligner volumes reflect a sequential increase in Invisalign shipments from the APAC and Latin American regions as well as North American Invisalign teenage cases. This was offset by lower volume and more pronounced softness from summer seasonality in EMEA and North America, primarily Invisalign adult cases.\nFor the Americas Invisalign case volume, Q3 '23 was down sequentially, primarily due to lower Invisalign adult shipments in the GP channel and slightly down year-over-year. Q3 '23 Clear Aligner volumes reflect increased submitters in the ortho channel with an increase in teen and younger case starts, driven by momentum from Invisalign First. This is reflected in the September Gaidge data, which shows Invisalign Ortho starts perform better than wires and brackets and other Clear Aligners. In North America, adoption of Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 product drove sequential volume growth in Q3 '23. Invisalign DSP touchup cases in North America also drove growth sequentially year-over-year.\nFor EMEA, Q3 Clear Aligner volumes were down sequentially, primarily from the impact of Q3 summer seasonality when doctors' offices are closed for summer vacations and more consumers are traveling. This was partially offset by sequential growth in Italy, Benelux, Turkey and the Middle East. Year-over-year, Clear Aligner volumes were up reflecting continued adoption of Invisalign Moderate, the comprehensive [ 3 in 3 ] product as well as an increase in teen case starts, driven primarily by Invisalign First and our new Invisalign Teen case packs.\nFor APAC, Q3 Clear Aligner volumes were up sequentially and up year-over-year, reflecting improving trends in China as well as other key markets like India, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Thailand. Q3 APAC results also reflected increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization, especially for teen patients, driven by growth from Invisalign First in the orthodontic channel during our typically strong teen season in China. Q3 APAC results also reflect growth in the GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization sequentially and year-over-year.\nDuring Q3, we continued the rollout of Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 product in APAC, most recently launched in China. Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 is also available in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan and India. We are pleased with the adoption of the 3 and 3 product in APAC where the majority of cases treated are comprehensive, allowing our doctor customers more flexibility within Invisalign product portfolio.\nDuring the quarter, we also shipped to a record number of doctors in APAC, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year. Invisalign is the most trusted brand in the orthodontic industry globally and it's important that we continue to create demand for Invisalign Clear Aligners, especially given the macroeconomic pressures on doctors and their patients. In Q3, we delivered 11.1 billion impressions and had 27.7 million visits to our websites globally. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents of teens about the benefits of the Invisalign brand, we continue to invest and create campaigns in top media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, WeChat, and Douyin across markets. The underlying market opportunity for Clear Aligner treatment especially for teens and kids remains huge and significantly underpenetrated.\nWe know Invisalign Clear Aligner treatment is faster and more effective than braces, yet the vast majority of orthodontic cases are still treated using brackets and wires. Differentiation is key to increasing Invisalign's share of the orthodontic case starts, especially among teens and their parents. We are continuing to differentiate through novel campaigns, such as our new Invis is Drama Free Teen campaign, which uses humor to juxtapose the significant benefits of Invisalign treatment over metal braces.\nSimilarly, to differentiate Invisalign treatment for adults, we launched new campaigns globally using powerful patient stories that share how important a smile is and how Invisalign treatment increases self-confidence that transforms lives. Reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents also requires the right engagement to Invisalign influencers and creator-centric campaigns, which delivered 5.8 billion impressions in the Americas in Q3.\nCreators such as Michael Cimino; Jaylyn Hall; NFL player, Darren Waller and also the Leilani Green showed their results and why they chose to transform their smiles with Invisalign Aligners. In the EMEA region, we partnered with influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta and launched our global consumer campaign for teens and parents of teens, highlighting the benefits of Invisalign treatment versus braces.\nIn Germany, we continue to see positive engagement with our patient testimonial campaign launched in the previous quarter. Our consumer campaigns delivered more than 1.4 billion media impressions and 6.9 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 3.9 billion impressions and 11.9 million visitors to our websites in the quarter. We expanded our region in Japan and India via Meta and YouTube, and partner with key influencers to reach consumers across social media.\nWe saw increased brand interest from consumers as evidenced by an over 800% increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 135% increase in Japan. Finally, digital tools such as My Invisalign consumer and patient app continued to increase with 3.4 million downloads to date and over 367,000 monthly active users, representing a 19% year-over-year growth.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nChief Financial Officer & SVP-Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 '23 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $960.2 million, down 4.2% from the prior quarter and up 7.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q3 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2.7 million or approximately 0.3% sequentially and favorably impacted by approximately $4.2 million year-over-year or approximately 0.4%.\nFor Clear Aligners, Q3 revenues of $794.9 million were down 4.5% sequentially, primarily from lower volumes and lower ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Clear Aligner revenues were up 8.5%, primarily due to higher ASPs, higher volumes and higher non-case revenues. For Q3, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect larger discounts, product shift, mix shift to lower-priced products and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners.\nOn a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners and price increases, partially offset by larger discounts and unfavorable product mix shift. For Q3, Invisalign ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decrease in ASPs reflect larger discounts, higher sales credits and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by higher additional aligners and favorable foreign exchange.\nOn a year-over-year basis, the increase in noncomprehensive ASPs reflects price increases, higher additional aligners and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by product mix shift. In Q1 '23, we launched the Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 product. The 3 and 3 configuration offers our doctor customers Invisalign comprehensive treatment with 3 additional aligners included within 3 years of the treatment end date instead of unlimited additional aligners within 5 years of the treatment end date at the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price.\nInvisalign comprehensive 3 and 3 product is available in North America and in certain markets in EMEA and APAC, most recently launching in China, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign comprehensive 3 and 3 product and anticipate it will continue to increase providing doctors the flexibility they want and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.\nAs we begin to ship more additional aligners for comprehensive 3 and 3 products, we expect to see an ASP benefit. As revenues from subscriptions, retainers and other ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total Clear Aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be a more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy.\nQ3 '23 Clear Aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2 million or approximately 0.3% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.8 million or approximately 0.5%. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $14.1 million or up 1.1% sequentially and up $116 million or up 9.9% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.\nQ3 '23 Systems and Services revenues of $165.3 million were down 2.5% sequentially, mostly due to unfavorable ASPs and lower revenues from our certified preowned program, partially offset by higher scanner volume and higher services revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 Systems and Services revenue were up 4.9% due to higher scanner volume, higher services revenue from our larger base of scanners sold and higher revenues from our certified preowned and leasing rental programs, partially offset by unfavorable ASPs. Q3 '23 Systems and Services revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $0.7 million or approximately 0.4% sequentially.\nOn a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenues were favorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $0.4 million or approximately 0.3%. The Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $4.4 million or 1.6% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in the deferral of service revenues included with scanner purchases and essentially flat or up slightly to $0.1 million or 0.1% year-over-year. Services deferred revenues will be recognized ratably over the service period.\nAs our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade make trade-ins and purchase certified preowned scanners in certain markets, developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold.\nMoving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 69.1%, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 0.5 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.1 point on a sequential basis and favorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.1 point on a year-over-year basis. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 70.7%, down 1.7 points sequentially, primarily from higher manufacturing spend and a higher mix of additional aligner volume and lower ASPs.\nClear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was roughly flat year-over-year, primarily due to increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations in our new manufacturing facility in Poland, partially offset by higher ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was 61%, down 4.1 points sequentially, primarily from lower ASPs, partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances, lower service and freight costs and higher services revenues.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was down 2.3 points year-over-year, primarily from lower ASPs, partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances, lower service and freight costs, favorable foreign exchange and higher service revenues. Q3 '23 operating expenses were $496.7 million, down sequentially 8.3% and up 4.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $44.9 million, primarily from lower consumer marketing spend and lower incentive compensation.\nYear-over-year operating expenses increased by $21.2 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $458.2 million, down 9.3% sequentially and up 3.3% year-over-year.\nOur third quarter operating income of $166.3 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.3%, up 0.1 point sequentially and up 1.2 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.3 points sequentially primarily due to foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase in operating margin is primarily attributable to operating leverage, partially offset by investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 0.1 point. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating margin for the third quarter was 21.8%, up 0.5 points sequentially and up 1.6 points year-over-year.\nInterest and other income expense net for the third quarter was a loss of $4.2 million compared to a loss of $0.3 million in the second quarter and a loss of $21 million in the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to foreign exchange. The GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 25.1% lower than the second quarter effective tax rate of 34.8% and lower than the third quarter effective tax rate of 40.7% of the prior year.\nThe third quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the second quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to the application of newly issued tax guidance and lower U.S. taxes on foreign earnings in Q3. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly periods in 2022.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate in the third quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Third quarter net income per diluted share was $1.58, up sequentially $0.12 and up $0.65 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.08 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.05 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.14 for the third quarter, down $0.08 sequentially and up $0.51 year-over-year.\nNote the prior note 2022 non-GAAP net income and prior year 2022 non-GAAP EPS reflects the Q4 '22 change in our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities were $1,301.9 million, up sequentially $268.1 million and up $160.9 million year-over-year. Of our $1.3 billion balance, $381 million was held in the U.S. and $920.6 million was held by our international entities.\nQ3 accounts receivable balance was $904.2 million, down sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 84 days, up approximately 3 days sequentially and down approximately 2 days as compared to Q3 last year. Cash flow from our operations for the third quarter was $287.2 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $21.6 million primarily related to our continued investments to increase Aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $265.6 million.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter outlook. For Q4 '23, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our worldwide revenue to be in the range of $920 million to $940 million, down sequentially from Q3 of '23. We expect both Clear Aligner and Systems and Services revenues to be down sequentially, reflecting a more challenging macro environment for doctors and patients with fewer orthodontic case starts overall, unfavorable foreign exchange, given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key currencies and longer sales cycles for capital equipment purchases. For our Clear Aligner business, we expect Clear Aligner Teen volume to be seasonally lower in Q4 of '23, and we don't anticipate improvement in Adult volumes.\nFor Q4 '23, we also expect Clear Aligner ASPs to be down sequentially, primarily due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. For our Systems and Services business, we anticipate increasing headwinds from macro uncertainty and potential supply issues related to the war in the Middle East. We expect our Q4 '23 GAAP operating margin to be down sequentially from Q3 of '23 due to restructuring primarily related to severance as we adjust headcount for this environment.\nWe anticipate our non-GAAP operating margin to be up sequentially from Q3 of '23. During Q1 '23, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 stock repurchase program. During Q4 '23, we expect to repurchase up to $250 million of our common stock through either or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement.\nFor full year 2023, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 worldwide revenue to be in the range of $3.83 billion to $3.85 billion. We also expect our full year 2023 GAAP operating margin to be roughly 1 point lower than 2022 and our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 21%. For 2023, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued international expansion.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. While our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook reflect weaker consumer sentiment and increased headwinds, including foreign exchange, Align is in a unique position to continue driving the digital revolution in the dental industry to help doctors transform and grow their practices with Invisalign Clear Aligners, iTero Scanners and Align digital platform. We're very excited about the recent innovations developed to further revolutionize digital treatment planning for orthodontics and also restorative dentistry by providing doctors with greater flexibility, real-time treatment plan modification capabilities and digital solutions to help improve practice productivity and patient experience, which are even more important to our customers in the current environment.\nThis includes ClinCheck live update for 3D controls, Invisalign Practice app, Invisalign Personal Plan or IPP and Invisalign Smile Architect, iTero-exocad connector, Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro and Invisalign Virtual Care AI software. These digital tools are continuing to gain adoption and help doctors gain efficiencies. In Q3, ClinCheck live update was used by 41,000 doctors on more than 560,000 cases, reducing time spent in modifying treatment by 21%. Invisalign Practice app is now actively used by about 87,000 doctors with over 5.2 million photos uploaded during the quarter via the Practice App.\nIn addition, we will launch Invisalign Palate expander, or IPE system in Canada this quarter, IPE is our first direct printed orthodontic device that provides a safe, comfortable and clinically effective alternative to metal palate expanders and boost our market opportunity in the teen market by addressing a portion of cases we couldn't otherwise treat without IPE.\nIn summary, we're committed to balancing our investments in the near- and long-term growth drivers while delivering improved operating margin. As we navigate one of the most challenging operating environments in recent history with increasing macroeconomic pressure on doctors and their patients, we have an enormous opportunity to continue driving adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry and responsibility to optimize our investments for the current environment.\nBefore turning the call over for questions, I'd like to address the war in the Middle East and our iTero scanner business. The situation continues to evolve and is very fluid. And we are monitoring developments closely. Our singular focus at this stage is on the safety and security of our employees and their families and our doctors and their staff and patients. Align offices and scanner manufacturing facility in Israel are currently open and operating. While we hope the situation will improve, we're preparing mitigation plans to ensure business continuity and will update our customers and other stakeholders as needed.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions Operator?",

Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, system services and clear aligners John will provide more detail on our Q2 financial performance and comment on our views for the third quarter and 2023 overall. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points, and we'll open the call to questions.\nOverall, I'm pleased to report another better-than-expected quarter with Q2 revenues and operating margins that exceeded our guidance. Q2 results reflect improving trends across regions, strength in teen and younger patient volumes, driven by momentum in both submitters and utilization as well as continued growth from Invisalign First. In the teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, 195,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the second quarter. An increase of 7% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, reflecting the highest annual growth rate in the teen segment since 2021.\nFor Systems & Services, second quarter revenues of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially and down very slightly 1% year-over-year. For Q2, sequential increases in systems and services revenues, reflects increased scanner volumes across the regions and higher services and nonsystem revenues, reflecting increased sales of certified preowned or what we call CPO scanners and higher subscription revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 services revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription revenues from a large number of iTero scanners in the field. We also had higher nonsystem scanner revenues related to our certified preowned again CPOs and our scanner leasing and rental programs.\nFor Q2, total ClearLiner revenues of $832.7 million up 5.4% sequentially and 4.3% year-over-year. Q2 sequential revenue growth rate is consistent with our historical 3-year average and reflects growth across all regions. Q2 non-case revenues at $80 million were up 6.2% sequentially and 18% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from Avera retainers and Invisalign Doctor subscription program, or DSP, our monthly subscription-based clear aligner program and commerce sales for aligner-related consumables, like aligner cases and whitening and cleaning products. DSP has been successful in addressing an important and growing opportunity for experienced Invisalign doctors. It is our first subscription-based clear aligner program that enables doctors to reach new patients and provide them with a better overall experience.\nDSP enables doctors flexibilities to treat simple touch-up cases or offer their patients a superior, flexible and convenient retention solution. We introduced DSP in the United States and Canada in 2021. We expanded it to Spain and the Nordic countries in Q2 2023, and we'll launch DSP in France and the United Kingdom in the second half of this year. We have also extended DSP to DSO partners who recognize the value of our Invisalign subscription aligner model. Over the past 2 years, our DSP subscription program has continued to ramp and in Q2 drove strong volume growth in touch-up cases typically 5 to 10 stage cases of aligners.\nFor Q2 '23, we shipped over 18,000 DSP touch-up cases in North America, up from [ 15,500 ] and in Q1 '23 and more than double the case volume in Q2 '22 last year. Given its continued success and contribution to our growth this year, DSP touch-up cases are included in my overall commentary for clear aligners. Otherwise, specified in my remarks, our case volumes and metrics do not include DSP and touch up cases. For Q2, total clear aligner volumes were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Q2 clear aligner volumes, including DSP touch-up cases, were up 5.4% sequentially and up 2.4% year-over-year. For the Americas, Q2 clear aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the region from both ortho and GP dentist channels, an increase in teen case starts driven by momentum from Invisalign First and increased adult patients from the GP dentist channel.\nIn North America, adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 product drove sequential volume growth. For Q2, North American ortho utilization was up sequentially and down a fraction year-over-year, including DSP touch-up cases. Q2 North American ortho utilization was up both sequentially and year-over-year as noted in our Q2 '23 earnings slides. For EMEA, Q2 Clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region and continued adoption of Invisalign Moderate Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 products as well as an increase in teen case starts, which grew sequentially and year-over-year driven by Invisalign First and our new Invisalign Teen case packs.On a sequential basis, ClearLiner growth was led by Iberia, Italy, dock and Turkey.\nFor APAC, Q2 clear aligner volumes were up sequentially and up year-over-year, reflecting improving trends in China as well as other key markets like Japan, Taiwan, Korea and India. Q2 APAC results also reflect increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization, especially for teen patients, driven by growth from Invisalign First in the orthodontic channel, which is especially important as we enter the China team season in Q3. Q2 APAC results also reflect growth in the GP channel with increased Invisalign submitters and higher utilization sequentially and year-over-year. During Q2, we continued to roll out the Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 product in APAC, where it is now available in Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan and India. We plan to launch Invisalign 3 and 3 in China in Q3. We are also pleased with the additional adoption of 3 and 3 product in APAC, where the majority of cases treated are comprehensive, allowing our doctor customers more flexibility within the Invisalign product portfolio.\nIn June, we hosted 2023 Invisalign APAC Summit in Singapore and brought together nearly 1,000 orthodontists and general practitioners, dentists and clinic staff from 18 countries across the Asia Pacific region. The Summit showcased Invisalign and iTero products, the Align Digital platform and the recent and upcoming innovations, while also highlighting our doctors' experience with digital transformation and how it improves the patient treatment journey. Attendees joined expert sessions focused on enhancing treatment planning efficiency, optimizing digital workflows, addressing the unique needs of teens and younger patients in exploring the essential aspect shaping today's digitally driven orthodontic practices. Teen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for clear aligner sales to Orthos.\nWe continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through teen-specific sales and marketing programs and product features unique to the Invisalign system. For Q2, total Clear liner cases for teenagers were up 7% sequentially and 9.7% year-over-year, reflecting improving trends across the regions. On a sequential basis, growth was driven by increased submitters in the APAC and EMEA regions on a year-over-year basis. [ TNK ] starts were in the APAC region, driven by increased submitters and in the EMEA region, driven by increased submitters and utilization, both in the orthodontic channel.\nLast year, we introduced the Teen Case Packs in the United States and Canada, and in Q1, Q2, we launched them in France, Scandinavia and Iberia. For the quarter, Teen Case Packs increased sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strength in EMEA. Invisalign First also was up sequentially and year-over-year across all regions and continues to drive adoption of Invisalign treatment among young patients. Invisalign first aligners are designed for Phase I treatment, typically in growing children 6 to 10 years old, making up about 20% of orthodontic case starts. For the dental service organizations, or DSO customers, Q2 clear aligner volumes increased sequentially primarily from the Americas region. Overall, ClearLiner growth rate from DSO doctors continues to outpace non-DSO doctors and our DSD touch-up cases are ramping nicely up as DSO doctors understand the value of the subscription program brings regarding pricing and flexibility for their patients.\nInvisalign is one of the most trusted brands in the orthodontic industry globally among both doctors and patients. On the consumer marketing front, we delivered $10.3 billion impressions and had 30.9 million visits to our website in Q2 '23. To increase awareness and educate young adults, parents teams about the benefits of Invisalign brand, we continue to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram across all markets as well as key social media influencers and brand ambassadors. In the Americas, we focused on reaching young adults as well as teens and their parents through our influencer and creator-centric campaigns partnering with leading smile squad creators, including Marshall Martin, Rally Shaw and Jeremy Lin.\nEach of these creators shared their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners. Additionally, in the United States, we work closely with athletes over time, a high school sports social media platform that showcases the benefits of Invisalign treatment. Brand interest remained strong throughout the quarter with 9.2 million consumers visiting our websites in the Americas region, representing 17% growth year-on-year. In EMEA region, we partnered with new influencers to reach consumers across social media platforms, including TikTok and Meta. In Germany, we launched new testimonial campaigns highlighting the stories of 70 [ young ] adults and teens who share why they chose Invisalign treatment and how it impacted their lives.\nOur consumer campaigns delivered more than 1.7 billion media impressions and 9.7 million visitors to our website. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in more than 12 million visitors to our websites and over $4.8 billion impression. We expanded our region in Japan and India via TikTok, Meta and YouTube. We partner with key influencers like Remy Killinghall and [ common ] gain. We saw increased brand interest in consumers as evidenced by 270% year-over-year increase in unique visitors to our website in India and a 46% year-over-year increase in Japan. Adoption of My Invisalign consumer and patient apps continued to increase with 3.1 million downloads to date and over 350,000 monthly active users, a 28% year-over-year growth. Uses of other digital tools also continue to increase. ClinCheck live update was used by 40,000 doctors on more than 580,000 cases, reducing time spent and modifying treatment by 20%. Invisalign practice app is increasing in adoption with 88,000 doctors who are actively using this app and 5.1 million photos were uploaded in Q2 via the Invisalign practice set. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nChief Financial Officer & SVP-Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $1.002 billion up 6.3% from the prior quarter and up 3.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q2 '23 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.3 [ million ] or approximately 0.1% sequentially. unfavorably impacted by approximately $19.4 million year-over-year or approximately 1.9%.\nClear Aligners Q2 revenues of $832.7 million were up 5.4% sequentially, primarily from higher volumes, higher non-case revenues and higher ASPs. On a year-over-year basis, Q2 clear line of revenues were up 4.3%, primarily due to higher ASPs, higher non-case revenues and higher volumes. For Q2, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were down sequentially and up year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect larger discounts and product mix shift to lower-priced products partially offset by price increases. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in comprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange.\nFor Q2, Invisalign ASPs for noncomprehensive treatment were up sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the increase in ASPs reflect lower discounts, higher additional aligners, price increases and favorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in noncomprehensive ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional liners, partially offset by product mix shift larger discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange. In Q1 '23, we launched Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 products in most markets, and we have continued to expand into more markets, as previously mentioned. The 3 and 3 configuration offers our doctor customers our Invisalign comprehensive treatment with 3 additional aligners included within 3 years of the treatment end date, instead of unlimited additional aligners with 5 years of the treatment end date at the 2022 Invisalign comprehensive product price.\nOver time, we have come to learn that on average, Invisalign doctors complete a comprehensive Invisalign treatment with 2 or fewer additional aligners. We are pleased with the continued adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive 3 and 3 product and anticipate that it will continue to grow, providing doctors the flexibility they desire and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time, compared to our traditional Invisalign comprehensive product. As revenues from subscriptions, retainers and ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth.\nIn our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Q2 23 clear aligner revenues impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $1.2 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $16.3 million or approximately 1.9%. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $13 million or up 1% sequentially $138.6 million or up 12.2% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q2 '23 systems and services revenue of $169.5 million were up 10.5% sequentially, mostly due to higher scanner volume, higher revenues from our certified preowned program and higher services revenue from our larger base of scanners sold, partially offset by unfavorable ASPs.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were down 1%, primarily due to lower scanner volume and unfavorable ASPs, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold and higher revenues from our CPO and leasing rental programs. Q2 '23 systems and services revenue were impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $0.1 million or approximately 0.1% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $3.1 million or approximately 1.8%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $2.3 million or 0.8% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase and up $8.6 million or 3.3% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales, and the deferral of service revenues included with our scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.\nAs our scanner portfolio expands, and we introduced new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins and provide refurbished scanners for certain markets. As such, our model is changing. We expect to continue growing our programs and as offering our CPO units for purchase and selling the way the customer -- our customers desire. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners, is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanner sold. Moving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 71.2%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 0.3 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately 0.5 points on a year-over-year basis.\nClear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 72.4%, up [indiscernible] sequentially, primarily due to the lower mix of additional aligners, favorable manufacturing variances and higher ASPs. Clear aligner gross margin for the second quarter was down 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume, partially offset by higher ASPs and lower freight. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was 65.1%, up 3.5 points sequentially, primarily from lower service and freight costs, partially offset by lower ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was up 5.3 points year-over-year, primarily from lower service and freight costs and higher services revenue, partially offset by lower ASPs.\nQ2 operating expenses were $541.7 million, up sequentially 2.8% and up 8.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $14.5 million, primarily from higher consumer marketing spend and higher incentive compensation. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $42.3 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $505 million up 2.9% sequentially and up 8.4% year-over-year.\nOur second quarter operating income of $171.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 17.2% up 3 points sequentially and down 2.2 points year-over-year. The sequential increase in operating margin is primarily attributed to higher gross margin, as well as favorable impact from foreign exchange of 0.1 points. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to investments in our go-to-market teams and technology, as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 1.1 points. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, offset by restructuring other charges, operating margin for the second quarter was 21.3%, and up 2.8 points sequentially and down 2 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $0.3 million compared to an income of $1.1 million in the first quarter and a loss of $14.6 million in the second quarter a year ago, primarily due to foreign exchange.\nThe GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.8%, consistent with the first quarter effective tax rate of 34.8% and 35% in the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly results in 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology. Second quarter net income per diluted share was $1.46, up sequentially $0.32 and up $0.02 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.02 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.15 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.22 for the second quarter, up $0.40 sequentially and up [indiscernible] year-over-year. Note that the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income per diluted share in our prior year 2022 non-GAAP reflects the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Moving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term, and long-term marketable securities were $1.338 billion up sequentially $112.4 million and up $56.6 million year-over-year. Of our $1.338 billion balance [ $14.3 ] million was held in the U.S. and $719.5 million was held by our international entities. In Q2, we completed a $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental a multidisciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the U.S. During Q1 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the $2023 $1 billion stock repurchase program. Q2 accounts receivable balance was $908.4 million, up sequentially.\nOur overall days sales outstanding was 81 days, down approximately 2 days sequentially and down approximately 4 days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $251.9 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $58.5 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity in facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $193.3 million. Now turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q2 results. While the macroeconomic environment still remains uncertain, we have seen improvements in the operating environment and the consumer demand signals that influence our outlook.\nFor Q3 2023, we anticipate our worldwide revenue to be in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion, up approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect our Q3 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly up from Q2 2023 as we continue to strategically prioritize our investments in R&D and go-to-market activities to drive growth. For full year 2023, assuming no circumstances occur that are beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 worldwide revenue to be in the range of $3.97 billion to $3.99 billion, up approximately 7% year-over-year at the midpoint. We also expect our full year 2023 GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 17% and our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 21%, a 1 point improvement from the guidance we provided in April of 2023.\nFor 2023, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million. Capital expenditures are expected to primarily relate to building construction improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of our continued international expansion. With that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nChief Executive Officer, ABB Ltd.\n\nAt our continued growth despite the economic slowdown in uncertain environment. Q2 results demonstrate our resilience and adaptability. While we cannot predict future economic conditions, we're confident in our ability to focus and execute on our strategic growth initiatives. As a leader in digital transformation, we offer a powerful suite of innovative digital tools that make up the aligned digital platform, which provides a seamless end-to-end digital experience for doctors and their patients.\nInnovations launched over the last year include ClinCheck live update for 3D controls. This enables doctors to generate modified Invisalign patient treatment plans in real time, reducing modifications that used to take weeks to as little as 2 minutes. Improving practice productivity while also improving the quality of treatment plans. Invisalign Personal Plan, or IPP streamlines the treatment planning process and helps doctors achieve their desired treatment plans more consistently and efficiently. Invisalign Smile Architect allows general dentists to integrate clear aligner therapy into their comprehensive treatment plans by combining tooth alignment and restorative planning in a single platform.\nInvisalign Virtual Care, equips doctor with a next-generation remote monitoring solution that has new artificial intelligence-assisted capabilities to streamline their workflows. Cowen being computed tomography or CVCT, enables doctors to visualize the patient's roots as part of the digital treatment planning process. Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro, expand Align's existing Invisalign outcome simulator technology and adds the benefit of the company's ClinCheck in-face visualization tool that combines a photo of a patient's face, with their 3D treatment simulation, creating a truly personalized view of how their new smile will look. itero/XOCAD connector integrates iTero intera camera and Neary images with Exocad dental CAD 3.1 software, allows dental professionals to visualize the internal and external structure of team.\nIn addition to these and other incredible innovations in the coming years, we'll continue to build a digital platform and add new capabilities to improve clinical outcomes and elevate the patient experience to drive continued practice growth and positive patient experiences. Thank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking to you at our upcoming Investor Day on September 6, where we'll share with you our views about the incredible market opportunity we have and how Align is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the transformation of the digital orthodontic industry.

Please refer to these slides we filed for more detailed information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph Hogan\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter results and discuss a few highlights from our 2 operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our Q1 financial performance and comment on our views for the second quarter in 2023. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nOverall, I'm pleased to report better-than-expected first quarter revenues and earnings. The sequential increase in first quarter revenues of $943 million reflects stability across all regions for our Clear Aligner business and favorable average selling price for the Clear Aligner and Systems and Services segments.\nQ1 sequential growth reflects an increase in non-case revenues, which also increased year-over-year, driven by continued growth from our Invisalign Doctor Subscription Program and Vivera retainers. In the teen segment, which represents the largest portion of the 21 million annual orthodontic case starts, 182,000 teens and kids started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners during the first quarter, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year, which is encouraging as we head into the important summer season for teens and kids. Overall, we remain confident in our large underpenetrated market opportunity globally and our ability to deliver digital products and technology that are helping doctors transform smiles and change lives for millions of people.\nFor Systems and Services in Q1, revenues of $153.3 million were down 9.7% sequentially and 6.2% year-over-year. As expected, Q1 Systems and Services revenues decreased sequentially, consistent with seasonal capital equipment cycles compared to Q4. For Q1, Systems and Services revenues were sequentially lower primarily in the Americas and APAC regions, offset somewhat by an increase in EMEA.\nFor nonsystems scanner revenues, Q1 was up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting increased scanner rentals, upgrades and certified preowned or CPO leasing programs. Q1 CPO sales include initial shipments of leasing units to Desktop Metal, who's supplying iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs, one of the largest lab networks in the United States serving general dentists. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 services revenues increased primarily due to higher subscription revenues resulting from a large number of iTero scanners in the field. We also had higher nonsystems revenues related to our scanner leasing and rental programs previously mentioned.\nFor Q1, total Clear Aligner revenues of $789.8 million was up sequentially and down year-over-year. Q1 sequential revenue growth reflects increases across the regions, driven by price increases, favorable foreign exchange and more additional aligners. Q1 non-case revenues were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting continued growth from DSP, Vivera retainers and commerce sales, which include everything from aligner cases to whitening and cleaning products. DSP has been very successful and is enabling doctors to purchase aligners on a subscription basis, giving them flexibility to treat simple touch-up cases or offer their patients a superior, flexible and convenient retention solution.\nWe introduced DSP in North America during the pandemic and are continuing to expand DSP offerings in EMEA region. The contribution of DSP to non-case revenues is important to understand, especially the impact to overall Clear Aligner volumes. While we don't report the number of DSP clear aligners shipped, and we don't include them in our total Clear Aligner volumes, if we were to calculate an equivalent case shipment for touch-up patients using our DSP aligners, we estimate those cases would increase approximately 25% sequentially.\nQ1 total Clear Aligner volumes of 575,400 were down slightly sequentially, reflecting stability across regions and improvements in consumer confidence as well as the easing of COVID restrictions recently in China. For the Americas, Q1 Clear Aligner volumes were up slightly sequentially, reflecting higher orthodontic cases, especially teen case starts, with growth in both Invisalign Teen case packs and Invisalign First treatment for kids as young as 6, offset primarily by a decrease in adult patients from the GP dental channel.\nBased on the most recent Gaidge practice analysis tool that collects and consolidates data from approximately 700 ortho practices in North America, overall, new patient flow and adult exams were lower this period, while teens outpaced adults. During this period, wires and brackets cases continue to grow ahead of clear aligners, although at a slower rate than in recent quarters. And Invisalign cases outpaced other clear aligner brands. The Gaidge report also included a few data points regarding no-shows in future exam schedules, which we believe may provide insight into consumer sentiment and macro conditions.\nRegarding no-shows, over the last 12 months, there's been a large increase in the number of patient no-shows. However, that rate appears to be stabilized. Conversely, over the last 12 months, future exams scheduled were negative year-over-year, but the rate has steadily improved in the most recent months covered by the report, which we believe may be a good gauge for consumer optimism.\nFor EMEA, Q1 Clear Aligner volumes include strong adoption of Invisalign Moderate across the region in both the adult and teen segments. Invisalign Moderate Package is a 20-stage treatment option designed for patients whose treatment goals fall between the existing Invisalign Lite and Invisalign Comprehensive packages.\nFor APAC, Q1 Clear Aligner volumes reflect improvement in China, and continued growth in markets like Japan, Korea and India, with positive year-over-year growth, including teens.\nTeen orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for Clear Aligner sales to orthos. We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through teen-specific sales and marketing programs and product features, including Invisalign First for kids as young as 6, which is up sequentially across all markets.\nFor Q1, total Clear Aligner cases for teenagers were up sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting improving trends across the regions. On a sequential basis, growth was driven by increased submitters in the APAC and Americas region.\nOn a year-over-year basis, teen case starts were up in EMEA region, reflecting increased utilization and the recent introduction of Invisalign Moderate across the region, which outpaced the year-over-year growth rate of Invisalign First, which also continues to perform very well across markets.\nInvisalign First was also up sequentially and year-over-year across all regions. Invisalign First is designed to treat a broad range of teeth straightening issues in growing children from simple to complex. And because Invisalign First is removable, it's easier for kids to brush and floss. There's also no discomfort from rubbing braces or poking wires from metal braces. These benefits, along with positive compliance experience, may also contribute to continued momentum for Invisalign First. In fact, the majority of surveyed Invisalign orthodontists agreed that their young patients are highly compliant with Invisalign First treatment, understanding that younger kids are highly compliant and Invisalign First provides an opportunity to support overall practice growth.\nThe Q1 Clear Aligner volume from dental service organizations, or DSO customers, continued to outpace non-DSO customers. Q1 Clear Aligner volume from DSO customers increased sequentially, reflecting growth in the Americas region. DSOs make up approximately 20% of the dental market and represent one of the most important channels for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry.\nThrough their network of doctors and systematic approach to clinical education and practice management, DSOs are uniquely positioned to drive adoption of new technologies and tools that increase practice efficiency and profitability and deliver a better patient experience. We have well-established relationships with many DSOs, especially in the United States, with DSOs such as Smile Docs and Heartland Dental. And we are continuously exploring collaboration with others that drive adoption of digital dentistry.\nEach DSO has a different strategy and business model. And our focus is working with them and encouraging DSOs align with our vision, strategy and business model goals. One of the most digitally minded DSOs is Heartland Dental. And today, we announced a $75 million equity investment in Heartland.\nHeartland is a multidisciplinary DSO with GP and ortho practices across the U.S. Their growth strategy includes Heartland's de novo dental practices, which feature modern technology, are located in areas with strong community need for dentistry, where Heartland provides practices with opportunities for mentorship, leadership training and continuing education.\nIn the last 3 years, Heartland opened 188 state-of-the-art de novo practices across the United States and are planning to continue investing through more de novo openings. We have a shared sense of purpose with Heartland. Their mission is to help doctors, and their teams deliver the highest quality digital dental care to the communities they serve. Demand creation remains an important strategic growth driver, and we continue to invest in consumer marketing programs that create awareness of the Invisalign systems and that drive demand to Invisalign practices.\nIn Q1 '23, we delivered 7.8 billion impressions and had 22.1 million visits to our websites and continue to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube across markets. For more details on our programs and key Q1 performance metrics, please see our presentation slides on our website.\nWe're also developing digital tools and apps for consumers, patients and for doctors. The Q1 adoption of the My Invisalign consumer and patient app continue to increase with 3.1 million-plus downloads to date and over 350,000 monthly active users, representing 28% year-over-year growth. Usage of our other digital tools includes ClinCheck Live Update, which is used by 38,000 doctors to reduce time spent modifying treatment plans of up to 13%, and Invisalign practice app with 58,000 doctors actively using this feature and uploading more than 5.1 million photos to date.\nFinally, in addition to our focus on consumer marketing and digital tools, we're committed to driving excellent treatment and Align innovation through industry and Align-hosted clinical education events. Our team has just participated in the annual AAO conference, which took place in Chicago, where we engaged with a broad range of orthodontists.\nIn March, we participated in IDS in Cologne, Germany, one of the largest dental shows in the world, focused on digital dentistry and the technologies shaping the industry. Earlier in the quarter, we hosted the second Align symposium on the digital practice, a smaller Align event from the most engaged and experienced Invisalign orthodontists in the world. It was an amazing opportunity to come together with long-term global partners and thought leaders in orthodontics to see how we are driving the digital transformation of dentistry together.\nBy our participation in each of these events and opportunities, we continue to reinforce the importance of peer-to-peer clinical education and our investments in the orthodontic specialty. We are grateful for all of our customers, GP orthodontists, corporate practices, but we know that the orthodontic specialty leads the way in adoption of digital orthodontics. We are excited about the future we see them in the orthodontic profession.\nAlign ably supports the orthodontic profession through education, grants and continued innovation. Our educational pathway was created to support recent graduates and early career doctors at critical career transition points. As a result of schooling and early career initiatives, graduates will be educated on digital dentistry and digital orthodontics, connected with and supported by colleagues, more experienced ortho experts in the Align team and engaged with Align Digital Platform. Align supports doctors throughout all stages of their career, from educating facility at dental schools and orthodontic programs to education for residents, early to mid-career providers and more seasoned professionals looking to expand their clinical capabilities and practices.\nAlign is expanding its global footprint of education centers to provide a forum for hands-on learning and continued development in key cities across our regions. We are also focused on continuing to innovate in digital dentistry, scaling capacity to manage the millions of digital requests, patient scans and orders flowing through our systems, while also using technologies like AI and machine learning to increase efficiencies, speed treatment planning and quickly deliver products so patients can begin their paths to transforming their smiles.\nIn the next 1 to 2 or 3 years, Align believes our newest technologies and innovations will revolutionize our existing offerings in the ways in which doctors and their patients experience orthodontic treatment. Together with our customers, we are developing the future of digital dentistry and digital orthodontics, not just the technology that drives treatment, but the models reshaping how we interact with customers and deliver treatment experiences for their patients. We look forward to sharing more with you in the coming months.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Morici\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $943.1 million, up 4.6% from the prior quarter and down 3.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q1 '23 revenues were impacted by favorable foreign exchange of approximately $25.8 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately $34.9 million year-over-year or approximately 3.6%.\nFor Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $789.8 million were up 7.9% sequentially, primarily from higher ASPs and higher non-case revenues, partially offset by lower volumes. On a year-over-year basis, Q1 Clear Aligner revenues were down 2.5%, primarily due to lower volumes, lower ASPs, including unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher non-case revenues.\nFor Q1, Invisalign ASPs for comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and decreased slightly year-over-year. On a sequential basis, ASPs reflect price increases, favorable foreign exchange and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix and larger discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the ASPs for our comprehensive treatment were almost flat, primarily due to product mix shift, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts, mostly offset by price increases and higher additional aligners.\nFor Q1, Invisalign ASPs for non-comprehensive treatment were up sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the increase in ASPs reflect price increases, favorable foreign exchange and higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in ASPs reflect price increases and higher additional aligners, partially offset by product mix shift, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts.\nDuring the quarter, we've launched Invisalign Comprehensive [ 3 and 3 ] product in most markets. The [ 3 and 3 ] configuration offers our doctor customers our Invisalign Comprehensive treatment with 3 additional aligners included within 3 years of treatment end date instead of unlimited additional aligners within 5 years of the treatment end date at the 2022 Invisalign Comprehensive product price. Over time, we have come to learn that on average, Invisalign doctors complete a comprehensive Invisalign treatment with less than 2 additional aligners.\nWe are pleased with the initial adoption of the Invisalign Comprehensive [ 3 and 3 ] product and anticipate that its impact will be more meaningful, providing doctors the flexibility they desire and allowing us to recognize more revenue upfront, with deferred revenue being recognized over a shorter period of time compared to our traditional Invisalign Comprehensive product.\nAs revenues from subscription retainers and other ancillary products continue to grow globally, some of the historical metrics that only focus on case shipments are expected to account for a lesser percentage of our overall growth. In our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total Clear Aligner revenue per case shipment, which we believe to be more indicative measure of our overall growth strategy. Clear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $32 million or up 2.6% sequentially and $150.9 million or up 13.6% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.\nQ1 '23 Systems and Services revenue of $153.3 million were down 9.7% sequentially primarily due to the seasonally lower scanner volume, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger base of scanners sold, higher revenues from our CPO and leasing rental programs and favorable ASPs, down 6.2% year-over-year primarily for the reasons just stated. Q1 '23 Systems and Services revenue was impacted from favorable foreign exchange of approximately $4 million or approximately 2.7% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $5.8 million or approximately 3.6%.\nSystems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was down $2.2 million or 0.8% sequentially, primarily due to the decrease in scanner sales and deferred -- deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, and up $24.2 million or 9.8% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period. As our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade, make trade-ins and provide refurbished scanners for certain markets.\nAs such, our model is changing. We expect to continue to roll out programs such as our certified preowned leasing and rental offerings to customers by possibly leveraging our balance sheet and selling the way our customers desire. Developing new capital equipment opportunities to meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners sold.\nMoving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 70%, up 1.5 points sequentially and down 2.9 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was favorably impacted by foreign exchange by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis.\nClear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 71.7%, up 0.9 points sequentially due to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher manufacturing of [indiscernible]. Clear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was down 3.1 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower ASPs, increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland and a higher mix of additional aligner volume.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was 61.6%, up 2.8 points sequentially primarily from increased manufacturing efficiencies. Systems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was down 1.8 points year-over-year due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher services revenues and ASPs.\nQ1 operating expenses were $527.1 million, up sequentially 4.4% and up 3.1% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up $22.1 million, primarily from higher incentive compensation and consumer marketing spend, partially offset by restructuring and other charges not recurring in Q1. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $15.9 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and our continued investments in sales and R&D activities, partially offset by controlled spending on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, operating expenses were $490.5 million, up 6.7% sequentially and up 2.1% year-over-year. Our first quarter operating income of $133.5 million resulted in an operating margin of 14.2%, up 1.7 points sequentially and down 6.2 points year-over-year. Operating margin was favorably impacted by approximately 1.5 points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange and higher gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margins, investments in go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 2 points.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, offset by restructuring and other charges, operating margin for the first quarter was 18.5%, up 0.2 points sequentially and down 5.5 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the first quarter was an income of $1.1 million compared to an income of $2.7 million in the fourth quarter and a loss of $10.6 million in the first quarter a year ago, primarily due to net foreign exchange gains from the strengthening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nThe GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.8% compared to 63.8% in the fourth quarter and 28.4% in the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter GAAP effective tax rate was lower than the fourth quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to increased earnings in low tax jurisdictions in Q1 2023 and an audit settlement in Q4 2022. As a reminder, in Q4 2022, we changed our methodology for the computation of our non-GAAP effective tax rate to a long-term projected tax rate and have given effect to the new methodology from January 1, 2022, and recast previously reported quarterly periods in 2022. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20%, reflecting the change in our methodology.\nFirst quarter net income per diluted share was $1.14, up sequentially $0.60 and down $0.56 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was favorably impacted by $0.14 on a sequential basis and unfavorably impacted by $0.21 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $1.82 for the first quarter, up $0.09 sequentially and down $0.43 year-over-year. Note the prior year 2022 non-GAAP net income per diluted share and our prior year 2022 non-GAAP EPS reflects the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities was $921.4 million, down sequentially $120.2 million and down $199.2 million year-over-year. Of the $921.4 million balance, $310.5 million was held in the U.S. and $610.9 million was held by our international entities. During Q1 2023, we purchased approximately 942,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $307.74 per share for a total purchase price of $290 million, completing a $200 million accelerated share repurchase from Q4 2022, a $250 million ASR from Q1 2023 and our May 2021 $1 billion stock repurchase program.\nDuring Q1 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to succeed the 2021 $1 billion program. Currently, $1 billion remains available for repurchase under the 2023 $1 billion stock repurchase program. Q1 accounts receivable balance was $884 million, up sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was $83 (sic) 83 days, down approximately 2 days sequentially and down approximately 4 days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $199.9 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $64.1 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operation less capital expenditures, amounted to $135.8 million.\nNow turning to our outlook. As Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q1 results and what continues to be a more stable environment across all regions. We remain cautiously optimistic for continued stability as we move through the year. However, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. And given continued domestic and global challenges and unpredictability, we are not providing full year revenue guidance. We would like to see consistent improvements in the operating environment and consumer demand signals before revisiting our approach.\nWe remain focused on making investments to drive growth and penetration into a huge untapped market opportunity, including our strategic investments in sales, marketing, technology and innovation. We are confident in our ability to address the massive opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, with our execution centered on our strategic initiatives. With this as a backdrop for Q2 2023, we anticipate Clear Aligner volume and ASPs to be up sequentially. We also anticipate Systems and Services revenue to be up sequentially.\nFor Q2 2023, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $980 million to $1 billion. We expect our Q2 2023 non-GAAP gross margins to be flat to slightly up from Q1 '23, and our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be up by approximately 1 point sequentially as we continue to strategically prioritize our investments in go-to-market activities and R&D to drive growth.\nFor full year 2023 and assuming no circumstances beyond our control, we reiterate our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 20%. For 2023, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $200 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion.\nFinally, as it relates to the $75 million equity investment in Heartland Dental that Joe discussed, our investment is less than 5% of their company and Align has no oversight or involvement in management of Heartland Dental or its affiliates.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph Hogan\n\nThanks, John. In closing, we're pleased with our first quarter results that reflected an environment of continued stability for our doctor customers. However, degrees of uncertainty remain from market to market. We're confident in our durable competitive advantage as we continue to transform the orthodontic industry, bringing digital dentistry and clear aligner treatment to more doctors and the patients they serve, driven by our strategic initiatives of international expansion, orthodontist utilization, general dentist treatment and patient demand and conversion. We will continue to focus on the next phase of new platform innovations in scanning, software and direct 3D printing while prioritizing the needs of our customers for the ultimate benefit of their patients.\nWe are a purpose-driven organization with a tireless commitment to transform more smiles and change more lives. We're the only digital orthodontic company in the world today with the scale and reach to address the 500 million potential people that could benefit from teeth straightening within the Invisalign system.\nThank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.",

You'll note that we have shortened our formal remarks in order to leave more time for Q&A.\n\nOverall Im pleased to report fourth quarter results that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients in the recent quarters, especially in the Americas and EMEA regions as well as parts of APAC for Q4 trends in consumer interest fourth hedonic treatment patient traffic in doctors' practices and Taro scanner demos improved.\n\nHowever, the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results reduced our revenues and margins significantly.\n\nDespite the large impact of unfavorable foreign exchange Q4 revenues of $901 5 million increased sequentially from Q3.\n\nReflecting growth in systems and services as well as a slight increase in clear aligner shipments. This is the first quarter and a year that our total revenues in clear aligner volumes increased sequentially.\n\nAs we move through 2023 and are hopeful that we will see continued stability in an improving operating environment, but remind everyone that the macroeconomic situation remains fragile regardless.\n\nRegardless, we are confident in our large untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, we anticipate 2023 will be an exciting year.\n\nFor new innovation at a line and we will begin to commercialize one of our largest new product and technology cycles in our 25 year history.\n\nThe Q4 systems and services revenue of $169 9 million were up seven 8% sequentially and down 21, 3% year over year on a constant currency basis, Q4 systems and services revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $2 7 million or one 5% sequentially.\n\nAnd approximately $11 2 million or six 2% year over year.\n\nFor Q4 systems and services revenues increased sequentially driven by growth in the Americas, and EMEA regions, reflecting continued sales of inner oral scanners, especially the .\n\nQ4 sequential growth also reflects continued growth of our scandal rental programs as well as initial deployment of a certified pre owned will be called CPO scanner leasing rental program with desktop metal that I'll describe in more detail shortly.\n\nWe continue to develop new capital equipment opportunities that meet the digital transformation needs of our customers and DSO partners, which is a natural progression for our equipment business with a large and growing base of scanners are sold.\n\nAs our scanner portfolio expands and we introduce new products, we increased the opportunities for customers to upgrade to make trade ins and provide refurbished scanners for emerging markets. We expect to continue rolling out programs, such as leasing and rental offerings that help customers in the current macroeconomic environment by leveraging our balance sheet and selling the way our customers want to buy.\n\nOn a year over year basis, Q4 services revenues increased primarily due to increased subscription revenue, resulting in a larger number of field scanners. We also had higher non case systems revenues related to our scanner leasing rental programs previously mentioned.\n\nTo help accelerate the adoption of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry in Q4, we announced a strategic collaboration with desktop metal to supply element flex scanners. The desktop labs, one of the largest lab networks in the U S serving general dentists.\n\nElement flex is now the preferred restorative scanner for desktop labs and will connect Dennis directly to a suite of offerings from desktop labs that simplifies the digital design and manufacturer restorations with both traditional and digital technologies.\n\nOur collaboration with desktop metal reflects our commitment to a relationship we expect will evolve and expand to being advanced restored of workflows to market.\n\nWe see significant opportunities to enable dentists to use scan data directly order restored of services or printed ready digital files from desktop labs.\n\nCan be used for three D printing in their offices and.\n\nIn addition to our scanners were also excited about extending the benefits of the aligned digital platform, including the Invisalign system and software to desktop labs customers as well.\n\nFor Q4 total clear aligner revenues of 73.\n\n$731 7 million were down slightly 2% sequentially and down 10, 3% year over year.\n\nOn a constant currency basis for Q4 clear aligner revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of $13 4 million or one 8% sequentially and $56 4 million or seven 2% year over year.\n\nQ4, total clear aligner volumes of 583000 was up slightly sequentially, reflecting growth in the Americas and EMEA regions offset by lower APAC volumes, primarily in China for.\n\nFor the Americas, Q4, clear aligner volumes were down slightly sequentially, reflecting lower ortho cases, especially teen starts as compared to the typical higher teen season in Q3.\n\nOffset primarily by an increase in adult patients from the GP dentist channel.\n\nFor Q4 clear aligner volume from DSO customers continued to outpace non DSO customers.\n\nFor EMEA Q4, clear aligner volume increased sequentially in all markets and across product, especially recently launched invisalign moderate.\n\n, plus and express, which enable GP dentists to treat a broader range of cases may also moderate types of amount of inclusions and can easily be integrated in a wide range of restorative treatments and a dental practice.\n\nhad a strong sequential growth in the teen market segment with continued demand for Invisalign Teen case packs, which are available in France in Iberia as well as Invisalign first treatment for kids as young as six years old.\n\nAPAC Q4 clear aligner volumes were lower sequentially due primarily to China, which continues to be impacted by Covid in Q4 ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in China persisted throughout the quarter.\n\nOutside of China, APAC volumes increased sequentially led by Japan, Taiwan, India, and Southeast Asia markets on a year over year basis, Q4 clear Aligner case volumes reflected increased shipments led by Korea, India, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nThe easing of Covid restrictions in China, and the more recent downward trend in Covid infection rates are encouraging many uncertainties remain including the lingering impacts from COVID-19 across the population and the time and effort needed to restore consumer confidence.\n\nFor the other noncash revenues, which include retention products, such as our retainers clinical training and education accessories, ecommerce and our new subscription programs such as our DSP fourth quarter revenues were down slightly sequentially and up double digits year over year for retention and E. Commerce products Q4 revenues were relatively.\n\nUnchanged from Q3, we are pleased with our subscription based programs like DSP, which increase sequentially and a year over year and year over year and expect to continue expanding DSP offerings in other regions.\n\nFor Q4, the total number of new Invisalign trained doctors decreased sequentially due primarily to fourth quarter being a seasonally slower period for clinical education with holidays et cetera, as well as fewer training in China and Brazil. This is off offset by somewhat significantly higher numbers of new Invisalign doctors trained in EMEA.\n\nDean Orthodontic treatment is the largest segment of the orthodontic market worldwide and represents our largest opportunity for clear aligner sales to . We continue to focus on gaining share from traditional metal braces through team specific sales and marketing programs and product features including Invisalign for kids as young as six.\n\nWhich is up sequentially across all markets for Q4 total clear aligner teen cases were down sequentially due primarily to the impact of Covid in China as well as seasonally fewer teen starts in North America as compared to Q3.\n\nAccording to a December gauge report, which tracks approximately 1000 ortho in the United States and Canada, New patient exams for teams slowed in Q4, while new patient exams for adults improved slightly.\n\nA smaller pool of potential teen patients may put pressure on traditional worth those and caused them to go between clear liners in wires and brackets, especially those practices that have failed to understand the significant benefits of adopting more efficient digital workflows, believing metal braces are more profitable.\n\nIn EMEA Q4 was a record quarter for TNK starts on a year over year basis. Q14, K starts were relatively unchanged for Q4, Invisalign first increased year over year and was strong across all regions Invisalign clear aligner treatment is designed for predictive results and a positive experience while at .\n\nThe unique needs of growing children from as young as six.\n\nphase one.\n\nFor the full year Invisalign clear aligner shipments for teens and young kids is approximately 733000 cases are teen case mix overall was a record 31% of Invisalign cases shipped for the year.\n\nFinally in Q4, the total number of doctors ship was 82 9000 doctors a slight decrease due primarily to the impact of Covid in China and off our Q3 22 high point, which included a major DSO Onboarding in North America.\n\nFor the full year 2023, we also shipped to the highest cumulative number of Invisalign trained doctors over 124000 doctors reinforcing our commitment to doctor directed care for clear aligner treatment to achieve the safest and best possible clinical treatment outcomes for patients.\n\nWith that I'll now turn the call over to John .\n\nThanks, Joe before I go through the details of our Q4 results I want to comment on two items in our fourth quarter financial results we.\n\nRestructuring and other charges. During Q4 2022, we incurred a total of $14 3 million of restructuring and other charges of which $2 9 million was included in the cost of net revenues and $11 5 million included in operating expenses restructuring and other charges included.\n\n$8 7 million of severance related costs and $5 6 million.\n\nCertain lease terminations and asset impairments, primarily related to operations in Russia in light of business needs.\n\nSecond non-GAAP tax rate in Q4, 2022, we changed to a long term projected tax rate for our non-GAAP provision for income taxes, our previous methodology for calculating our non-GAAP effective tax rates included certain nonrecurring.\n\nAnd period specific items that produce fluctuating effective tax rate that management does not believe are reflective of the companys long term effective tax rate.\n\nWe have recast non-GAAP results for our provision for income taxes effective tax rate net income and diluted net income per share for each reporting period in 2022 to reflect this change we did not make any changes to the results reported for 2021 as reflecting the change in our methodology for the .\n\nComputation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate was immaterial to our 2021 results referred to the section in our Q4 press release titled recast of financial measures for prior periods in 2022 for tax rate change.\n\nUnaudited GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for further information.\n\nNow for our Q4 financial results total revenues for the fourth quarter were $901 5 million.\n\nUp one 3% from the prior quarter and down 12, 6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago on a constant currency basis Q4, 2022 revenues were impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $16 million or approximately one 7% sequentially and approx.\n\n$67 $6 million year over year or approximately 7%.\n\nFor clear liners, Q4 revenues of $731 $7 million were flat sequentially, primarily from lower Asps.\n\nThe offset by higher.\n\nVolumes on a year over year basis, Q4 clear Aligner revenues were down 10, 3%, primarily due to lower volume and lower asps, partially offset by higher non case revenues.\n\nFor Q4, Invisalign Asps for comprehensive treatment were flat sequentially and decreased year over year on a sequential basis Asps reflects the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional liners and product mix shift.\n\nOn a year over year basis.\n\nHeine in comprehensive Asps reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange product mix shift and higher discount, partially offset by higher additional liners and per order processing fees for.\n\nFor Q4, Invisalign asps for non comprehensive treatment decreased sequentially and year over year on a sequential basis. The decline in asps reflect product mix shift unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and higher discounts, partially offset by higher additional lenders.\n\nOn a year over year basis, the decline in Asps reflect a significant unfavorable impact of unfavorable foreign exchange product mix shift and higher discussed partially offset by higher additional liners and per order processing fees.\n\nAs we mentioned last quarter as our revenues from subscriptions retainers and other ancillary products continued to grow and expand and globally. Some of the historical metrics that focus only on pay shipments do not account for our overall growth.\n\nIn our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we've added to.\n\nAdded our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment, which is more indicative of our overall growth strategy.\n\nClearer lines of deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $56 4 million or four 8% sequentially.\n\n$171 9 million or up 16, 2% year over year and will be recognized as the additional liners are shipped.\n\nQ4, 2022 systems and services revenues of $169 $9 million were up seven 8% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volume services and revenues, partially offset by lower Asps and were down 21, 3% year over year, primarily due to.\n\nLower scanner volume and Asps.\n\nThe offset by higher services revenue from our larger installed base of scanners and increased non system revenues related to our certified pre owned and leasing and rental programs.\n\nQ4, 2022 systems and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2 7 million or approximately one 5% sequentially on a year over year basis system and services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11 2 million.\n\nOr approximately six 2%.\n\nSystems and services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $9 million or three 4% sequentially and up $42 9 million or 18, 7% year over year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase which will be .\n\nIgnite badly over the service period.\n\nMoving on to gross margin fourth quarter overall gross margin was 68, 5% down one point sequentially and down three seven points year over year overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange on our revenues by approximately six points sequentially and two two.\n\nOn a year over year basis.\n\nClear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 78% down one points sequentially due to lower asps.\n\nWarranty and restructuring costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing absorption and lower training costs.\n\ngross margin for the fourth quarter was down three four points year over year, primarily due to lower Asps increase.\n\nIncreased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland.\n\nAnd a higher mix of additional aligner volume systems and services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 58, 8% down four six points sequentially due to lower asps.\n\nAnd higher inventory costs, and manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by higher services revenues and lower freight cost.\n\nSystems and services gross margin for the fourth quarter was down five nine points year over year for the reasons stated previously.\n\nQ4, operating expenses were $505 million up.\n\n, six 2% and down three 6% year over year.\n\nOn a sequential basis operating expenses were up $29 5 million mainly.\n\nMainly due to restructuring and other charges and our continued investment in sales and R&D activities, along with higher consulting expenses year over year operating expenses decreased by $18 $6 million, primarily due to control spend on advertising and marketing.\n\nAs part of our efforts to proactively manage costs as well as lower incentive compensation, partially offset by restructuring and other charges.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock based compensation restructuring and other charges and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisition.\n\nOperating expenses were up.\n\nWe're $459 $7 million up three 7% sequentially and down 7% year over year.\n\nOur fourth quarter operating income of $112 $7 million.\n\nResults in an operating margin of 12, 5% down three six points sequentially and down eight nine points year over year operating margin was unfavorably impacted by nine points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange and lower gross margin.\n\nThe year over year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed.\n\nTwo lower gross margin .\n\nInvestments in our go to market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately $4 two points.\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock based compensation restructuring and other charges and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions operating margin for the fourth quarter was 18, 3% down one nine points sequentially and down six four points year over year.\n\nInterest and other income expense.\n\nNet for the fourth quarter was it was income of $2 7 million compared to a loss of $21 million in the third quarter and a loss of 9 million in Q4 of 2021, primarily due to net foreign exchange gains from the strengthening of certain certain foreign currencies against the U S.\n\nS dollar.\n\nThe GAAP effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 63, 8% compared to 47% in the third quarter and 13, 2% in the fourth quarter of the prior year, the fourth quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than third quarter effective tax rate primarily due to decreased.\n\nEarnings in low tax jurisdictions.\n\nAnd an increase in the amount of U S minimum tax on foreign earnings our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20% in the fourth quarter and reflects the change in our methodology that was discussed earlier, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11, 5% in the fourth quarter.\n\nOf the prior year, and 2021, which does not reflect the change in our methodology.\n\nFourth quarter net income per diluted share was 54 down sequentially 39, and down $1 86 compared to the prior year.\n\nOur earnings per share was unfavorably impacted by on a sequential basis and 22 on a year over year basis due to foreign exchange on a non-GAAP basis net income per diluted share was $1 73 for the fourth quarter up 10 sequentially.\n\nAnd down $1.10 year over year.\n\nNote that the prior year 2021, non-GAAP net income per diluted share.\n\nOr prior year 2021, EPS does not reflect the Q4 2022 change in our methodology for the computation of the non-GAAP effective tax rate.\n\nMoving on to the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities were $1 billion down.\n\nDown sequentially, $99 $5 million and down $255 $1 million year over year.\n\nOf our $1 billion.\n\nBalance.\n\n$387 9 million was held in the U S and $653 7 million was held by our international entities. In October 2022, we purchased approximately 848000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $188 62 per share.\n\nThrough a $200 million accelerated share repurchase under our May 2021, $1 billion stock repurchase program.\n\nWe have $250 million remaining available for repurchase under this program and we plan to repurchase this remaining amount starting in Q1 2023 through either.\n\nEither or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement completing the repurchases in Q2 of 2023.\n\nQ4 accounts receivable balance was $859 7 million flat sequentially.\n\nOur overall days sales outstanding was 85 days down one day sequentially and up approximately seven days as compared to Q4 last year.\n\nCash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $144 7 million capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $53 $2 million.\n\nPrimarily related to our continued investment to.\n\nTo increase our lighter manufacturing capacity and facilities free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to 91 $5 million.\n\nWe exited fiscal 2022 with a strong balance sheet, including $1 billion in cash and investments a healthy cash flow position and no long term debt as we announced with our earnings Alliance Board of directors has authorized a new $1 billion.\n\nrepurchase program to succeed the current $1 billion program this new $1 billion.\n\nProgram reflects the strength of our balance sheet, and our cash flow generation as well as management and our boards continued confidence in our ability to capitalize on large market opportunities in our target markets and trajectory for growth, while concurrently returning capital to our shareholders.\n\nNow turning to our outlook as Joe mentioned earlier, we are pleased with our Q4 results and what appears to be a more stable environment in North America and EMEA. We are cautiously optimistic for continued stability and improving trends as we move through the year. However, the macroeconomic environment remains fragile and given continue.\n\nglobal challenges and uncertainty we are not providing full year revenue guidance, we would like to see improvements in the operating environment and consumer demand signals, including stability in China before revisiting our approach.\n\nAt the same time, we are confident in our large untapped market opportunity for digital orthodontics, and restorative dentistry and our ability to make progress towards our strategic initiatives we.\n\nWe intend to focus on the things, we can control and influence which includes strategic investments in sales marketing technology and innovation.\n\nFor full year 2023, assuming no additional material disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, we anticipate our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly above 20%.\n\nWith this backdrop for Q1 2023, we anticipate clear aligner volumes to be down sequentially, primarily due to weakness in China from Covid.\n\nWe offset by some stability from our Americas and EMEA regions, we anticipate clear aligner asps to be up from Q4, 2022, primarily due to higher pricing and unfavorable and favorable foreign exchange rates.\n\nWe anticipate scanner and services revenue to be down sequentially as the business followed a more typical capital equipment cycle.\n\nTaken in total we expect Q1 2023 revenues to be about flat to Q4 of 2022, we expect our Q1 2023 non-GAAP operating margin to be consistent with our Q4 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as we continued to make investments in R&D and other go to market activities.\n\nFor 2023, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $200 million.\n\nCapital expenditures, primarily relate to building construction and improvement as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support to support our international expansion with that I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments Joe.\n\nThanks, John in closing, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results and the improved trend in sequential growth, we saw in the Americas and EMEA regions and parts of APAC that reflect a more stable environment for doctors and their patients.\n\nIt's still very early and many uncertainties remain we are hopeful that we'll see continued stability across the business and regions, especially in China. As we continue to work through these challenges were confident in our ability to focus on our customers and deliver key technology and innovation that furthers our leadership position in digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, we're balancing it.\n\nInvestments to deliver shareholder value through transformative digital orthodontic solutions unique to align.\n\nAs a purpose driven business and we are committed to helping doctors transform smiles and change lives of millions of people around the world over.\n\nOver the last year, we are flooded our customer base with a lot of new technology that represents one of the largest new product cycles in our history, but there is still a great deal of room for innovation in the next one to three years, you should expect to see new platforms from us that will continue to revolutionize doctors' practices and patients expectations for Doctor led treat.\n\nand scanning, making it simpler and faster and software saving both doctors and patients more time with or with improved clinical outcomes.\n\nIn direct three D printing and evolution in both product and material science.\n\nThese three platforms will give doctors tools only drempt before with a singular focus to make the invisalign system. The standard of orthodontic and restored of care and we couldnt be more excited about it.\n\nThank you for your time today, we look forward to updating you on our next earning call.\n\nNow I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions operator.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you at this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question. Please press star one on your telephone keypad.\n\ntone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You May Press Star two if you would like to move your questions from the queue for participants using speaker equipment. It may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star.\n\nOne moment, please while we poll for questions.\n\nThe first comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler you May proceed.\n\nThanks, Good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions.\n\nJoe and John Congrats on seeing the stability return to the business.\n\nMaybe I'll start with that point.\n\nYou could talk about maybe what's changed versus say three to six months ago.\n\nAll part of the market still sounds maybe a little sluggish, but you also saw a sequential improvement team.\n\nTeams are holding in could you maybe speak to the visibility you have today versus where you set.\n\nLast summer and the fall would have led to the greater confidence and demand forecasting.\n\nHey, Jason it's Joe.\n\nFirst of all I think we have a more stable stable macroeconomic environment.\n\nObviously 2022 is pretty unprecedented when you think about China situation, Ukraine situation in Europe .\n\nThe rapid increase federal reserve rates, it really puts the economy and a lot of ways. So I mean, we're working from a better platform in that sense I think.\n\nPowells comments today in five increase at all I mean, it shows a little bit of confidence and the best partner since of what they're seeing and what youre directing too. So I'd just say Jason from a broad standpoint, we feel really good about our portfolio. We feel good about the technology, we talked about and all of those things. We're just looking for a stable platform from an economic standpoint to operate.\n\nYes.\n\nOkay. That's helpful.\n\nIt sounds more macro related than anything else.\n\nBut that's helpful. And then maybe Joe I wanted to pick up on one point you mentioned.\n\nRegarding the bracket and wire piece.\n\nSure seems like maybe a profit motivated decision for docs, maybe shortsighted, but still profit motivated as they focus on that across the brackets and wires versus that clear aligner lab fee.\n\nWhat do you think it's going to take to reverse that trend bath to clear liners picking up meaningful share I guess, especially with teens to market volumes need to come back in a bigger way to convince doctors to free up more cheer time of clear liners or is there something you can do on your end to really stimulate that that shift back towards in decline.\n\n.\n\nYes, that's a great question.\n\nFirst of all I mean doctors are doing what they think are in the best financial interest and from a patient standpoint too.\n\nStronger macroeconomic environment will help in that sense, because they'll have higher patient traffic in.\n\nThe trade off won't be as severe in that sense because of the patient throughput, but where we help is in technology and that's why we emphasize the technology developments and the investments that we're making that a really significant as we launched this year and like I talked about with just software alone the big one in the sense of being able to move patients through faster.\n\nBeing able to have doctors really do cases, a lot faster before with our products like IPP in different areas. So those technology advancements are really important and then how we put those together and business models like our digital subscription programs really help doctors get over that line too. So I feel we have a good format to be able to address that going forward, but again I'll emphasize.\n\nWe need a market that we can stand on NUCYNTA and predict.\n\nAlright, thanks, so much congrats again.\n\nI appreciate it next question please.\n\nAbsolutely. The next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird You May proceed.\n\nHi, Jeff. Thanks, Hey, guys. Good afternoon, Joe I, just wanted to ask a couple of questions here I guess, one just on the clear aligner volume guidance for .\n\nIt sounds like it's because China incrementally weaker stability in Americas and EMEA.\n\nPress release, but got some hedging words in there about primarily due to weakness in China and some stability in the Americas and EMEA I mean should we be thinking at this point that your Americas and EMEA are kind of odd.\n\nAnd kind of a baseline here and I know, obviously macro can change from here.\n\nFilming that macro change away or are we kind of at a baseline level now on absolute volume for Americans and EMEA and do you think China put a DEA recovery play throughout this year or are you seeing any early signs of some pickup in some of those big dental hospitals or are the new adult in the standard product there or anything.\n\nHey, Jeff first of all on the front end with western economies as we just see stability and Thats, what we talked about that's what we see versus before we saw the market falling away from us, but right now we see it being stable and.\n\nFeel better about that point on China uncertainty in China has incredible when you think about 1 billion people being sick there right now or have been over the last couple of weeks.\n\nJeff I've refused forecast over a number of .\n\nof quarters now because a lot of it has to do with the uncertainty that we see in China, specifically, which our second biggest market in the world. So I don't want to try to forecast China right now I can tell you right now it's a blur for us.\n\nVery difficult.\n\nBut we feel good about where we stand with EMEA and the states from a stability standpoint.\n\nWe tried to reflect as much in our words, what we see for the first quarter for you too.\n\nUnderstood.\n\nSo there's going to be a lot more questions here on the short term things I don't wanted to look at are asking about the desktop metal yellow.\n\nOn that right now is it all for kind of milling.\n\nMilling using to connect to the lab there for milling three D printing.\n\nJust restorations are you guys doing any early work with them on three D printing of clear liners.\n\nAnd just kind of again kind of update us maybe with your most recent thoughts on when we might start seeing three D printing of the liners in the office and kind of your competitive.\n\nAdvantages you think is .\n\nLying carve out in that kind of study.\n\nYes, yes, that's a good question the desktop metals is primarily we think about our restorative play.\n\nOur labs play a huge role in restoring dentistry with general dentist, there I mean, they're really strong partners in that sense, what desktop metal represents as you see a modest three D printing going on there's some really great resin development around restorative times of things dentures different areas. The desktop metal leads in our scanner can really help.\n\nWith that too.\n\nAlso we have a vision of ortho restorative, where you use our orthodontic procedures in order to reduce the amount of tooth loss mass that often comes with restorative procedures to that we'll work together with desktop about the idea of printing a liners.\n\nStandard types of STL kind of processes from a standpoint, I don't see that and honestly, Jeff I'm not one to think that doctors should turn their offices in the production facilities.\n\nprinting is hard.\n\nThe materials are difficult there's a lot of doctors are trying it but I feel like doctors are much better being physicians and doctors in that sense, then trying to run our manufacturing operations.\n\nEven in that first case to try to seal the deal and really lock that patient.\n\nPaying customer.\n\nJeff I, just think there's some things that.\n\nKind of makes sense from a productivity standpoint, some things that don't maybe the technology changes to the point, Jeff will have a different conversation, but as it stands today I really don't believe that.\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jim.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore you May proceed.\n\nHi, guys. Thanks, so much for the question.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'm wondering if you could talk about one.\n\nHow are you sort of think about the opex spend in terms of this particularly sales and marketing in this environment do you sort of you know obviously with the uncertain demand profile and the things that youre doing incrementally fourth quarter in the first quarter, that's sort of switch that stat.\n\nSpend around.\n\nYes, I think what what we always look at.\n\nThis is John we're always looking at trying to find the right return on investment. So as you see some of the market stabilized and start to come back that we see that's what we'll continue to make investments and as we see volume come back we'll invest even more.\n\nLike we talked about some of the stability in Americas and EMEA. So we'll constantly look at trying to find the right return on investment and as those markets stabilize and come back.\n\nYoull see us continue to invest in there and as we said last year, we kind of had a pair some of that back based on the conditions and ideally we could be in a better situation, where we can make additional investments this year.\n\nThat makes sense and maybe I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the GP demand profile because that was interesting how that would sort of holding up on a relative basis I heard what you said, obviously about the teen commentary is it something about that market or maybe the lower price point per.\n\nKeith or anything like that that would sort of be impacting that that'd be just curious to get more color on that.\n\nElizabeth It's Joe could you restate that question I didn't quite get the entire question.\n\nI think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the GP dentists sort of strength versus the fourth though on a relative to assist in the quarter. I was wondering if you could talk more about sort of the underlying color about why that why you sort of think that is at this point.\n\nYes, that's a good question.\n\nWhen you think about it we haven't we're in like a procedure and so someone's going to go into an orthodontist on a procedure like this that have her teeth straightening with the GP.\n\nThere is patient.\n\nPatient traffic, they're constantly with cleaning and restoration and different things and so just its an area right now where since it's not just elected procedures. There. We feel GPS are just seeing more patients than an ortho wood when you compare period to period.\n\nGot it thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. The following question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. You May proceed.\n\nHi, Jessica is going to change.\n\nJoe.\n\nMaybe the first one John or Joe can you just talk about the five 5% price increase for 2023.\n\nguidance is lower cases, lower scanner and services, but rose flat, so clearly a ASP benefits.\n\nThank you realize the five 5% the docs fees on comprehensive.\n\nOr goes to three by three but how do we think about flu.\n\nFlows to realized AOSP, John is that sort of.\n\nI don't know a plus two or 3% from the hundred 22 levels. When we think about 23 and into the balance of 'twenty three.\n\nThat's a good way to look at it John because you're going to have some cases that kind of carryover, where they kind of order them and they get shifted a little bit later, and then you're right you're going to have the mix shift between the three by three which is kind of the same price and then and then the.\n\nThe full comprehensive so 2% to 3% in that first quarter is about in that range.\n\nOkay.\n\nJust a quick.\n\nGo ahead John .\n\nI am sorry that was a clarify that it was just 2% to 3% sequential John correct from the four due to the Lumpiness yes.\n\nYes, Thats correct okay.\n\nOkay, and sorry, and the second question just on the Op margin I think you said, 18% non-GAAP of greater than 20% for the year.\n\nI'll just sort of load up a modeling question here do we think about sequential improvement for each of the quarters throughout 2023, and then that might be for John and Joe for you just talk to us on how you are comfortable.\n\nOne that OLED Guy when you still have a lot of moving parts with the economy, you've got what's going on in China, I think you framed it as a fragile environment. How do you get comfortable with that guide there is enough wiggle room I suppose in the Opex, where you feel you can titrate spend accordingly, thanks guys.\n\nYeah I'll take the modeling question John Yes, you would expect that just like we have in.\n\nI mean with prior years and so on as you start to get that volume leverage youll start to see some of that op margin improvement as you go throughout as you go throughout the year. So kind of starts at that lower point and you would model it too.\n\nTo see some improvement as you go through the year and like we said total year.\n\nSlightly above the 20%.\n\nAnd John on the Om guide and the competence of the competencies related to what we see right now and what we think is some macro trends that are much more stable than what we've experienced before so from that we understand our costs and we know what we have given take John and I watch it closely.\n\nWe obviously manage it as a percentage of our total revenues are too so revenues have to adjust we have to adjust to.\n\nBut again I think we know what the levers are in this business and within the context of stability. We feel we can manage to the numbers that we've given you.\n\nOkay fair enough thanks, guys.\n\nExcellent.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thanks for the question.\n\nJoe I just wanted to kind of follow up on your comments about starting to commercialize obviously, a product and technology cycle that you seem very excited about and that sort of ortho and restore division I guess could you maybe just kind of help crystallize that for us in terms of how that kind of comes to market in 2023.\n\nThe type of investment that the company needs to make to kind of go after that opportunity.\n\nYes.\n\nNathan overall, obviously, we do spend a significant amount on R&D in the business.\n\nThe foundation of that is the history of aligned because basically we're revolutionized digital orthodontics overall, but what we see as a start just invention for invention sake. We're always after how can we do these cases faster how do we do the more predictably how do we make it simpler for doctors a better treatment for patients overall and experienced in .\n\nOne statistic right, so versus wires and brackets, which we talked about in the script on an average we do patient cases five months past.\n\nAnd 35% fewer visits to a doctor and you do that some technology right you do that through remote monitoring you do that through the consistency of your algorithms and moving teeth and knowing when those seats are going to land as long as patients were and so the technology I talked about in those three areas first of all whether it's scanning we get better on scanning every year.\n\nReal important part of that because look through AI, you can anticipate a lot of things moving scans through a lot faster.\n\nLast year like IPP Invisalign personal plan.\n\nThese kinds of technologies really reduce the traffic and communications between the Doctor and us in the sense of setting up treatment plans and lastly, three D printed devices as I mentioned has always been the Holy Grail and.\n\nAnd we're the biggest printer in the world, but we don't really three D printing devices reprint molds, which in vacuum form over top of it when you vacuum form over the top of a mortgage you can't control wall thickness. As you can in three D printing and wall thickness is really critical to move teeth. So all of these invention to take a lot of time and money overall, but.\n\nBut we just see a huge opportunity for us to be able to increase clinical efficacy efficiency for doctors and patient experience and that's why we're so excited about it.\n\nOkay, Great and then just a quick clarification on.\n\nOn the adult side cases were up 7% sequentially. It sounds like you saw modest improvement in North America I think that was the case in APAC as well I guess I didn't see a reference to a $1 youre talking about EMEA I guess was the kind of adult dynamic kind of more in one thing about the western economies more in North America, just curious if.\n\nYou also saw the same thing play out in EMEA as well.\n\nIf I get the question right Nathan I mean, EMEA was great both adults and teens, we felt good about it. They can't you always go around I called the dark side of the Moon in Europe in third quarter right, but when they came out in the third quarter, we had a good fourth quarter from that.\n\nAnd so we felt good on both the adult side in the teen side in Europe .\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nYes, Thank you Nick.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS you May proceed.\n\nHi, Thanks for taking my question.\n\nHi, guys.\n\nI always struggle with this number that you really havent grown the number of docs and it's been a while and I understand that when demand is down you don't ship docks every quarter, but even the ones that are registered invisalign users havent really grown and I guess my question is is there an issue with that like.\n\nWhy hasnt that number really expanded over the last four to five quarters.\n\nDo you need it as part of your growth algorithm to keep expanding the number of doctors or is it just a change in culture in the world right now or is it competitive pressures or is it just harder to find docs, who are willing to do this because the penetration of clear liners, which suggests there is.\n\nA lot of doctors out there that could be doing them.\n\nHey, Kevin doctors, both on the orthodontic side and on the GP side I mean, obviously I think you are right about that and obviously, we expand a lot globally. So everything you said is true I'll just give you one word on your questions on China.\n\nChina's.\n\nChina's light.\n\nIt's down we shipped thousands of doctors in China, we can't ship to right now.\n\nThat's the answer to your question is Thats why its gone down Theres no systemic overall.\n\nOverall issue in the sense of us being penetrated to the point that we can find more doctors, it's just mechanics downdrafts in China right now in your equation is right new doctors, Dr ship too as well as utilization that is the two key metrics that help us grow our business.\n\nCan I ask a quick follow up.\n\nCan you talk about the.\n\nNeed to see consumer demand signals improving yeah.\n\nHow far ahead can you actually see that meaning.\n\nIs it is there something in ordering and planning like or can you see three months ahead or six months ahead in terms of you're starting to see demand increase.\n\nOr is it really real time like we've made.\n\nWe're starting to see an inflection point I guess it gets to the point of like.\n\nWhat what do you need to see in terms of consumer demand how far forward can you can you look before you can really feel comfortable that there's been an inflection point.\n\nBut Kevin when we look at things that were a real time business. Obviously, when you have a three D printing business like we do and what we make.\n\nThere is no leading indicators that would say that.\n\nIt Hasnt R squared of overnight.\n\n90%, but what we watch closely are the consumer confidence indices.\n\nIn the states in Europe , where we can get good ones out there theyre more confirming then they are predictive and what we're seeing.\n\nBut they reflect the I think best from.\n\nA demand standpoint of what we can expect in the consumer confidence indices that we see both in Europe , and the states have flattened out or turn slightly positive.\n\nLast month or so thanks, Kevin next question. Please.\n\nAbsolutely. Our next one comes from Brandon with William Blair You May proceed.\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nI wanted to ask one to kind of go back.\n\nA couple of those were trying to get at.\n\nYou guided to a full year op margin above, 20% and you're a little bit below that now of course, probably transient.\n\nQuestion being you need sequential improvements in sales to then drive the sequential improvements in op margins through the year, how should we be thinking about that or are you prepared to kind of deliver that 20%. Even if let's say we are just stable through the rest of the year rather than improving.\n\nYes, it's a good question.\n\nWe would expect is.\n\nAs we start to see .\n\nDemand has stabilized as the exchange in the world.\n\nIt gives us a better operating environment, we would expect to see some sequential improvement in revenue as you go through the year and.\n\nThat would help us get.\n\nSome of the leverage that we need from an op margin standpoint.\n\nThanks Brennan got next question.\n\nAbsolutely. The next question comes from Anne White with Morgan Stanley You May proceed.\n\nGreat. Thanks, just a follow up to that last question just to clarify I understand youre not giving the full year guidance from a volume perspective, but if you do continue to see the environment.\n\nYoure, saying sustained where it is today are getting slightly better you are in a position to grow volume year over year end 2023, and then.\n\nSeparate question on subscription offerings, particularly in routine Ericsson and I'm curious, how that's resonating with customers today is another revenue driver for the practice.\n\nAnd when do you think that that will be material in terms of contribution. Thanks.\n\nOn the volume I mean, we would expect.\n\nWhat we're watching.\n\nLot of the signal supposedly we tried to give more color around Q1, and the rest of the year will play out as things.\n\nAs things in the World change due to this situation. So we'll watch volume closely.\n\nBut like I said, we would expect some sequential improvement as you go forward through the year, but.\n\nWe're not getting into the specifics of what it is for total.\n\nThey are still on the on the DSP program.\n\nAnd originally that was targeted primarily retainers orthodontist, because a lot of orthodontists were making their own.\n\nis in a back room.\n\nFor wires and brackets.\n\nSo we signed up we also obviously do the touch up cases with that too is tenant liners less.",
    "content2": "And that's worked out well and I think what you're referring to in the end is that the subscription program to the Doctor and we also have a subscription program. We offered from the doctor through the patients and we're implementing that now there's a lot of enthusiasm from our doctors about that because it becomes a reoccurring revenue stream for them that they haven't many of them haven't tapped into before.\n\nSo we feel good about that.\n\nWe'll be working closely with our doctors to implement that more fully this year.\n\nThank you next question please.\n\nAbsolutely. The next question comes from Michael with Bank of America. You May proceed.\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys ill throw in a couple of just real quick from a versa.\n\nFirst on China, I think you mentioned that.\n\nOn the use the word it's a blur, which is kind of understandable, but any updated thoughts on DVT or any of the local on the ground.\n\nHow what's going on there while the COVID-19 situation is ongoing.\n\nA box and then I also wanted to ask on the on the tax rate. The non-GAAP tax rate and then you called out 20% in should we sort of assume possibly go forward.\n\nSo Michael this is John on tax rate for the non non-GAAP tax rate assume 20% going forward.\n\nOn China, GDP, I mean, obviously that program over there we talked about it several times.\n\nIn tier three tier four cities, it's really not in the middle of our portfolio.\n\nIt was picked up by some Chinese competitors were primarily private over there we will sell the public hospitals.\n\nThe programs.\n\nExclusive of in essence to so when we feel like we can we can manage in China right now around this fine.\n\nAlright. Thanks.\n\nThank you.\n\nWell, thank you everyone.\n\nI appreciate your time today. This concludes our conference call.\n\nWe look forward to speaking to you at upcoming financial conferences and industry meetings, including Chicago Midwinter idea and.\n\nIf you have any follow up questions. Please contact our Investor Relations line have a great day.\n\nThis concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation you may now disconnect your lines."

Welcome to the Align Q3 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Shirley Stacy, with Align Technology. You may begin.\nGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.

Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our Q3 results and discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, System and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back, summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nOur third quarter results reflect the continued macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence as well as significant impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates across currencies that affect our operations. On a constant currency basis, total Q3 revenues were reduced by $25 million or 2.7% sequentially and $57.4 million or 6.1% year-over-year, one of the largest quarterly foreign exchange impacts in our history. We remain confident in the execution of our strategic growth drivers despite the continuing economic headwinds.\nIn Q3, we reached our 14 millionth Invisalign patient milestone during the quarter, which includes nearly 4 million teenagers and kids as young as 6 years old, who have been treated with Invisalign clear aligners. In Q3, teen case starts of 200,000 were up 13% sequentially and just off slightly compared to Q3 '21 a year ago with a record 206,000 teenagers started Invisalign treatment. We're also excited to be launching significantly new products and technologies that further enhance the Align Digital Platform, leading the digital transformation are the practice of dentistry.\nDuring the quarter, we also began to commercialize ClinCheck Live Update software, Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personal Plan, Invisalign Smile Architect, the Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro with in-face visualization, Cone Beam Computed Tomography with ClinCheck software Invisalign, Virtual AI software and iTero-exocad Connector.\nThese technology advancements represent an important expansion of our digital platform that we believe will help our doctor customers increase treatment efficiency and deliver superior clinical outcomes and patient experiences, positioning us to drive growth when the market inevitably rebounds. We'll be showcasing these innovations next month at the Invisalign Ortho Summit, Las Vegas, the premier education and networking experience for Invisalign practices with the most peer-to-peer presentations of any Invisalign education event.\nThrough Q3, Systems and Services, interest in our iTero scanners was good with increased product demos across the regions. Doctors are increasingly recognizing the substantial benefits of intraoral scanning and end-to-end digital workflows with the iTero scanner and imaging systems. At the same time, increasing inflation, rising interest rates and less patient traffic and dental practices are lengthening sales cycles and conversion time.\nFor Q3, System and Services revenues of $157.5 million were down sequentially year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced Q3 '22 Systems and Services revenues by approximately $4.1 million or 2.5% sequentially and approximately $9.9 million or 5.9% year-over-year. For Q3, scanner services year-over-year revenue growth was strong across all regions, particularly due to increased subscription revenue driven by growth of the installed base of iTero scanners.\nYear-over-year growth also reflects increased sales of iTero warranties and continued growth of our scanner leasing rental programs. We continue to work closely with our doctor customers to support their practice growth and digital transformation goals. This includes understanding different ways to enable them to navigate to more uncertain economic environment. Over the past year, we've had good success rolling out new leasing programs in Latin America and certified preowned or CPO, as we call it, options in India and North America.\nWe're also looking at new opportunities on the capital equipment side for our DSO partners. This is a natural progression in an equipment business with a large and growing installed base. As we introduce new products, there are more opportunities for customers to upgrade to make trade-ins and to provide refurbished scanners for emerging markets, too. We expect to continue to roll out programs that are especially helpful for customers in the current macroeconomic environment.\nIt's selling the way doctors and customers want to do business and leveraging our balance sheet. We're still early, we're pleased with the contribution of margin accretion we're seeing.\nFor our Clear Aligner segment, macroeconomic uncertainty and waiting consumer confidence continues to impact the dental market overall, making for a challenging operating environment across the board. For Q3, third-party reports indicate there are fewer new patient visits, less traffic flow and lower orthodontic case starts overall.\nOur Clear Aligner volumes further reflect the underlying orthodontic market trends and a shift away from adults toward teens in Q3. Q3 Clear Aligner revenues were down 8.2% sequentially and down 12.5% year-over-year compared to Q3 '21 year-over-year revenue growth rates of plus 35%. On a constant currency basis, Q3 '22 Clear Aligner revenues were reduced by unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately $21 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially and approximately $47.4 million or approximately 6.1% year-over-year.\nFor the quarter, Q3 Aligner volumes reflect a sequential increase in Invisalign shipments from Asia Pacific and Latin America as well as North America Invisalign teen cases offset by lower volume in EMEA and North America, primarily Invisalign adult cases. For Q3, Invisalign First for kids as young as 6 grew year-over-year and was strong across all regions. On a trailing 12-month basis, as of Q3, Invisalign Clear Aligner shipments for teens and young kids using Invisalign First up year-over-year to over 734,000 cases.\nFor Q3, the total number of new Invisalign trained doctors increased sequentially 8.5% driven by North America and Asia Pacific. In terms of Invisalign submitters, the total number of doctors shipped to for Q3 increased sequentially to 84,400 doctors, the second highest number this year, driven by Asia Pacific and the Americas. From a channel perspective, ortho submitters were slightly year-over-year up, especially from doctors submitting teen cases, offsetting -- offset by a few GP dentists year-over-year, especially in EMEA.\nFor other non-case revenues, which include retention products such as Vivera retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce and our new subscription programs such as our DSP, Q3 revenues were up both sequentially and year-over-year. This reflects strong growth in retainers sequentially and year-over-year growth across all regions, driven by more submitters.\nIn U.S., revenues for our doctor subscription program increased sequentially and year-over-year. I'm very pleased to see continued momentum in non-case revenues driven by subscription-based programs that we expect to continue to expanding across the business.\nNow let's turn to the specifics around the third quarter results, starting with the Americas. The Q3 Invisalign case volumes for Americas were down sequentially single-digit percentages and primarily due to lower Invisalign bulk shipments. The environment remains challenging and feedback from our customers indicates consumer financing and patient no shows affecting their practices in Q3, especially with adult patients. Q3 Invisalign volume also reflects increased case submissions from orthodontic channel and sequential growth in the teen segment.\nFor Q3, teen patients were most resilient, reflecting continued momentum in younger patients with Invisalign First as well as the new Invisalign Teen case pack. During Q3, Invisalign Teen case packs grew both sequentially and year-over-year.\nAs a reminder, Invisalign Teen case packs, a new subscription program that enables orthodontists to buy clear aligners and packs in advance. They also include exclusive practice development benefits with the Invisalign brand and require an incremental volume commitment from doctors. Teen case packs are currently available in the U.S., Canada and France, and we expect to be expanded more in EMEA region.\nTurning to our international business for Q3, Invisalign Clear Aligner volume was down very slightly sequentially, 1.4%, with strong sequential growth for APAC, offset by lower volume in EMEA. For EMEA, Q3 operating environment was challenging. Inflation in the Eurozone is more than 10% and global macroeconomic factors weighed on consumer sentiment and purchasing decisions, especially for adult patients, which compounded the impact of Q3 summer seasonality. Similar to the Americas, doctors in EMEA also reported increased appointment cancellations and the impact of less patients financing their purchases.\nEMEA teen patients also resilient in Q3 increased sequentially in Iberia as well as France, where we introduced teen case packs during the quarter. In APAC, Q3 sequential growth was led by China, Japan and ANZ despite ongoing COVID restrictions and lockdowns in parts of China and Japan. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign case volumes reflected increased shipments across almost all markets, led by Taiwan, Thailand, India and Korea, driven by increased submitters.\nIn Q3, APAC sequential growth also reflects strong demand from our expanded Invisalign clear aligner product portfolio in China. Recall in late April, Q2, we introduced 2 new products that better serve the expanding market in China. Invisalign Adult and Invisalign Standard clear aligners leverage our proven technology while broadening our appeal to more consumer segments. Q3 was the first full quarter offering these new products that provide doctors and patients in China with broader clinical and affordable options for moderate-to-complex adult cases.\nFinally, I'm pleased to share that the Invisalign system was recently awarded the Good Design Award for 2022, making it the first orthodontic appliance to win the prestigious award in Japan. In the judge's assessment of the Invisalign system, they emphasized that the opportunity for teeth straightening is high in Japan and cited the barrier to adoption by Japanese consumers is resistance to metal braces and praised the Invisalign system as an orthodontic solution that can improve the quality of life during treatment.\nWe certainly recognize the importance of the Japanese market for digital orthodontics and is one of the reasons we opened our first office in Tokyo nearly 15 years ago and established treatment planning operations in Yokohama a few years ago.\nTurning to new innovations, we continue to deliver our technology road map. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we began to commercialize several new products and services that we previously announced would come to market in the second half of 2022. These technology advancements illustrate our commitment to continuous innovation in digital orthodontics, and we remain excited about the transformational projects that we're working on as we continue to drive the evolution of our industry.\nNo other dental company has the experience, including over 14 million patients treated to date to lead the transformation of the practice of dentistry. Our consumer marketing focus on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to Invisalign doctor's offices ultimately capitalize on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles globally. In Q3, we built on our successful Invis Is media campaign and continued our launch of the Invis is Drama Free, targeted at teens and Invis When Everything Clicks, targeted at adults.\nOur teen campaign, Invis is Drama Free highlights the benefits of Invisalign while humorously juxtaposing them with the significant trade-offs involved with using braces. Our Invis is When Everything Clicks campaign showcases Invisalign treatment transforming smiles and the resulting confidence it gives to young adults.\nDuring Q3, we had over 4.3 billion impressions delivered in 14 million visits to our website, a 1.6% year-over-year increase as a result of rightsizing our media investments. We're also rightsizing our consumer media investments across all core EMEA markets, impacting the impressions and unique visits.\nIn U.S., we continued our influencer and creator-centric campaigns, partnering with leading smile squad creators like Olympic Gold Medalist, Suni Lee, Michael Le, Josh Richards and Marsai Martin. Each of these creators shared their personal experience of Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smile with Invisalign aligners.\nMost recently, Suni Lee shared her positive experience with Invisalign in major media programming include Good Morning America, people.com, resulting in over 93 million impressions. We continue to invest in consumer advertising across APAC region, resulting in a 72% year-over-year increase in impressions and 29% year-over-year increase in unique visitors.\nOur ongoing campaigns were omnipresent across the top social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and YouTube to increase the awareness of the Invisalign brand with young adults and teens. In Q3, we launched a global plot on the Roblox platform within the popular game LiveTopia creating a fun experience for players to learn about the benefits of Invisalign treatment.\nTo date, we had over 5.9 million impressions delivered in over 2.6 million unique visitors on the game experience. Adoption of My Invisalign Consumer and Patient app continues to increase with 2 plus 2 million (sic) [2.2 plus million] downloads to date. Usage of our key digital tools also continued to increase. Live update was used by 41,000 doctors or more than 395,000 cases, reduced time spent in modifying treatment by 18%. Invisalign Practice app has been downloaded 314,000 times to date.\nFurther, we received more than 110,000 patient photos in our virtual care capability to date, providing rich global data to leverage our AI capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients. The investments that we make to drive patient demand and conversion to support our doctor customers is unparalleled in our industry, leveraging the global recognition of the Invisalign system.\nNo other dental company equals our brand strength today. For more details on our consumer marketing programs, please see our Q3 '22 earnings and conference slides.\nTurning to exocad. Overall, I'm very pleased with our progress with the exocad business and its leadership and restorative dentistry. In addition to the iTero-exocad Connector, I mentioned previously, during the quarter, we also introduced iTero NIRI, NIRI is near infrared technology intraoral camera images and are now automatically imported into dental CAD when designing restorations, enabling technicians to visualize the internal and external tooth structure and optimize the process of margin line tracing.\nThe new xSnap module is a model attachment for a printable 3D articulated system, featuring a spherical head, which allows a precisely executed movement. And Ivoclar's Ivotion Dental System, a complete workflow for digital production of high-quality removable dentures is now available on exocad. Together, the iTero and exocad product portfolios help accelerate the digital transformation of dental practices by facilitating the way doctors and labs collaborate to deliver better care for their patients.\nAs part of the Align Digital platform, the integration of iTero's digital scanning and exocad's complete software solution delivers seamless end-to-end digital workflows from diagnosis to treatment, planning and then fabrication. Customers are already utilizing the automated workflows, unlocking efficiencies and productivities, which are more important than ever in the current economic climate.\nWith the recent integration of iTero NIRI and intraoral camera images unique to iTero Element 5D imaging systems and exocad Rijeka software release, Align is redefining restorative visualization and treatment planning for the doctors and labs.\nWe are committed to continuing and innovating in the dental industry to drive efficiency and clinical excellence for the benefit of our customers and their patients.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nCFO & Executive VP of Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q3 financial results. Total revenues for the third quarter were $890.3 million, down 8.2% from the prior quarter and down 12.4% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, Q3 2022 unfavorable foreign exchange reduced Q3 revenues by approximately $25.1 million sequentially and approximately $57.4 million year-over-year.\nFor Clear Aligners, Q3 revenues of $732.8 million were down 8.2% sequentially primarily due to lower volumes, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher promotions and discounts and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners. On a year-over-year basis, Q3 clear aligner revenue were down 12.5%, primarily reflecting the aforementioned items, offset somewhat by per order processing fees and higher non-case revenues.\nOn a constant currency basis, Q3 '22 unfavorable foreign exchange reduced Q3 Clear Aligner revenues by approximately $21 million or approximately 2.8% sequentially and approximately $47.4 million or approximately 6.1% year-over-year. For Q3, Invisalign ASPs for both comprehensive and non-comprehensive treatment decreased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, decline in ASPs reflect unfavorable impact from foreign exchange that Joe described earlier as well as higher discounts and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners.\nOn a year-over-year basis, the decline in ASPs reflect the significant impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix shift and higher discounts, partially offset by the higher additional aligners and per order processing fees. As our revenues from subscription, retainers and other ancillary products continue to grow and expand globally, some of the historical metrics that focus only on case shipments do not account for our overall growth.\nIn our earnings release and financial slides, you will see that we have added our total clear aligner revenue per case shipment which is more indicative of our overall growth strategy. Clear aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $37 million or 3.3% sequentially and $184 million or up 18.6% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.\nDuring the 3 months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized $137.2 million that was included in the clear aligner deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2021. The Q3 Systems and Services revenue of $157.5 million were down 8% sequentially, primarily due to lower scanner volume, partially offset by higher services revenues from our larger installed base and were down 11.7% year-over-year, primarily due to lower scanner volume and lower ASP, partially offset by higher services revenue from our larger installed base.\nQ3 '22, Systems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $4.1 million or approximately 2.5% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, System and Services revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $9.9 million or approximately 5.9%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $4.1 million or 1.6% sequentially and up $76.5 million or 40.9% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.\nDuring the 3 months ended September 30, 2022, we recognized $13.3 million that was included in the Systems and Services deferred revenues balance as of December 31, 2021.\nMoving on to gross margin. Third quarter overall gross margin was 69.5%, down 1.4 points sequentially and down 4.8 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points sequentially and 1.8 points on a year-over-year basis due to the impact of foreign exchange on our revenues.\nClear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was 70.9% down 2.4 points sequentially due to lower ASPs and increased manufacturing spend as we continue to ramp up operations at our new manufacturing facility in Poland. Clear Aligner gross margin for the third quarter was down 5.3 points year-over-year due to increased manufacturing spend for the reasons stated previously, higher freight and a higher mix of additional aligner volume and lower ASPs.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was 63.3%, up 3.6 points sequentially due to improved manufacturing absorption and lower freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin for the third quarter was down 2.3 points year-over-year due to higher inventory costs and manufacturing inefficiencies coupled with lower ASPs, partially offset by higher service revenues. Q3 operating expenses were $475.5 million, down sequentially 4.8% and down 3.7% year-over-year.\nOn a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $23.9 million, mainly due to controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses decreased by $18.5 million for the same reasons as sequential as well as lower incentive compensation. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $443.4 million, down sequentially 4.8% and down 4.9% year-over-year.\nOur third quarter operating income of $143.7 million resulted in an operating margin of 16.1%, down 3.3 points sequentially and down 9.6 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.6 points sequentially due to foreign exchange and lower gross margin. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 3.5 points.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisition, the operating margin for the third quarter was 20.2%, down 3 points sequentially and down 8.6 points year-over-year. Interest and other income and expense net for the third quarter was a loss of $21 million compared to a loss of $14.6 million in Q2 and an income of $0.8 million in Q3 of '21, primarily due to larger net foreign exchange losses from the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nThe GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 40.7% and compared to 35% in the second quarter and 30.9% in the third quarter of the prior year. The third quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the second quarter effective tax rate, primarily due to the decrease in profits and changes in jurisdictional mix of income, resulting in lower tax benefits from foreign income tax at different rates and higher than in the U.S.\nOn a non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.1% in the third quarter compared to 25.6% in the second quarter and 22.2% in the third quarter of the prior year. Third quarter net income per diluted share was $0.93, down sequentially $0.51 and down $1.35 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.30 on a sequential basis and $0.48 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $1.36 for the third quarter, down $0.64 sequentially and down $1.51 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.1 billion, up sequentially $163.8 million and down $96.8 million year-over-year. Of the $1.1 billion balance, $471 million was held in the U.S. and $670 million was held by our international entities.\nQ3 accounts receivable balance was $859.6 million, down approximately 7.8% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 86 days, flat sequentially and up approximately 11 days as compared to Q3 last year. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $266.5 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $75.3 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities.\nFree cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $191.1 million. We are well capitalized to continue to invest for growth while managing through these challenging market conditions, exiting the quarter with over $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and 0 debt.\nNow turning to full year 2022 and the factors that influence our views on our business outlook.\nUnderlying market dynamics as well as the reactions to macroeconomic headwinds by central banks, governments and consumers remain uncertain. We will continue to focus on those matters that have been central to our historically successful business strategies by managing those things within our control. This includes maintaining fiscal controls and focused delivery on our business model so that we are positioned for success once the difficult operating environment ultimately abates.\nWe remain confident in the huge underpenetrated market for the digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our technology and industry leadership and our ability to execute and make progress toward our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth. We expect to be below our fiscal 2022 GAAP operating margin target of 20%, which includes the impact from the current unfavorable foreign exchange of approximately 2 to 3 points that was not factored into our operating margin guidance for the fiscal year 2022 when we gave an update on the Q1 '22 earnings call in April.\nFor 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our investment in the aligner fabrication facility in Wroclaw, Poland, which began servicing doctors in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn addition, during Q4 2022, we expect to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock through either -- or a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As we continue to navigate a macroeconomic uncertainty, weaker consumer confidence and the lingering impacts of COVID-19 shutdowns primarily in China and Japan, we remain focused on our strategic initiatives as well as the incredible market opportunity for digital dentistry and our products.\nWe believe our unwavering drive to transform smiles and change lives for millions of people around the world is on one other clear aligner company can match and positions us to better address this market opportunity. Regardless of the operating environment, we are committed to balancing investments to drive growth and long-term strategic priorities that will transform the practice of dentistry and strengthen our business.\nThese are uncertain times. Every business is being impacted by macroeconomic environmental uncertainty. In addition, as a multinational company based in the United States with roughly half of our sales outside the country, the negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange has been like anything I've ever seen in my career.\nWe will continue to invest in digital solutions and demand creation to help doctors and their patients. We are committed to doctor-directed care and transforming the industry together while working through these global macro-economic challenges.\nThank you for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?",

Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our Q2 results and discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nI'm pleased to report solid second quarter results with top line revenues relatively unchanged from Q1, and an operating margin of approximately 20%, despite unfavorable foreign exchange. The underlying market for orthodontics continues to be impacted by macroeconomic environment factors and lingering effects of COVID-19 variants in certain markets.\nNotwithstanding these headwinds, we've remained focused on achieving our strategic initiatives, including opening new offices in the Middle East and Africa and our new manufacturing facility in Poland, launching new solutions to better support the way our customers want to do business. such as a Doctor Subscription Program, and Teen case packs, and announcing new products and innovation to help our doctors and their patients. These new innovations are revolutionizing the digital treatment planning and helping to drive the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry.\nAlign is well positioned to withstand the current market conditions to lead a digital revolution in orthodontics and dentistry as the environment and growth trends improve. For Systems and Services , Q2 revenues were up 4.7% sequentially and up slightly year-over-year compared to Q2 '21 year-over-year growth of 215%. Q2 Systems and Services revenues increased sequentially driven by scanner volume growth in the Americas and APAC, partially offset by lower volume in EMEA, and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. The iTero Element 5D imaging system continues to represent the majority of our scanner volume as doctors recognize the benefits of going digital.\nIn APAC, the iTero entry-level Flex scanner offering was up sequentially in Q2, reflecting increased adoption. I'm also pleased with sequentially increasing services revenues in Q2, reflecting growth from the installed base. Services revenues represent approximately 40% of our Systems and Services business. For our Clear Aligner segment, Q2 revenues were down slightly sequentially and down 5.1% year-over-year compared to our Q2 '21 record year-over-year revenue growth of 182%.\nFor the quarter, Q2 Clear Aligner volumes reflect sequential growth across the Americas and parts of EMEA, partially offset by China and U.K. Q2 Invisalign case starts for teens and younger patients was 177,300 up slightly sequentially and down 2.1% year-over-year compared to Q2 last year when our Teen case shipment growth rate was an all-time high. For Q2, Invisalign First for kids as young as 6 years old, grew year-over-year and was strong across all regions.\nDuring Q2, we introduced Invisalign Teen packs in the U.S. and Canada and France. Teen packs is our new subscription program, which enables orthodontists to buy clear aligners and packs in advance, similar to the way they buy wires and brackets today. Our Teen case pack simplified the ordering process and make the billing more predictable for doctors. Teen case packs also include exclusive practice development benefits with the Invisalign brand and requires an incremental volume commitment from doctors.\nTo date, enrollment has been encouraging with early adoptions highest among doctors who have not historically used Invisalign aligners to treat their teen patients. For other non-case revenues, which include retention products such as Vivera Retainers, clinical training and education, accessories, e-commerce and our new subscription programs such as our DSP revenues, were up both sequentially and year-over-year. For retainers, Q2 shipments had strong momentum with sequential and year-over-year growth across all regions driven by both submitters and utilization.\nMomentum in our Doctor Subscription Program continued and Q2 revenues increased over 60% sequentially.\nNow let's turn to the specifics around our second quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, Q2 Invisalign case volumes were up sequentially, reflecting increased submissions from the orthodontic channel and increased utilization from the GP channel. From a product standpoint, Q2 sequential Invisalign case growth reflects increases in both comprehensive and noncomprehensive products, including Invisalign First and Invisalign Moderate. Q2 also benefited from increased utilization in the DSO channel.\nOur international Clear Aligners, Q2 Invisalign case volumes were down 1.7% sequentially, primarily as a result of the headwinds described previously. For EMEA, Q2 Invisalign case volumes were down slightly primarily reflecting a slight increase in Iberia and Italy, offset primarily by slightly lower sequential volumes in the U.K. and France. For Q2, expansion market shipments declined sequentially. Q2 Invisalign teen patients increased sequentially driven by an increase in the number of doctors submitting teen cases.\nTurning to APAC. Invisalign case volumes were down slightly, reflecting a full quarter effect of continued lockdowns in China. For Q2, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and India performed well during the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign case shipments growth was strong in Japan, India, Taiwan, Thailand and Korea. The APAC teen case volume increased year-over-year, primarily driven by increased doctor submitters.\nTurning to new innovations. The Align Digital Platform is an integrated suite of proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless end-to-end solution to customers that connects all users, doctors, labs patients and consumers to transform smiles, and change lives. Our technology advancements help our doctor customers deliver superior clinical outcomes, treatment efficiency and also superior patient experience.\nIn Q2, we introduced Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro and Cone Beam Computed Tomography systems integration for ClinCheck software, building on several new innovations announced last quarter that we'll begin rolling out across the regions in August. Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro, the next-generation patient communication tool that empowers doctors to help patients visualize their potential new smile after Invisalign treatment. Use in-phase visualization in 3D dentition view, all done chairside in minutes.\nCone Beam Computed Tomography systems, or what we call CBCT, integration for ClinCheck software is designed to deliver a complete view of a patient's roots, crown and jawbone. CBCT integration for ClinCheck software enables doctors to confidently deliver a more informed Invisalign clear liner treatment plan or a wide range of cases. The user-friendly interface makes it easy for doctors to see their patients root, crown and jawbone and 1 automatically digitally fused 3D model. This allows doctors to tailor their treatment, plan based on their experience and their patients' needs. CBCT integration for ClinCheck software gives doctors the control and confidence to expand treatment planning to a broad range of mal inclusions, including surgical, restorative, expansion, extraction as well as teen cases with impacted or unerupted teeth.\nWhile it's still early in the commercialization of these new products, initial feedback from doctors is encouraging. We are excited to begin scaling them across our customer base in the second half of 2022. Also, during the quarter, we awarded 11 new research grants totaling $275,000 to universities around the world. Through our annual research awards program, we help advance orthodontic and dental research, furthering our commitment to the future of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry.\nOur consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system, and driving that demand to Invisalign doctors offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. For Q2, we had over 16.2 million visits to our websites, a 15% year-over-year increase, and delivered over 6.3 billion impressions. Both metrics were lower versus Q1 as we chose to rightsize our size and media spend in Q2 given the macroeconomic environment.\nDuring the quarter, we built on our successful \"Invis is\" multimedia campaign and launched in the U.S. the next evolution with 2 new campaigns, \"Invis is trauma-free\", targeted at teens, and \"Invis is when everything clicks\", targeted at adults. Our Invis is trauma-free campaign highlights the benefits of Invisalign treatment, while numerously juxtaposing teens with the significant hassles involved with using braces. Our Invis is when everything clicks campaign showcases of Invisalign treatment transforming smiles and the resulting confidence it gives to young adults. Both campaigns will be rolled out to markets around the world in Q3.\nAdvancing of our consumer patient app, My Invisalign, continued to increase with 1.8 million downloads to date. Uses of our 4 digital tools continues to increase, for example, Invisalign virtual appointment tool was used over 12,000 times, and our insurance verification feature was used 36,000 times in Q2. Further, we received more than 91,000 patient photos in our virtual care feature globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our artificial intelligence capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients. Additional consumer demand metrics are included in our Q2 earnings slides posted on our website.\nWe are pleased with our Q2 Systems and Services revenues, which were up 5% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. Q2 sequential growth primarily reflects higher scanner volumes in the Americas and APAC, in increased subscriptions. Year-over-year results primarily reflect increased scanner revenues in the Americas, offset by lower volume in APAC and EMEA. Growth of our iTero scanner installed base is driving an increase in services revenue.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services growth reflects increased service revenues from our largest scanner installed base, higher subscription revenues and increased sales of scanner once leased. The number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions in Q2 reflect continued adoption of our digital scanners and our larger installed base. Total worldwide intraoral digital scan submitted to start an Invisalign case in Q2 increased 88.4% from 82.2% in Q2 of last year.\nInternational intraoral digital scans for Invisalign case submissions increased 84.4%, up from 76.2% in Q2 of last year. For the Americas, 91.4% of Invisalign cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 87% in Q2 last year. Cumulatively, over 60.4 million orthodontic scans and over 12.6 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners.\nOur Q2 exocad CAD/CAM products and services, which include restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design offerings are included in our Systems and Services revenue. Exocad products and services are helping extend our digital dental solutions and broaden the aligned digital platform towards fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows. During the quarter, exocad released dental CAD 3.1 Rijeka in the new powerful lab software, which saves design time and offers more intuitive workflows along the designs earning from CAD to CAM.\nIn addition, the release -- the exocad release launched the new, myexocad, portal, introducing mandatory end-user software use registration that for the first time, allows exocad to collect information about who and how customers are using the software. This expands the opportunities for future product improvements. Also during the quarter, we signed a new long-term contract with exocad largest customer, (inaudible), further strengthening our relationship.\nFinally, we continue to execute our strategy of geographic expansion. In June, our European manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland, began manufacturing clear aligners for the EMEA region, locally, for the first time. We also continued our operational expansion in Poland with our latest treatment planning facility.\nOur expanded operation in Poland supports Invisalign doctors in local languages, increases our flexibility and timeliness in supporting our doctor customers across the region, and we expect will positively influence the quality and time of preparation of ClinCheck treatment plans and provide our doctor customers with benefits of digital orthodontics with the Invisalign system. We are uniquely positioned with manufacturing and treatment planning in all 3 regions, and no other clear aligner manufacturer has our global footprint and capabilities.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nCFO & Executive VP of Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q2 financial results. Total revenues for the second quarter were $969.6 million, down 0.4% from the prior quarter and down 4.1% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. This is compared to Q2 '21 revenues of $1 billion, which had a year-over-year growth rate of 186.9%. For clear aligners, Q2 revenues of $798.4 million were down 1.4% sequentially, due primarily to product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by higher non-case revenues, and down 5.1% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower volumes, unfavorable impact from foreign exchange and product mix shift, partially offset by higher additional aligners, per order processing fees and higher non-case revenues.\nQ2 '22 Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $12.3 million or approximately 1.5% sequentially, and approximately $32.9 million or approximately 4% year-over-year. For Q2, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and increased year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the decline in comprehensive ASPs reflect higher discounts and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners.\nOn a year-over-year basis, higher comprehensive ASPs reflect the impact of higher additional aligners and per order processing fees, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts. Q2 Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year.\nOn a sequential basis, Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by lower discounts, partially offset by product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, higher Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs reflect lower discounts, per order processing fees and higher additional aligners, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift.\nClear Aligner of deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $25.4 million or 2.3% sequentially and $231 million or up 25.5% year-over-year, and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped. Q2 '22 Systems and Services revenue of $171.2 million were up 4.7% sequentially, primarily due to higher scanner volume and ASP, and were up slightly by 0.8% year-over-year, primarily from higher services revenues from our larger installed base, partially offset by lower scanner volume and lower ASP.\nSystems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $2.9 million, or approximately 1.7% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Systems and Services revenue were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $7 million or approximately 3.9%. Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was $13.3 million or 5.4% sequentially, and up $99.6 million or 62.3% year-over-year primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenues included with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.\nMoving on to gross margin. Second quarter overall gross margin was 70.9%, down 2 points sequentially and down 4.1 points year-over-year. Overall, gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.5 points sequentially and 1.1 points on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. Clear Aligner gross margin for the second quarter was 73.3%, down 1.5 points sequentially due to lower ASPs and higher freight costs. Clear Aligner gross margin was down 3.6 points year-over-year due to a higher mix of additional aligner volume, higher freight and manufacturing spend, partially offset by higher ASPs.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the second quarter was 59.8%, down 3.6 points sequentially due to higher manufacturing variances and freight costs partially offset by higher ASPs. Systems and Services gross margin was down 6.1 points year-over-year due to lower ASPs and higher manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher service mix.\nQ2 operating expenses were $499.4 million, down sequentially 2.3% and up 2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down by $11.9 million mainly due to lower incentive compensation and controlled spend on advertising and marketing as part of our efforts to proactively manage costs. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $9.7 million, reflecting our continued investment in marketing, sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating expenses were $466 million down sequentially 3% and up 1% year-over-year. Our second quarter operating income of $188.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 19.4%, down 0.9 points sequentially and down 7.2 points year-over-year. Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1.1 points sequentially due to foreign exchange. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributable to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange by approximately 2.4 points.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating margin for the second quarter was 23.3%, down 0.7 points sequentially and down 6.5 points year-over-year.\nInterest and other income expense net for the second quarter was a loss of $14.6 million, down sequentially by $4 million and down year-over-year by $14.5 million, primarily due to larger net foreign exchange losses from the weakening of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nThe GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 35% compared to 28.4% in the first quarter and 25.7% in the second quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25.6% in the second quarter compared to 24.2% in the first quarter and 19.5% in the second quarter of the prior year. The second quarter GAAP effective tax rate was higher than the first quarter effective tax rate primarily due to foreign income tax at different rates and lower excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nSecond quarter net income per diluted share was $1.44, down sequentially $0.26 and down $1.07 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.26 on a sequential basis and $0.42 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per share was $2 for the second quarter, down $0.13 sequentially and down $1.04 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term marketable securities were $977.2 million, down sequentially $143.4 million and down $109.2 million year-over-year. Of our $977.2 million balance, $251.4 million was held in the U.S. and $725.8 million was held by our international entities.\nQ2 accounts receivable balance was $931.9 million, down approximately 2% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 85 days, down approximately 2 days sequentially and up approximately 13 days as compared to Q2 last year. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $127 million. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $76 million, primarily related to our continued investments to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities.\nFree cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to $51 million. In Q2, we purchased $200 million of our common stock through an accelerated stock repurchase program, receiving approximately 757,000 shares at an average price of $264.37 per share. We are over halfway through our May 2021 $1 billion repurchase program, and have approximately $450 million remaining available for purchase.\nNow turning to full year 2022 and the factors that influence our views on our business outlook. Overall, our Q2 results were solid, and we feel good about the execution across the business, especially in an increasingly challenging global economic environment. Delivering revenues and volumes relatively unchanged from Q1 and down only slightly year-over-year despite unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange speak to the strength of our underlying products and services and the size of our market opportunity. We remain confident in the huge underpenetrated market for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our technology and our industry leadership and our ability to execute and make progress towards our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth.\nWe also remain committed to our goal for fiscal 2022 to deliver GAAP operating margins above 20%, while making strategic investments in sales, marketing, R&D and operations, notwithstanding the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, which was not factored into our operating margin guidance for the full year.\nCapital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as a digital manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. For 2022, we expect our investment in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. This includes our investment in our aligner fabrication facility in Wroclaw, Poland.\nIn times like these, our strong fundamental Business differentiates Align, and we are grateful to have a profitable underlying business model that generates strong cash flow as well as a healthy balance sheet that provides flexibility to invest in our growth while supporting our employees, customers and shareholders.\nAs we move into the second half of the year, we will continue to manage our investments to account for headwinds and uncertainty while focusing on successfully delivering on our strategic growth drivers.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Closing Q2 in the first half of 2022 has proved to be tougher than we expected. As we continue to navigate macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer confidence and impacts related to COVID-19 variance, we cannot lose sight of the strong fundamentals of our business and the enormous market opportunity for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry.\nThe decisions we make this year will have lasting strategic implications for the future of our industry and the competitive landscape. We are holding true to our business strategy, and making good progress in a very difficult operating environment. We remain committed to balancing investments to drive growth and long-term strategic priorities with near-term headwinds while acting with a sense of urgency to ensure that we're ready to capitalize and extend our global innovation leadership as growth resumes.\nThanks for your time today. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator. Operator?",

Welcome to the Align Q1 '22 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this conference will be recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Shirley Stacy with Align Technology. You may begin.\n\nShirley Stacy\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm Shirley Stacy, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Joining me for today's call is Joe Hogan, President and CEO; and John Morici, CFO.

Please refer to these files for more detailed information.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide an overview of our Q1 results and discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments: Systems and Services and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial performance and our view for the remainder of the year. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nOverall, the first quarter proved to be a tougher-than-expected operating environment globally. And we believe our results primarily reflect 3 key factors: the continued impact of COVID-19 waves in every region and especially in China, with its restrictions and lockdowns under their zero-COVID policy; a weaker economic environment and waning consumer confidence driven by increasing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions; and the military conflict in the Ukraine and fallout across Europe.\nIn addition, with approximately half our business occurring outside the United States, unfavorable foreign exchange rates negatively impacting our revenues, margins and EPS. Notwithstanding these headwinds, Q1 '22 total revenues of $973.2 million were up 8.8% year-over-year compared to Q1 '21 revenues of $894 million with a growth rate of 62% year-over-year. Our Q1 '22 operating income was $198 million, and operating margin was 20.4%.\nIn Q1, Systems and Services revenues were up 15.6% year-over-year, but down 24% sequentially, coming off our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and record scanner and services revenue. Sequential results primarily reflect lower volumes from our aforementioned headwinds and from seasonality as Q4 is historically a stronger capital equipment sales quarter.\nFor Q1, Clear Aligner revenues were up 7.5% year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth across regions and products, and were down slightly sequentially from Q4 at minus 0.7%.\nIn the teen segment, 175,000 teens started treatment with Invisalign aligners, up 6% year-over-year. Invisalign First for kids as young as 6 years old grew sequentially year-over-year and was strong across all regions.\nQ1 non-case revenues, which include doctor-prescribed retention products, clinical training and education and other dental consumables, performed well and grew both year-over-year and sequentially. Our Doctor Subscription Plan (sic) [Doctor Subscription Program], or DSP, pilot was launched last year in the United States and Canada, and it continues to ramp nicely, driving strong revenue growth.\nDSP is a monthly subscription program designed for a segment of experienced Invisalign doctors who are not regularly using our retainers or low-stage aligners. We're very excited about the feedback and uptake we're seeing, and we'll expand the program into other markets this year.\nHere are just a few things some doctors are saying about DSP. Dr. Drew Ferris in Santa Barbara, California, \"We have shifted our retention model and workflow. We really like the material, the fit and the precision of the product and having everything in Align systems versus printing in-house and having to maintain it ourselves.\" Dr. Sandra Tai in Vancouver, Canada, \"This program fits my business model very well. I'm able to pass savings to patients.\"\nNow let's turn to the specifics around the first quarter results, starting with the Americas. For Q1, Invisalign case volumes were down 1.5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Americas case volumes were down 4.3%, primarily reflecting the impact from the COVID-19 waves, first experienced in North America beginning in Q4 '21 and continuing to Q1 and later in Latin America, causing consumers customer staffing shortages and practice closures as well as decreased patient traffic and increased appointment cancellations.\nThe latest data from the Gaidge practice analysis tool that collect and consolidates data from about 700 ortho practices, covering more than 1,000 orthodontists across 1,600 locations in the United States and Canada, showed weakening underlying patient demand trends in the first quarter for both adult and teens and across wires and brackets and clear aligner products. New patient visits were down 7.6% year-over-year, and ortho starts were down 7.2% year-over-year.\nIn the DSO channel, in Q1 '22, DSO practices grew faster than non-DSO practices, with utilization led by Heartland and Smile Doctors. Earlier this month, we announced a new DSO partnership with dentalcorp, Canada's largest and fastest growing network of dental practices. dentalcorp plans to extend its offering of Invisalign brand clear aligner treatment to Canadians nationwide through its Ortho Acceleration Program. This strategic collaboration also provides dentalcorp's network of doctors across nearly 460 practices with access to enhanced benefits, dedicated learning opportunities and treatment planning support for the Invisalign system.\nAlso this month, we launched a new Invisalign Teen Subscription Program in the United States and Canada to help unlock the massive opportunity from teen orthodontics, which makes up approximately 75% of the 5 million annual case starts in North America. The Teen Subscription Program enables orthodontists to buy clear aligners in case packs in advance, much like the way they buy wires and brackets today, offering simple and more predictable billing for doctors.\nIt also includes exclusive practice development benefits with the Invisalign brand and requires an incremental volume commitment from doctors. The timing of the new teen program coincides with the beginning of the summer teen season, and we're excited to continue partnering with doctors to grow their practice with Invisalign treatment. With less than 10% share of teen case starts, the Teen Subscription Program has the potential to help accelerate Invisalign adoption in the largest segment of the orthodontic market, teens.\nFor our international business, Q1 Invisalign case volumes were up 3% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, international case volumes were down 6.1%, primarily reflecting the headwinds described earlier, especially the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in China and the fallout across Europe from the military conflict in Ukraine.\nFor EMEA, Q1 Invisalign case volumes were up 2.1% year-over-year, with core -- growth in our core markets led by Italy and Germany and DACH, along with the growth expansion markets led by Turkey and MEA. The Q1 year-over-year Invisalign case volume in EMEA was driven by increased submissions, primarily from the orthodontist channel, especially in the teen market.\nDuring the quarter, we launched our first ever direct-to-teen campaign in EMEA focused on educating teens about the benefits of Invisalign treatment over traditional wires and brackets; increasing consumer demand as part of our wider teen growth plan, combined with our Parent of Teen campaign; and to help give teens critical influence in the parent decision by driving peer word-of-mouth.\nMore recently, we launched the Invisalign Go Express system, the latest addition to the Invisalign Go portfolio for general dentists. First launched in EMEA in 2016 as a 20-stage aligner treatment offering, the Invisalign Go portfolio system is designed for general dentists to treat mild to moderate malocclusions and to integrate tooth alignment into restorative and comprehensive dental care. Additionally, building of our European manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland remains on track to go live this quarter, increasing our flexibility and timeliness in supporting our valued doctor customers across the EMEA region.\nTurning to APAC for Q1. APAC Invisalign case volumes were up 4.7% year-over-year with strength in the GP dentist channel, primarily through increased Invisalign submissions with the Invisalign Go product and, in the teen market with increased submissions from the orthodontic channel.\nOn a sequential basis, APAC was down 2.6%, reflecting a larger impact from surges in new COVID-19 cases that led to significant lockdowns in China. Alternatively, despite headwinds, Japan and Taiwan performed well and we had strong growth in emerging markets like Korea and India and Thailand on a year-over-year basis.\nEarlier this month, we expanded the Invisalign Clear Aligner product portfolio with new offerings that better serve the expanding market in China. The 2 new products, Invisalign Adult and Invisalign Standard clear aligners are designed for more specific types of malocclusion cases and private (sic) [provide] doctors and their patients with a more clinical and affordable options for moderate to complex cases. Invisalign Adult and Invisalign Standard clear aligners built on our proven technology for a wider range and scope of malocclusion.\nDuring the quarter, we announced new Invisalign innovations for the Align Digital Platform, a proprietary combination of software, systems and services designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients and consumers. These new Invisalign innovations include ClinCheck Live Update, the Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personalized Plan or IPP, Invisalign Smile Architect and the Cone Beam Computed Tomography, CBCT, integration feature for ClinCheck digital treatment planning software.\nThese innovations will revolutionize digital treatment planning for orthodontics and restorative dentistry by providing doctors with greater flexibility and real-time treatment plan access and modification capabilities. Each of these innovations is designed to enhance Invisalign treatment planning quality, efficiency and scale and contribute to a better doctor-patient experience.\nMore recently, we introduced a new enhancement for the Invisalign system with mandibular advancement feature. The Invisalign system with mandibular advancement is the only clinically proven clear aligner product in the world today that addresses Class II correction with simultaneous alignment. Using feedback from customers, we've enhanced the original design with new enhanced precision wings that provide increased durability and comfort as well as great overlap to help ensure that the aligners remain seated and properly engaged to more effectively address Class II malocclusions in growing preteen and teen patients.\nOur consumer marketing focuses on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to Invisalign doctors' offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. In Q1, we built on a successful Invis Is multimedia campaign across the Americas, EMEA and APAC, driving awareness and interest in Invisalign treatment with adult, teen and parent consumer segments. Globally, we delivered strong impression volume with over 23.7 million visits to our websites, 113% year-over-year increase and over 7.8 billion impressions delivered, representing a 32% year-over-year increase.\nIn the U.S., we continue to amplify our campaigns across the top social platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube to increase the awareness of Invisalign brand with young adults and teens. Our campaigns featured collaborations with some of the largest influencers in social media, including Charli D'Amelio, Lana Candor, Devan Key, Michael Le and Josh Richards. Each of these creators shared their personal experience with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smiles with Invisalign aligners.\nTo continue growing our young adult business across the Americas, EMEA and APAC, we built upon our successful \"Invis is a Powerful Thing\" campaign, which highlights how powerful the smile transformation with Invisalign treatment can be for even young adults' self-confidence. We leveraged top influencers like Leilani Green and Lana Candor in integrated media campaigns. Further, we are expanding our collaboration with influencers globally and are excited to welcome Olympic Gold Medalist, Suni Lee, and creators Josh Richards, Hyram Yarbro and Scarlett Estevez who have chosen to shape their smiles with Invisalign treatment.\nIn the EMEA region, we accelerated our media investments across digital media platforms, including YouTube, TikTok, Meta and Snapchat and expanded our Invisalign Smile Squad roster with new influencers. Additionally, we launched a pilot in the U.K. to reach teens with special campaigns to create awareness of the unique benefits of Invisalign treatment. Our consumer campaigns delivered more than 8.8 million unique visitors to our website, representing 170% increase year-over-year with over 2.5 billion media impressions.\nWe continue to expand our investment in consumer advertising across the APAC region, excluding China, resulting in a 278% increase year-over-year in unique visitors and a 265% year-over-year increase in impressions. We continued to strengthen our investments in Australia by expanding our reach via social media platforms such as TikTok, Meta and YouTube. In Japan, we built upon our successful consumer campaigns by expanding into Twitter and continue to see strong response from consumers, as evidenced by a 373% increase in unique visitors to our site.\nFor our Systems and Services business, Q1 revenues were up 15.6% year-over-year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services; and down 24.2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower volumes from the previous mentioned headwinds and capital equipment seasonality.\nDuring the quarter, we saw continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system we launched last year that features innovative technology like Near Infra-Red technology that we call NIRI, which aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities without -- above the gingiva without harmful radiation.\nA strong indicator of the digital adoption within dental offices is the number of intraoral scans used for Invisalign case submissions. Total worldwide intraoral digital scans submitted to start an Invisalign case in Q1 increased to 87.1% from 80.9% in Q1 last year. International intraoral digital scans for Invisalign case submissions increased to 83%, up from 75% in Q1 last year.\nFor the Americas, 91% of Invisalign cases were submitted using an intraoral digital scan compared to 85.5% in Q1 of last year. Cumulatively, over 54.9 million orthodontic scans and over 11.4 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners.\nDuring the quarter, the iTero Element 5D Plus won the Best New Imaging or CAD/CAM Product from DrBicuspid.com, a Cuspie award. The award reflects our commitment to develop innovative solutions that help doctors transform lives by improving patients' journey to a healthy, beautiful smile. We are pleased to share that the iTero Element scanner received an Orthotown 2021 Townie Choice Award, which seeks to recognize the top peer-recommended products and services in dentistry. We're proud that the iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system provides dental practices with latest in imaging technology, cutting-edge enhanced chairside visualizations and applications that can drive practice growth and treatment acceptance.\nContinued growth in the iTero scanner installed base is driving increased services revenues as well as exocad CAD/CAM software solutions that integrate workflows to the dental labs and dental practices.\nOur Q1 exocad CAD/CAM products and services, which include restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design offerings, are included in Scanner and Services revenues and are helping extend our digital dental solutions and broaden Align Digital Platform towards fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows.\nAs we continue to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, our goal is to make orthodontics a pillar of dentistry. April 2 marked our second anniversary since welcoming exocad into the Align family. And together, we're working to ensure that every dental technician and every dentist planning a restorative treatment considers the benefits of digital orthodontics first. We're continuing to focus on integration and road map development to strengthen the Align Digital Platform by addressing restorative needs to facilitate both ortho restorative and comprehensive dentistry.\nTwo years after exocad joined Align, we are more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead to shape the dental industry and with technology and expertise that complement the many benefits of the Align Digital Platform and bringing all key stakeholders together, doctor, customers, labs, partners and users as we continue transforming smiles and changing lives.\nDuring the quarter, exocad participated in the 2022 Dental South China show in Guangzhou, China, showcasing its newest software release, DentalCAD 3.0 Galway plus other open software solutions like innovative smile design program called Smile Creator. The show allowed the exocad team to deepen their relationships with the dental community to discover new trends emerging in the growing dental market in China. Attendees at booth experienced firsthand how exocad's wizard-guided workflows and easy online communication programs streamline the treatment journey from consultation to final restoration.\nFinally, this quarter, exocad is opening its new headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, which provides a robust high-tech infrastructure to a key region of our business. exocad has been working with a growing number of Korean manufacturers for many years, and this location help facilitate strategic relationships in the region.\nWith that, I'll now turn over the call to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nCFO & Executive VP of Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q1 financial results. Total revenues for the first quarter were $973.2 million, down 5.6% from the prior quarter and up 8.8% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q1 revenues of $809.7 million were down 0.7% sequentially due to lower Invisalign case volumes, partially offset by higher ASPs and up 7.5% year-over-year, reflecting higher ASPs and non-case revenues.\nIn Q1, Invisalign case volume were down 5.1% sequentially and up 0.5% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped Clear Aligners to 82,400 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which over 5,000 were first-time customers. Q1 comprehensive volume increased 2.4% year-over-year and decreased 5% sequentially. Q1 non-comprehensive volume decreased 4% year-over-year and decreased 5.4% sequentially. Q1 adult patients decreased 1.6% year-over-year and decreased 5.7% sequentially. In Q1, teens or younger patients increased 6% year-over-year and decreased 3.6% sequentially.\nClear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $6.5 million or approximately 0.8 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $24 million or approximately 3.2 points.\nFor Q1, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect per order processing fees charged on most Clear Aligner shipments, lower discounts and higher additional aligners, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners and per order processing fees, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.\nQ1 Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs were favorably impacted by per order processing fees and lower discounts, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. On a year-over-year basis, Invisalign non-comprehensive ASPs reflect per order processing fees, higher additional aligners, partially offset by foreign exchange.\nClear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $53 million or 5% sequentially and $307.1 million or 38.1% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.\nOur Systems and Services revenue for the first quarter were $163.5 million, down 24.2% sequentially and up 15.6% year-over-year. The decrease sequentially can be attributed to lower scanner volume following a strong Q4 and consistent with seasonality in the capital equipment business, coupled with the headwinds described earlier. The increase year-over-year can be attributed to increased services revenue from our larger installed base as well as slightly higher scanner volume.\nOur Systems and Services deferred revenues on the balance sheet was up $16.5 million or 7.2% sequentially and up $114.9 million or 87.6% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferral of service revenue included with our -- with the scanner purchase, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.\nMoving on to gross margin. First quarter overall gross margin was 72.9%, up 0.7 points sequentially and down 2.8 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, overall gross margin was 73.3% for the first quarter, up 0.7 points sequentially and down 2.8 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points on a year-over-year basis and by approximately 0.2 points sequentially due to foreign exchange.\nClear Aligner gross margin for the first quarter was 74.8%, up 0.6 points sequentially due to higher ASPs, partially offset by higher mix of additional aligner volume and higher freight costs. Clear Aligner gross margin was down 2.8 points year-over-year due to higher mix of additional aligner volume and higher freight costs, partially offset by higher ASPs.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the first quarter was 63.4%, down 1.3 points sequentially due to lower volume and lower ASPs, partially offset by lower freight costs. Systems and Services gross margin was down 2 points year-over-year due to higher manufacturing inefficiencies, partially offset by a higher mix of service revenues and increased ASPs.\nQ1 operating expenses were $511.3 million, down sequentially 2.4% and up 13.2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down $12.4 million. Year-over-year, operating expenses increased by $59.6 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing, sales and R&D activities and investments commensurate with business growth.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating expenses were $480.2 million, down sequentially 2.9% and up 13.1% year-over-year due to the reasons described above.\nOur first quarter operating income of $198.1 million resulted in an operating margin of 20.4%, down 1.1 points sequentially and down 4.8 points year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin is primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions and acquisition costs, operating margin for the first quarter was 24%, down 0.7 points sequentially and down 4.6 points year-over-year.\nInterest and other income and expense, net for the first quarter, was a loss of $10.6 million, down sequentially by $9.7 million and down year-over-year by $46.8 million. Q1 of 2021 included the SEC arbitration award gain of $43.4 million.\nThe GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 13.2% in the fourth quarter and 23.4% in the first quarter of the prior year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.2% in the first quarter compared to 11.5% in the fourth quarter and 20.2% in the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were higher than fourth quarter effective tax rates, primarily due to tax benefits related to expiration of statutes of limitations for timely asserting claims and an out-of-period adjustment recorded last quarter.\nFirst quarter net income per diluted share was $1.70, down sequentially $0.70 and down $0.81 compared to the prior year. Our EPS was unfavorably impacted by $0.13 on a sequential basis and $0.28 on a year-over-year basis due to foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.13 for the first quarter, down $0.70 sequentially and down $0.36 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of March 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.1 billion, down sequentially $176.1 million and down $11.1 million year-over-year. Of our $1.1 billion balance, $453 million was held in the U.S. and $667.6 million was held by our international entities.\nQ1 accounts receivable balance was $950.9 million, up approximately 6% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 87 days, up approximately 9 days sequentially and up approximately 15 days as compared to Q1 last year. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $30.5 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $87.3 million, primarily related to our continued investment to increase aligner manufacturing capacity and facilities.\nFree cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to negative $56.8 million. In February, we repurchased $75 million of our common stock through open market repurchases of approximately 143,600 shares at an average price of $522.61 per share. We have approximately $650 million remaining available for repurchase under our May 13, 2021, $1 billion repurchase program.\nAs described during our Q4 2021 earnings call, we provided our fiscal year 2022 outlook with revenue growth in line with our long-term revenue range of 20% to 30%. This revenue growth assumed no significant new COVID surges after current wave, no meaningful practice disruption nor material supply chain issues throughout the year.\nAt that time, we were seeing some recovery as Omicron headwinds began to ease and COVID restrictions were relaxing. However, later in the quarter, unfavorable impacts on our business occurred, driven by China lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. For April, we have not seen momentum return as the headwinds previously mentioned persist.\nNow turning to full year 2022. We remain confident in the huge under-penetrated market, our technology and industry leadership and our ability to execute and make progress toward our long-term model of 20% to 30% revenue growth. At the same time, the headwinds we're experiencing, which include increased COVID waves and significant China lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflation pressures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have increased uncertainty across all markets. We also anticipate capital equipment sales will be increasingly constrained throughout the year as practices adjust to these headwinds.\nGiven less visibility and an increasing unpredictable operating environment, we are not providing revenue guidance for the year. However, assuming no additional material disruptions or circumstances beyond our control, our goal for fiscal 2022 is to deliver GAAP operating margin above 20%, while making strategic investments in sales, marketing, R&D and operations.\nIn addition, during Q2 '22, we expect to repurchase up to $200 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement.\nFor 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $300 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as digital manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our investment in an aligner fabrication facility in Wroclaw, Poland, which is expected to begin serving doctors in the second quarter of 2022 as part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers.\nAs we continue growing, we intend to expand our investments in research and development, manufacturing, treatment planning, sales and marketing operations to meet the actual and anticipated local and regional demands.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nExcuse me. Joe Hogan, are you there?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. I'll run by this again. Okay. That was my fault. Overall, our first quarter results reflect a more challenging environment than expected. We know that COVID lockdowns, weaker consumer confidence, inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have created headwinds. But we remain excited and committed to realizing the enormous opportunity in front of us to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry.\nWith less than 10% share of the 21 million orthodontic case starts each year with over 500 million people globally who can benefit from a healthy, beautiful smile, our market is as large as ever. No other company is as well positioned as us to take advantage of that potential as the environment improves and growth trends return.\nWe will continue to focus on the execution of our strategic growth drivers while managing investments in the near term to account for the headwinds and uncertainty, and we remain confident in our long-term revenue growth model of 20% to 30%.\nBefore we open the call to questions, I want to address the military conflict in the Ukraine and our operations in Russia. It's a human tragedy for all people involved, and our thoughts go out to everyone impacted and especially to those with personal connections who are undoubtedly concerned with their families and loved ones. Our primary concern remains the safety and security of our employees and their families, our doctors, their staff and patients. We have nothing to do with this conflict.\nAs a global medical device provider of doctor-prescribed products, continuity of care is critical to the doctors and their patients in orthodontic treatment. We discontinued commercial activities in Russia that are not essential to providing continuity of care to patients. Our focus on only essential activities is consistent with our values and ethical responsibility to patients in treatment.\nIn the process, we're also adhering to the international sanctions that have been imposed. Our IT infrastructure, including code and intellectual property, is hosted outside of Russia. Prior to the conflict, we had begun expanding our R&D teams in Darmstadt, Germany; Madrid, Spain; Toronto, Canada and Austin, Texas. And we're prudently working with the team on the ground in Russia on work visas.\nA number of our Russian employees have already transitioned and are in various stages of transitioning their families to Armenia, where we've set up an R&D center in Yerevan to support those who choose to relocate. At the same time, it's humbling to see the tremendous outpouring of kindness and support throughout the company as our employees respond to the humanitarian needs of the crisis.\nOur Polish team members has set up donation centers at our facilities where employees are contributing food, clothing, supplies and human care. Many are also taking Ukrainian refugees into their homes. And we're proud of the tremendous initiative by our colleagues and are grateful for their actions.\nIn addition to our employees' efforts, Align is donating $300,000 to support humanitarian relief efforts through organizations providing shelter, food, medicines and vital supplies. We can only hope that the conflict in Ukraine will end soon, that the ongoing impact of the pandemic will lessen for good and that economic factors facing many customers and consumers will abate. But these things are beyond our control, so we will continue to prioritize the health and safety of employees, customers and patients and will stay focused on strategic initiatives.\nIn closing, April 3 marked the 25th anniversary of the founding of Align Technology and, shortly thereafter, the launch of the Invisalign system. Over the past 25 years, we've transformed the orthodontic industry with a passion for innovation as we've evolved from leading the evolution from digital appliances to digital platform. We've created an incredible company unlike any other.\nInvisalign is a unique mass customization business operating in real time with no inventory or distribution at the front end of our market. Consequently, fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment are felt faster at Align than I've ever experienced anywhere in my career. And we monitor these trends to make adjustments in our business when needed. Our success is a result of our vision and purpose and resolve.\nThanks to our employees and our doctor customers around the world who took a chance on a Silicon Valley startup and risked everything. Today, Align is the largest 3D printing operation in the world, producing 1 million customized aligners each day based on the learnings gained from nearly 13 million Invisalign patients and 60 million iTero digital scans. Our global team of over 25,000 employees support more than 250,000 doctors and labs in more than 150 countries.\nThere are more than 500 million people in the world that can benefit from orthodontic procedures. It's huge. And you can only address opportunities of that size with digital orthodontics. It could never happen using old analog methods. As we have digitized that capability, it has opened up a market broadly for orthodontic treatment to the masses.\nIt's hard to believe that after 25 years, we're still in the early phases of transforming the orthodontic market. We look forward to sharing more milestones over the next 25 years as we continue to lead the digital evolution of orthodontics and dentistry, deliver great treatment outcomes and treatment experiences to doctors and patients around the world.\nThank you for your time today. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator?",

Please refer to these files for more detailed information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Align Technology's President and CEO, Joe Hogan. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Shirley. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter, then briefly discuss the performance of our 2 operating segments, Services Systems and Clear Aligners. John will provide more detail on our financial results and discuss our outlook. Following that, I'll come back and summarize a few key points and open the call to questions.\nOverall, I'm very pleased to report fourth quarter results and another record year -- full year for Align. Net revenues of $4 billion and operating margin of 24.7% were both at the high end of our guidance for fiscal 2021. For Systems and Services, full year revenues increased 90.4% over the prior year to a record $705.5 million. For Clear Aligners, full year revenues increased 54.5% over the prior year to a record $3.2 billion.\nDuring 2021, we achieved several major installed base milestones, including our 12 millionth Invisalign patient, 68,000 iTero scanners sold and 47,000 exocad software license install. Together, these elements are the foundation of the Align Digital platform. Proprietary combination of software, systems and services designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients and consumers.\nFor Q4, revenues reflect continued strong growth and momentum from iTero scanner services revenues, particularly in North America, offset by lower-than-expected Invisalign Clear Aligner revenues. Through most of the fourth quarter, our Clear Aligner volumes were trending in line with our Q4 seasonality. However, the environment quickly changed in December with the rise of COVID-19 Omicron variant. We believe our Q4 Clear Aligners volumes were impacted by an increase in COVID-19 Omicron cases that cause customer lab shortages from a staff standpoint, practice closures or reduced hours and less patient traffic in December and that continued into Q1.\nThis compounded an already slower seasonal period for many practices in which offices took time off in between the holidays. We estimate that our Q4 was negatively impacted by roughly 3 points of year-over-year revenue growth as a result of these factors.\nWhile there are some similarities to what we experienced 2 years ago when COVID-19 first appeared, especially in China, which currently has a 0 tolerance COVID policy. The environment today is total -- today is different. There aren't broad government-mandated shutdowns, stay-at-home orders or extended quarantines, but there is more consumer caution, self-imposed quarantines, higher inflation, less economic stimulus and supply chain shortages, which makes it more difficult to predict when recovery may occur. Nonetheless, Invisalign doctor submitters and case submissions are improving. We're working closely with our customers to support their needs and protect the health and safety of our employees.\nFor Q4, Systems and Services revenues were up 61.3% year-over-year and up 21% sequentially, with strong revenue growth across all regions. Q4 results reflect the continued adoption of the iTero Element 5D imaging system, which we launched last year and that features innovative technology like near infrared technology with age and detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions or cavities above the gingiva without harmful radiation.\nThe iTero Element 5D us imaging system represents 75% of iTero volumes in Q4. In addition, over 50% of iTero scanner sales in Q4 were sold to first-time scanner buyers who are just beginning their Align Digital Platform journey. We also continue to see growth in our iTero scanner installed base with strong service revenues, which historically have been a leading indicator of increased digital adoption among doctors.\nFor Q4, Clear Aligners revenues were up 16.3% year-over-year with strong revenue growth across all regions and across the portfolio, including comprehensive and noncomprehensive products as well as Invisalign First, Invisalign Moderate and Invisalign Gold products.\nOur fourth quarter revenues also include non-case revenue for clinical training and education, doctor prescribed retainer products and other dental consumables. During the quarter, we saw good performance from our retainer business overall, delivering strong revenue growth, along with increased enthusiasm for the doctor subscription program pilot in North America.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, our share of the retention market is significantly underpenetrated even more so than our share of the orthodontic case starts. We have been developing a robust retainer strategy, including a separate marketing team, focused solely on driving adoption and increasing market share in the U.S.\nOur objective is to build brand awareness for Vivera retainers and drive engagement with doctors through clinical education and sales initiatives while connecting consumers to doctors through demand creation programs and our concierge service. We've also recently implemented social media campaigns featuring the benefit of Vivera from the makers of Invisalign Clear Aligners. We believe that incremental investments will increase value for Invisalign practices and contribute to growth consistent with our long-term financial model target.\nQ4 non-case revenues also include accessories and consumables such as Aligner cases, clamshells, cleaning crystals, Invisalign Whitening Pen and other oral health products that are available on our e-commerce channel, including the Invisalign accessory store, walmart.com and amazon.com. We view these ancillary products as a natural brand extension, enabling patient and doctor behavior with the power and the Invisalign brand.\nOur full year results reflect continued adoption and demand for both the Invisalign system and iTero systems and services and exocad CAD/CAM software as more doctors transform their practices to digital and more consumers need to transform their smiles through doctor-directed Invisalign treatment.\nNow let's turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter results, starting with the Americas. For the Americas region, full year 2021 Invisalign case volumes were up 57.6%. For Q4, Invisalign case volumes were up 11.5% year-over-year, reflecting growth across the region, especially in LatAm. On a sequential basis, American shipments were down 7.9%, primarily reflecting the impact of Omicron previously described as well as a seasonally slower teen season from Q3 to Q4. We also saw higher GP and adult case volume and continued momentum from our doctor subscription plan pilot.\nIn Q4, we pledged a $1 million donation to the American Association of Orthodontists Foundation, the charitable arm of the American Association of Orthodontists in support of the science of orthodontics. We're also investing in education grants, programs to provide universities with greater access to all line products for education and training purposes. Through these programs, our partnership with the aligner intensive fellowship and the other in-person educational programs, we are investing in the orthodontic profession through the people who care for and treat patients directly.\nFor Systems and Services, Q4 was a strong quarter for Americas, driven by continued adoption of iTero 5D Plus imaging system across customer channels, including our DSO partners. Services revenues continue to grow nicely, reflecting the growth of the iTero scanner installed base in North America.\nFor the full year, international Invisalign case volume was up 51.6%. For our international business, Q4 Invisalign case volumes were up 10.7% year-over-year on tough comps compared to 2020. On a sequential basis, international shipments were up 1.7%. Notwithstanding the impact of Omicron in December, we still saw strong growth in EMEA, offset somewhat by a seasonally slower period primarily in China.\nFor the full year, EMEA Invisalign volume was up 69.5%. For EMEA, Q4 Invisalign case volumes were up 14.9% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across all markets, led by Italy and Iberia, along with continued growth in our expansion markets in Turkey, Russia, CIS and Benelux. For Q4, year-over-year Invisalign case volume in EMEA was driven by increased submissions primarily from the orthodontist channel. On a sequential basis, despite the impact of Omicron, EMEA Invisalign case volume was up 13.6%, primarily as a result of strong ortho channel performance especially in the teen market.\nDuring Q4, we began commercial operation in Africa, with our initial focus on North Africa and then plan to enter Sub-Sahara Africa and South Africa this year further broadening our expansion markets in EMEA. It's exciting opportunity for Align in this untapped and expanding totally addressable market. We're also making great progress on building our Europe and manufacturing facility in Poland, which will be our third global aligner manufacturing operation.\nThe Europe manufacturing facility is on track to go live during the first half of 2022, further increasing our ability to efficiently provide the Invisalign system to our valued doctor customers within the European region.\nFor Q4, we saw strong scanner shipments during the quarter as more doctors in the EMEA region continue to digitize their practices. Through a full year APAC, Invisalign case volume was up 27.1%. For Q4, APAC Invisalign case volumes led by Japan, Korea and India were up 3.4% year-over-year on tough comps despite continued COVID resurgences and lockdown sporadically impacting various APAC countries, including China.\nWe also saw strength in the GP dentist channel with increased Invisalign submitters and in the teen market with increased submissions from the orthodontic channel. On a sequential basis, APAC was down 15.4% notwithstanding the impact of Omicron in December and Q4 seasonality in China. We had strong growth in Thailand, Southeast Asia, Taiwan. Overall, it was encouraging to see record numbers of shipments to those markets in APAC and that were not as impacted by the most severe lockdowns.\nIn Q4, Systems and Services in APAC saw the highest percentage of iTero scanners sold to new doctors. Today, we announced new Invisalign Systems innovations for the Align Digital platform, a proprietary combination of software, systems and services, designed to provide a seamless experience and workflow that integrates and connects all users, doctors, labs, patients and consumers.\nThese new innovations include ClinCheck live update for 3D controls; the Invisalign practice app; Invisalign Personalized Plan, or IPP; and the Invisalign Smile Architect. We believe they will revolutionize digital treatment planning for orthodontics and restorative dentistry by providing doctors with greater flexibility, consistency of treatment preferences and real-time treatment planning access and modification capabilities. Each of these innovations is designed to enhance Invisalign treatment planning quality, efficiency and scale and contribute to better doctor patient engagement and treatment outcomes.\nClinCheck live update for 3D controls enables real-time ClinCheck treatment plan modifications that improve practice productivity significantly while also improving quality of treatment plans. Invisalign practice app provides mobile integration with the Invisalign Doctor Cider IDS. It enables doctors to manage their practices at their fingertips.\nInvisalign's personal plan, or IPP, automatically applies the doctor's specific treatment preferences for comprehensive cases, enhancing efficiency and step changing treatment planning consistency. Invisalign Smile architect software is designed for GP dentists to create and visualize orthodontic restorative treatment plans for their patients using iTero digital scans and wide smile photos on the Invisalign Go platform. The technical design assessment go-to-market is scheduled for Q4 '22.\nWe know that every Invisalign train doctor has distinct preferences. Every patient is unique and every treatment plan can vary depending on a variety of factors such as the type of malocclusion, patient age and desired outcome. Because of that, doctors spend time planning and reviewing and modifying their ClinCheck plans and it multiplies with practice growth.\nIPP and ClinCheck live update for 3D controls are game-changing innovations that represent a step change in digital treatment planning to help doctors achieve more personalized ClinCheck treatment plans. By using 3D controls, doctors can see greater efficiency with changes reflected in real time.\nInvisalign Smile Architect combines basically driven in ortho restorative treatment planning within the power of ClinCheck software, providing flexibility across treatment planning to address a variety of patient needs, whether it may be orthodontic, restorative or ortho restorative combined. It allows doctors to share their vision with patients and use digital technology and tools to achieve the best quality clinical outcomes for their patients.\nIt's through the convergence of advancements in digital technology, Align's unique capabilities and know-how, and data from millions of Invisalign patients that were able to bring these new Invisalign innovations to our customers this year. The journey to deliver a ClinCheck live update in Invisalign Personal Plan has taken thousands of combined person years of development, testing and learning. It is only possible through the experience data and insights we have gained from over 12 million Invisalign cases.\nAcross our innovations, we're also using a combination of AI and automation to reimagine what the treatment planning experience looks like for our doctors, doctor customers and augmenting their expertise and experience to help them create and personalize and modify Invisalign treatment plans more efficiently and more consistently than ever before. What used to take several days can now be accomplished in just a few minutes, and it's a huge productivity win for doctors and their patients.\nOur consumer marketing is focused on educating consumers about the Invisalign system and driving that demand to Invisalign doctors offices, ultimately capitalizing on the massive market opportunity to transform 500 million smiles. Consumer interest in the Invisalign brand remains high, and we are continuing to invest in building the brand in key markets and customer segments. This includes investments in social media as an effective channel to increase awareness and interest for Invisalign treatment. We're continuing to work closely with our media partners to reach consumers with the right creative and compelling campaigns, optimize our buys and test new approaches.\nIn Q4, we continued to build on our successful \"Invis is\" multimedia campaign across the Americas, EMEA and APAC and drove awareness and interest in Invisalign treatment with adult teen and parent consumer segments. Globally, we delivered record impression volume with over 8 billion impressions, representing 84% year-over-year growth and 21.7 million unique visitors to our website, a 127% increase year-over-year.\nIn the U.S., we amplified our campaigns across the top social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube to increase awareness with teens about Invisalign treatment. Our campaigns continue to feature some of the largest teen influencers from our Invisalign Smile Squad, such as Collins, Devon Key, Charlie Dimelo and Michael Lay, each of whom share their personal experiences with Invisalign treatment and why they chose to transform their smiles with Invisalign aligners.\nOur consumer marketing programs also include connecting with teams within gaming, specifically on Twitch, with a customized integration that was awarded the gold medal in the Annual Internationalist Awards for innovation in digital marketing solutions.\nTo continue growing our young adult business across the Americas, EMEA and APAC, we built upon our successful \"Invis is\" a powerful think campaign, which highlights the power of Invisalign treatment transformation for every young adult self confidence. Our integrated media plans across YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok connected with young adults in the media channels they consume the most. In Brazil, we continue to amplify our \"Invis Is\" powerful thing campaign, featuring mega influencer, Tai, driving a 400% year-over-year increase in web traffic.\nIn the EMEA region, we successfully expanded into new markets such as Italy in the Netherlands. To complement our integrated media plan with Google and YouTube, we also leverage newer media channels such as TikTok and Snapchat to drive engagement with consumers resulting in more than 170% year-over-year increase in unique visitors. We continue to expand our investment in consumer advertising across the APAC region, resulting in a 192% year-over-year increase in unique visitors and a 235% year-over-year increase in impressions.\nWe continue to strengthen our investments in Australia leveraging leading influencers featured in premium placements in TikTok and also YouTube. In Japan, we continue to see strong response from consumers as evidenced by 117% year-over-year increase in unique visitors.\nLastly, we expanded our advertising investments in India and Taiwan, which generated a strong consumer response. We saw 1,200% and 628% increase in impressions and a 470% and 116% increase in unique visitors to our website in India and Taiwan, respectively.\nAdoption of our consumer and patient app, my Invisalign continued to increase with 1.4 million downloads to date. Usage of our 4 digital tools continues to increase. For example, in addition to my Invisalign just mentioned, the Invisalign virtual appointment tool was used over 14,000x and our insurance verification feature was used 20,000x in Q4.\nFurther, globally, we received more than 45,000 patient photos in our virtual care feature globally, which continues to provide us with rich data to leverage our AI capabilities and improve our services for doctors and patients.\nOur Systems and Services business, Q4 revenues grew 61.3% year-over-year, reflecting strong scanner shipments and services up 21% sequentially. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for our Systems and Services business. And I as mentioned earlier, over 50% of scanner sales in Q4 were the first time iTero scanner buyers. We're pleased to see doctors continue to go digital and invest in the Align digital platform.\nThe iTero Element 5D imaging system continued to gain traction across all regions with the most recent launch in China during Q4. The series expands the portfolio of iTero Element scanners and imaging systems to include new solutions that more broadly serve the needs of doctors and patients in the dental market.\nA strong indicator of digital acceleration within the dental offices is a number of intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions. Total worldwide inter-oral digital scan submitted to start an Invisalign case in Q4 increased to 85.4% from 79.3% in Q4 last year. International inter-oral digital scans for Invisalign case submissions increased 80.8%, up from 73.7% in the same quarter last year.\nFor the Americas, 89.1% of Invisalign cases were submitted using an inter-oral digital scan compared to 84% in the same quarter last year. Cumulatively, over 50 million orthodontic scans and 10.3 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners. With continued growth of the iTero scanner at 68,000 scanners sold worldwide as of Q4, approximately 30% is services revenue, which includes reoccurring revenue subscriptions, CAT scan software and ancillary products.\nAnd we continue to make improvements in our scanner and imaging systems, making iTero systems and service as an integral part of orthodontic and GP dentist workflow. For example, we streamlined the Invisalign case submission process with the iTero Element 5D imaging systems auto upload functionality.\nTurning to exocad. For Q4 Systems and Services, revenues also include exocad CAD/CAM products and services. exocad's expertise in restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design extends our digital dental solutions and broadens Align's digital platform towards a fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows.\nCumulatively, as Q4 exocad now has over 47,000 software license worldwide. During the quarter, exocad announced the release of chairside CAD 3.0 Galway. It's a next generation of easy-to-use CAD software for single-visit dentistry. With this new release, exocad offers dentist design tools for a vast range of indications with a wide choice of integrated devices.\nAlso during the quarter, exocad announced the availability of chairside CAD 3.0 Galway software in the U.S. and Canada, where the software is now available in North America, EU and other selected markets. Exocad chairside CAD is groundbreaking open architecture CAD software for single-visit dentistry. It received the 2021 Celera best-of-class technology award from Seller & Consulting Group during the quarter as well. This is the third consecutive year that cure side CAD has been recognized for this award.\nWith that, I'll now turn this over to John.\n\nJohn F. Morici\n\nCFO & Senior VP of Global Finance, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, Joe. Now for our Q4 financial results.\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.31 billion, up 1.5% from the prior quarter and up 23.6% from the corresponding quarter a year ago. For Clear Aligners, Q4 revenues of $815.3 million were down 2.7% sequentially due to lower Invisalign volumes, partially offset by slightly higher ASPs and up 16.3% year-over-year, reflecting Invisalign volume growth across all geographies and higher ASPs.\nIn Q4, we shipped 631,100 Invisalign cases, a decrease of 3.7% sequentially, an increase of 11.1% year-over-year. In addition, we shipped to 83,500 Invisalign doctors worldwide, of which over 6,400 were to first-time customers.\nQ4 comprehensive volume increased 13.1% year-over-year and decreased 4.5% sequentially. And Q4 noncomprehensive volume increased 6.6% year-over-year and decreased 1.7% sequentially. Q4 adult patients increased 10.4% year-over-year and increased 0.1% sequentially. In Q4, teens or younger patients increased 13% year-over-year and decreased 11.8% sequentially.\nClear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $11.4 million or approximately 1.4 points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, Clear Aligner revenues were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of approximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.2 points.\nFor Q4, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs increased sequentially and year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional liners, partially off by unfavorable foreign exchange and higher discounts. On a year-over-year basis, comprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional aligners, partially offset by higher discounts.\nQ4 Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs decreased sequentially and increased year-over-year. On a sequential basis, Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange, partially offset by higher additional aligners.\nOn a year-over-year basis, Invisalign noncomprehensive ASPs reflect higher additional liners and product mix, partially offset by higher discounts.\nClear Aligner deferred revenues on the balance sheet increased $68.5 million or 6.9% sequentially and $332.9 million or 45.8% year-over-year and will be recognized as the additional aligners are shipped.\nOur Systems and Services revenues for the fourth quarter were a record $215.8 million, up 21% sequentially and up 61.3% year-over-year. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. The increase sequentially can be attributed to increased scanner shipments and increased service revenues from our larger installed base.\nThe increase year-over-year can be attributed to increased scanner shipments, increased service revenues from our larger installed base as well as higher ASPs from the favorable mix shift towards higher-priced iTero 5D scanners and imaging systems.\nOur Systems and Services deferred revenue on the balance sheet was up $42.6 million or 22.8% sequentially and up $116.2 million or 102.6% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in scanner sales and the deferred -- and the deferral of services revenues, which will be recognized ratably over the service period.\nMoving on to gross margin. Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 72.2%, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 0.9 points year-over-year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, overall, gross margin was 72.6% for the fourth quarter, down 2.1 points sequentially and down 0.9 points year-over-year. Overall gross margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.1 points on a year-over-year basis and by approximately 0.4% sequentially due to foreign exchange.\nClear Aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74.2%, down 2 points sequentially due to higher freight costs and additional aligners, along with lower primary shipments, partially offset by higher ASPs. Clear Aligner gross margin was down 0.6 points year-over-year due to higher additional aligners and higher freight costs, partially offset by higher ASPs and improved manufacturing absorption due to higher volumes.\nSystems and Services gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64.7%, down 0.9 points sequentially, primarily due to higher freight costs and increased component costs, partially offset by higher ASP from 5D plus mix and higher service revenues. Systems and Services gross margin was up 0.4 points year-over-year due to higher ASP from higher mix of iTero 5D plus and higher service revenues, partially offset by higher freight costs and increased component costs.\nWe are actively engaged in activities to mitigate supply disruptions by expanding supplier communications, modifying our purchase order coverage and increasing inventory levels for key components. Q4 operating expenses were $523.7 million, up sequentially 6% and up 31.8% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up by $29.7 million. Year-over-year operating expenses increased by $126.4 million, reflecting increased headcount and our continued investment in marketing, sales, in R&D activities and other investments commensurate with business growth.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating expenses were $494.4 million, up sequentially 6.1% and up 32.8% year-over-year due to the reasons described earlier.\nOur fourth quarter operating income of $220.9 million resulted in an operating margin of 21.4%, down 4.3 points sequentially and down 4.1 points year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year decreases in operating margin are primarily attributed to lower gross margin, investments in our go-to-market teams and technology as well as unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles related to certain acquisitions, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 24.7%, down 4.1 points sequentially and down 4.3 points year-over-year.\nInterest and other income and expense net for the fourth quarter was a loss of $0.9 million, down sequentially by $1.7 million and down year-over-year by $2.2 million. The GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 13.2% compared to 30.9% in the third quarter and 25.9% in the fourth quarter of the prior year.\nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.5% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.2% in the third quarter and 14.5% in the fourth quarter of the prior fourth quarter. The fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates reflected an out-of-period adjustment, which reduced our tax rate by 7.3% and 6.3%, respectively.\nFourth quarter net income per diluted share was $2.40, up sequentially $0.12 and up $0.40 compared to the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $2.83 for the fourth quarter, down $0.04 sequentially and up $0.22 year-over-year. For the full year, net income per diluted share was $9.69, down $12.72 year-over-year due to the onetime tax benefit in 2020 of approximately $1.5 billion associated with our corporate structure reorganization completed during the first quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, net income per diluted share was $11.22 for the full year, up $5.97 year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities were $1.3 billion, up sequentially $58.8 million and up $335.8 million year-over-year. Of our $1.3 billion balance, $582.9 million was held in the U.S. and $713.8 million was held by our international entities.\nQ4 accounts receivable balance was $897.2 million, up approximately 4.9% sequentially. Our overall days sales outstanding was 78 days, up approximately 3 days sequentially and up approximately 7 days as compared to Q4 last year. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $272.8 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $109.1 million, primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner manufacturing capability -- capacity and facilities.\nFree cash flow, defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, amounted to $163.8 million. In November 2021, we purchased $100 million of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase, which was approximately 0.2 million shares at an average price of $666.53 per share. We have approximately $725 million remaining available for repurchase under our May 13, 2021, $1 billion repurchase program.\nBefore I move to our outlook, I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2021 results. In 2021, we shipped a record 2.5 million Invisalign cases, up 54.8% year-over-year. This reflects 51.6% volume growth from our international doctors and 57.6% volume growth from our Americas doctors.\nTotal revenues were a record $4 billion, up 59.9% year-over-year with Clear Aligner revenues a record $3.2 billion, up 54.5% year-over-year. 2021 Systems and Services revenue were a record $705.5 million compared to $370.5 million in 2020, up 90.4% year-over-year. Full year 2021 GAAP operating income of $976.4 million was up 152.2% versus 2020, and operating margin at 24.7% versus 15.7% in 2020.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, 2021 operating margin was 27.9% versus 20.3% in 2020.\n2021 interest income and other income and expense net of $36 million included the SmileDirectClub arbitration award gain of $43.4 million. Excluding the SmileDirectClub arbitration award gain, interest and other income and expense was $7.4 million expense on a non-GAAP basis.\nWith regards to full year tax provision, our GAAP tax rate was 23.7%. The full year tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 18.5% compared to 17.6% for 2020. 2021 diluted EPS was $9.69. On a non-GAAP basis, 2021 diluted EPS was $11.22. Free cash flow was $771.4 million for 2021, up $264.2 million versus 2020.\nOverall, we are pleased with our Q4 results and another record year for Align. We delivered strong growth and profitability, in line with our guidance despite disruptions late in the quarter from Omicron and others. Our Q4 revenue year-over-year growth was within our long-term model despite disruptions impacting roughly 3 points of growth. We continue to see strong momentum and demand for our Systems and Services throughout Q4, with the majority of scanners being sold to first-time buyers. We believe this is a good leading indicator of future Invisalign growth as our customers continue to invest in digital technology even during COVID.\nLet me turn to our outlook. We would normally expect sequentially higher Invisalign revenues and lower Systems and Services revenue, consistent with the typical Q1 seasonality. However, due to the continued impact of Omicron into Q1, we now expect our total Q1 revenue to be slightly down sequentially. We remain confident in our strategy, our huge underpenetrated market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute. These factors have guided our approach throughout the pandemic, where we continue to invest in new technology, commercial expansion and manufacturing capabilities to drive our growth.\nWe plan to continue these investments in Q1 and therefore, expect our Q1 operating margin to be less than 20%. In addition, during Q1 2020 -- 2022, we expect to repurchase up to $75 million of our common stock through either a combination of open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement.\nTurning to full year 2022. Despite Omicron headwinds, we expect 2022 revenue growth to be in line with our long-term model range of 20% to 30%. Our 2022 guidance assumes no significant new COVID surges after the current wave. No meaningful practice disruptions nor material supply chain issues throughout the year. On a GAAP basis, we anticipate our 2022 operating margin to be around 24%. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect 2022 operating margin to be approximately 3 points higher than our GAAP operating margin after excluding stock-based compensation and intangible amortization from certain acquisitions.\nFor 2022, we expect our investments in capital expenditures to exceed $350 million. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building in construction and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion. This includes our planned investment in a Clear Aligner manufacturing facility in Wroclaw, Poland, which is expected to begin serving doctors in 2022 as part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Joe for final comments. Joe?\n\nJoseph M. Hogan\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Align Technology, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Overall, despite the disruption from the Omicron in December, we delivered a record year with strong revenue growth and operating margin, in line with our guidance for the full year on top of a record Q4 and 2020 a year ago.\nAs you look back, I wanted to take a moment to recognize our accomplishments and thank our employees and our customers for another remarkable year. In the face of ongoing challenges related to COVID-19 and economic uncertainty, we remain steadfast in our commitment to our employees, customers and the focused execution of our strategic initiatives, and our customers remain confident in our ability to support them.\nOperating in this environment has not been easy, but after 2 years of navigating uncharted waters, the Align team is more agile and resilient than ever. In 2021, we met our goals and achieved numerous milestones. Globally, we delivered across each of our strategic priorities, which are highlighted in our Q4 '21 webcast slides. Our performance over the last year reaffirms the incredible size of our target market, and demonstrates that our strategy and investment in recent years are validated by the trust and faith our customers place in us.\nIn 2022, we must continue with our leadership in digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry through relentless execution of our strategic initiatives, focusing on expanding our commercial, manufacturing, R&D, clinical, treatment planning and manufacturing operations, and building our quality and regulatory muscle globally in existing and emerging markets, reaching millions of consumers who want to transform their smiles using the most advanced Clear Aligner system in the world through the right investments in advertising, PR, digital, social media and influencer marketing to drive demand and conversion through Invisalign train doctors.\nInvisalign ortho adoption and teen utilization of Invisalign treatment and training and educating GP dentists on how the iTero Element family of inter-oral scanners and imaging systems can propel today's dental practice into the future by enhancing patient experience and elevating clinical precision, and on the benefits of digital dentistry with the Invisalign system trusted by more than 12 million people worldwide to transform smiles.\nWe remain mindful of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and the challenges that go with it. While there is still uncertainty, it has become increasingly clear over the last year with the first spread of the Delta variant, now Omicron, that COVID-19 may never fully go away and may be a virus that persist in one variant form or another for the foreseeable future. And like other viruses, new or different vaccines will be needed and new therapies will be developed to minimize the impact and treat COVID-19 more effectively in our most vulnerable populations.\nThe reality of living with COVID is one of the government's businesses and communities all over the world are beginning to acknowledge and move towards, and at Align, we will do the same.\nIn closing, I'm going to share some thoughts that I express to our employees recently. What we learn in life, both in business and our personal lines, is that we're not fully in control of our environment and destiny. This is a fact of life that we face every day, but not being in control does not mean that we can't make good choices regardless of the situation or challenges we all face. We must look forward focused on the opportunities. Align has numerous growth drivers in a vastly underpenetrated market.\nAnd while we continue to see some lasting impact and continued uncertainty due to COVID-19, we remain confident in both the enormous opportunity to lead the evolution of digital orthodontics and comprehensive dentistry. We never forget that digital orthodontics presents the fastest growing and largest market in the world of medical devices. We have the greatest Clear Aligner system, scanners, GP lab software in the world and the broadest and deepest digital dental platform.\nWe have the most recognized consumer brand in the largest direct sales force in the dental space with over 4,000 salespeople supporting over 212,000 doctors and labs and their staff who have incredible skills and dedication to their patients. We have an amazing team of employees committed to our purpose. It's a unique opportunity unlike anything I've ever seen in my career. They both continue to grow Align and be part of the positively changing millions of lives by transforming their smiles.\nThank you for your time today. We look forward to speaking to you again as the year progresses. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?",

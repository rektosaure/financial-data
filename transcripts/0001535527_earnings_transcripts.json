With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nThank you, Andy, and a warm welcome to the CrowdStrike team. Andy is no stranger to many on this call, and I'm glad to have him with us to lead Investor Relations. I'm excited to share CrowdStrike's fantastic Q3. It was a record quarter as the business continued accelerating. On the back of record attendance at Fal.Con and Fal.Con Europe, the momentum we're seeing with customers, prospects, and partners drives my conviction in our near-term and long-term growth. Last quarter, Q2, we delivered our forecasted re-acceleration a quarter early. This quarter, we furthered the trend with relentless execution.\nAcross the entire CrowdStrike team, I'm extremely proud of our Q3 with highlights including: one, record Q3 net new ARR of $265 million, which grew 73% year-over-year, beating our expectations by more than 10%. Two, ending ARR of $4.92 billion, which accelerated to 23% growth year-over-year. Three, record Q3 free cash flow of $296 million, or 24% of revenue. Four, all-time record operating income of $265 million, or 21% of revenue. This is the second consecutive quarter of record operating income. Five, broad-based ending ARR acceleration across cloud, next-gen identity, and Next-Gen SIEM collectively, as well as acceleration in our endpoint business.\nSix, more than $1.35 billion in ending ARR from accounts that have adopted the Falcon Flex subscription model, growing more than 200% year-over-year. Underpinning these financial highlights is the CISO, CIO, and board feedback I regularly hear. CrowdStrike is mission-critical in today's agentic society. No matter how the market swings, geopolitical tensions evolve, or what technologies are in vogue, our digital society mandates cybersecurity as a necessity. Now more than ever, synonymous with that, CrowdStrike is a necessity. Our growth is driven by pervasive, durable, and thematic market forces.\nOrganizations of all sizes are in the midst of AI transformations, investing in the future of workforce productivity in the name of speed, scale, and cost benefits. In the midst of this societal shift, what I've shared over the past few years and quarters is unfolding before our very eyes. One, AI is rapidly expanding the attack surface. Businesses are onboarding a whole new type of workforce today, the agentic workforce: humans using agents to do more and agents working by themselves, each with access to data, applications, compute, and sometimes even other agents.\nWhile the benefits of this newfound workforce are exciting and increasingly vital for market competitiveness, the rapidly expanding risk profile of this realm cannot be ignored. Every single agent expands the attack surface, necessitating protection. CrowdStrike is both the armor and intelligence layer that keeps agentic identity secure. The intelligence layer provides visibility and context to organizations from agentic threats and risks, and the armor protects agents from attacks, influence, exfiltration, and data manipulation.\nIn addition, CrowdStrike is also present as the foundational protector of the underlying technologies powering the AI revolution, providing security by design for the world's cloud and token factories. Two, the democratization of destruction wasn't just a bold prediction; it's already today's reality. Businesses every day are having jarring, lightbulb moments witnessing AI-powered adversarial tradecraft firsthand. Just a few weeks ago, a major AI company shared that China state-sponsored adversaries were using their LLM to create and operationalize active cyber intrusion agents.\nThis is just one of the many AI-enabled attacks we've seen. The AI cyber battleground is no longer theoretical. It's now real. Now, just as anyone can use AI to vibe code and become a software engineer, anyone can now also vibe hack, becoming a sophisticated adversary with AI. Three, cybersecurity in the agentic era demands a single platform. The criticality in being able to operate with agility, efficacy, and speed to stop breaches is having the data, the controls, and the actions in a single platform, not multiple platforms. Because when you have multiple platforms, by definition, you don't have a platform.\nTab switching and context switching costs time. Data stitching doesn't scale. These are the seams and cracks where adversaries thrive. The leaky lifeboat of point platforms and point product fragments simply cannot offer the protection, scalability, and cost benefits, or the ease of use of a single-platform solution. CrowdStrike wins as the market's broadest and only single-platform solution. Taking my three points together: one, we've built the right architecture: a single console, single data backend, single sensor, agentic hyperscale platform that is frictionless and one-of-a-kind in cybersecurity.\nTwo, it's the right time with the rapid growth of AI agents raising the threat risk profile and driving a holistic technology shift. And three, we're in the right position. CrowdStrike's technology, innovation engine, and ecosystem position us as the operating system of cybersecurity for the agentic era. Market demand is high because the need is real. We have the right architecture, we have the right products, and we're in the right market position to continue taking share.\nSuccessful AI adoption requires cybersecurity transformation, necessitating a new operating system to create a structure around the next chapter of enterprise security programs. Falcon Next-Gen SIEM is the foundation of our platform, turning CrowdStrike into our customer's operating system for cybersecurity. Next-Gen SIEM has become a scale disruptor in a market that has historically been slow to evolve as customers embrace the speed and efficiency advantages versus legacy competitors.\nWith the acquisition of Onum, we're making it even easier to build on CrowdStrike with a hyperscalable telemetry detection pipeline that brings CrowdStrike even closer to all our customers' critical data. Falcon Next-Gen SIEM had a record net new ARR quarter, a clear outcome of the deliberate strategic choices we've made over the past several years. We know that the value of the technology is only as good as the platform on which it's delivered, so we invested heavily in integrating Next-Gen SIEM to create a unified single platform.\nThis isn't just a single console. It's a truly integrated and unified data backend that brings together all of CrowdStrike in one place, delivering not just economies of scale, but far superior outcomes. And with Charlotte as the agentic SOC orchestrator, now FedRAMP high approved, we're delivering the AI SOC of the future today. Furthering our position as the operating system of cybersecurity, we recently announced our expanded partnership with AWS.\nThrough this announcement, all of AWS's millions of customers will have access to Falcon Next-Gen SIEM natively within their AWS security console, enabling them to immediately access, interact with, and analyze AWS telemetry directly in Next-Gen SIEM. Going a step further, we've also enabled federated search so that AWS customers can query their data from a single console. We're incredibly excited about what the future holds and thank AWS for both our amazing partnership and for the validation of Falcon Next-Gen SIEM as the best choice for their customers.\nA large European bank renewed their more than 500,000 workload EDR deployment, adding Next-Gen SIEM, Onum, and Charlotte AI in a large eight-figure expansion deal. With our acquisition of Onum, this financial institution was able to eliminate their existing streaming pipeline point product as well as migrate off Splunk. Competing against hyperscalers and firewall vendor SIEMs, Falcon Next-Gen SIEM won the hearts and minds of the security and IT team as the easiest solution, fastest to see value, and best agentic SOC transformation platform.\nOur identity business continues to perform exceptionally well. While the demand for our ITDR offering has increased, it's the launch of both our PAM and Falcon Shield offerings that has our customers increasingly excited. Falcon Shield had a record net new ARR quarter, growing nearly 50% sequentially as market demand for SaaS application security has become a mainstream necessity. Securing SaaS app misuse from human and non-human identities has never been more important or challenging. Nefarious agentic behavior is targeting data-rich SaaS applications that have quickly become a feeding ground for breaches.\nFrom on-prem apps to cloud apps, we stopped these breaches. A Fortune 500 logistics company used Falcon Shield to uncover exfiltrated CRM data in less than 30 minutes from deployment, resulting in a seven-figure deal. A leading customer experience platform saw a Shield demo and activated the module via Flex within an hour. Lastly, a Global 500 personal care leader conducted a Shield assessment uncovering 25 unknown shadow instances of their CRM. This customer quickly transacted a seven-figure expansion, bringing their SaaS environment under control.\nAs these examples illustrate, today's elevated third-party SaaS risk environment demands visibility and protection. Falcon Shield delivers near-immediate time to value and is a product that we can land new logo accounts with even without endpoint deployments. Turning to the cloud, where we delivered Q3 record net new ARR. While CrowdStrike continues to benefit from M&A-related market disruptions, it is our customers' embrace of best-in-class runtime protection that continues to push us forward. As the cloud security market matures, customers are realizing that posture doesn't equate to prevention.\nSecurity teams now understand that they need active defense within their cloud environments, and this can only be delivered in runtime. CrowdStrike is the cloud runtime security leader, as validated by the most recent Frost & Sullivan CWPP report. And with our recent acquisition of Pangea, we're now positioned to protect the entirety of our customers' AI infrastructure. At our recent analyst day at our Fal.Con Conference, we discussed how protecting AI is akin to protecting a building.\nSecurity teams don't want a non-integrated, fragmented series of solutions to protect their critical AI infrastructure because they know that this complexity creates gaps that are increasingly exploitable by AI-enabled adversaries. CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud Security offers customers a unified, integrated, end-to-end solution that enables secure adoption of transformative technology without slowing the end user down. A Fortune 500 consumer packaged goods company grew their Falcon deployment with Falcon Cloud Security and a seven-figure expansion deal.\nThis customer took the opportunity to displace Wiz, bringing their cloud security program to Falcon for the benefit of our consolidated CSPM, ASPM, CIEM, and CDR approach. The outcome delivered is single-platform management, better visibility, and the ability to stop cloud breaches versus simply alerting on them. This was just one of multiple Wiz replacements. In addition, Falcon Cloud Security was selected to protect a leading neocloud in an eight-figure transaction.\nThis token factory decided it was time to secure AI from the source so that enterprises of all sizes would trust and build with confidence on them. Cybersecurity became a differentiator and business enabler, not a cost. And finally, I wanted to touch on our endpoint business. Our endpoint business accelerated in the quarter on the heels of AI-driven demand. In the world of AI, so much is being pushed to the edge. Employees are now deploying new applications such as Cloud Desktop and ChatGPT directly onto their machines, driving both rapidly improved productivity and also significant new risks.\nThis is further exacerbated by the rapid adoption of new AI browsers such as Comet and Atlas, which bring new opportunities and concurrently new vulnerabilities and threats. AI adoption is supercharging renewed interest in the endpoint as the endpoint is the epicenter of human and non-human interaction with AI. In this new agentic world, the endpoint has quickly become the risk point, the productivity point, and the opportunity point.\nA large government agency took the opportunity to modernize, replacing more than 75,000 endpoints of legacy AV with Falcon, as well as deploying us in their AWS environment for cloud protection in what was a strong federal quarter for CrowdStrike. In addition, EY brought us into a Fortune 500 healthcare account where in just a few months we were able to modernize the endpoint, cloud, and SIEM environments, an eight-figure end-to-end Flex expansion deal where we displaced two SIEMs, Defender for Endpoint, and a point cloud security product.\nFrequently imitated but never duplicated, Falcon Flex makes it easier than ever for our customers to experience the full power of the Falcon platform without procurement friction. The Flex model cultivates more platform utilization, accelerating module adoption. Falcon Flex is an unlock, not an ELA. Flex customer ending account ARR more than tripled year-over-year. But what has us even more excited is the momentum we're seeing in Re-Flex activity. The number of Re-Flex accounts more than doubled quarter over quarter to more than 200, with 10 customers Re-Flexing more than 2x their initial Flex subscription.\nThis demonstrates that Flex customers can and do increase their ARR and TCV spend with CrowdStrike, which is contrary to the ELA model, where all the economic value is realized once upfront. When we launched Flex, we believed that it would allow customers to more quickly benefit from the full value of our platform, and that's exactly what's happening. As customers and partners alike continue to embrace Flex as the best way to adopt Falcon, we expect it to become our licensing standard.\nOur community, or crowd, powers our technology, and that's who we build for. Our ecosystem partners continue leading us to new heights, affirming CrowdStrike's market and category leadership. Our Alliance team delivered a record quarter in terms of deal value closed with partners. CrowdStrike's market position comes to light in mission-critical times. F5 asked us to partner with them to further secure their BIG-IP hardware and virtual appliances. We rapidly deployed our sensor on BIG-IP, which they certified, and F5 took the opportunity to purchase Falcon and OverWatch licensing for their installed base in a large Flex transaction.\nWe are pleased to be taking our industry-leading protection capabilities to new insertion points designed to enhance network perimeter protection. Today, hundreds of F5 customers are now securing their F5 appliances with CrowdStrike, many of whom weren't CrowdStrike customers prior. Partners take us into new account environments, implementing Falcon as part of their broader agentic enterprise architecture vision. Experiencing the success Next-Gen SIEM in the market, EY took a bold step to standardize their SIEM practice on Falcon in a large seven-figure transaction.\nEY is migrating accounts for which they own and operate multiple legacy SIEM technologies, consolidating on CrowdStrike. Additionally, EY is a leading global partner of ours for Next-Gen SIEM implementations, taking numerous Fortune 500 accounts through the journey from legacy SIEM to Next-Gen SIEM migration. Deloitte announced Next-Gen SIEM in their MXDR practice, replacing their legacy SIEM provider, and Wipro, too, has standardized security delivery and incident response on Falcon. The GSI community is quickly seizing the SIEM and SOC transformation opportunity that only our single platform provides.\nThe ecosystem embrace of partner-led services on Falcon is correlated to the opportunity we represent. A recent Canalys report showed that our ecosystem creates up to $7 in services opportunities for every dollar of Falcon product sales, illustrating the large ecosystem opportunity surrounding the Falcon platform. I want to return to yesterday's announcement that we made with AWS. AWS selected Falcon Next-Gen SIEM as the default SIEM for all their customers offered in their Security Hub console. This brings Falcon Next-Gen SIEM with pre-populated AWS data to millions of AWS customers in a product-led growth motion.\nOur intent is to convert Next-Gen SIEM usage into Flex subscriptions as more accounts experience the power, speed, and actionability of their AWS data, CrowdStrike data, and other third-party data in Next-Gen SIEM. Our Next-Gen SIEM helps AWS fill a critical market gap, now competing with other hyperscaler SIEMs and doing so with Falcon. Our Next-Gen SIEM delivers value for AWS customers, even those who don't yet use Falcon, because we've become a federated, pre-populated, and affordable security data lake for observability, triage, and threat hunting. Charlotte AI is there to help operate the whole system on a customer's behalf.\nIn addition, Accenture is our launch partner with AWS, helping AWS customers leave their legacy SIEM for Falcon Next-Gen SIEM on AWS. Our partnership with AWS continues from strength to strength, with CrowdStrike announced as AWS's Global Security Partner of the Year and AWS's Global Marketplace Partner of the Year yesterday at re:Invent. We're excited about the opportunity to engage AWS accounts, onboarding them to Falcon, and serving as their operating system for cybersecurity.\nLastly, I want to share a noteworthy MSSP partnership, which we've announced today with Kroll, a leading mid-market professional services firm. Kroll's cybersecurity division performs thousands of incident response engagements yearly for mid-market firms around the world, largely from their cyber insurance panel inclusion. Kroll had been using a point product EDR in their incident response and managed detection and response business.\nNow, Kroll exclusively uses Falcon, and in an almost eight-figure rip and replace transaction, Kroll is migrating nearly half a million endpoints to Falcon, which were previously running on a point product SMB EDR, and upleveling their own MDR service with Falcon Complete for service providers, with our Falcon Complete team becoming the SOC for Kroll. This partnership announcement illustrates the value that only CrowdStrike can deliver. The best technology platform with numerous expansion opportunities to help customers and partners alike consolidate.\nThe services opportunities partners need to see value, whether that be an incident response, proactive assessments, managed detection and response, or SOC transformation, and our scaled and agentic MDR teams to uplevel partners so they can focus on selling and client services while we focus on stopping breaches as the world SOC. We've improved Kroll's technology stack, displaced an inferior point product, improved their margins with Falcon Complete, and they migrated their entire practice to us.\nThis transaction highlights the power of Falcon to be a business creator for our ecosystem. We're not selling products. We're delivering outcomes, introducing the world to a whole new way of performing cybersecurity and risk management. In closing, this was one of our very best quarters in company history. Acceleration is back. We're winning, and we're living the company's mission of stopping breaches. AI represents our largest opportunity and demand driver yet. We're using AI to revolutionize cybersecurity.\nEven larger, we're securing the world's use of AI so businesses of all sizes can adopt more AI faster, securely, and with confidence. The takeaway is this: AI adoption necessitates the right cybersecurity. It necessitates CrowdStrike. Jensen Huang summed up our market position best, saying, \"I can't imagine a better defender than CrowdStrike,\" on the stage at NVIDIA GTC in Washington, D.C. The transformative work we're doing with NVIDIA is representative of how we're securing AI at its very source, all the way down to its human and non-human users and its outcomes.\nI see this as a generational opportunity for the company. AI is but one of many tailwinds continuing to propel CrowdStrike to new heights. One thing is certain: whenever our customers engage in technology change and transformation, cybersecurity has been a constant necessity, and that constant is CrowdStrike. With that, we have a big Q4 opportunity in front of us, a robust demand environment, and no shortage of breaches to stop. Cybersecurity doesn't slow down for the holidays, and neither do we. Stay safe, happy holidays, and I'll pass the call over to Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike's CFO.\n\nBurt Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. Additionally, the results we are reporting today include the acquisitions of Onum and Pangea, which closed during the quarter and were de minimis to revenue and ARR. We delivered an exceptional third quarter driven by organic growth, exceeding expectations across all guided metrics. We achieved record Q3 net new ARR of $265 million, exceeding our expectations by double-digit millions and more than 10 percentage points.\nNet new ARR growth accelerated to 73% year-over-year, and ending ARR reached $4.92 billion, accelerating to 23% growth over last year. As George highlighted, our performance reflects the success of our single platform strategy as organizations prioritize cybersecurity in the agentic era and customers consolidate on Falcon as the operating system of the SOC. We delivered acceleration across the platform with cloud, Next-Gen SIEM, and Next-Gen identity, all delivering strong results.\nMomentum was broad-based across customers of all sizes, from enterprise to down market and MSSPs, achieving record results in our corporate business and strong performance in the public sector, particularly in US federal and higher education. Falcon Flex continues to be a powerful driver of platform consolidation, with over $1.35 billion in ending ARR from accounts that have adopted the Flex subscription model. Falcon Flex is quickly becoming the standard licensing model as it makes it easier for customers to adopt more of the Falcon platform faster.\nCustomers continue to leverage Falcon to consolidate their security needs and lower their total cost of ownership, resulting in higher retention rates over the prior quarter and increased module adoption rates. As of Q3, 49% of subscription customers are now using six or more modules, 34% are using seven or more, and 24% are using eight or more modules. With our business momentum increasing and our all-time record high pipeline entering Q4, we have strong conviction in our ability to deliver profitable growth as we finish FY 2026 and look into FY 2027 and beyond.\nMoving to the P&L, total revenue exceeded our guidance range and grew 22% over Q3 of last year to reach $1.23 billion. Subscription revenue grew 21% over Q3 of last year to reach $1.17 billion, and professional services revenue was $65.5 million. The geographic mix of third quarter revenue consisted of approximately 67% from the US. 33% from international geographies, with both US and APAC year-over-year revenue growth accelerating compared to Q2. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 78%, and non-GAAP subscription gross margin increased to 81% of revenue.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $703.2 million, or 57% of revenue. In Q3, we saw a typical step-up in sales and marketing expenses from our annual Fal.Con Conference we hosted in September, which was our biggest selling event of the year and set multiple records with over 8,000 attendees joining us. Non-GAAP operating income was a record $264.6 million, and operating margin was 21%, exceeding our guidance.\nThe outperformance was driven by our strong top-line performance, gross margin improvement, and sales execution, underscoring our commitment to profitable growth as we balance accelerating net new ARR growth with operational excellence. GAAP net loss attributable to CrowdStrike was $34.0 million, which included $26.2 million of costs associated with the 19 July incident and related matters, and $5.6 million of acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike was a record $245.4 million, or $0.96 on a diluted per-share basis, exceeding our guidance.\nMoving to cash, our cash and cash equivalents were $4.80 billion. We generated record cash flow from operations of $397.5 million and record Q3 free cash flow of $295.9 million, or 24% of revenue. Payments for incident-related and strategic plan costs impacted Q3 free cash flow by approximately $53 million. Moving to our outlook and modeling notes. The AI-driven demand environment, combined with our record pipeline and the continued momentum in customer platform consolidation on Falcon, gives us strong conviction as we finish Q4 and look toward FY 2027.\nWhile we do not guide to ending ARR or net new ARR, our revenue guidance includes the following assumptions: low to mid-teens sequential net new ARR growth Q3 to Q4, bringing ending ARR growth for FY 2026 to 23% year-over-year. At the midpoint of our net new ARR assumptions, we expect second-half net new ARR growth of at least 50% year-over-year, well above our previously provided assumptions of at least 40% year-over-year, driven by our strong Q3 outperformance and record pipeline.\nAdditionally, we continue to expect FY 2027 year-over-year net new ARR growth of at least 20% from our now increased FY 2026 net new ARR assumptions. As we discussed during our September investor briefing, as a result of our successful CCP and related partner programs, our ARR to subscription revenue assumptions include a separation of $13 to 15 million in Q4, consistent with what we noted at Fal.Con. This gets you to the midpoint of our FY 2026 revenue guidance, which we have raised by $24.1 million at the midpoint to reflect our strong Q3 outperformance and record pipeline.\nWe ask that you please be mindful of these dynamics when updating your models. Moving to cash, we expect Q4 free cash flow margin to be 27% and include cash payments of approximately $33 million in connection with incident-related costs. This brings our full-year FY 2026 free cash flow margin expectation to 25%. Finally, we remain confident in our previously provided assumptions for FY 2027 partner rebates, non-GAAP operating margin, and free cash flow margin, which are detailed in the modeling assumption slide of our Q3 FY 2026 earnings presentation, available at ir.crowdstrike.com following our prepared remarks today.\nMoving to our outlook. For the fourth quarter of FY 2026, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.290 to 1.300 billion, reflecting our year-over-year growth rate of 22% to 23. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $315 to 319 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $282 to 287 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $1.09 to 1.11, utilizing a 21% tax rate and weighted average share count of approximately 258 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year of 2026, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $4.797 to 4.807 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 21% to 22 over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $1.036 and 1.040 billion. We expect fiscal 2026 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $950 to 954 million. Utilizing a 21% tax rate and approximately 256 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.70 to 3.72. George and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please click on the raise hand button, which can be found on the bar at the bottom of your Zoom window. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by lowering your hand. When it is your turn, you will hear your name called and receive a message on your screen notifying you that you may unmute yourself. In the interest of time, participants will be limited to one question. Our first question will come from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Please unmute and ask your question.\n\nBrian Essex\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question, and nice results. And Andy, congratulations on the new role. Maybe for George, great to hear the acceleration in the endpoint segment of the business. And I know you guys aren't giving any update until year-end on the emerging segments of the business, but could you offer a little bit of color of how those segments are behaving as you kind of lap the initial CCP initiatives of last year? And then maybe for George, I mean, maybe for Burt, I know you're not offering any kind of impact from Pangea and Onum on ARR, but any sense of the seasonality, organic seasonality for net new ARR? Thank you.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nHey, Brian, thanks. Yeah, when we look at, obviously, the emerging products, which was the heart of your question, they perform fantastic. If you look at Next-Gen SIEM, it's been an all-star standout for us. We've seen just incredible results from a customer perspective in what they're able to do and driving down the cost and get better outcomes. Identity as well, that's key to securing the AI in an enterprise. Then, obviously, cloud, we talked about some of the big wins throughout the quarter. So when we look at those segments, and as you mentioned, we'll be reporting out on those next quarter, we're very, very pleased on the results.\nCustomers are embracing the technology and the consolidation the single platform delivers. From that standpoint, I think we're very happy. Then as we lap the CCP, CCP was designed to do exactly what we delivered, right?\nWe helped customers through a situation, and also we provided a way to accelerate Flex adoption. We've seen that with our Flex license adoptions throughout the quarter, which we called out. Then, obviously, we had a fantastic endpoint quarter, which continues to help drive all the other modules. Overall, I couldn't be happier with the quarter that we just put up.\n\nBurt Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike\n\nYeah. On your question with respect to Pangea, I think that I called out that we have got the minimal impact from both the revenue standpoint and net new ARR, and we're excited that those are going to roll into the platform in Q4, so that's how we think about it.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks for the question, Brian. I'll take our next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHey, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter, and congrats, Andy. George, maybe for you, I just want to pick up on your comment earlier on SIEM. It feels like the SIEM market is starting to see more velocity of displacements. Can you just maybe talk about what sort of value you're able to capture in those opportunities compared to what customers were maybe spending before? And then maybe relatedly, how do you kind of think about the timetable for legacy SIEM renewals in the coming quarters, years, which, of course, I imagine you'd be targeting? Thanks.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nYeah. I'll try to wrap this up into one answer here. Saket, let me just kind of lay this out. If you look at the journey that we've been on and how we've been able to replace legacy AV, it feels a lot like that market in the early days when we think about replacing legacy SIEM. Customers are looking for better outcomes. They're looking for faster results, and they're looking for lower cost. Because we already have the EDR data in the platform, we can offer disruptive pricing versus our competitors. The stickiest data that's out there is the EDR data, and we already have it.\nReally, what it becomes is a journey to activate Next-Gen SIEM for our customers. When we think about the opportunity to work with customers and how we get in and the opportunity going forward, keep in mind, all of our customers are Next-Gen SIEM-enabled. All of our customers are Next-Gen SIEM-enabled. It's a huge difference between us and everyone else in the marketplace.\nAll we need to do is go through the licensing exercise, and Flex is helping to accelerate that. We can offer competitive, disruptive pricing, and then overall grow our total wallet share with a customer over time, so it's a multi-year, long-tail journey that feels very similar to the displacement of legacy AV.\n\nSaket Kalia\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nVery helpful. Thanks.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks, Saket. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Matt Hedberg with RBC.\n\nMatt Hedberg\n\nManaging Director and Software Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats from me as well on the quarter, and Andy, to you as well. George, building on your Next-Gen SIEM success and Onum, and a little bit related to Saket's question, do you see a further push into observability? Obviously, there's been some movement with some of your cyber competitors to go deeper into observability. Just curious on kind of how you view that market, and is that a consolidation opportunity for you as well?\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nWell, we do view it as a consolidation opportunity. I'll remind everyone on the call that when we acquired Humio, which became LogScale, 50% of their business was actually in observability. We have all of the technology and in fact, because the platform is collecting so much data and so much telemetry, we have customers today that are using it for observability use cases. You combine that with our agent technology, which does deep inspection within its platform, and we have data that goes well beyond security data that is already being consumed by customers.\nThen you combine that with Onum, the pipelining technology, the data fabric, which, again, has the ability to take IT data and we have a fantastic opportunity in front of us to consolidate in those areas, which, again, this is nothing new to us. We've actually been doing this, and this has been part of our selling motion as well as what customers are embracing. It's already there, and there's certainly more that we can do, and certainly more we will do.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nGreat. Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs.\n\nGabriela Borges\n\nManaging Director and Software Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you. Question for Burt. So CrowdStrike has years and years of data on customer cohorts and how your customer cohorts typically expand with you over time. You've now got several quarters of data on Flex and how the Flex customers expand with you over time. There's a piece of this which is structural, which is making it easier for customers to consolidate with you.\nBut I'm wondering if there's also a dynamic where you've seen elevated tailwind to NRR for a period of time because of Flex and Flex starting with your best and most excited customers, and then perhaps normalizes lower. So my question for you is, how do you think about that dynamic? How do you think about the tailwind that Flex is driving in the model and how sustainable that is? Thank you.\n\nBurt Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks, Gabriela. So the way I think about this is our Flex licensing, it's continuous. Net ARR will be continuous throughout time. The beauty of this whole program is that it's designed for customers to easily buy more. Over time, we're excited about the opportunity as we bring more products to market and offer more availability to our customers easily. I think that's the biggest piece that everybody on the call should just remember is that that's exactly what Flex was designed to do: make it easier for customers to buy, make it very easy for us to be able to deploy, and be able to give value and lower TCO.\nThat's how we think about it. The benefit is that we're seeing bigger deals and longer deals. That's all good for us, and it's great for the customers. I think the most important thing is, and not get lost in things I've just said, is consolidation. We started this company talking about consolidation, the ability for customers to do more with us, spend more with us, and lower their total TCO, but spending more with us. I think that's the biggest point that I want to drive home.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks, Gabriela. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Dan Ives with Wedbush.\n\nDan Ives\n\nManaging Director and Global Head of Technology Research, Wedbush\n\nYeah, thanks. And also congrats on the Mercedes-Benz deal, George. Can you just talk about AI? As you're starting to see more and more deployment, talk about how that's changing the conversations with customers, even over the last three, six, nine months relative to where CrowdStrike sits. Can you just maybe just give some insight into how those have changed from your perspective?\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nYeah, great. Thanks, Dan. Thanks as always. Yeah, when we think about the conversation of AI, what customers have realized is that CrowdStrike is probably the only company in security that's moved beyond chatbots. What I mean by that is Charlotte AI and its related agents are deeply embedded into the platform. Our last Falcon in Europe, we talked about 11 AI agents and AgentWorks, which allows our customers to actually create their own security agents, which we think is going to be a massive opportunity for us. It's moved from chatbots to actual doing work.\nThis is something that we continually hear differentiates us from our competitors. Our competitors are still stuck on chatbots where we've done the orchestration within the platform. We've created models around each of our modules, and we're delivering results. Things that would take four days of work, we're delivering in minutes for customers.\nAt the various events that I was at, both in Las Vegas for Fal.Con and in Europe for our Fal.Con in Europe, I had customers talk about just the evolution of Charlotte, the maturation of it, and how it's become a key part of their success and their SOC. It gets back to what I said earlier. CrowdStrike has become the operating system for the SOC, and Charlotte is a big piece of it.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nAll right, thanks, Dan. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Joseph Gallo with Jefferies.\n\nJoseph Gallo\n\nSVP and Software Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for the question, and congrats, Andy, on the new role. It was awesome to see you guys maintain the fiscal 2027 net new ARR growth of 20% on higher numbers. You mentioned several key components of the business accelerated in Q3. Is there one or two products that you think have an outsized growth impact for upside next year? And then as a part of that, security for AI feels necessary, but very early. Is that accounted for in your preliminary fiscal 2027 guidance, or is that more longer term? Thank you.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nYeah, sure. I think when we look at next year, again, seeing the momentum that we talked about with Next-Gen SIEM, again, it's an all-star product. It delivers a lot of value, which is key in this market when you're talking about consolidation. It's enabling customers to do things that they haven't been able to do. I think one of the areas that maybe is really not appreciated is that many organizations of all sizes are making a decision in the past to not collect certain data because of the cost. With CrowdStrike, we can actually open the aperture, and we can provide value to collect all that data.\nIn general, we're expanding the wallet share, but we're giving them more value because we're collecting data they've never seen, and we're giving them outcomes that weren't available to them previously. I would look at that as an all-star. I would look at cloud. We look at the displacements that we talked about in the call. We talked about the runtime protection, which is key. Customers want that protection. Then we look at Falcon Shield, which is, again, cloud and identity, but it is a key technology to help protect the SaaS application. These are all fantastic opportunities for us in the coming year, and we'll continue to double down on them.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nAll right, thanks, Joe. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Fatima Boolani with Citi. Fatima, you may unmute and ask your question.\n\nFatima Boolani\n\nManaging Director and Co-head of Software Equity Research, Citi\n\nOh, here I go. Thank you for taking my questions. George, I wanted to direct this to you. You gave us a lot of information about your strengthening partnership with AWS. Your proximity to AWS as a customer and a very, very strategic partner has only cemented further. I wanted to ask you a very high-level strategic question.\nThis proximity that preclude you or influence you or potentially maybe even complicate your relationship with other hyperscalers and your customers who would typically, presumably, have multi-cloud infrastructure footprints would love for you to sort of dive into some of those dynamics a little bit, again, just by virtue of the strengthening partnership with AWS and the availability of the full Falcon suite in a very deep integrated way inside AWS. Thank you.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nYeah, so first, we couldn't be more excited about this partnership. Really, I mean, I think this is something that's going to be incredible for AWS customers as well as customers of CrowdStrike. The fact that now natively, you can actually flow data from AWS into Next-Gen SIEM. It's right in your console, and it's going to be a tremendous enabler for new customer acquisition. It's a needed technology for AWS customers. Overall, fantastic relationship, and we're excited to be deeply integrated. When we think about the current environment, as you know, there's always an area to cooperate with many different companies that are out there.\nJust look at the AI space and how many people work with different companies that are out there. I think if you look at that and you apply it to security, of course, we're going to work with other players that are out there. They're going to leverage the best technology in the market, which is CrowdStrike. We're there to support all of our customers and potential partners.\nIt doesn't preclude us from doing that, but again, I think this reinforces what a great relationship we have with AWS, how we've been able to partner with them, not only in the technology side, but also in the marketplace. You've seen the evidence of that by the awards that I called out. Overall, extremely excited about what the future brings.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks, Fatima. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\n\nMeta Marshall\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. You noted core EDR acceleration in the quarter, and you kind of noted AI as a catalyst for that. Is that kind of more endpoints getting protected as they become more intelligent, or just existing customers looking to modernize as part of general AI adoption?\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nSure. When you think about endpoints and the adoption of AI, a lot of it takes place at the endpoint. Think about all of the various technologies that are out there where people are running these as a user on their endpoints. I mean, we've seen some big announcements from consulting firms and others that are leveraging AI in their business because they have to, and they have to drive efficiency. What that means is that that creates opportunities and exposure for companies. They're going to need to monitor what sort of queries go in. They're going to need to monitor what data comes out.\nThey're going to need to monitor what other services are connected into those AI desktop technologies. That becomes another threat factor. This becomes a catalyst. Again, I think this is underappreciated as a new risk factor that we hadn't had over the last number of years. Now with the adoption of this, this isn't AI creation. It's AI adoption. That, I believe, is going to be a massive market opportunity for us. That's where we see that. Overall, as I always say, 50% of the market is still legacy AV, and there's still a long runway in the endpoint business to be able to take that legacy market share.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks, Meta. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Patrick Colville with Scotiabank.\n\nPatrick Colville\n\nLead Software Equity Research Analyst, Scotiabank\n\nAll right, thanks, Andy, for having me on. I guess this one's for George. I want to ask about discounting levels. Because if I think about this time last year, we had the CCP program, but we also had CrowdStrike very correctly being aggressive to cement and extend its position through discounting. That was the right strategy, and these results prove that.\nAs I think about the quarter we've just had, fiscal Q3, and as we look towards fiscal 2027, I guess, can you just talk about how you're thinking about just discounting and normal course of business discounting? Are those levels going to diminish over time as we have the Falcon outage further and further in the rearview mirror, and your position's looking very strong?\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike",
    "content2": "Sure. Well, I think when you look at this market and you look at, say, enterprise sales, I mean, there's always some level of discounting. That's not unique to us. It's not unique to security, and it's not unique to software companies. It just happens as a normal course of business. I think we've been very prudent in how we operate in those areas. We've tried to focus on things like CCP, which again allow customers to take new technologies in, but protect the price point and allow us to basically capture them in a flex opportunity.\nWe're going to use the tools available to us to be competitive. We continue to take share. We continue to drive new customer business. We don't see anything out of the normal course of business, but we've got various tools in our toolbox, and we tend to use those judiciously and, again, where it makes sense for us and for the customer. That just drives the growth that you've seen. I'll also point out the 81% gross margin. You have to look at the margin as well. We've been able to be successful, and we've been able to protect the margin.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks, Patrick. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Eric Heath with KeyBanc.\n\nEric Heath\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nHey, great. Thanks for taking the question. Nice set of results. George, I wanted to ask about the partnership with F5. I thought that was pretty interesting. But correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this part of the infrastructure stack historically was never able to support endpoint agents before. So does this expand the endpoint TAM? How meaningful can this be? And are there other areas of the infrastructure stack you think this is applicable to?\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nYeah, this is a great and insightful question. I'm really glad that you asked it because it does. What we've seen over the years is that customers have been asking for a long time to protect these appliances. In many cases, the appliances have not been available to us, the underlying operating system, if you will, to be able to protect, but there's been a huge demand there. We worked with F5 in great partnership, and very quickly, to be able to certify our agents to run on their platform. We do think that this will create a working model that will open it up to other appliance vendors to be able to have it protected.\nI can tell you just some anecdotal stories. There was a story just last week of a non-customer, never used CrowdStrike, had the opportunity to actually use our technology because of F5 and was blown away. Within a week, we had him in an EBC, and now we're getting into a proof of value. This play works, and we're going to expand our market and be very forward-leaning in being able to protect other appliances that are out there, which you probably have seen are the tip of the spear for many of these nation-state breaches.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks, Eric. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Roger Boyd with UBS.\n\nRoger Boyd\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Can you hear me okay?\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nYes.\n\nRoger Boyd\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nAwesome. Well, congrats, Andy, on the new role. I wanted to double-click on the Kroll partnership. I know MSP has been a growing part of the channel for CrowdStrike for the past couple of quarters. Can you walk us through that longer-term opportunity as you expand with Kroll and other beyond kind of the initial endpoint landing spot? Thanks.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nSure. Yeah. We were excited about this opportunity. We took out another EDR vendor that was in there. We're providing a much better solution for them and their customers. They're in a segment that allows us to bring our technology too. There's a lot of incident response engagements they're doing. They're part of the insurance panels. It opens up a market opportunity with one customer and just accelerates our ability to penetrate that. These are the type of models that we like to create. We've been very successful in the MSSP market.\nThis is just another proof point of us working with customers like Kroll and the reach that they have and the trust that they have. The idea is to create more Kroll opportunities and certainly grow the opportunity that we have with Kroll, which I feel very confident we will.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks, Roger. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Tal Liani with BofA.\n\nTal Liani\n\nManaging Director and Technology Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, guys. You're a $5 billion revenue company, and you only provide one number. Revenue or ARR. There's no breakdown. I'm trying to understand a little bit of the kind of any segmentation of your revenues. The question I have is, can you discuss verticals like contribution of SMB and trends in SMB, kind of new market opportunities that were not in your core before and how you're addressing them, and also new customers versus upsell to existing customers? Are you disclosing NRR and GRR? I know you stopped doing it a few quarters ago. Thanks.\n\nBurt Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike\n\nActually, let me take the last part of your question first. Basically, we are going to be giving out dollar-based net retention and gross retention rates at the end of the year. That's what we've talked about, and we will do that now at the end of Q4. We do it every Q4. So I think you'll get that information. Now, with respect to breaking out how we think about our business, whether it's enterprise, SMB, or MSSP, the great news about our business is that we sell all of it. We're successful with all of it. We're successful with small deals.\nWe're successful with large enterprise deals. For us, we have that great technology that it's the same. It's the same technology for if you're a five-person shop or you're the largest company in the world. The beauty of how we're able to deliver our technology is that it's up and running in seconds. When you think about segmentation, you think about who we sell to, it really is everybody. Our ability and our success is agnostic. We are really driving new wins and displacing competitors on a daily basis.\nFor us to continue to invest in the business and for us to be able to continue to make sure that we're able to deliver in a very timely manner, these are the successful things that we look at to be able to sell to all of our customers, whether big or small. We're excited about that and we're also rare in the entire security community to be able to do that successfully.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nAll right. Thanks, Tal, for the question. Operator, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Mike Cikos with Needham.\n\nJeff Hopson\n\nEquity Research Associate, Needham & Company\n\nHi, this is Jeff Hopson on for Mike. Thank you for the question. With the increased amount of M&A activity in security we've seen this year, including CrowdStrike recently, how are you guys approaching the buy versus build when it comes to a technology like AI that's developing pretty quickly? Thank you.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nWell, when we look at the market, certainly there's a lot of activity out there. It probably isn't a week that goes by that we don't talk to some bankers that are talking about other companies. The great news is we've got a tremendous balance sheet. We're in a fantastic position to be able to build or buy or partner. I think we've been very thoughtful about our acquisitions. A big part of our strategy has been the integration. When you look at Pangea, we're really starting to sell that in Q4 because we wanted to take the time and effort to integrate it. It's not just kind of stitched together.\nThe single platform, which I talked about, is very important to our customers. We're going to continue to be thoughtful. We're going to continue to buy what we perceive as best-of-breed in the market, not legacy technologies. We're going to integrate them, which is part of our customer brand promise. We're going to continue to grow them within our sales motion and the channel that we built. We'll be opportunistic, but we'll also be very strategic in what we buy.\n\nAndy Nowinski\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CrowdStrike\n\nAll right. Thanks for the question. Operator, last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question will come from Adam Borg with Stifel.\n\nAdam Borg\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stifel\n\nAwesome. And thanks much for the question. And Andy, congrats on the role. Maybe just on the identity business, it's great to hear the stronger quarter there qualitatively. I know we've talked in the past about PAM being almost like a 1.0 product. Love to hear more about how you're thinking about that product in particular and the maturity in coming quarters. Thanks so much. Yeah.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nIdentity, as we mentioned, is super important in an AI era, something we got into many years ago, and we continue to evolve that. We've seen some really nice wins specific to our PAM technology. We have to look at what customers are telling us and basically skate to the puck of where they're going, which is they're looking for more modern identity solutions. They're looking for solutions that can do just-in-time and some of the kind of legacy vaulting they'd like to move away from. Those are areas of focus for us. We'll continue to build out our identity stack. It's been very successful for us, but certainly there's more to do.\nThere's more to build out, and there's more opportunity in front of us. The good news is there's demand from customers, as you've seen lots of market movement. As customers think about what they're going to do next, they want to make sure they set themselves up for really in the next era agentic identity, and CrowdStrike will be there for them.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to George Kurtz for closing remarks.\n\nGeorge Kurtz\n\nCEO and Founder, CrowdStrike\n\nThanks to everyone today for your time. We appreciate your continued support. We'll actually be presenting at the UBS conference tomorrow, and a live webcast and replay of the presentation will be available on our IR website. We look forward to seeing many of you at the conference. Thanks so much. Stay safe, and we'll talk soon.\n\nOperator\n\nGoodbye."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Maria, please go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections and expected performance, including our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2026 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nFurther information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in the company's quarterly and annual reports.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures disclosed on this call will be non-GAAP. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings release, which may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you, all, for joining our Q2 FY '26 earnings call. Reflecting on our second quarter, the key theme was reacceleration. We've talked about reacceleration coming in the back half of this fiscal year. It's here now. I'm proud of CrowdStrike's ability to deliver reacceleration, our return to year-over-year net new ARR growth a quarter early. Our reacceleration is driven largely by AI-necessitated demand for the Falcon platform and stellar execution across the business.\nQ2 was a robust quarter where we exceeded all guided metrics. Highlights included: one, record Q2 net new ARR of $221 million, double-digit millions ahead of our expectations, showcasing accelerating net new ARR; two, ending ARR of $4.66 billion, growing more than 20% year-over-year; three, record Q2 free cash flow of $284 million or 24% of revenue; four, record operating income of $255 million or 22% of revenue; five, total revenue growth of 21% year-over-year, reaching $1.17 billion and exceeding the high end of our guidance; six, cloud, Next-Gen Identity, and Next-Gen SIEM platform solutions are now more than $1.56 billion in ending ARR, growing more than 40% year-over-year; and seven, we surpassed the 1,000 Falcon Flex customer milestone with the average Flex customer representing more than $1 million of ending ARR.\nBuilding on last quarter's re-Flex momentum, now more than 100 customers have already re-Flexed. We're very pleased with adoption rates. Seeing so many customers re-Flex validates the Flex model and illustrates customers' accelerating consolidation with CrowdStrike. Quarters like this one highlight our momentum and progress on the path to $10 billion in ending ARR. Setting new records, achieving net new ARR reacceleration sooner than anticipated and rising competitive win rates highlight CrowdStrike leading the way in cybersecurity.\nOur innovative solutions are winning at scale like Exposure Management, which surpassed $300 million in ending ARR and was named a leader in the 2025 IDC Worldwide Exposure Management Marketscape. CrowdStrike's market leadership was further reflected in Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms where we were placed in the Leaderbox for the sixth consecutive year. Our position was furthest right for completeness of vision and highest for ability to execute out of all vendors for the third year in a row.\nIn cybersecurity as well as the broader technology market, AI's impact is palpable. As organizations of all sizes embrace AI transformation, I hear several thematic concerns from executives and Boards. One, where is shadow AI emerging in my business? Two, how do I control what data enters AI systems? Three, how do I control what AI systems can do in my enterprise? Which ultimately leads to the focal question of four, how do I secure AI agents? AI has made the role of CISOs and COOs more complicated than ever.\nAnswering these 4 questions is far too difficult, expensive, nuanced, conditional and incomplete. At the same time, adversaries are now using AI, democratizing destruction at mass scale. Our threat intelligence research uncovered Famous Chollima, a North Korean nexus group, using GenAI to infiltrate more than 320 enterprises by automating fabricated resumes and conducting deepfake interviews. The threat is real.\nCrowdStrike's role in the agentic era is staying ahead of AI-armed threat actors to secure AI at every layer. Beginning with the AI model itself to the workloads and hosts on which they run to the actual human and agentic identities, to the end-user devices accessing these systems and applications. In this time of societal and technological revolution, we secure where AI happens. Enterprises are quickly realizing AI security is not a network problem. AI doesn't happen in transit. Model creation and AI development happens in the cloud and in the data center.\nAI adoption happens at the endpoint on the computing device itself. And AI access happens by users with human and increasingly, nonhuman machine identities. CrowdStrike secures each of these attack surfaces. We deliver AI for security, where we revolutionize security operations with our own SOC agent, Charlotte. We also deliver security for AI helping the world securely adopt the power of agentic outcomes. This combination, grounded in our data foundation, is a competitive moat. You can't just stitch or acquire a unified AI native platform.\nAI security's primary enforcement mechanism is not and will not be the firewall. AI security must be on the devices, workloads, data and identities anywhere, everywhere and always on. AI security and now enterprise security in the agentic era is fundamentally a data, speed and enforcement problem, one that CrowdStrike solves today and is uniquely positioned to solve tomorrow.\nDriving adoption of the Falcon platform as the operating system of cybersecurity is our Next-Gen SIEM. Every day, customers are discovering the power of our native hyperscalable data foundation to solve their most complex security and IT problems. Falcon Next-Gen SIEM had a stellar Q2 with year-over-year growth of more than 95% and ending ARR of more than $430 million. Next-GEN SIEM is becoming synonymous with AI SOC transformation, akin to upgrading from a typewriter to a computer, unlocking new capabilities, cost efficiencies and agentic speed.\nA leading Global 2000 communications platform chose Next-Gen SIEM in a highly competitive 7-figure legacy SIEM replacement. Synthesizing EDR and third-party data proved easier, faster and more effective than going with a network-first SIEM product. And we're not stopping. Today, we're incredibly excited to announce our intent to acquire Onum, a leading data pipeline platform. Built on a proprietary stateless in-memory architecture, we believe Onum is the perfect complement to Next-Gen SIEM. It offers unparalleled speed, scale and efficiency in onboarding to Next-Gen SIEM while giving customers control of their data.\nOnum will bring Falcon's AI-powered detections closer to third-party data sources in pipeline, starting analysis before data even enters the Falcon platform. Here's why Onum stood out to us. One, speed. Onum delivers 5x more events per second than its nearest competitor and processes data in real-time versus legacy batch and store methods. Two cost. Onum's smart filtering reduces data storage costs by 50%. Three, superior outcomes. Onum's real-time pipeline detection starts before data enters the Falcon platform, delivering up to 70% faster incident response with 40% less ingestion overhead. If our Next-Gen SIEM is the engine that powers the modern SOC, then data is the fuel that makes the engine run. Onum is both the pipeline and the filter, streaming high-quality filter fuel quickly into the engine to drive robust, efficient and superior performance.\nWith Onum, CrowdStrike will align with each stage of the AI life cycle, ingestion and detection of data, filtration and optimization of data as well as actioning and enforcement to produce high-fidelity autonomous outcomes across security and nonsecurity use cases. Before, migrating data into Next-Gen SIEM was a long pole in a displacement tent, often requiring third-party tools. Our acquisition of Onum is a direct response to a growing course of frustration with the incomplete data and punitive costs from today's third-party tools.\nWe're forging a new path. Onum and Next-Gen SIEM will enable CrowdStrike customers to focus on earlier in pipeline detection, blazing fast data streaming and high-fidelity data filtration, optimizing the agentic Next-Gen SIEM experience. Most importantly, the acquisition of Onum will give our customers control of their security, observability and IT data, uniquely positioning CrowdStrike as our customers' data foundation.\nWith our performant data platform as its foundation, CrowdStrike is rapidly expanding our pace of AI innovation. Charlotte is our agentic SOC analyst, automating actions and now end-to-end autonomous workflows across the SOC. Charlotte had a record quarter, growing more than 85% over Q1. We're embedding Charlotte across the entirety of the Falcon platform, empowering customers to achieve their agentic security goals out of the box with immediate ROI.\nCharlotte is constantly learning and improving as we train it on our market-leading threat intelligence, battleground incident response and scaled Falcon Complete MDR analyst behavior. As one of cybersecurity's largest MDRs, our Falcon Complete SOC data is akin to the encyclopedia threat telemetry, resulting in a powerful cybersecurity AI feedback loop. Our unique cyber data advantage, coupled with our data science expertise, create a reinforcement learning flywheel, continuously adapting and improving autonomous detection and response.\nThe outcome is Charlotte turning our data moat into a fortified and dynamic AI wall. Our customers are facing AI disruption, which is driving our Next-Gen Identity business. As agentic identities proliferate, customers require an identity security solution to safely leverage agentic AI, preventing exploitation, misuse and breaches. We recently announced the launch of Next-Gen Identity Protection, which extends our best-in-class identity protection to nonhuman identities or NHI, SaaS applications and most importantly, AI agents. Including Falcon Shield, our Next-Gen Identity Protection business exceeded $435 million of ending ARR in Q2, growing more than 21% year-over-year.\nBased on customer demand and seeing another opportunity to innovate, we launched our own PAM offering in Q1. Elevated uncertainty around the future of legacy PAM tools is driving heightened interest in our Next-Gen PAM solution. Driven by the excitement for Next-Gen Identity Protection and Next-Gen Privilege Access, these new solutions significantly expand our identity opportunity.\nA leading global consulting firm decided to replace their legacy PAM after years of frustration with cost, limited efficacy and point product woes. Our ability to deliver privileged account password rotation, privileged user identification and risk assessment, privileged escalation detection, user risk profile insights and flexible MFA controls for different departments helped this customer consolidate with confidence. With nothing new to deploy, this customer seamlessly met all device trust, escalating privilege and cyber insurance requirements.\nMoving to our Cloud business, the rapid adoption of AI has placed a spotlight on the importance of securing cloud infrastructure at run time. While out-of-band posture tools can lend an overall view of security health, they are incapable of stopping breaches. CrowdStrike is a leader in cloud runtime protection with the largest and most sophisticated enterprises trusting us to protect their most critical production environments.\nWith the need to secure AI as a backdrop, we delivered impressive net new ARR in Cloud this past quarter. Total Cloud ending ARR exceeded $700 million, growing more than 35% year-over-year. A Fortune 500 energy supplier selected Falcon Cloud Security in a 7-figure win. The ease of adoption for our single-platform approach and having ASPM already natively integrated drove this win. Our ASPM reduced months of manual work into minutes. Through this upsell, Falcon Cloud Security consolidated more than 10-point products across CNAP, CSPM, ASPM, CDR and container security.\nContributing to our platform growth is our revolutionary Falcon Flex model, helping customers accelerate and maximize Falcon platform adoption. In Q2, we crossed 1,000 Falcon Flex customers, adding more than 220 new Flex customers. Not only are we and our partners successfully landing new Flex deals, we also continue to see increases in: one, platform adoption. Utilization of Flex contracts is more than 75% across the Flex customer base; two, re-Flexes. We more than doubled the number of re-Flexed accounts to nearly 10% of all Flex customers. In just an average of 5 months from their initial Flex subscriptions, this cohort of Flex customers found themselves wanting more modules and more consolidation.\nRe-Flexes on average are yielding a nearly 50% uplift in Flex customer ending ARR, illustrating the strength of the Falcon platform and the power of our game-changing licensing model. Re-Flex activity gives us conviction in our net new ARR acceleration, highlighting the difference between a onetime ELA and the recurring Flex model.\nA lighthouse example of the re-Flex motion was with a Fortune 500 software firm which completed an 8-figure re-Flex. 18 months prior to their initial Flex subscription expiration, this customer decided to take their next strategic step with CrowdStrike, enabling them to modernize their SOC by replacing a legacy SIEM and a hyperscaler SIEM. They also adopted Charlotte to identify threat hunting and SOC operations. What was recently a very successful Flex has become an even more impressive re-Flex.\nConsolidation isn't just a phenomenon with our customers. We also see it with our ecosystem partners. Diverse partner types are continuing to standardize on Falcon as their cybersecurity platform of choice. Take Red Canary, an MDR focused on the mid-market to small enterprise recently acquired by Zscaler, one of our strategic technology partners. Red Canary decided to consolidate and migrate their legacy point product EDR installed base of more than 100,000 endpoints across hundreds of customers onto Falcon.\nThrough a multimillion-dollar Q2 transaction, Red Canary is migrating these customers to CrowdStrike, where they will enjoy Red Canary's MDR services delivered on the Falcon platform. Red Canary is just one of the many MSSPs who build their business on CrowdStrike. Further into the SMB market, Amazon Business Prime selected CrowdStrike Falcon Go for millions of businesses around the world. Business Prime members now receive Falcon Go as part of their subscription, opening a significant sub-100 user TAM. This partnership highlights our ability to strategically monetize new markets and migrate underserved segments from legacy ineffective technologies.\nAnd lastly, industry stalwarts like NVIDIA continue to choose CrowdStrike as their cybersecurity partner of choice. With our recently announced integration of Falcon Cloud Security, with NVIDIA universal LLM NIM microservices and NeMo Safety, NVIDIA customers now benefit from full AI life cycle protection for over 100,000 LLMs through Falcon. Partners sourced over 60% of Q2 new business, highlighting our ecosystem's competitive advantage and leadership across all customer segments.\nI started my remarks talking about acceleration. AI is accelerating every aspect of our society and revolutionizing the way we work, but it's also accelerating the adversary. I know all too well that there is no peace time in cybersecurity. The adversary never rests. The world is soon to embark on the largest arms race ever, the arms race over AI superiority. The world's AI infrastructure necessitates protection from development to deployment, from cloud to endpoint, and from human to agent.\nCrowdStrike isn't just a passenger in this revolution, we're driving it. We're becoming the foundation of our customers' AI future, delivering the security platform that makes AI transformation possible. Looking forward, AI-driven market demand and customer-driven consolidation, brought together by our revolutionary Flex licensing model, drive my belief in sustained growth. In light of the demand environment and our platform superiority, our guidance now assumes back half net new ARR will grow at least 40% versus last year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike's CFO.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong second quarter, exceeding expectations across all guided metrics. We achieved record Q2 net new ARR of $221 million and net new ARR reacceleration a quarter ahead of our expectations, growing ending ARR to $4.66 billion, up 20% over last year. Market demand for our AI native Falcon platform and Falcon Flex subscription model drove strength across the business. The number of deals with total deal value over $10 million doubled year-over-year, and we reached a new milestone of 800 customers with ending ARR exceeding $1 million.\nAs George highlighted, customers are increasingly consolidating their security operations onto the Falcon platform as they modernize their security stack for the AI era. This momentum is reflected in our module adoption metrics with 48%, 33% and 23% of subscription customers adopting 6, 7, and 8 or more modules, respectively. Most notably, among our customers with over $100,000 in ending ARR, we reached a new milestone with 60% adopting 8 or more modules, demonstrating the power of our platform consolidation strategy.\nLooking into the back half of the year, the combination of strong Falcon Flex momentum, record Q3 pipeline and increasing demand for our AI-powered innovations reinforces our conviction in driving year-over-year growth acceleration in both net new ARR and ending ARR. Moreover, we have a clear line of sight to well exceed the $5 billion ending ARR milestone by fiscal year-end, achieving the ambitious goal we set in 2022 as we execute on our path to $10 billion in ending ARR by FY '31.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue exceeded our guidance range and grew 21% over Q2 of last year to reach $1.17 billion. Subscription revenue grew 20% over Q2 of last year to reach $1.10 billion, and professional services revenue was a record $66.0 million. The geographic mix of second quarter revenue consisted of approximately 67% from the U.S. and 33% from international geographies, with both U.S. and EMEA year-over-year growth accelerating compared to Q1.\nTotal non-GAAP gross margin was 78% and non-GAAP subscription gross margin remained best-in-class at 80% of revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were $652.5 million or 56% of revenue. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating income was a record $255.0 million and operating margin was 22%, exceeding our guidance. Strong top line performance and efficiency gains from our strategic plan drove the outperformance in profitability, highlighting our commitment to profitable growth as we accelerate net new ARR growth and execute on the path to achieving our target operating model.\nGAAP net loss attributable to CrowdStrike was $77.7 million and included $35.7 million of expenses for outage and related matters and $38.4 million of strategic plan-related charges. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike was a record $237.4 million or $0.93 on a diluted per share basis, exceeding our guidance. In Q2, our long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate decreased to 21% from 22.5%, reflecting recent changes in tax legislation and resulting in a $0.03 benefit on a diluted per share basis.\nMoving to cash. Our cash and cash equivalents grew to a record $4.97 billion. We generated record Q2 cash flow from operations of $332.8 million and record Q2 free cash flow of $283.6 million or 24% of revenue. Expenses for outage-related and strategic plan costs impacted Q2 free cash flow by approximately $29 million.\nMoving to our outlook and modeling notes. Our leadership is showcased by our record Q2 performance, strong Falcon Flex adoption and expansion, continued strong retention rates and broad success across our AI-powered Falcon platform. This momentum further bolsters our conviction in continued net new ARR acceleration for the back half of FY '26.\nWhile we do not guide to ending ARR or net new ARR, our revenue guidance includes the following assumptions: high single-digit sequential net new ARR growth Q2 to Q3 and at least 40% year-over-year net new ARR growth for the back half of the fiscal year, bringing ending ARR growth for FY '26 to more than 22%. Our revenue guidance also assumes a wider-than-typical range for professional services, given the strong Q2 performance. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, as a result of our successful CCP and related partner programs, our ARR to subscription revenue assumptions includes a separation of $10 million to $15 million per quarter through Q4. When this impact begins to subside, we ask that you please reflect this when updating your models.\nMoving to cash. Payments related to strategic plan costs are expected to be de minimis in Q3, and we expect to make Q3 cash payments of approximately $51 million in connection with outage-related costs. As previously discussed, we expect to exit this fiscal year with a free cash flow margin of 27% in Q4, expanding to more than 30% for the full year FY '27.\nMoving to our outlook. For the third quarter of FY '26, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1,208.0 million to $1,218.0 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $256.0 million to $262.0 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $238.1 million to $242.8 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.93 to $0.95, utilizing a 21% tax rate and weighted average share count of approximately 257 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2026, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $4,749.5 million to $4,805.5 million, reflecting a growth rate of 20% to 22% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $1,000.1 million and $1,040.1 million. We expect fiscal 2026 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $922.4 million and $954.0 million. Utilizing a 21% tax rate and approximately 256 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.72.\nFinally, Fal.Con 2025 begins on Monday, September 15. With over 100 sponsors and over 8,000 attendees, Fal.Con is going to be our largest customer event yet. We will hold an investor briefing during the conference on Wednesday, September 17. The briefing will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. George and I will now take your questions.",

Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining our Q1 FY 2026 earnings call. Our fiscal year started from a position of strength.\nWhile the market navigates evolving condition, CrowdStrike is capitalizing on accelerated demand through continuous innovation, increasing win rates and platform consolidation at scale. We consolidate point products without compromise and most importantly, CrowdStrike stops the breach.\nIn Q1, where we met or exceeded our key metrics, highlights include: one, Q1 net new ARR of $194 million, double-digit millions ahead of our expectations; two, Q1 ending ARR surpassing $4.4 billion, maintaining our leadership as the only pure-play cybersecurity software company of this size; three, subscription gross margin of 80%, demonstrating our AI platform efficiency; four, sustained 97% gross retention as customers remain firmly committed to Falcon; five, free cash flow of $279 million or 25% of revenue, demonstrating double-digit quarter-on-quarter growth; and six added $774 million of total Falcon Flex account value bringing the total deal value of accounts that have adopted Falcon Flex to $3.2 billion, growing 31% sequentially and more than 6x year-over-year.\nSeeing our customers an ecosystem embrace Falcon Flex at this speed and scale gives me confidence, confidence in improving sequential net new ARR growth next quarter and accelerating back half net new ARR. Falcon Flex is significantly evolving our go-to-market and customer experience. The subscription model sparks Falcon platform adoption, delivers point product consolidation and fuels partner success.\nI'd like to share where we are with Falcon Flex as well as a thematic customer win showcasing the power of the model. In less than 2 years since starting Falcon Flex, we've closed more than $3.2 billion of total account deal value across more than 820 accounts that have adopted the subscription model.\nHere are the trends we're seeing. One, customers spend more, the average Flex customer deal size is greater than $1 million in ending ARR; two, customers commit to longer durations, the average Flex subscription length is 31 months; and three, Flex customers adopt Falcon faster, more than 75% of Flex contracts are already deployed.\nThe outcome of these points taken together as a phenomenon we're already seeing reflexes, 39 Flex customers have already deployed their initial contract demand plan and have returned to us for a reflex. These customers' initial Flex contracts were 35 months, nearly 3 years on average, and within just 5 months, they came back to CrowdStrike wanting more of the Falcon platform to achieve their cybersecurity consolidation goals.\nThe model we pioneered is a game changer. Flex accelerates what would have taken years of module sales cycles into rapid platform transformations unlocking adoption and spend while creating even more platform stickiness.\nNow let's witness Flex in action at a Fortune 100 technology firm. We began our relationship with this account pre Falcon Flex when they selected CrowdStrike to displace and consolidate a point product EDR and legacy AV. Our initial EDR contract was for $12 million over a 3-year term. When we launched Falcon Flex, this customer took the opportunity to accelerate their cybersecurity modernization, executing a 5-year $100 million-plus contract. This is the power of Flex, evolving Falcon from what was a singular outcome sale into a multidimensional platform experience more than 8x the size of the initial deal.\nThis transformational Flex contract was for securing cloud workloads, expanding in other business units, Next-Gen SIEM to replace 2 legacy SIEMs and broad-based adoption of Falcon Complete to standardize detection and response. Within just 9 months of the initial Flex contract, this customer had already utilized 95% and of their initial subscription and still had more point products to consolidate and cybersecurity outcomes to deliver.\nAs a result, in Q1, this customer reflected to realize the following new outcomes: Expansion of Falcon endpoint protection across multiple additional business units, replacing and consolidating cloud protection with Falcon Cloud Security, which has since become the standard across a vast and growing cloud estate. Identity protection became an imperative across sensitive assets.\nNext-Gen SIEM quickly became the central enterprise data store replacing multiple legacy SIEMs and expanding beyond security use cases into IT. Data protection is replacing legacy DLP from endpoint to cloud, Falcon for IT is replacing a legacy endpoint management tool and Charlotte AI will deliver agentic analyst capabilities and automation, accelerating security outcomes at scale.\nThis customer more than doubled their initial Flex subscription in their Q1 9-figure reflex over an unchanged subscription duration. Through Flex, this customer now spends nearly 20x their initial EDR purchase. Replacing more than 8 technologies and deploying more than 10 Falcon modules, this customer still has much more to achieve with the Falcon platform across millions of workloads, petabytes of data and hundreds of thousands of identities.\nWith Flex dramatically accelerating Falcon platform adoption, customers are already seeing our Agentic AI transforming their security outcomes. We're on the cusp of the fifth industrial revolution with artificial general intelligence on the horizon.\nWhat excites me the most is the necessity Agentic AI is creating for CrowdStrike's AI-native security, growing our total addressable market each and every day. Here's why and how. In a recent market survey, 96% of respondents plan to expand their use of AI agents in the next 12 months with 2/3 already building agents and some targeting to reach over 1 billion in production agents. At their core, every AI agent represents a unique superhuman identity, necessitating visibility, control and protection for every single agent.\nThese autonomous AI agents increasingly have access to multiple internal and external data stores, applications and machines, automating business processes and workflows at scale. Simply put, AI agents dramatically increased the size, severity and speed of the enterprise attack surface. Size, more agents everywhere. Severity, everything is connected faster than it can be contained. Speed, autonomous agents move at machine speed.\nThis is the new attack surface, and it's an adversaries paradise. Just as enterprises need best-in-class protection for devices, data workloads and human identities, every AI agent has the same needs too. As an AI-first company, CrowdStrike is uniquely positioned to secure the identity, the workload, the infrastructure, the data and underlying AI models themselves.\nWe have the platform, we have the expertise, we have a track record. CrowdStrike will be the protector of autonomous AI agents. While we see a massive opportunity to protect AI agents, our use of Agentic AI is already transforming the SOC. Charlotte AI is our genic security analyst, completing tasks and making decisions to supercharge human stock personnel.\nWith the launch of Charlotte AI's expanded detection triage customers now have access to an agentic SOC analyst delivering autonomous expert-level triage, reasoning and response at machine speed, flattening the hiring curve, saving time and delivering even better security outcomes.\nThe power of Charlotte AI came to life in an 8-figure Falcon Flex expansion for a global health care provider. Charlotte AI was the tip of the spear in this customer's AI-native SOC transformation with Next-Gen SIEM, where we displaced a legacy SIEM. Charlotte AI and Next-Gen SIEM started a new chapter of cybersecurity for this customer.\nCharlotte AI enables this customer's Level 1 threat analyst team delivering on the promise of Agentic security today. We deliver an AI-first automated approach, eliminating clicks, panes of glass and manual operations for a predictive, fast and cost-efficient SOC.\nNext, I'll share updates on the momentum we're experiencing in our cloud, identity, exposure management and Next-Gen SIEM platform products.\nFirst, turning to our cloud business. Cloud had a very strong start to the year with Q1 net new and total ARR growth accelerating year-over-year over the prior quarter. Our native unified offering combines cloud workload protection, posture management, application security and SaaS security on a single back end and with both agent and ageless form factors.\nIn Q1, we built on this approach with the launch of cloud data protection, all on our unified sensor, the very same sensor that also delivers our world-class workload protection which is what the market now wants and needs. Our innovation and commercial success was recognized in the 2025 Frost Radar, cloud and application runtime security report where we scored highest out of all vendors on the innovation index.\nFurther driving our success is recent M&A in the space, increasing our relevance and competitiveness as a hyperscaler agnostic, independent solution. We also announced the general availability of both our AI model scanning and AI security dashboard technologies at RSA.\nWith the rapid growth of AI tools across the enterprise, CrowdStrike is ensuring that enterprises can safely adopt AI while managing potential risk such as model vulnerabilities, data leakage, unsanctioned use an identity-based privilege. A prime example of a customer adopting Falcon Cloud Security was a 7-figure technology customer doubling their spend with us.\nThis customer had CrowdStrike on the endpoint and was using a competitor's point product, CSPM for cloud protection. The incident response call came into CrowdStrike when the competitor's CSPM didn't stop the breach. Our rapid platform expansion, including Falcon Cloud Security quickly illustrated the difference between just alerting on a breach and actually stopping one. This customer was able to consolidate on Falcon, save money and most importantly, see the benefits of Falcon Cloud securities protection.\nMoving on to our Exposure Management business, which includes vulnerability management and attack surface management. CrowdStrike is rapidly evolving from an incumbent complement to a scaled disruptor. Historically, our biggest displacement gap was the lack of network scanning, something near and dear to me as someone who pioneered the vulnerability management space.\nWith the launch of AI-powered network vulnerability assessment, CrowdStrike now delivers unified exposure management for both managed and unmanaged devices. With this innovation, CrowdStrike customers no longer need to rely on legacy third-party VM point products. Our winning offering in this space is yielding exciting share gains.\nA large financial services customer purchased Falcon Exposure Management across 120,000 devices through their Flex subscription. Utilizing Charlotte AI and Falcon Exposure Management together allows for AI to finally automate vulnerability detection.\nNow with network vulnerability scanning, this customer is moving away from their long-standing legacy VM vendor and their existing attack surface management vendor as well.\nMoving on to our Next-Gen SIEM business, where we're disrupting the proverbial horse and buggy with the combustion engine. Our Next-Gen SIEM delivered triple-digit ending ARR growth while displacing antiquated, expensive and poor performing point products. With LogScale as a foundational component of the Falcon platform, we're creating even deeper tie-ins across the rest of the CrowdStrike and third-party ecosystem.\nThis quarter, we announced Falcon Adversary Overwatch for Next-Gen SIEM, which brings together our world-class threat hunting and our hyperperformance cost-efficient data platform. This makes the AI-powered SOC turnkey hunting across native and third-party data with real-time intelligence and automation to deliver full visibility, high fidelity alerts and accelerated response.\nThis is exactly why a leading payments company displace the legacy SIEM in a large 7-figure win. Next-Gen SIEM was our entry point to the account where they were frustrated with ballooning costs, latency and complexity, substantially faster query times accelerated and customizable dashboarding and significant cost savings resulted in this new logo win.\nWithin our Identity business, we continued rapid expansion in both coverage and functionality. In April, we announced the general availability of Falcon Privileged Access. Before CrowdStrike's identity customers relied on third-party integrations for enforcement. Today, CrowdStrike customers experience just-in-time access and permissions for critical applications and services all within our single AI native platform.\nThe need is real, a foreign government expanded their 7-figure existing Falcon platform subscription with identity protection, gaining insights into stale accounts, exposed credentials, shared passwords and agent free unmanageable devices went beyond the incumbents limited approach Falcon was the clear winner of providing immediate time to value in securing identities.\nOur ecosystem partners continue accelerating CrowdStrike's growth with 60% of our Q1 annual deal value sourced by partners. Several highlights include: first, GuidePoint joins our $1 billion partner ranks as our fifth partner to achieve this noteworthy milestone joining AWS, Optiv, CDW and SHI and further cementing CrowdStrike as cybersecurity's benchmark for partner success.\nSecond, our MSSP business continues growing at a rapid pace, now representing more than 15% of our Q1 deal value. We won our largest Latin American deal of all time through our MSSP channel last quarter. And third, NVIDIA's recently announced Enterprise AI factory, their reference AI architecture integrates Falcon as the cybersecurity standard for securing NVIDIA's hardware and software.\nA marquee partnership with Microsoft, which we announced yesterday, highlights our bold ecosystem leadership. Since last summer, we've worked to find common ground where together, we can make the world a safer, more resilient place. I was pleased to have Satya joined me at Fal.Con last fall. And yesterday, we announced a joint threat actor strategic collaboration where we map each other's adversaries naming conventions.\nThrough this Rosetta Stone collaboration, we unite defenders in knowing the adversary, both in our nomenclature and Microsoft, so they can better defend. Together, we take the guesswork out of adversary attribution for the benefit of our joint customers and the entire market. In closing, I'm very pleased with where we are and even more excited about where we're going.\nQ2 will be a quarter of improving sequential net new ARR growth followed by back half net new ARR acceleration. Here's why the platform wins across 30 Falcon modules. We have the products and innovation engine that stops breaches. In addition, we're seeing momentum build across the entire business.\nI began today's comments talking about uncertainties facing the world. What's certain is that the world increasingly needs cybersecurity and increasingly needs CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike is best positioned to protect the workloads, identities, data and infrastructure for the AI age and the superhuman AI agents themselves.\nOur Falcon Flex subscription model is accelerating platform adoption at a faster pace than we've ever seen before, and our execution is delivering speed and efficiency across the business.\nIt's all of these elements together that gives me confidence and excitement in our future, and that's why the company has authorized up to $1 billion in share repurchases. We -- I'm more certain than I have ever been of CrowdStrike's place as the world's leading cybersecurity platform for the AI era with the unequivocal mission of stopping breaches. Thank you to our team, partners and customers who tell me that they cannot live without CrowdStrike.\nAnd I'll now turn the call over to Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike's CFO.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP.\nCrowdStrike delivered a strong first quarter to kick off the new fiscal year. Our robust Q1 performance, focused execution and growing Falcon Flex momentum, including reflexes further reinforce our conviction in improved sequential net new ARR growth in Q2 as well as net new ARR reacceleration and margin expansion in the second half of FY '26.\nAnd -- Additionally, the share repurchase authorization of up to $1 billion that we announced today reflects our confidence in CrowdStrike's long-term strategy, including M&A, growth prospects and robust cash flow generation capabilities as we scale on the path to $10 billion in ending ARR.\nWe will continue to prioritize investing in our growth and innovation while retaining the flexibility to opportunistically repurchase shares to maximize returns and deliver increased value to our shareholders.\nIn Q1, we achieved net new ARR of $194 million, growing ending ARR to $4.44 billion, up 22% over last year. Highlights in the quarter included significant big deal activity driven by Falcon Flex Momentum and Reflexes, record MSSP channel results, strength in multiple geographies, including the U.S., Europe, Canada, Japan and Latin America, deep platform adoption with subscription customers with 6, 7 and 8 or more modules, representing 48%, 32% and 22%, respectively, strong and increasing competitive win rates and sustained 97% gross retention and consistently strong net retention in line with our expectations, demonstrating our success in both customer retention and expansion.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue was within our guidance range and grew 20% over Q1 of last year to reach $1.10 billion, subscription revenue grew 20% over Q1 of last year to reach $1.05 billion and professional service revenue was a record $52.7 million. The geographic mix of first quarter revenue consisted of approximately 67% from the U.S. and 33% from international geographies.\nTotal gross margin was 78% and subscription gross margin was best-in-class at 80% of revenue. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $656.0 million or 59% of revenue. In the first quarter, non-GAAP operating income was $201.1 million and operating margin was 18%, exceeding our guidance.\nWe achieved strong non-GAAP operating income performance alongside strategic upfront investments in internal automation, go-to-market and AI innovation. We expect these investments to fuel our growth in the back half of FY '26 and beyond as we progress towards our long-term targets.\nGAAP net loss attributable to CrowdStrike was $110.2 million and included $39.7 million of expenses for outage and related matters. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike was $184.7 million or $0.73 on a diluted per share basis, exceeding our guidance.\nCash and cash equivalents grew to a record $4.61 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $384.1 million and free cash flow was $279.4 million or 25% of revenue. Expenses for outage and related matters impacted Q1 free cash flow by approximately $61 million.\nMoving to our outlook and modeling notes. We believe cybersecurity remains mission-critical in today's AI-accelerated threat environment. We continue to see strong demand for the Falcon platform, growing momentum with Falcon Flex, including reflexes and a robust and growing pipeline building for the second half of FY '26.\nWe -- while we do not guide to net new ARR, our Q2 assumptions include the sequential net new ARR growth rate to be at least double over what we saw from Q1 to Q2 in the prior fiscal year. I'd like to take a minute to discuss the near-term relationship between ARR and subscription revenue in FY '26.\nAnd -- as we previously discussed, our successful CCP program that concluded in Q4 of FY '25 provided customers the onetime ability to choose more product, more time or both, which results in an impact to subscription revenue. In addition, a limited special partner program related to CCP success also has an amortization impact on subscription revenue.\nAs a result of these CCP-related programs, we expect to see a temporary near-term separation between ARR and subscription revenue recognition, which was reflected in our revenue guidance. This amounted to approximately $11 million in Q1. We expect the impact to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in each remaining quarter of this fiscal year, subsiding in Q4.\nWe -- moving to the strategic realignment plan we announced in early May, we continuously look for optimizations and efficiencies across the business. We identified opportunities to reallocate and focus investment in one platform growth areas of Cloud, Identity, Exposure Management, AI and Next-Gen SIEM as well as platform resilience; two, AI to accelerate our internal execution and efficiency; and three, go-to-market and customer success as we scale.\nThe timing of executing the realignment in early May was focused on minimizing in-quarter business disruption while maximizing in-quarter financial benefit. We expect the full benefit of the realignment to add at least 1% to next year's non-GAAP operating margin from our previously discussed target, increasing our target in FY '27 to at least 24%. And -- Additionally, we now anticipate an FY '27 improved free cash flow margin of more than 30%.\nMoving to cash. We expect to incur Q2 cash charges of approximately $26 million in connection with the aforementioned strategic plan. Additionally, we expect Q2 free cash flow to be impacted by approximately $29 million for outage and related expenses. As I just mentioned, we now anticipate an FY '27 free cash flow margin of more than 30%.\nMoving to our outlook. For the second quarter of FY '26, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 1,144.7 million to $1,151.6 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 19%. And -- we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $226.9 million to $233.1 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $209.1 million to $213.8 million.\nWe expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.82 to $0.84, and -- utilizing a 22.5% tax rate and weighted average share count of approximately 255 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2026, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $4,743.5 million to $4,805.5 million, reflecting a growth rate of 20% to 22% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $970.8 million to $1,010.8 million. We expect fiscal 2026 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $878.7 million and $909.7 million.\nUtilizing a 22.5% tax rate and approximately 256 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.44 to $3.56.\nPlease refer to our earnings presentation with additional modeling notes that we just posted on the website. George and I will now take your questions.",

Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today for our Q4 2025 earnings call. I'm extremely proud of the engagement we've had with customers, partners, prospects in the market, navigating a year that tested CrowdStrike. Q4 showcases the fruits of our labors, giving me a strong conviction in our AI native single platform, excellent execution and accelerating market opportunity.\nQ4 and FY 2025 highlights include: Q4 net new ARR of $224 million, well ahead of our expectations closing FY 2025 at $4.24 billion in ending ARR. FY '25 ending ARR for Cloud Security, Identity Protection and Next-Gen SIEM of over $1.3 billion, growing nearly 15% year-over-year. Gross dollar retention of 97% as customers remain firmly committed to the Falcon platform. Q4 free cash flow of $240 million and for the full year, we delivered free cash flow of $1.07 billion or 27% of revenue, setting a new record and for the first time exceeding $1 billion in annual free cash flow.\nCrowdStrike is the first cybersecurity ISV to cross $1 billion in deal value on AWS Marketplace in a single calendar year, setting a new standard for ecosystem execution and record and accelerating FY '25 total contract value of $6 billion, the first and only pure-play software cybersecurity company reported to achieve this metric, which increased 40% year-on-year, showcasing the scale and commitment of customers' long-term cybersecurity consolidation on the Falcon platform.\nEveryone loves a comeback story and that's exactly what we've started experiencing in Q4 as we've closed out the year. The results tell our story. One, we've never been closer to our customers and partners with market-leading customer satisfaction levels, two, we're playing best-in-class defense as well as offense with our Falcon Flex subscription model; and three, our innovation engine hasn't missed a beat, the Falcon platform has never been more market competitive, whether that's winning new logos or a third-party analyst research.\nWe find ourselves placed at the epicenter of a rapidly evolving demand environment, a new administration, a new wave of technology and a new threat landscape necessitate all businesses to evolve their cybersecurity programs. Consolidation, cost reduction and automation are now the accepted enterprise and federal priorities. These priorities are accelerating the shift from ineffective, narrow or duplicative point products.\nI'd like to share AI-specific trends on the broader demand environment and how these trends relate to CrowdStrike. First, AI experimentation is just starting to evolve into AI outcomes, second, we're in the midst of a rapidly accelerating geopolitical AI armed race and third, winning the AI war requires the very best data and battle-tested innovation engine.\nCommenting on the shift from AI experimentation to AI outcomes. We're still in the early but rapidly evolving innings of the AI revolution. Businesses and governments across the globe are looking for their AI investments to yield both improved efficiencies and novel outputs. At CrowdStrike, where we're acquiring every team and function to leverage the power of AI. We expect these investments to play critical top and bottom line roles on our path to $10 billion in ARR.\nIn the broader market, businesses are equally grappling with how to secure their environments in this AI age. Here's my take on what this means. First, more AI everywhere means more data, more access and more processes, services and products requiring cybersecurity. The locales of AI adoption are either in cloud workloads or data centers or even on edge devices, all of which we are market leaders in securing with AI native technology that stops the breach; second, more access to more third-party and in-house Agentic applications and services requires rethinking identity and data protection,; who is accessing data and where is it traveling, matters more now than ever before; and third, securing AI starts a broader enterprise data discussion. I'm seeing CISOs, CIOs and CEOs going to the drawing board to reinvent their technology stack with AI-powered platforms of record for their next decade and beyond. And for security, it's even more pressing.\nFor our customers, Falcon has quickly become their AI native SOC. Charlotte, our generative AI security analyst is a SOC analyst best friend in already driving tangible AI outcomes. Charlotte AI detection Triage accelerates SOC operations and threat response times. Across more than 100 Q4 Charlotte AI deals, customers are seeing outcomes, sharing feedback like what we've received from a European financial services firm, which stated Charlotte AI has been very useful for us. It's done summarization of activity on host and users in 10 to 15 seconds, which would have taken us 20 to 30 minutes to do manually.\nReturning to my second point on the geopolitical AI arms race. Our threat intelligence practice sees nation-state cyber craft proliferation at all-time new highs. A new wave of nationalism and threat actors is creating adversary stockpiling akin to the cold war era. In our recently released annual global threat report, we exposed China Nexus adversaries escalating state-sponsored cyber operations by 150%, with targeted attacks in financial services, media, manufacturing and industrial sectors soaring up to 300% and -- and with tools such as DeepSeek making AI access easier and cheaper, the pace and prevalence of adversarial AI adoption is only accelerating.\nIt is in this intensifying threat landscape that CrowdStrike and our threat intelligence expertise shines. Q4 was our largest threat intelligence quarter in company history. Governments and enterprises increasingly turned to CrowdStrike, especially in a competitive environment where M&A activity has subsumed many existing threat intelligence vendors. We're the market's leading threat intelligence authority, discovering and naming the adversaries to unite Cyber defenders in stopping them. The democratization of destruction, AI in the hands of more adversaries intensifies the market need for CrowdStrike.\nAnd lastly, my third point, CrowdStrike is manufacturing the instruments to win the AI war. We have the innovation engine and the security data to fuel it.\nFinally, in this AI fuel demand environment, the point product vendors and those that have failed to deliver open and native single platforms increasingly fall short. CrowdStrike is cyber security's AI native SOC. Our greatest asset is our role as the creator of cybersecurity's richest data. We've curated this data set with millions of Falcon Complete analysts and notations, making threat data contextualized and actionable. No one else has this. Our data is liquid gold for creating new Agentic models for continuously improving protection.\nFalcon is purpose built to win the AI War with market-leading protection. As the first call for organizations large and small to stop the breach, we see where others fall short. We saw an uptick in incident response engagements in Q4. Thematically, these organizations were using a next-gen EDR vendors technology, where we saw one of our strongest competitive displacement quarters in a logistics software vendor, a national packaging and marketing firm and security software provider to name a few. Falcon's efficacy and rapid ease of deployment is why CrowdStrike is the first call to stop the breach.\nWe've also innovated in devising the most effective model for customers to adopt the Falcon platform, Falcon Flex. Falcon Flex is a subscription model that enables customers to adopt the modules they want across their subscription term. This model deeply resonates with prospects and customers as well as our ecosystem partners.\nFollowing the summer's incident, we worked with impacted customers to offer them Customer Commitment Packages, CCP, largely in the form of additional product and Falcon Flex subscriptions. The CCP program was a Falcon Flex accelerant. In Q3, we shared accounts that adopted the Falcon Flex model representing more than $1.3 billion of total deal value. In Q4 alone, we added over $1 billion of total account Flex deal value, with accounts that adopted Falcon Flex soaring to $2.5 billion in total deal value, growing 80% quarter-over-quarter and growing more than 10x year-over-year.\nOur ability to close Falcon Flex deals at size and scale shows customers' long-term commitment to CrowdStrike and was a key contributor to our TCV acceleration. This commitment is supported by action deploying more Falcon modules and consolidating on the platform. With more than 60% of Falcon Flex deal value already deployed by customers to date, we are pleased with the deployment stats.\nFalcon Flex is a game changer, accelerating module adoption and making it easier and faster than ever before to consolidate on Falcon. With the summer now several quarters behind us, we're ending our Customer Commitment Package program. The CCP program was an excellent proactive measure, which not only built our relationship with impacted customers but also resulted in significant platform adoption. This uptake gives me confidence in our second half net new ARR reacceleration as products are deployed, onetime discounts drop off and contracts are upsized and renewed.\nAnd one of the biggest beneficiaries of Falcon Flex is the accelerated adoption of our rapidly emerging platform solutions. In the past, we've discussed 3 core solutions: Cloud, Identity and Next-Gen SIEM. This quarter, I'd also like to provide an update on our Exposure Management business, which is displacing legacy vulnerability management products and has swiftly become a meaningful contributor to the business with line of sight to $300 million in ARR.\nStarting with Cloud. Our Cloud Security business delivered a strong Q4 and growing more than 45% with ending ARR more than $600 million. The cloud is central to the AI revolution, providing the core infrastructure to enable enterprises to harness the power of AI across their businesses.\nCloud security has never been more important. We're seeing 2 core trends emerge in the cloud security market. First, the core mechanism for protecting the cloud is run time protection, where CrowdStrike is uniquely positioned to deliver the best and most comprehensive workload protection in the industry. We are the cloud runtime security vendor.\nWhile others are trying to catch up, CrowdStrike has delivered frictionless CWP for years, battle tested to stop cloud breaches.\nAnd second, the market for cloud security is rapidly consolidating with customers looking for an integrated end-to-end platform where the sum of the parts is greater than the individual pieces. This is the promise on which Falcon Cloud Security delivers. By securing the entirety of the AI infrastructure from workload to LLM, CrowdStrike is enabling enterprises to harness the power of AI securely.\nA key win in the quarter was an 8-figure Falcon Flex transaction for a major global financial services holding company, where we displaced a network security vendors multiplatform cloud offering. CrowdStrike Financial Services made it even easier to go all in with Falcon, committing to a large multiyear deal. [indiscernible] consoles got in the way of seamless SOC operations. Falcon Cloud Security was far easier to manage in a single console and provided all the right security controls to stop cloud breaches.\nMoving on to our Identity business, which grew to more than $370 million in ending ARR. Our Identity business continues to benefit from several key trends, including the rapidly growing identity attack surface. In addition, our vision for the recently acquired Adaptive Shield business, now called Falcon Shield, secures identities everywhere, whether on-premises, in SaaS applications or within hyperscaler infrastructure.\nA key Identity win was a large state university hospital system that consolidated on Falcon in a 7-figure deal. The CSO secured independent budget for Falcon because of the operational superiority of our identity protection module. Specifically, this university had enough of a competitor's identity protection bolt-on product that produced too many false positives.\nMoving on to our Next-Gen SIEM business. which grew more than 115% year-over-year, finishing the year at more than $330 million in ending ARR. Next-Gen SIEM is rapidly breaking out as a foundational cornerstone of the integrated Falcon platform, offering unmatched speed, scalability and cost efficiency compared to legacy SIEMs. We believe the coupling of Next-Gen SIEM alongside our native first-party data and the Agentic power of Charlotte AI gives CrowdStrike a unique advantage to continue leading the AI security revolution. This is why CrowdStrike is uniquely delivering the AI SOC of the future today.\nA key 7-figure Next-Gen SIEM win from the quarter was a major U.S. airline, which also ranks as one of the top of global airlines by passengers carried. This airline selected CrowdStrike to replace legacy AV in the fall and then turn to us to replace their legacy radar SIEM. Falcon Next-Gen SIEMs, ease-of-use, incident workbench and ease of data ingestion prevailed over a network security vendor and hyperscaler SIEM. In total, our cloud identity and Next-Gen SIEM businesses represent more than $1.3 billion in ending ARR growing nearly 50% year-over-year.\nWhile each of these businesses can stand on their own, it's the combination of these technologies, when delivered together alongside the broader Falcon platform that continues to propel CrowdStrike forward as the only true single platform on the market today.\nAnd finally, for the first time, I'm excited to discuss our exposure management business which has quickly become a market disruptor. CrowdStrike Exposure Management offers both native vulnerability management for devices and applications, coupled with integrated attack surface management. This enables features like attack path analysis and dramatically improved vulnerability prioritization.\nOur customers are already replacing legacy vulnerability management products at scale. Exposure Management wins are easy module attaches to Falcon Flex deals, and we're closing them with regularity as we consolidate out legacy vulnerability management vendors. Representative wins include a large digital radio station, a multinational shipping line and a large health care provider in Asia Pacific.\nCybersecurity's leading partners see CrowdStrike as a generational opportunity. Our ecosystem is a key growth lever on our $10 billion ARR journey, already returning significant dividends. From a dealer origination standpoint, partners source 60% of our new business in the fiscal year, validating our partner first strategy and ecosystem investments.\nIn particular, Next-Gen SIEM has attracted the interest of the GSI community given their experience configuring the SIEMs of yesterday and the market opportunity to displace these legacy products. In addition, the Falcon Flex subscription model fits the GSI selling motion with incentives for customer Flex utilization. Our GSI business neared the $1 billion milestone in FY '25, growing north of 40% year-over-year. Leading GSIs like Accenture, Deloitte, EY, HCL, Wipro, NTT TCS, Infosys and Cognitive are investing in their Falcon Services practice, and I expect us to see continued growth from these partners this fiscal year.\nOur MSSP go-to-market continues to expand at a hyper growth pace, addressing the needs of small to medium businesses who want their cybersecurity program fully managed. MSSP contributed nearly 15% of our new business in FY '25, signifying a route to market, which has quickly grown and scaled over the past 2 years.\nAll of our go-to-market partners benefit from our deep investment and strategic focus on cloud marketplaces. We recently announced being the first cybersecurity ISV to achieve more than $1 billion in sales on the AWS Marketplace in 1 calendar year. We also had a noteworthy year with Google Marketplace, where in our first year of partnership, we did over $150 million in deal value out of the gate. We have aligned our partner ecosystem around hyperscaler marketplaces where we see larger deal sizes and faster deal cycle times.\nIn closing, we are cybersecurity's AI native Agenetic platform that stops the breach. Our innovation engine enables us to be a consolidating force for secure AI transformation. Our platform wins Seven modules are each now individually over $300 million in ending ARR, demonstrating the power of our innovation in driving record adoption and Falcon's multi-act platform opportunity that continues to drive growth.\nAnd our go-to-market execution momentum is unprecedented. Businesses are speaking with their wallets, investing in CrowdStrike to secure their futures. Today, including our end customers and those of our MSSPs, CrowdStrike is trusted by more than 74,000 organizations as their cybersecurity platform of choice, growing more than 30% year-over-year. And in Q4 alone, we've closed new records in every total deal value segment.\nOver 20 deals greater than $10 million, over 350 deals greater than $1 million, over 2,300 deals greater than $100,000, and that was all in Q4. I -- the data tells me that customers trust CrowdStrike, partners Trust CrowdStrike and the market trust CrowdStrike. I open with everyone loving a good comeback story. Ours was forged by the trust of our customers, the dedication of our team and the loyalty of our partners. For that, I am truly grateful.\nOne thing is certain in our AI evolving world. cybersecurity will be an increasingly essential ingredient for life in the AI era. And now more than ever, the world needs CrowdStrike.\nI'll now turn the call over to Burt Podbere, CrowdStrike's CFO.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP.\nA -- CrowdStrike delivered a strong fourth quarter and finish to the year, achieving results above our stated expectations across all guided metrics and demonstrating our ability to adapt to unexpected challenges and emerge stronger.\nSeveral key areas from our performance and outlook demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business, including: first, the strength of our results demonstrates the power of our business model and sales execution highlighted by our record total contract value reaching $6 billion in FY '25, with growth accelerating to 40% year-over-year.\nSecond, the successful completion of our Customer Commitment Program, which accelerated platform adoption and deepened customer relationships. Our success is demonstrated by Falcon Flex customers adding over $1 billion in Q4 account value and our strong gross retention rate of 97%.\nAnd third, as we look ahead our visibility is improving. We expect net new ARR reacceleration as well as operating margin and free cash flow margin expansion in the second half of FY '26. We -- we believe this momentum will set the stage for further acceleration in FY '27 over FY '26 and position us well to achieve our long-term targets.\nFor the full fiscal year, we achieved 23% and 29% ending ARR and total revenue growth, respectively. Operating income grew 27% year-over-year to reach a record $837.7 million, or 21% of revenue. Net income attributable to CrowdStrike and EPS grew 31% and 27%, respectively, to reach a record $987.6 million or $3.93 per diluted share. Free cash flow grew 14% year-over-year to reach a record $1.07 billion or 27% of revenue.\nFor the fourth quarter, we achieved net new ARR of $224 million and ending ARR grew 23% over last year to reach $4.24 billion. Our fourth quarter results showcase the success of our go-to-market and single platform strategies.\nFalcon Flex momentum is increasing. Accelerating platform adoption and our strong sales execution positions us to extend our market leadership with the AI-native Falcon platform. Additionally, we entered the new fiscal year with a healthy pipeline as we continue to see robust demand for both prospective and existing customers.\nIn Q4, we completed our very successful Customer Commitment Program. We estimate that the ARR value of customer commitment packages provided in Q4 was approximately $56 million, bringing the estimated value for the fiscal year to approximately $80 million.\nWhile this exceeded our expectations in Q4 as we concluded the program, the majority of deals that closed with customer commitment packages in the quarter included additional product or Flex dollars, rather than extended time and professional services. We view this as a positive for the business as it demonstrates customers' trust in our long-term partnership and importantly, drives bigger deals and increased levels of platform adoption as customers further consolidate onto the Falcon platform.\nAnd as George stated, the success of the program, combined with the strong uptake of Falcon Flex gives us confidence in future net new ARR reacceleration as products are deployed, onetime discounts expire and contracts are upsized and renewed.\nThis dynamic also limited the impact on Q4 revenue, which was de minimis and well below our $30 million expectation, contributing to our strong revenue beat for the quarter.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are seeing substantial increases in Falcon platform adoption, accelerated by our Falcon Flex subscription model. In Q4, subscription customers were 6, 7 and 8 or more modules grew to 48%, 32% and 21% of subscription customers, respectively. Notably, customers with 5 or more modules reached an all-time high of 67% and on average, new customers are landing with at least 5 modules. Given this new heightened level of platform adoption on a broad scale, we will discontinue the 5 or more metric.\nOur Falcon Flex program fueled an acceleration in platform adoption in FY '25. With Falcon Flex customers adopting more than 9 modules on average, Flex is our future. Additionally, in Q3 of FY '25, we announced the launch of CrowdStrike Financial Services, or CFS, and have already closed deals worth over $140 million through the program in FY '25. CFS enhances our customers' ability to do larger and longer-term deals with us, further enabling future platform adoption and strategic Falcon Flex deals.\nAs our growing module adoption demonstrates, customers are purchasing the Falcon platform for a strategic, long-term single platform standardization and increasingly leveraging Falcon Flex as the vehicle for these purchases.\nIn addition to accelerating module adoption, our strong customer relationships underpin our exceptional customer retention. Gross retention in Q4 remained high at 97%, and our dollar-based net retention rate was 112%, and -- reflecting the impact of customer commitment packages. Given the size and scale of our business, we're very pleased with our net retention.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 25% over Q4 of last year to reach $1.06 billion ahead of our expectations. Subscription revenue reached a new milestone of over $1 billion in quarterly revenue, growing 27% year-over-year to $1.01 billion, while professional services revenue was $50.2 million. Total gross margin was 78% and subscription gross margin was over 80% of revenue, both in line with last year's Q4 performance.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $607.8 million compared to $448.1 million in the prior year. In Q4, we continued our disciplined approach to investing, prioritizing investments in platform innovation and resiliency. Our customer-first mindset is central to our approach to innovation and the driving force behind the success of our single platform strategy and industry-leading retention rates. In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew to $217.3 million and operating margin was 21%, well ahead of our guidance.\nOur investments in AI are driving significant internal efficiencies, enabling our teams to focus on high-value activities across the business. In Q4, we saw strong employee adoption of AI capabilities with average reported time savings per employee of over 1 full workday a month, equating to more than 24,000 work weeks saved, if annualized across our entire workforce.\nWe are also leveraging AI to automate key sales processes and streamline reporting and workflow. By automating the hours of manual work involved in these tasks, we can deliver new efficiencies in the business while continuing to execute on growth initiatives.\nGAAP net loss attributable to CrowdStrike was $92.3 million and included $49.9 million of tax expenses related to acquisitions and $21 million of incident-related expenses with the remaining loss related to the ongoing impact of onetime programs for employees and onetime incentives for the sales team.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike grew 10% over Q4 of last year to $261.0 million, or $1.03 on a diluted per share basis, well ahead of our guidance.\nCash and cash equivalents grew to $4.32 billion. Free cash flow was $239.8 million or 23% of revenue. Incident-related expenses impacted Q4 free cash flow by approximately $22 million. The $93 million in deals financed through CrowdStrike Financial Services in Q4 had a de minimis impact to the quarter's free cash flow as expected.\nMoving to our outlook and modeling notes. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we remain committed to our long-term target model. We are encouraged by first best-in-class customer retention rates and the success of our concluded Customer Commitment Program. Second, continued strong and rapid adoption of Falcon Flex, which is accelerating module adoption rates, helping drive deeper strategic relationships with our customers and positioning us for long-term growth. And third, a robust demand environment across multiple large and growing markets, including Next-Gen SIEM, where we are in the early stages of disrupting a large legacy market and newer markets. such as Agentic AI for cybersecurity, where our unique data advantage positions us as the natural innovation and category leader.\nVisibility is improving as we move further from the sun. While we do not guide to net new ARR, our assumptions include a typical Q4 to Q1 seasonal decline of approximately 21% to 23% quarter-over-quarter. The net new ARR acceleration we expect in the second half of FY '26 sets the foundation for further acceleration in FY '27 over FY '26 and -- as we scale the business to our goal of $10 billion of ending ARR by FY '31.\nIt also sets the stage for operating and free cash flow margin improvement in the back half of the year, particularly in Q4.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Maria, please go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth, including projections and expected performance, including our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2025 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThese forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call.

A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release which may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nI would like to start today's remarks with my apology to everyone impacted by our Channel File 291 incident, which transpired on July 19. I also want to take this moment to show my gratitude to everyone who worked with us through the incident. Thank you to our customers and partners for your continued trust. Thank you to our team of relentless CrowdStrikers for living our mission. Thank you to the broader cybersecurity and IT community for standing with us as we face the most challenging event in our company history.\nThe magnitude of the July 19 incident will never be lost on me and my [ commitment this ] never happens again. These following incidents were among the most challenging in my career because I deeply felt what our customers experienced. Our response to the July 19 incident was immediate, deliberate and focused. We activated CrowdStrike's crisis response plan to lead through the incident. We clearly communicated status with customers partners in the market at large in our website, social media, e-mail, phone and broadcast.\nOur technical teams devise new automated recovery techniques for accelerated response. Our efforts were 100% focused on bringing impacted devices back online, the highest level of speed and transparency. This included the mobilization of CrowdStrikers in our partner community to communicate proactively and transparently with customers as well as the market at large and then recover impacted host. For many, recovery was within hours.\nWe've already implemented the following actions to build a more resilient Falcon platform. First, enhance content visibility and control. While sensor version control was always a cornerstone of the Falcon operational experience, we've already released new content control configurations. This allows customers to choose when and where new Falcon content is deployed with new granular controls. Second, content QA enhancements. We already shipped an enhanced content validator and content interpreter, 2 of the components which did not properly function. These components have been refactored to prevent shipping erroneous content and were both made GA earlier in August. And third, external review and validation. We've engaged 2 independent third-party software security vendors to review the Falcon sensor and quality process. This ongoing work focuses on enhancing security and resiliency over the short, medium and long term.\nThese 3 major actions are in addition to an enhanced content release process. Our content release process now mirrors the sensor release regimen. It consists of sample testing, internal lab and canary systems testing, early access soaking and lastly, a staggered concentric ring deployment and adherence with customer policy settings.\nThe July 19 incident starts a new chapter for CrowdStrike, one focused on ensuring that cybersecurity's best AI platform for SOC operations, protection, visibility, response and automation is also cybersecurity's most resilient platform with built-in redundancy modes, new content controls and enhanced safeguards we've immediately addressed learnings from the incident and will continue to apply and evolve these lessons into our future.\nMoving to our Q2 results. Our execution following the July 19 incident highlights the resiliency of CrowdStrike's business. Our focus on transparency and accountability continues to inspire trust. Our track record and third-party validation of delivering the industry's best AI-powered protection continues to resonate at scale. As the July 19 incident was in the final 2 weeks of the quarter, when a meaningful portion of our sales typically close, it delayed deals into subsequent quarters. The vast majority of these deals remain in our pipeline.\nDespite its impact, I'm encouraged by the results we delivered. The enduring trust that prospects, customers and the market have in CrowdStrike is demonstrated by our Q2 performance, ending ARR of $3.8 billion, growing 32% year-over-year. Q2 net new ARR of $218 million, up 11% year-over-year within our pre-incident stated assumptions. Q2 revenue of $964 million, also ahead of our guidance. Record non-GAAP operating income of $227 million, growing 46% year-over-year. GAAP profitability for the sixth consecutive quarter and free cash flow of $272 million at 28% of revenue with a free cash flow Rule of 60.\nThese financial results illustrate the resilience of our business and our team. Customers, prospects and partners recognize CrowdStrike's technological leadership and role in serving the market need for ongoing platform consolidation. This is why they continue to choose CrowdStrike. In the hundreds of customer interactions I've had in the July 19 incident, organizations of all sizes thematically shared 3 messages with me. First, necessity to understand the incident, our response and our actions to ensure it doesn't happen again. Second, acknowledgment of our trust record, gratitude for CrowdStrike safeguarding their organization over the years. And third, steadfast support for CrowdStrike continuing to be cybersecurity's innovation leader and their consolidation partner of choice.\nThe breadth and depth of the Falcon platform spans 28 modules that revolutionize cybersecurity, stopping breaches for tomorrow's AI-powered SOC, covering cloud security, identity protection, device security, data protection, IT automation and next-generation SIEM, our portfolio is diversified. CrowdStrike is much more than EDR, and we appeal to a variety of personas across cybersecurity, IT, digital, risk and compliance teams.\nOver the past year, our LogScale Next-Gen SIEM, identity protection and cloud security businesses each expanded the power and reach of the Falcon platform, each representing resilient growth vectors outside of what was once considered our market back when I started the company. In Q2, our LogScale Next-Gen SIEM, identity protection and cloud security hypergrowth businesses together surpassed $1 billion in ending ARR and grew more than 85% year-over-year. These results reaffirm our [ continued investment ] in innovation, ushering in the next chapter of the Falcon platform.\nLet me provide a few examples showcasing how these products are disrupting their respective markets. Importantly, each of these customer wins was closed after the July 19 incident began. I'll start with Falcon Cloud, the industry's only integrated CSPM, ASPM, DSPM, CIEM, CWP and agentless solution. CrowdStrike's cloud security business is more than $515 million in ARR and grew faster than [ 80% ] year-over-year.\n2 noteworthy post-July 19 wins, an 8-figure deal in a major enterprise software firm, where Falcon Cloud Security was already running on a part of the environment, replacing another next-gen cloud security vendor allowed this customer the opportunity to standardize on Falcon Cloud Security for ease of management across broad distributions and superior cloud [ security ] protection. Next, a 9-figure Falcon Cloud security purchase across one million hosts in a large enterprise for their production environment. Falcon Cloud Security's leading protection, visibility and operational scoring in their evaluation place CrowdStrike ahead of other cloud security products.\nFalcon Identity Protection continues to set the industry standard in the identity threat detection and response space. As of Q2, identity ending ARR surpassed $350 million, growing over 70% year-over-year. We pioneered this category and it's a key differentiator in our XDR value proposition.\nNow let's move to the LogScale Next-Gen SIEM business which is greater than $220 million in ARR and grew more than 140% year-over-year. The SIEM market continues to be in a state of renaissance where organizations of all sizes are drafting their next chapter of security and IT data management. Our LogScale Next-Gen SIEM momentum showcases CrowdStrike's ability to displace legacy SIEMs at scale and capitalize on market demand for AI-powered SOC operations.\n2 exciting post-July 19 wins include an 8-figure win in which LogScale Next-Gen SIEM replace 2 legacy SIEMs. This customer was already a large CrowdStrike customer and the ability to store visualize and act on large amounts of first-party CrowdStrike data natively in a platform, significantly lower cost by more than 60%, while increasing functionality. Ingesting third-party data into the Falcon platform is not only more cost effective, but also differentiated in our incident workbench, which brings novel visibility and AI-powered response to the hands of every SOC analyst. What once took 2 legacy SIEMs is now natively in Falcon.\nAnd finally, a leading generative AI company that started using LogScale Next-Gen SIEM over a year ago, standardized on the technology and a 7-figure win. Winning the totality of their SIEM business as well as observability use cases was a function of LogScale Next-Gen SIEM search speed, the native nature of Falcon Data coupled with third-party data and response actions and improved TCO relative to their legacy SIEM.\nI'm reassured by customers and prospects feedback, wanting to do more with CrowdStrike post-incident as evidenced by multiple 7- and 8-figure platform expansions with most opting for multiyear deals. Eliminating complexity is a key component of achieving resilience, and we see the Falcon platform continuing to help solve a wide range of customer problems, simplifying cybersecurity and most importantly, stopping breaches.\nOur partner-first go-to-market continues to deliver at scale, connecting our technology platform with new and existing customers. CrowdStrike's preeminent partner position as a top security vendor by business size and number of transactions serves as a competitive moat. In Q2, 66% of our new logo business was sourced by our partners, showcasing our best-in-class partner go-to-market.\nIn Q2, our systems integrator business grew over 100% year-over-year, highlighting Falcon as an industry driver in delivering multidisciplinary cybersecurity transformation. Our partners were instrumental in helping customers recover with noteworthy engagement from Accenture, KPMG and E&Y among a dozen others. Our strategic alignment and deep partnership extend our reach. In this vein, global system integrators are increasingly becoming a central part of our partner strategy, the Falcon Flex subscription model highly resonates with the transformative nature of GSI engagements.\nWe unite and align our entire partner ecosystem with our use of cloud marketplaces in CrowdStrike's go-to-market. We've demonstrated the success and results of this strategy with AWS, helping customers not only secure their AWS cloud services but also procure CrowdStrike for the full range of their cybersecurity needs. Now 2 quarters into our expanded relationship with Google, CrowdStrike is the fastest-growing cybersecurity vendor on the Google Cloud Marketplace this year.\nCustomers of all sizes are increasingly looking to utilize their committed hyperscaler spend, adding an additional layer of resilience through our go-to-market, aligning our entire ecosystem from reseller to systems integrator, MSSPs to distributors makes CrowdStrike cybersecurity's partner of choice. With CrowdStrike, the entire ecosystem wins together.\nOur resilient business platform and go-to-market position CrowdStrike to execute on our unchanged vision and mission, whether on July 18 or today, on August 28, our TAM and market opportunity remain unchanged. This is because, first, the need for cybersecurity simplification organizations of all sizes remain eager to simplify, consolidate and rationalize their cybersecurity product lineups. Streamlining operational processes goes hand-in-hand with SOC transformation with the goal of faster, more effective cybersecurity delivered at lower cost. Decreasing TCO and increasing efficiencies through AI and automation are clearly voiced organizational priorities and will be for years to come.\nSecond, adversary proliferation and threat landscape acceleration. Released in our annual threat report several weeks ago, CrowdStrike's analyst and industry [ allotted ] threat intelligence is in a class of its own now tracking over 245 adversary groups. In the past year, our threat intelligence teams uncover threat actors applying to and actively working for more than 100 unique companies. The realities of the threat landscape necessitate effective cyber protection, and that is only intensifying.\nIn the face of universally-accepted market needs [ and ] adversary realities, the resounding feedback I hear from customers is that CrowdStrike is their #1 and most effective cybersecurity control. This is not only because of product performance and efficacy but also because of the organizational process and orchestration built on and around Falcon. With greater than 7 modules on average deployed an organization spending $100,000 or more per year, the Falcon platform is firmly rooted with replacement requiring a multi-vendor, costly and time-consuming process, abandoning the protection and TCO benefits of a single platform consolidation. Our best-in-class module adoption, supercharged by Charlotte AI, our generative AI SOC analyst makes the Falcon platform sticky for all users as well as the data foundation of the SOC.\nThis is why we continue aggressively investing in innovation to advance our track record of revolutionizing cybersecurity. This is why customers are looking to not only stay with us, but also expand their Falcon platform adoption. This is why our upcoming annual customer and industry conference, Fal.Con, is what I refer to as our largest selling event of the year. It is already an overflow with more than 5,000 security and IT executives and more than 95 sponsoring partners. Our unchanged vision and mission propels us to become an even better, even more resilient and even more customer-obsessed CrowdStrike.\nIn working with customers post incident, we quickly mobilized around customer loyalty. We took inspiration from our Falcon Flex subscription program, a licensing model that's been rapidly gaining traction across all of our customer segments. In the year since we built the Falcon Flex program, the customers who have subscribed to this new licensing model represent over $700 million in total deal value. Flex supercharges platform adoption making it easier and faster for organizations to displace other technologies through flexibility, turning on and moving between modules without procurement and legal friction. Customers love the flexibility as it makes it easy to use more Falcon.\nIn Falcon Flex, we also found a simple and effective mechanism to drive retention by offering compelling customer commitment packages. Our customer commitment package takes traditional module-by-module licensing into our Falcon Flex model, where customers can use any and all modules they wish at compelling economic values. Depending on need, the customer commitment package encompasses discounting, module [ adds ], professional services flexible payment terms as well as adding duration to a customer subscription. Our best-in-class module adoption is differentiating and leading indicator of CrowdStrike customers' behavior. And post incident, our customer commitment package will drive even more Falcon utilization and platform value realization in both the short and long term. Customers see this as an immediate win to realize maximum and differentiated value from the Falcon platform. It is also a long-term win for CrowdStrike, cementing us as the organization's cybersecurity platform of record.\nCustomer feedback has been extremely positive because we're proactive in our approach and customers benefit because they get what they want, more Falcon. The blueprint for our customer commitment packages were Falcon Flex deals like this Fortune 500 insurance firm that I referenced before in the next-gen SIEM discussion. This customer has been with us for 5 years building over time from endpoint to identity. They had aspirations of consolidation and saw CrowdStrike as a platform where they could achieve their protection, automation and economic objectives.\nIn the midst of this deal discussion, the incident happened. We work with them on a rapid recovery. Our trust record and value from the platform over time stood out. Through Falcon Flex, this customer accelerated consolidation. They contracted for every Falcon module, displacing 7 technologies. And through the AWS marketplace, their spend with CrowdStrike will grow from $2.2 million in ARR to more than $5 million in ARR over the subscription. Falcon Flex grew platform adoption through the subscription term and increased ARR over the multiyear period. Our customer commitment package will grow Falcon adoption, increasing platform stickiness, ROI and protection levels. Customer commitment packages are a proactive and concerted investment we're making to build long-term loyalty and seed long-term platform adoption.\nIn closing, the past few weeks have been some of the most formative for CrowdStrike. Beyond apologies, I want our actions to speak even louder than our words. We work to recover customers quickly no matter the location or need, we focused on helping customers. Challenging and unprecedented moments like these are the true test of companies, teams and individuals. Our response has shown me that the golden rule I've led CrowdStrike with since day 1, put the customer first always, isn't just alive and well it's thriving.\nCybersecurity's mission-critical role in today's digital society is undeniable. CrowdStrike's contribution to cybersecurity, bringing cybersecurity to the cloud, bringing AI to cybersecurity has profoundly redefined the industry, and we will continue to do so. We continue to invest in growth and innovation as well as safeguards to build cybersecurity's most resilient AI-powered platform.\nThe mission of we stop breaches rings just as true today as it did prior to July 19. The most important part of CrowdStrike is the crowd, the people. Working at CrowdStrike isn't a job, it's a mission, the fight, the creativity and the will to make the world a safer place by stopping breaches is here. Our mission is alive and well, and I know that CrowdStrike's very best days are ahead of us.\nThank you for your unwavering trust. And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Burt Podbere.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. In today's discussion, I will briefly summarize our second quarter financial results and provide our assumptions and investment priorities for the second half of the fiscal year.\nThe strength of our second quarter results, we believe, demonstrates our resilience, focused execution, commitment to financial discipline and the long-term durability of our business. Despite the challenges of the last couple of weeks of the quarter, we delivered better-than-expected revenue, operating profit and net income.\nIn Q2, ending ARR grew 32% year-over-year to $3.86 billion, of which $218 million was net new added in the quarter, up 11% over Q2 of last year and within our previously stated assumptions for the quarter. In Q2, we achieved our second largest quarter of all time for net new customer additions expansion business and net new ARR contribution from cloud, identity and LogScale combined.\nPrior to July 19, we are on pace to deliver net new ARR growth well ahead of these results. The July 19 incident had a significant impact on the last 2 weeks of the quarter as we rapidly mobilize teams to assist customers, but we continue to close deals, including a 9-figure [ in deal ] value expansion. While deals can push in any given quarter, this quarter, we experienced elevated levels with more than $60 million in deals that we had line of sight for the quarter and remain open as of Monday. We expect these deals to close in future quarters.\nOur retention metrics and module adoption metrics remained strong in Q2, highlighting our deep partnership with customers and the significant value that Falcon Platform delivers. Our dollar-based gross and net retention rates were consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Subscription customers with 5, 6 and 7 or more modules represented 65%, 45% and 29% of subscription customers, respectively. Notably, deals with 8 or more modules grew by 66% over the prior year and 48% of all customers with $100,000 or more in ending ARR adopted at least 8 modules, an increase of more than 10 percentage points over the prior year.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 32% over Q2 of last year to reach $963.9 million, ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Subscription revenue grew 33% over Q2 of last year to reach $918.3 million. Professional services revenue was $45.6 million, representing 10% year-over-year growth. The sequential decrease in professional services revenue was primarily attributed to deploying complementary remediation services to help customers impacted by the July 19 incident.\nRecord total gross margin of 78% increased by approximately 80 basis points year-over-year. Record subscription gross margin of 81% increased approximately 90 basis points over the prior year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were $529.1 million or 55% of revenue compared to 56% of revenue in the prior year.\nConsistent with our plan, we increased the pace of hiring primarily in the areas of sales and marketing and R&D, growing total headcount by 22% year-over-year. In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 46% year-over-year to reach $226.8 million, and operating margin increased by more than 2 percentage points year-over-year to reach 24%.\nWe delivered GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike of $47.0 million, growing more than 5x over Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike grew 45% to reach $260.8 million or $1.04 on a diluted per share basis. Cash and cash equivalents grew to $4.04 billion. Free cash flow grew 44% over Q2 of last year to reach $272.2 million or 28% of revenue, in line with our expectations. And we delivered a Rule of 60 on a free cash flow basis.\nIn regards to the impact of potential legal exposure related to the July 19 incident, I would like to note the following: the outcome of litigation is inherently difficult to predict, particularly in the early stages and it is still too early for us to estimate any potential legal exposure we may have at this time. Our customer agreements contain provisions limiting our liability, and we maintain insurance policies intended to mitigate the potential impact of certain claims and have a strong cash position. We continue to work hand-in-hand with our customers to ensure their success and are well positioned to continue investing in the business for long-term growth.\nTurning to our outlook. Taking care of our customers has always been and will continue to be our #1 priority. We believe this focus and commitment will benefit us and them over the long term. Customer retention remains remarkably strong and we do not expect this to meaningfully change in the foreseeable future. Gross retention was 98% at the end of Q2 and dollar-based churn in the last 5 weeks as of Friday was modestly lower than the same [ period last year ].\nHowever, visibility into the back half of the year is less than typical. We expect the following factors to impact our near-term results: first, we delayed the vast majority of outbound pipeline generation activities for a few weeks following the July 19 incident. Outbound prospecting has since fully resumed and is rising to pre-incident levels of responses; second, we expect to see extended sales cycles for both new and existing customers with additional scrutiny requiring higher levels of approval at the CEO and in some cases, Board of Directors level; third, as George mentioned, through our customer commitment packages, we are encouraging customers to commit to more of the Falcon platform for longer periods of time. We are focused on making sure these commitments to the Falcon platform are one of the best decisions that IT and security teams make.\nAs reflected in our revenue guidance in the short term, we expect our commitment packages will result in temporarily muted upsell dollar values and temporarily higher than typical levels of [ traction ] due to elongated subscription terms. We estimate these packages will impact net new ARR and subscription revenue by approximately $60 million and professional service revenue by high single-digit million dollars in the back half of FY '25. In the long term, we expect our customer commitment packages will ultimately lead to higher platform and module adoption and deeper partnerships with customers.\nAnd fourth, specific to free cash flow, we expect to have increased flexible payment terms for our customers. We will incur additional G&A costs associated with the July 19 incident. At this point in time, we are not providing a free cash flow margin expectation for the full year. We will maintain our long-standing focus on financial discipline and the bottom line with our attention squarely on the highest and best use of every dollar.\nAs reflected in our guidance for the remainder of the year, while we will shift some planned investment from sales and marketing to further R&D, quality assurance and customer support, we are continuing to invest in our FY 2025 plan for the remainder of the year at this point in time. This will enable us to remain focused on our customers, protect the world against cyber threats and stay on track with our long-term investment and growth priorities. We expect these headwinds to remain in varying degrees for about a year with acceleration starting in the back half of next year.\nFrom the longer-term perspective, we expect to see operating margin improvement on an annual basis in FY '26. Additionally, we remain committed to reaching $10 billion in ending ARR by the end of fiscal year 2031 and achieving our target non-GAAP operating model on an annual basis by fiscal year 2029. I will provide a detailed update of our long-term model and FY '26 outlook after the conclusion of fiscal year 2025.\nMoving to our guidance. For the third quarter of FY '25, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $979.2 million to $984.7 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 25%. This includes an estimated $30 million impact from the customer commitment package we discussed earlier. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $166.7 million to $170.8 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $201.2 million to $205.2 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.80 to $0.81, utilizing a weighted average share count of approximately 252 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,890.0 million to $3,902.2 million, reflecting a growth rate of 27% to 28% over the prior fiscal year. This includes an estimated $60 million impact from the customer commitment package we discussed earlier. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $774.7 million and $783.9 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $908.8 million and $980 million. Utilizing approximately 252 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.61 to $3.65.\nAs George mentioned, Fal.Con 2024 is going to be our biggest customer event yet. The investor briefing will be held on September 18 and will feature conversations with customers and partners. To join Fal.Con in person, please contact our IR team for the registration information. The briefing will also be webcast live on our IR website. We look forward to seeing many of you there.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.",

A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release which may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us for our first earnings call of fiscal year 2025. We start the year from a position of momentum and exceptional strength, outperforming our guided metrics. Our AI native platform wins at scale every geography, every market segment and every solution area.\nCrowdStrike delivered a record Q1. Record Q1 net new ARR of $212 million, growing 22% year-over-year. Record ending ARR of $3.65 billion, growing 33% year-over-year. Record subscription gross margin of over 80% and record free cash flow of $322 million, reaching 35% of revenue and a free cash flow Rule of 68 making us the only cybersecurity vendor of scale delivering this level of growth and profitability.\nWe achieved all of these records while closely managing every P&L line delivering significant year-over-year operating leverage and our fifth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. Even as we continue investing in growth, we're adding sales capacity, investing in our market-leading brand and accelerating innovation while firmly on the path to $10 billion in ending ARR.\nThe foundational theme underpinning CrowdStrike's results is the power of the Falcon platform to consolidate cybersecurity at scale. This is coupled with the market's unequivocal desire for a single AI-powered software platform consolidator. We're landing with more modules than ever before. The number of deals involving cloud, identity or Falcon Next-Gen SIEM modules more than doubled year-over-year, and we're closing some of our largest deals ever.\nWe're consistently hearing that customers want to partner with us as they consolidate, standardizing their cybersecurity future on the Falcon platform and investing their trust in CrowdStrike as cybersecurities North Star. Let me explain why.\nWe built the right architecture from the start, the industry's lightest weight, easiest to install sensor embedded with AI, no system reboot required a single AI native platform console, not disparate stitch together or siloed multi-platforms. Our architecture built from the start, with what I refer to as gold plated plumbing, allows the Falcon platform to gracefully land, retrieve data once and then slight infinite security, IT, data and compliance capabilities without any friction.\nThis is the definition of a true platform, and our platform strategy from inception continues to deliver the results, [indiscernible] with 8-plus modules grew 95% year-over-year. Our 28 modules are best-in-class on a stand-alone basis as rated by applicable leading industry analysts, yet combined and natively built into single Falcon platform, our solution modules work even better together, unlocking customer value characteristics of a virtuous flywheel. The sum of platform adoption is even greater than the individual parts.\nThe Falcon platform's differentiated architecture creates a technological competitive moat around our ability to be cybersecurity's premier platform consolidator. This is something you can't acquire or fix later. You must build it right from the start.\nOur platform architecture delivers the following unique customer outcomes. Through consolidation, the Falcon platform delivers faster and more effective cybersecurity than ever before, our AI native platform is consistently evolving to close the gap between detection and response, compressing alert to resolution time scales from days and hours to seconds and real time.\nAnd now with Charlotte AI, customers are experiencing more platform utility at faster speeds, shrinking hours of their security work days into minutes. [indiscernible] hunting is supercharged, response and remediation are revolutionized. The AI-powered stock is no longer a vision, it's a reality. We stand out in our ability to secure diverse attack services with the industry's highest protection levels, spanning cloud, data, device, identity, third-party sources and beyond, natively alerting in one place and automatically responding across the platform at machine speed. There's no console, hide-and-go-seek, no separate platforms with their own UI languages, no multi-agent bloat and no stitch data silos.\nThrough consolidation, the Falcon platform delivers extreme cost savings, the more modules customers adopt, the more cost savings they realize. The Falcon platform consolidates point and pseudo platform vendors across point cloud security fragments like CWP, CSPM, ASPM, ESPM and CIEM products, identity protection, SIEM, threat intel feeds, data protection and VLP, vulnerability management, attack service management, compliance, endpoint management suite and legacy AV and next-gen AV and EDR.\nAs an industry, organizations are buying many promises, Unfortunately, they are left with wasteful shelfware, point product learning curves and features that fail to deliver end-to-end outcomes. The long-time cybersecurity adage of defense and depth has led to a new phenomenon, expensive depth consolidating on the Falcon platform reverses the ever-increasing cost curve. A recent IDC report quantifies CrowdStrike extreme cost savings for every dollar invested in Falcon Solutions, our customers recognize $6 of cost savings. Our customers came to us asking for new ways to adopt the Falcon platform even faster.\nInstead of acquiring Falcon module by module, we developed the Falcon Flex subscription model. Falcon Flex customers enjoy the best prices for the products they want today and tomorrow while eliminating procurement and legal cycles for module use. The outcome for CrowdStrike is even broader platform adoption. Unlike vendors who pedal wasteful ELAs, our customers utilize what they purchase because when you buy what you want and need, when you want to need it, utilization is natural. We're not reclassifying, recounting or repositioning existing business to [indiscernible] perceived platform value. When a platform delivers real value, you don't have to give it away.\nIn the 3 quarters since we've built the Falcon Flex program, the customers who have subscribed to this new licensing model represent over $500 million in deal value, growing our share of customer wallet while consolidating and simplifying their security. Applying IDC's analysis would imply Falcon Flex has assisted customers in saving more than $3 billion that would have been spent on other products. Now that extreme cost savings and indicative of the platform momentum we are seeing with new and existing customers.\nThrough consolidation, the Falcon platform delivers innovation to solve tomorrow's cybersecurity as well as broader IP and data problems. Our position of cybersecurity consolidation platform keeps CrowdStrike innovating to lead the industry forward. This focus has allowed us to ship game-changing products at rapid pace.\nWithin months of our Bionic acquisition, we fully integrated ASPM into our Falcon Cloud Security Suite. Over the past few months, we brought our LogScale Next-Gen SIEM into the console of all of our customers, feeding their utilization of Falcon to replace legacy SIEMs. And more recently, following yet another major Microsoft breach in CIS' Cyber Safety Review Board's findings, we received an outpouring of request from the market for help. We decided enough is enough, there's a widespread crisis of confidence among security and IT teams within the Microsoft security customer base.\nAt the request of organizations saddled with Microsoft E5 licensing, we delivered Falcon for Defender, a platform on ramp to help organizations of all sizes start utilizing Falcon to secure their Microsoft Defender usage. Falcon for Defender is delivered via the CrowdStrike sensor encompassing our industry-leading OverWatch threat hunting services as well as mission-critical reporting to help security teams do their job.\nWith Falcon for Defender organizations using Microsoft now have what we call V-Squared, validation and verification, a missing third-party protection layer for their security programs. And with our sensor already deployed on customer systems, we're dropping anchor on the beachfront real estate to not only transform cybersecurity but also stop breaches. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. CISAs now have the ability to reduce monoculture risk from only using Microsoft products and cloud services.\nOur innovation continues at breakneck pace multiplying the reasons for the market to consolidate on Falcon. Thousands of organizations are consolidating on the Falcon platform. There are a few that stood out from the quarter. A 7-figure deal in a Fortune 100 health care company who is using Microsoft and experienced a breach. Our industry-leading IR team deployed more than 46,000 sensors in days, stopping the adversary, restarting business and importantly, keeping this business out of promotional vendor fanfare. This customer immediately adopted Falcon Complete Identity, Falcon Cloud Security, LogScale Next-Gen SIEM and Charlotte AI.\nIn addition to removing Microsoft security products, they were able to move off their vulnerability management vendor and their legacy SIEM-2. The consolidation outcome a 75% reduction in agent footprint by consolidating to our single agent and a 700% improvement in mean time to detect and respond taking average alert triage times from 4-plus hours down to minutes. We stopped the breach, displacing more than 3 vendors along the way, and now this customer experiences not only lower TCO, but also cybersecurity outcomes they hadn't thought possible.\nA 7-figure deal in a large Middle Eastern power and utilities provider that experienced many incidents using a regional point product endpoint vendor. These incidents were each preventable with the Falcon platform's AI defenses. Standardizing the Falcon platform, this customer adopted CrowdStrike for endpoint, identity, cloud and Next-Gen SIEM, consolidating 5 security vendors down to just one in a few short months during the deal cycle.\nLastly, our focus on solving cybersecurity and IT use cases inspired a multinational services customer headquartered in Japan to consolidate on the CrowdStrike in a 7-figure expansion deal, acquiring 4 additional modules, they successfully eliminated TM, a legacy AV vendor and their vulnerability management provider. This deal illustrates existing customers taking the opportunity to further consolidate on Falcon beyond just security.\nWe have the platform, data gravity and trust to make consolidation turn key for security and IT teams alike. These deals highlight the tempo and scale of Falcon consolidation. It's not on a PowerPoint slide, it's inside a single console with a single sensor and delivered on a single platform. What we see are prospects and customers using consolidation as an opportunity to transform trading expense and depth for cybersecurity that's better, faster and more cost-effective. Consolidation isn't just a phenomenon happening with end customers. It's also a priority embraced and prioritized by our partners, too.\nIn our MSSP business, one of our fastest-growing segments, partners are coming to us to migrate their customers off legacy and substandard point products as well as multi-platform vendors. In a large 7-figure deal eSentire, and industry-leading MSSP selected the Falcon platform to migrate hundreds of Carbon Black customers in mass, representing an excess of nearly 0.5 million endpoints. This is a prime example of an industry-leading MDR that developed their own award-winning services on the Falcon platform, consolidating on CrowdStrike.\nIn our expanded partnership with Mandiant and Google Cloud announced at the RSA conference, Mandiant is migrating its Mandiant Managed Defense MDR customers to the Falcon platform. Recognizing our market leadership and the need to deliver services on the best technology platform, CrowdStrike is the natural choice to migrate their customers off legacy AV and other point products.\nIn our channel ecosystem at large, we're seeing partners deprioritizing other vendors on their line cards to consolidate their time, head count and go-to-market focus on CrowdStrike. Our top 50 partners in every geo are growing and telling us they're doing less and less with other vendors, instead increasing their focus and business results on Falcon. Partners are a key driver of market consolidation, both representing our technology to their end customers and also consolidating their efforts away from anecdotal declining point feature vendors.\nThe power to consolidate on a single platform requires having the right technologies at the right time, delivered on the right platform. Our investments in hyper-growth solution businesses continue to deliver market-leading capabilities and record results.\nHere's our Q1 color on cloud security, identity protection and LogScale Next-Gen SIEM as well as several platform innovation areas. Cloud utilization is reaching unprecedented highs. This is largely driven by the AI revolution of the past few quarters. Today, every company is or is quickly becoming an AI company. Every CISO, CIO and Board member, I speak with is experimenting with using AI in new ways. We all know that AI is transformative, and this transformation is happening in public and private clouds. The cloud is foundational technology for building AI models, operationalizing AI and integrating AI into existing technologies. The only way to safely harness the transformative nature of AI is through best-in-class security that operates at the speed and scale of AI built natively with AI with CrowdStrike.\nAs hyperscalers print remarkable results, as NVIDIA continues to amaze and as AI hardware spend reaches Gold Rush levels, estimated to be north of $60 billion in the last 12 months, CrowdStrike is at the epicenter of securing the workloads driving the AI revolution for the next conversation.\nJensen Huang, Founder and CEO of NVIDIA, recently validated this, stating in our Q1 partnership announcement that quote, \"pairing NVIDIA accelerated computing and Generative AI with CrowdStrike cybersecurity can give enterprises unprecedented visibility and to threats to help them better protect their businesses\". And this is why industry leaders across every vertical, including the GenAI companies themselves, are choosing Falcon Cloud Security to secure their heterogeneous cloud environment, consolidating multiple point products on the Falcon platform.\nHere is a lighthouse example. One of the world's leading hyperscalers grew their adoption of the Falcon platform, standardizing on the Falcon cloud security in an 8-figure deal. In a public press release, this customer and partner extolled the unified nature of our security platform and their ability to consolidate multiple cloud security point products on Falcon cloud security.\nOur joint go-to-market partnership has evolved to focus on Falcon Cloud security where CrowdStrike rises above other vendors to enable secure cloud consumption. Driving our cloud security customer wins is the market embracing our runtime centric cloud detection and response vision that focuses on real-time cloud visibility and protection, offering features like cloud attack path analysis, API-based side scanning and most recently integrated ASPM and CVR, sets us apart as the only solution in the market that spans code application to the infrastructure on which everything runs.\nOur latest acquisition of Flow furthers our competitive moat, adding in the industry's only runtime DSPM, securing data both at rest and in motion. Falcon Cloud Security has surpassed a garden of unicorns, decacorns and legacy vendors as one of the largest cloud security businesses in the market. As of Q1, Falcon has been selected by 62 of the Fortune 100 as their cloud security provider of choice.\nCrowdStrike pioneered the creation of the Identity detection and response category. Our identity protection module continues to be the only single agent solution on the market, giving us a major competitive advantage. Our active directory expertise has evolved to now support increasingly popular cloud identity solutions such as Microsoft Entra ID, formerly known as Azure AD, giving us the ability to support diverse customers wherever their identities reside.\nOur sustained focus on identity protection continues to pay dividends, not only winning deals, but also with industry analysts, where CrowdStrike was named the Overall Leader in KuppingerCole's inaugural ITDR Compass. A key customer went from the quarter includes, a 7-figure deal with a large health care provider who is stuck in a Broadcom contract and increasingly being pushed towards a multi-platform hardware providers patchwork products. Our Identity Threat Protection module was a game changer for this customer, deploying us to more than 100,000 devices and allowing us to replace these other 2 vendors. Identity protection led to an 85% better mean time to respond for identity-based attacks and motivated this customers significant cyber transformation.\nOne of the solution areas I'm most excited about is our LogScale Next-Gen SIEM business. There's certainly no shortage of market activity in the SIEM space where consolidation is a foot with M&A activity impacting Splunk and more recently, Exabeam and QRadar, more happened in the SIM market over the past few months than in decades. In the wake of this consolidation, the demand environment is right. Each of these consolidation moves create immediate opportunity zones. Organizations are iconic classically questioning their legacy SIEM choices and looking for new, better and more cost-effective ways to run their stock in the AI era.\nWith CrowdStrike representing more than 80% of the data going into today's SIEM, we are naturally placed to disrupt consolidate and chart the future of the SIEM market. This is because our LogScale Next-Gen SIEM is already natively in the Falcon platform, already ingesting, visualizing and actioning all first-party CrowdStrike data for all of our customers.\nWhile other vendors must buy their way into this market, acquiring legacy technology, our flag is already firmly planted and flying. Our goal is to win the hearts and minds of customers through superior technology and outcomes, not ELAs, forced migrations and traps.\nHere's why we're winning. We have the right technology. Our Next-Gen SIEM immediately solves one of the biggest and most costly SIEM challenges ingestion of data. CrowdStrike data natively resides in the platform, requiring 0 transportation costs, 0 storage cost and 0 configuration. We have also made it easy to ingest data from third-party sources. Once the data is in the platform, users benefit from our head-turning incident workbench, providing curated alert visualization delivering on the promises of XDR like never seen before.\nOur Next-Gen SIEM is created for security users by security users, making running a cybersecurity program easier and more data driven. And coupled with Charlotte AI, going from an idea to action, context to conquest and of course, detection to response is supercharged for the AI era.\nAnd our recent partner symposium in Asia and Europe, we received standing ovations with viewers commenting that Next-Gen SIEM is our biggest industry-changing innovation. We have the content with over 500 integrations we welcome data from all sources to call the Falcon platform home. While many competitors are closed and complicated in what data they ingest, we are open, the melting pot of cyber and IT data. Our ecosystem is a proxy for the cybersecurity market at large.\nFor years, we've collaborated closely with ISVs of all kinds from start-ups and innovators in our Falcon Fund portfolio to industry stalwarts across cybersecurity in the broader IT market. With hundreds of native vendor-specific connectors as well as a generic log in gesture, bringing data into Next-Gen SIEM is easier and faster than ever before. And once the data is in, cybersecurity experiences are enriched with the Falcon platform illustrating alert specific, attack surface specific and campaign-specific events coupled with automated response through Fusion SOAR playbooks and Charlotte AI actions.\nTo date, Fusion SOAR is used by 47% of our top 5,000 customers we have created more than 135,000 custom workflows, processing more than 155 billion signals weekly to automate actions across the Falcon platform and third-party products. We have the right services, helping organizations move into their Next-Gen SIEM as a partner-led opportunity.\nToday's SIEMs were installed, configured, and oftentimes managed by partners. Partners see where the puck is going and have approached CrowdStrike to build their Next-Gen SIEM practices. These practices span data governance, data movement, dashboard configuration and automation response creation as well as managed SIEM services. System integrators like Deloitte, EY, HCLTech as well as SIEM specific partners like Net Builder are leading the movement with CrowdStrike as their Next-Gen SIEM platform of choice.\nHere's an example of a noteworthy customer win. The Global 2000 manufacturing and machine system conglomerate, with more than 100,000 employees left Splunk for LogScale Next-Gen SIEM in an 8-figure deal. Together with Accenture, we were able to successfully and swiftly migrate numerous data sources as well as ongoing SIEM management to the Falcon platform, delivering the outcome of consolidation cost savings as well as longer data retention and faster alert response times.\nWe have the technology platform, the content, the partners, the customers and the native data gravity to transform the SIEM market, and it's happening right now. Outside of our cloud identity and Next-Gen SIEM hypergrowth businesses, new platform innovation areas are quickly taking flight. Demand for each of these products is exceeding our expectation driven by both the innovative nature of our technology, but also secular consolidation market factors and frustration with legacy incumbents.\nFirst, data protection. Frustration with legacy DLP remains at a fever pitch or logging into these products as akin to taking a time machine back to the '90s. In a little more than a quarter, we sold our data protection module to several hundred customers many of which are Fortune 1000 accounts delivering results indicative of a hyper-growth startup. We win because we scratched the consolidation itch delivering the compliance necessities without anything new to deploy and manage.\nData protection, coupled with Flow's DSPM are important components of our ability to natively secure AI as well. And with data becoming increasingly important for AI model development, customers want more than back in the disaster recovery for the data. Data protection is laying the groundwork for another multibillion adjacent Falcon market.\nNext, Falcon for IT. The desire to move away from endpoint management point products is pronounced and exceeding our expectations. Organizations are looking to Falcon to deliver enterprise search, patching deployment, device health and more, all from the same sensor. It's a very logical add-on and our pipeline is already in the 8 figures since shipping this module a little more than a quarter ago.\nAnd lastly, Charlotte AI, every CISO is eager to see their employees become more productive. Every CISO wants their cybersecurity to be faster. The productivity gains are real and the benefits of making cybersecurity easier, conversational and instant multiply the cybersecurity outcomes the Falcon platform creates.\nWhile still early, our POV close rate is close to 90% and reflecting excitement for Charlotte AI. Despite each of these solutions areas being young in the Falcon nest, the feedback from prospects, customers and partners show us we're on the right path for these technologies to be meaningful growth drivers and competitive differentiators. CrowdStrike's innovation engine is just another reason why customers have confidence in Falcon as cybersecurities platform consolidator for today and tomorrow.\nIn closing, I'm excited about the consolidation CrowdStrike is driving in the market. The business results we're delivering and most importantly, the Falcon platform's signal impact of stopping breaches. Over the past 12 months, our industry-leading incident responders in our partner network use Falcon to respond to thousands of breaches, [indiscernible] CrowdStrike as the industry's incident response authority. These engagements often convert to net new Falcon customers.\nDelivering a Q1 like the one we're announcing today is a strong reflection not only of the technological superiority of the Falcon platform, but also of the passion, the tenacity and the mission focused from the very best team in cybersecurity. While the talent war is ongoing, CrowdStrike remains a career destination. Many vendors take great pride in Best Place to Work designation.\nI'd like to point to a figure that dimensionalizing CrowdStrike as cybersecurity is very Best Place to Work. Over the past 5 quarters, we received more than 687,000 applications from individuals who want to work for CrowdStrike. These professionals decided that CrowdStrike professionals decided that CrowdStrike would be the ideal venue to build a career. In hiring low single-digit thousands of these individuals, our acceptance rate is low, a lower acceptance rate than to every Ivy League institution. It's figures like this one that send a clear message to me to CrowdStrikers, to customers, the partners, the prospect, to the cybersecurity community and to the market at large, the very best talent builds the very best cybersecurity and we have ample runway ahead of us to revolutionize, innovate and, of course, consolidate this year and well into the future.\nI'll now turn the call over to Burt for our financial updates. Thank you.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers, except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. Additionally, the results we are reporting today include the acquisition of Flow Security, which closed during the quarter and was de minimis to revenue and ARR.\nCrowdStrike delivered an exceptional start to the fiscal year, driven by strong execution and increased platform adoption, as customers prioritize their cybersecurity budgets around consolidation on the Falcon platform, driving bigger deals and increased wallet share. We have demonstrated a consistent track record of execution, profitably scaling the business to new heights.\nIn Q1, we achieved net new ARR of $212 million up 22% year-over-year, bringing ending ARR to $3.65 billion, up 33% over last year. Demand in the quarter was broad-based across the platform. Our strong win rates remained consistent with the prior quarter, and we built a record Q2 pipeline.\nAs George discussed, the Falcon platform's unique ability to consolidate multiple vendors along with the early success of our FalconFlex program drove bigger consolidation deals in the quarter. Customers are embracing CrowdStrike's platform strategy more than ever as evidenced by the number of deals with 8 or more modules, which grew 95% over Q1 of last year. Subscription customers with 5, 6 and 7 or more modules, grew to 65 and 28% of subscription customers, respectively, and the number of deals involving cloud, identity or Falcon Next-Gen SIEM modules, more than doubled year-over-year.\nAdditionally, our dollar-based gross and net retention rates were consistent with our expectations as we are executing well across landing, retaining and expanding with our customers.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 33% over Q1 of last year to reach $921.0 million. Subscription revenue growth accelerated to 34% over Q1 of last year to reach $872.2 million. Professional services revenue was $48.9 million representing 18% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of first quarter revenue consisted of approximately 68% from the U.S. and 32% from international geographies.\nRecord total gross margin of 78% increased by 26 basis points year-over-year. Record subscription gross margin of 80% increased 32 basis points over the prior year, driven by investments in data center and workload optimization and a consistent pricing environment.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $522.5 million or 57% of revenue compared to 61% of revenue in the prior year. As planned, in Q1, we increased our pace of hiring, growing total head count by 15% year-over-year as we invest in scaling the business to $10 billion in ending ARR and capture the massive opportunities ahead of us. In the first quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 72% year-over-year to reach $198.7 million, and operating margin increased by 5 percentage points year-over-year to reach 22%.\nWe, once again, delivered GAAP profitability, which grew to $42.8 million up significantly over Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike grew to $231.7 million or $0.93 on a diluted per share basis. Cash and cash equivalents grew to a record $3.70 billion and free cash flow grew 42% over Q1 of last year to reach a record $322.5 million or 35% of revenue increasing to achieve a Rule of 68 on a free cash flow basis.\nBefore I move to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. First, we are encouraged by the momentum we see across the business and pleased by our strong execution to start the fiscal year. While the macro environment remains challenging, the unique capabilities and data gravity of the Falcon platform, coupled with our FalconFlex program are driving larger platform deal sizes, consistently strong win rates and record levels of pipeline for the year.\nWith that in mind, we continue to maintain a consistent and prudent approach to our outlook and assumptions amid a macro environment that remains challenging. While we did not specifically guide to net new ARR, our net new ARR year-over-year growth assumptions for the second quarter of the fiscal year are at least double digits, up to the low teens.\nAnd second, we are maintaining our free cash flow margin target of 31% to 33% of revenue for the full fiscal year 2025 and expect Q1 to Q2 seasonality similar to last year.\nMoving to our outlook. For the second quarter of FY '25, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $958.3 million to $961.2 million reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 31%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $208.3 million to $210.5 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $245.7 million to $247.8 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.98 to $0.99, utilizing a weighted average share count of approximately 250 million shares on a diluted basis.\nWe are raising our guidance for the full fiscal year 2025. We currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,976.3 million to $4010.7 million, reflecting a growth rate of 30% to 31% over the prior fiscal year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $890.1 million and $916.5 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $985.6 million and $1,012 million. Utilizing approximately 251 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $3.93 to $4.03.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. It was another quarter of records. Record net new ARR of $282 million, continuing our acceleration trend, growing 27% year-over-year. Record operating margin of 25%, up 10 percentage points year-over-year. Record free cash flow reaching 33% of revenue and a free cash flow rule of 66. Record GAAP profitability and record cloud identity and next-gen SIM ending ARR of greater than $850 million together more than doubling year-over-year.\nThese results illustrate CrowdStrike substantial and widening competitive moat exceptional business acceleration and validated market leadership. Building on my founding vision, CrowdStrike is the only single platform single-agent technology in cybersecurity that solve use cases well beyond endpoint protection. Falcon is the easiest and fastest cybersecurity technology to deploy and our single AI native platform makes vendor consolidation instant, frictionless and natural.\nThe feedback we receive from customers, prospects and partners alike is consistent eagerness to deploy the Falcon platform, ease of adopting more Falcon platform modules and excitement from continuous innovation with new Falcon capabilities delivered weekly. Leaving SiP together point products and PowerPoint platforms behind, CrowdStrike customers realize the benefits of superior outcomes and low TCO. A recent IDC report echoes this casing $6 of return for every dollar invested in the Falcon platform. That is ROI. Free is never free.\nCustomers understand the difference between product pricing and the total lifetime cost of operating inferior technology. Given the Falcon Platform's ROI and TCO savings, we believe we will continue to see favorable pricing dynamics. I'm thrilled with our performance, which is a testament to the execution and passion from the very best team in cybersecurity. Unify by our focused mission we stop reaches, my gratitude to all CrowdStrikers on a job well done. Our execution and discipline across the business coupled with overwhelmingly positive market feedback, gives me strong conviction in our fiscal year 2025 momentum, which Burt will cover in more detail. The current macro environment remains stable and consistent with prior quarters.\nWe expect continued deal scrutiny throughout this coming year. We remain focused on operational excellence while delivering market-leading growth at scale, assisting organizations of all sizes to consolidate and improve their cybersecurity. In contrast to the macroeconomic backdrop, the state of the threat landscape has never been more elevated. In CrowdStrike's recent 2024 global threat report, we unpacked the harsh realities of cyber today. Key findings include: first, attacks are faster than ever. What took adversaries hours has shrunk to minutes and seconds, that tax fees will only accelerate. Second, the cloud is increasingly under attack. We tracked a 75% increase in cloud intrusion attempts. The cloud is today's battleground for cyber attacks. And third, generative AI is an adversary force multiplier. Gen AI puts advanced cybercrime trade craft in the hands of attackers of all skill levels AI will dramatically grow the adversary population.\nThe global threat report showcases our threat intelligence leadership. We collect trillions of threat signals daily creating one of the world's largest and fastest-growing cyber threat data set. From day 1, we've been an AI company, training the industry's most effective and accurate AI models to prevent attacks based upon our data mode. Embedded in the Falcon platform is a virtuous data cycle where we collect cybersecurity's very best threat intelligence data build and train robust preventative and generative models and protect CrowdStrike customers with community immunity.\nOur team of data science PhDs operate this continuous and real-time process, constantly evolving Falcon's AI foundation to predict adversary activity and stay ahead of threats. Our ever-growing data Corpus and unique access to Cyber's freshest data at the source alongside our technology and our human incident response, threat analysts, data science and engineering expertise together serve as a structural competitive advantage. Along with AI, cybersecurity is a top priority in my discussions with numerous boards.\nIn today's environment of heightened cyber attacks, the latest SEC breach disclosure regulation only increases the pressure on companies and their Boards. We regularly assist boards with regulation readiness by bringing cybersecurity from the back room to the boardroom. This, alongside the severity of the threat landscape makes effective cybersecurity and increasingly mission-critical necessity. That said, cybersecurity today is a frenetic vendor bizarre. This joined point feature copycat products, clutter the market attempting to Band-Aid symptoms instead of curing the illness.\nOS vendors use their market position to create a monoculture of dependence and risk and in many cases, serve as the breach originator. Even worse, multi-platform hardware vendors evangelized their stitch together patchwork of point products, mastering a tiny bail piece mail platforms. And what organizations inevitably realize is that vendor lock-in leads to deployment difficulties, skyrocketing cost and subpart cybersecurity. The outcome is shelfware [indiscernible] cost. ELA and bundling addiction become the only way to coast customers into purchasing nonintegrated point products.\nIt's the organization trapped in these fragmented Tudo platforms riddled with bolt-on point products that are the ones suffering from fatigue. And start just to position what CrowdStrike customers tell us is that when you build the right single data-centric AI platform, deliver the right frictionless native solutions and architect the right go-to-market organizations purchase because they need more, receive more and understand how cybersecurity transformation saves them time and money. Our deal metrics validate this. First, record deal volumes.\nIn Q4, we closed more than 250 deals greater than $1 million in deal value. More than 490 deals greater than $500,000 in deal value and more than 1,900 deals greater than $100,000 in deal value. Steel counts grew by more than 30% year-over-year across all deal segments. Second, record platform adoption deals with 8 or more modules more than doubled year-over-year. And lastly, continued rising win rates. In Q4, we saw steadily rising win rates across the board, validating our technological leadership over the competition. These results are driven by the following: the winning AI platform, the right solutions and our frictionless go-to-market motion.\nLet me begin with our winning AI platform. The secret to cybersecurities leading platform is our single platform has one console and one agent. It solves an ever-expanding set of cybersecurity and IT use cases. Our single platform is open. Our single platform is data-centric, AI native and scalable, delivering immediate time to value. Key wins proved the value of the Falcon platform, which makes point product consolidation and vendor replacement a reality. Our recent 7-figure win in a Fortune 1000 company highlights how our platform consolidates at scale.\nFalcon replaced an OS security vendor, a legacy AV vendor and a next-gen vendor. We eliminated multiple Microsoft consoles and multiple agents to a single console, single agent and single platform of Falcon. Our platform approach organically inspires customers to deploy Falcon Cloud Security as their first CSPM and IEM and SPM solution. An 8-figure multiyear win in a Fortune 100 business where the Falcon platform displaced 5 different products with recent breaches costing them 100 [indiscernible], it costs too much to keep using ineffective cybersecurity tools.\nThey purchased EDR, Next-Gen AV, Identity, bio integrity monitoring and vulnerability management, reducing the number of agents on their devices by approximately 50%. What used to require 5 installs is now done with one. There are countless similar stories. Our platform approach makes landing with multiple solutions at once easy and adopting increasing capabilities over time and organic experience. We collect data once and reuse it many times for today's and tomorrow's use cases. Our application of Gen AI makes cybersecurity predictive and accessible for all skill levels. It's all on one platform, one agent and one integrated workflow.\nNext, delivering the right solutions our market-leading cloud security, identity [ print ] and next-gen SIM solutions are in demand because they solve painful customer problems. These businesses collectively are more than doubling year-over-year each are IPO businesses and each play lead roles in Falcon platform consolidation. I'd like to start with our breakout cloud security solutions where we are setting new records and winning at scale. Our cloud security momentum accelerated in the quarter with net new ARR growing nearly 200% year-over-year and more than $400 million in ending ARR CrowdStrike is one of the largest cloud security businesses in the market and was recently positioned as a market leader in Forrester's cloud security wave.\nHere are a few recent cloud security wins. An 8-figure multiyear win in a hypergrowth AI company. This company's endpoint footprint is in the low thousands. However, with its rapidly expanding cloud estate, this transaction marks our largest inside sales deal of all time. Falcon Cloud Security protects their LLM development and cloud environment. This customer uses CrowdStrike Core, CSPN CIM, CWP and AFPM, from the SMB to large enterprises, our sellers and partners win with Falcon Cloud Security. A leading hyperscaler grew its use of Falcon Cloud Security, praising our Linux capabilities.\nThis large 8-figure transaction takes us deeper into the account where we're not only on every device, but now across large parts of their cloud. The win extends CrowdStrike leadership in securing the world's largest clouds. A global financial services giant replaced their Palo Alto Prisma Cloud products in a large 7-figure deal. The Palo Alto cloud security products required separate management consoles and separate agents because cloud security is on a separate Palo Alto platform altogether.\nCrowdStrike was able to deliver an expected 70% time reduction in management as well as more than $5 million in annual staffing cost savings. The patchwork of multiproduct, multi-agent multi-consul separate platform technologies resulted in visibility gaps asynchronous alerts and overall fatigue, managing cloud security. Falcon Single platform with its integrated cloud security component was a win for the customer. Customers are starting to realize that CSPM doesn't stop the breach. It is a compliance and reporting tool.\nCloud security has moved beyond CSPM, customers are increasingly realizing that a holistic suite encompassing runtime protection is the only way to protect from active real-time threats. CrowdStrike built the first native single agent and agent list cloud security solution. We've taken cloud security beyond CSPM to include CIEM for securing cloud identity for locating, ASPM controlling and securing cloud applications, EWP to stop malicious behavior and breaches. And now we turn to securing the cloud data itself that flows in and out of the cloud.\nTurning our cloud security focus to date. We're incredibly excited to announce our intended acquisition of Flow security. Flow stood out as the most unique technology amongst a sea of early start-ups by delivering the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. Let me explain the majority of companies and cloud data security focus on 2 things: discovery and classification. Here's where Flow stands apart. Runtime data discovery and classification, data is analyzed, pre and post decryption, enabling precise and instant results, real time and continuous data visibility a live view into data risk, not just at rest, but also in motion with LLM powered adaptive policies. Data leakage prevention, the ability to block data exfiltration including the data exposed through Gen AI services.\nSimply put, Flow is the industry's first and only cloud data runtime security solution. But will also enhance our native data protection module, which is off to a great start already replacing legacy DLP products in Fortune 500 accounts. Customer frustration with legacy DLP is at a fever pitch. Similar to the days of legacy AV where outdated products overstayed their welcome. We will now be able to offer a cloud-centric next-gen alternative, addressing a market currently shackled by ineffective legacy vendors estimated to be an $8 billion TAM in CY 28.\nWith Flow, we will have the most comprehensive data protection from code to application to device to cloud focused on stopping breaches. Next, let's look at identity protection, which surpassed $300 million in ARR more than doubling year-over-year. Q4 was also a record quarter of net new identity customer adds. With 80% of attacks involving identity vectors, we have made identity protection standard fare for modern cybersecurity because it is already integrated into our single agent. Other vendors attempt to offer identity protection through nonintegrated assets feature simply lack identity protection altogether.\nOur identity threat detection and response module remains the markets only single-agent solution that stops lateral movement, protects credentials and secures where identities are actually born active directory. [indiscernible] from the quarter include a 7-figure deal with a mega cruise line using a next-gen product that can never be fully deployed, upgrades and operations were a disaster. When I personally met with them, they were beyond frustrated with being the quality control test bed and tired of too many incidents that slip past their current vendor.\nOur identity solution delivered in one, not two agents. That's the Falcon platform apart. An 8-figure transaction with a major chip manufacturer added identity to their Falcon deployment. Trapped in a large Microsoft ELA, this organization realized Microsoft needed to bring in a start-up to augment its current offering. This piecemeal approach to identity protection created a massive burden of deploying another unproven agent. The customer saw the immediate value of Falcon identity. Our single agent and single-platform approach reduced their Microsoft dependency.\nLastly, let's discuss log-scale next-gen SIM and inflecting Falcon platform solution. We added record net new next-gen SIM ARR in Q4 and growing over 170% year-over-year. As of the end of Q4, our next-gen SIM ending ARR is now greater than $150 million, selected by well over 1,000 customers. Our next-gen SIM is quickly emerging as the go-to Splunk alternative for all businesses looking to leave legacy SIMs. Following M&A consolidation in the legacy SIM market, and mounting dissatisfaction with a slew of withering Sims, the market is hungry for better technology, lower TCO and instant time to value. In large-scale next-gen SIM, all CrowdStrike data is already resident, saving the expense and time of data transfer.\nCustomers are looking to standardize on the right cloud-native data centric platform for actioning their data, where they're manually searching, using automated AI-powered queries or trusting partners to manage their next-gen SIM Falcon experience with pipeline already in the hundreds of millions there's overwhelming interest in lock scale next-gen SIM. One of many noteworthy wins from the quarter was in partnership with Deloitte, which has a hyper-growth log-scale next-gen SIM practice. Together, we closed a 7-figure multiyear next-gen SIM deal with a large European manufacturer displacing Splunk and Elastic and beating out Azure Sentinel. This customer now has 16 Falcon platform modules deployed.\nA major mobile computing company standardized on lock scale next-gen SIM in a 7-figure multiyear deal replacing a legacy sent. We competed against Palo Alto EXIM. The customer was looking for an open architecture versus a closed vendor locked-in approach to cybersecurity. The complexity of having to deploy many different Palo Alto products and multiple agents made CrowdStrike and even easier choice. Lastly, a Fortune 500 hospitality brand grew its relationship with us, again, is placing Splunk and Azure Sentinel in a 7-figure deal. In partnership with E&Y and their global log-scale next-gen SIM practice, this customer grew their SIM use cases by bringing in security and IT data more than before retaining that data for years and benefiting from faster searches.\nLock scale next-gen SIM was significantly faster than Azure Sentinel with a substantially lower total cost of operation, which helped drive this win. Our lock scale next-gen SIM wins illustrate our sticky and growing data gravity with the businesses of all sizes. I can confidently say like scale next-gen SIM is one of the fastest-growing SIMs solutions on the market today. Our pace of innovation has never been faster. We're incredibly excited to announce that Falcon for IT and Charlotte AI are generally available. As our customers look to solve increasingly complex IT challenges across their heterogeneous environments Falcon for IT excitement is palpable. Our customers are also excited about the gen AI productivity gains from Charlotte AI, where over 80% of our beta users believe they will see hours to days of work each week using Charlotte AI.\nThe third and final driver of CrowdStrike's growth at scale is our frictionless go-to-market I'm a big believer that customers don't buy what they don't need and should never be forced to do so. At Falcon, we announced Falcon Flex, a flexible licensing model where we enable customers to use the products they want when they want over the course of a multiyear subscription term. Falcon Flex drives customer stickiness, enabling larger land and helping us expand with customers adopting more Falcon platform solutions faster. A recent noteworthy Falcon Flex deal was a multimillion dollar transaction with a Fortune 500 technology company that leveraged Falcon Flex to go all in with Falcon, consolidating and displacing legacy IT hygiene products, Point Cloud products and legacy DLP products.\nThe right platform solutions and go-to-market make a partner ecosystems leading choice. Some partnership highlights include: accelerating momentum with Dell. Since announcing our Dell partnership last year, we've transacted more than $50 million of total deal value together with customers in every segment and geography. We're in the early innings of where this partnership is going, and I'm thrilled with the momentum that we have with Dell as they standardize new offerings such as their own MDR service on Falcon.\nOur MSSP business is growing by triple digits year-over-year, fueled by the right technology, strategy and partners. MSSPs increasingly want the platform not part of the platform to power cybersecurity transformation. MSSPs are bringing Falcon to tens of thousands of SMBs who lack the staff and time but still need the outcome of the industry's best cybersecurity. Our AWS Marketplace business continues to accelerate at scale, surpassing $1 billion in sales the AWS marketplace to be one of the fastest-growing routes to market. A vast majority of our marketplace business also transacts through resellers in [indiscernible], where we've unified partners and cloud marketplaces for ease, speed and end customer value.\nThe Falcon platform is validated, tested and certified. Industry analysts regularly recognize Halcon and our leadership. Here are two recent examples. First, the Gartner's EPP Magic Quadrant. Our placement speaks for itself. CrowdStrike's positioning as highest in ability to execute and furthest to the right and completeness of vision and this year's Magic Quadrant solidifies our unequivocal market leadership ahead of Microsoft and every other vendor profile. Second, the Forester wafer cloud security placed CrowdStrike as one of only two leaders in the entire cloud security market. ranking highest provision and innovation.\nIn conclusion, Poured single agent, single unified data-centric platform and our mission to stop breaches sets us apart. And starting the company, we brought cybersecurity to the cloud. We pioneered AI for cybersecurity, and we've quickly become the de facto security platform that disrupts, displaces and consolidate other vendors. I couldn't be more excited about the year we completed as well as our bright future. CrowdStrike's contribution to cybersecurity goes beyond technology. It's the power of the crowd. We are cybersecurities community. When cybersecurity professionals apply for jobs, CrowdStrike certification is the required skill set.\nIn the reseller and ISV ecosystem, CrowdStrike is at the top of the line card. In [indiscernible] geography, CrowdStrike is the security operating system. It's CrowdStrike that's on the screen. When talking about the threat landscape, Brown Strike pioneered commercial threat intelligence that governments and companies of all sizes depend on. It's CrowdStrike that delivers billions of new threat detections every month to stop the breach. It's CrowdStrike that is the search bar of security, where analysts complete millions of XDR queries daily. It's CrowdStrike that created cybersecurity [indiscernible] Gen AI stock assistant to make every user a power user. CrowdStrike, were more than 0.5 million cybersecurity defenders log in every day to protect society by stopping breaches. The technology, the crowd the mission, this is what makes CrowdStrike cybersecurity decisive platform. With that, I'll turn the call over to Burt.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and a record finish to the year, highlighting our outstanding execution, growing market leadership and accelerating adoption of the Falcon platform. For the full fiscal year, we achieved 34% and 36% ending ARR and revenue growth, respectively, while delivering significant leverage on the bottom line. Operating income grew 86% year-over-year to reach a record $660.3 million or 22% of revenue and net income attributable to CrowdStrike and EPS more than doubled to reach a record $751.8 million or $3.09 per diluted share.\nFree cash flow grew 39% year-over-year to reach $938.2 million or 31% of revenue, exceeding our target for the year. Additionally, we are very proud to have achieved the important milestone of GAAP profitability for the past 4 quarters and full fiscal year in less than 5 years following our IPO. Our achievements in fiscal year 2024 represent another high watermark for CrowdStrike. Through our consistent focus on execution, we have efficiently scaled the business, growing ending ARR by over 10x from our IPO in fiscal year 2019, delivering significant operating leverage and growing our free cash flow margin profile to above 30%.\nWe continue to aggressively invest in our innovation engine and flight the company to achieve its vision of reaching $10 billion in ARR over the next 5 to 7 years. Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $282 million, up 27% off of last year's record Q4, representing our second consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. And we finished the quarter with $3.44 billion in ending ARR, up 34% over last year. Demand in the quarter was broad and we have a record Q1 pipeline as we executed on our platform strategy, closed many large consolidation deals and extended our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses.\nWhile companies may be fatigued with other vendors, they have embraced CrowdStrike's platform strategy and want to buy more of the Falcon [indiscernible]. This is evidenced by, first, the number of deals with 8 or more modules more than doubling year-over-year in Q4. Second, subscription customers were 5 or more 6 or more and 7 or more modules growing to 64%, 43% and 27% of subscription customers, respectively. Third, the number of customers with greater than $1 million of ending ARR growing to more than 580 and finally, the growth of deals with total value exceeding $1 million accelerated to over 30% and reached an all-time record at over 250 in Q4.\nWe finished the year with 29,000 subscription customers which excludes smaller customers served through our MSSP partners. We are landing bigger with new customers on average adopting 4.9 modules out of the gate, an increase over last year. Our gross retention rate remained high at 98%, and our dollar-based net retention rate was consistent with last quarter at 119%, which is slightly below our benchmark as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals. For the interim FY '24 quarters, Net retention was 119% in Q3, 119% in Q2, 122% in Q1.\nLooking into FY '25, a we expect our dollar-based net retention rate to fluctuate with minus a few points of 120% as the business scales to even greater heights and customers continue to land bigger and with more modules. Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $845.3 million. Subscription revenue grew 33% over Q4 of last year to reach $795.9 million. Professional services revenue was $49.4 million representing 26% year-over-year growth. The geographic mix of fourth quarter revenue consisted of approximately 68% from the U.S., 16% from Europe, Middle East and Africa 10% from the Asia Pacific region and 6% from all other markets.\nTotal gross margin increased by 282 basis points year-over-year to reach 78% and subscription gross margin was above 80% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 191 basis points over the prior year. Our strong gross margin performance was driven by our ability to command stable pricing, supported by the exceptional customer value delivered by the Falcon platform as well as our continued investments in data center and workload optimization. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $448.1 million or 53% of revenue compared to 60% of revenue in the prior year. Our strategic investments in talent and innovation underpin our ability to scale the business and deliver profitable growth.\nIn the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating income grew 123% year-over-year to reach a record $213.1 million, and operating margin increased by 10 percentage points year-over-year to reach a record 25%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q4 grew to a record $236.2 million or $0.95 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year-over-year. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 248 million shares. We ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments grew to a record $3.47 billion.\nCash flow from operations was a record $347.0 million. Free cash flow reached a record $283.0 million or 33% of revenue, achieving a rule of on a free cash flow basis. Before I move to our outlook, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. First, we are encouraged by the momentum in the business including larger deal sizes, increased win rates and a record Q1 pipeline. However, we continue to maintain a consistent and prudent approach to our outlook amid a macro environment that remains challenging and therefore, the guidance we are providing today assumes a consistent challenging macro backdrop.\nSecond, while we do not specifically guide to ending or net new ARR, given the incredible performance of Q4, I will share our current seasonality assumptions with respect to net new ARR in Q1, which calls for Q1 net new ARR year-over-year growth to be at least double digits up to the low teens. Third, given our strong momentum in the market, we are increasing our pace of hiring in FY '25 and as we continue to invest in our innovation engine and go-to-market functions to scale the business to $10 billion of ARR and beyond. As a result of increased hiring in the first half of the year, changes to the timing of our merit cycle and the timing of certain marketing programs, we expect operating leverage to be more weighted to the back half of FY '25.\nNext, we are raising our free cash flow target for FY '25 from between 30% and 32% to between 31% and 33% of revenue. Our assumptions on interest income and expense CapEx and cash outlay for taxes will be included after this call in our earnings presentation available on our Investor Relations website. Moving to our outlook. For the first quarter of FY '25, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $902.2 million to $905.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 30% to 31%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $188.1 million to $190.8 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $22.4 million to $223.1 million.\nWe expect diluted non-GAAP net income personal to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.89 to $0.90, utilizing a weighted average share count of 248 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2025, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,924.9 to $3,989.0 million reflecting a growth rate of 28% to 31% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $863.6 million and $913.0 million. We expect fiscal 2025 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $940.3 million and $989.7 million. Utilizing 250 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to Crowdstrike to be in the range of $3.77 to $3.97. George and I will now take your questions.",

Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. I would like to begin my remarks today by expressing gratitude to our customers, who proudly trust CrowdStrike as their cybersecurity platform consolidator for the AI era. Gratitude to our partners, who win with CrowdStrike, taking our joint customers on Falcon platform transformation journeys from device to cloud, to identity, to data and beyond. And to our team for their passionate dedication to our mission, stopping breaches, finding adversaries and delivering the very best cybersecurity outcomes.\nMoving on to Q3. Despite a challenging macro environment and geopolitical tension, I am extremely proud of the resilience of our business and that we delivered a record Q3. CrowdStrike surpassed the $3 billion ARR milestone, with an ending ARR of $3.15 billion, growing 35% year-over-year. CrowdStrike is the fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software vendor in history to achieve this milestone.\nIn Q3, we delivered double-digit net new ARR acceleration at scale, powered by customer demand for the depth and breadth of CrowdStrike's AI-native XDR platform, terrific execution exemplified by rising win rates against our competitors and acceleration in our cloud security and identity businesses, as well as a record quarter in our last scale next-gen FIM business.\nOur standout top line performance came in tandem with P&L discipline as our profitability soar to record heights. Q3 was indeed a quarter of record. Let me share several of our financial highlights. Record net new ARR of $223 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth from acceleration in new and expansion business. Record non-GAAP subscription gross margin, record GAAP and non-GAAP operating profitability, record free cash flow of $239 million representing 30% free cash flow margin and achieving free cash flow Rule of 66, up from 63 last quarter. Burt will share more color on our financials and platform adoption stats following my remarks. This was a standout quarter and places us well on the path to $10 billion in ARR that we outlined in our latest investor briefing.\nThe market continues to validate CrowdStrike's widening leadership position. While other scale back R&D, we are increasing our investments as innovation is the lifeblood of our company. We continue to make meaningful investments in go-to-market and profitable growth. To this end, we received multiple industry awards and accolades over the course of this quarter.\nAcross industry analyst firms, CrowdStrike is consistently top rated. In Q3, CrowdStrike was awarded a perfect 100% across protection, visibility and analytics detections in MITRE's latest attack testing, an industry first. Recognized as Gartner customer choice and one of the highest rated in their latest peer insight voice of the customer for EPP report. Named the leader in the Forrester Wave for endpoint security, and positioned as a leader in the IDC vulnerability management market scape. Our leadership position is translating into record demand for our exposure management solution in its first quarter on the market. Our market presence and open platform approach to XDR is a uniting force in cybersecurity.\nIn Q3, we hosted Fal.Con, our flagship customer and ecosystem event with more than 4,000 attendees and 70 sponsors. This was fast followed by our Falcon on the Road series, where we have already hosted Falcon Tokyo and São Paulo, with thousands in attendance. The drumbeat of innovation was loud and clear with multiple releases and announcements showcasing CrowdStrike as the XDR leader, including the Falcon platform Raptor release, which standardizes all of our customers on LogScale. This builds our platform data gravity, coupling native Falcon data with third-party data ingest, further enabling our customers to realize SIM and XDR use cases on Falcon.\nFalcon for IT, a new module to unify IT and SecOps from hygiene to patching, Falcon for IT lets customers consolidate multiple use cases and replace legacy products with our single-agent architecture. Our new Falcon data protection module that liberates customers from legacy DLP products with modern, frictionless data security, which prevents data exfiltration. Falcon Foundry, a no-code application development solution, enabling both customers and technology partners to build directly on Falcon. Foundry epitomizes the true definition of a platform offering linerless apps.\nWe announced the acquisition of Bionic, bringing application security posture management to the Falcon Cloud Security Suite. Falcon Cloud Security is the industry's most comprehensive and innovative cloud security offering, with integrated agent and agentless CSPM, CIM, CWP and now ASPM. We released the beta and pricing for Charlotte AI, our AI-powered stock analysts which was incredibly well received. CrowdStrike's generative AI, leveraging multiple foundational models can turn hours of work into minutes while democratizing cybersecurity, unlocking value and adoption across the entire breadth of the Falcon platform.\nEnthusiasm for Falcon for IT, our automation and hygiene module for IT teams is exciting to witness because it is something so intuitive that our customers want. Like data protection, Falcon for IT solved a clear and long-neglected pain point, where customers are forced to rely on multiple legacy products that have long outstayed their welcome. Customers are eager to consolidate their agent estate while reducing cost and complexity. Falcon for IT illustrates the power of CrowdStrike's single-platform approach. We have the real estate and data foundation to solve ever-evolving use cases, delighting our customers while disrupting vendors that have failed to evolve.\nThe resounding takeaway from my customer engagements at Fal.Con and throughout the quarter is that CrowdStrike is the right choice for CSOs, CIOs, executive teams and boards. Here's why. Our build by design, single-platform architecture requires no integration, no switching and no platformization. Our unified cloud native platform and critical beachfront real estate within the customer state naturally create cybersecurity data gravity, falling for today's challenges while preparing for the unknowns of tomorrow.\nOrganizations are looking for a trusted cybersecurity consolidator. CrowdStrike's -- is cybersecurity's AI consolidator, liberating organizations from a litany of increasingly ineffective legacy tools, multiple agents, point price and fragmented pseudo platforms. Illustrating this point, deals with 8 or more modules increased 78% year-over-year in the quarter. This is what consolidation looks like. And third, stopping the breach matters more today than ever. Adversaries continue to evolve moving faster and increasing their use of dark AI, turning AI into a weapon for evil. At the same time, legislative and SEC regulatory oversight pressures boards and executives to prioritize cybersecurity.\nWith these 3 takeaways in mind, let's start by expanding on the first, why CrowdStrike is the definitive single security platform. Multiple fragmented platforms, consoles and data silos force customers to focus on integrating not security outcomes. Our relentless focus on innovation and commitment to a single build-by-design platform creates cybersecurity source of truth. Built on this platform foundation, our cloud identity and LogScale next-gen SIM products are examples of IPO-worthy hypergrowth businesses.\nLet's take a look at our momentum in cloud security. Growth accelerated in the quarter, and we're entering Q4 with a record pipeline. Noteworthy wins in the quarter included an 8-figure total deal value with a new Falcon customer in the hospitality vertical where we now secure their vast multi-cloud estate as part of a broader Microsoft replacement. A 7-figure cloud security expansion with one of the largest enterprise SaaS providers where we replaced multiple existing point products with Falcon Cloud Security. A 7-figure cloud security expansion with a major apparel brand, where we replaced a firewall hardware vendors cloud security with our unified Falcon cloud security offering.\nCrowdStrike has one of the largest and fastest-growing cloud security businesses by ARR and customer count. The number of customers we protect in the public cloud has increased 45% from last year, as we rapidly replace other cloud security vendors in the ecosystem. Point product, API-based CSPM have emerged as the easiest to replace as the market rapidly adopts our consolidated view that together, agent and agentless security stops the breach. Combined with our recently completed Bionic acquisition, we're the only vendor offering ASTM, CSPM, BWP and CIM under a single CNAs umbrella.\nMoving to Identity Threat Protection, where we delivered a record quarter. More and more companies are investing in protection from the growing number of identity-based attacks with highly visible breaches prominently covered in the news over the past few months. Identity Threat Protection wins in the quarter included an 8-figure total deal value win in the federal government, where Falcon Identity landed as the identity security solution of choice. And multiple 7-figure wins across diverse verticals, including financial services, consumer packaged goods and manufacturing to name a few.\nWe see a long runway for guiding organizations on their Zero Trust transformation with our identity threat protection, given our rapidly growing threat vector, a largely untapped market where most organizations aren't protected and our frictionless unified architecture that secures identity across devices, clouds, domain controllers and active directory. CrowdStrike pioneered the identity threat protection category, and we are unmatched in the market as the only company with a single agent solution for both on-prem and cloud environments.\nMoving to LogScale. Our LogScale next-gen SIM business achieved new records in Q3, surpassing the $100 million ARR milestone. The combination of search speed, data gravity and cost efficiencies, all integrated within the Falcon platform, best LogScale miles apart from its competitors. However, it is the future of this business that really excites me. Our LogScale next-gen SIM opportunity is supercharged by pervasive discontent with legacy SIMs, recent M&A activity and CrowdStrike's growing position as cybersecurity's platform of record.\nWe have seen a significant and pronounced increase in interest among customers looking to leapfrog their expensive, cumbersome and slow legacy SIMs. Our next-gen SIM offering is the right technology in the right place at the right time to benefit from market dynamics and the scale of CrowdStrike.\nQ3 wins include a 7-figure expansion in a major consumer staples company, selected LogScale to ingest data from third parties, correlate alerts and benefit from long-term data retention. A 7-figure financial services, new customer land, where CrowdStrike was called in to stop a breach. With the desire to operationalize their high fidelity security data without compromising on cost, Falcon LogScale was an easy choice to replace the incumbent Microsoft. A 7-figure new logo land in a business process outsourcing firm that had decided it was time to replace their antiquated SIM with LogScale, while also adopting the Falcon platform for XDR, Identity and Cloud Security.\nOur advancement into the next-gen SIM market is accelerated by the Raptor release, which brings LogScale to the forefront of the Falcon platform experience. With Raptor, we've made it significantly easier for customers to build their security and data lake efforts on top of LogScale next-gen SIM, across our native first-party data and that of any third-party product. Our single-platform approach evolves and broadens the aperture of cybersecurity.\nCrowdStrike is cybersecurity's AI consolidator, liberating organizations from legacy AV, thus far EDRs and a hodgepodge of hygiene, compliant, vulnerability device management tools, costly and clunky SIMS, and a confusing alphabet soup of immature cloud point products. This lengthy list of costly point products can be left behind saving tens of millions annually for businesses.\nMost importantly, stopping the breach matters more today than ever before. adversaries don't discriminate, no matter the industry vertical, the geography or the business side, stopping the breach is nonnegotiable. The business disruption and financial losses from bridges are growing. Combing quarters on security is one of the most costly choices a business can make. The costs associated with cleaning up a breach can exceed $100 million. Our seminal cybersecurity platform innovation as well as threat intelligence and service expertise delivers the best security outcomes. This is why we win. Stopping the breach is the security outcome that CrowdStrike delivers. This makes our business incredibly durable in diverse economic cycles. We are a business necessity.\nA win this quarter, exemplifying our unmatched capabilities is a large multinational who was using legacy EDR until they were breached. They called CrowdStrike, and we quickly remediated the breach. Seeing the power of the Falcon platform, this customer purchased Falcon Complete, Identity Complete and LogScale next-gen SIM for hundreds of thousands of workloads, helping this large multinational in their time of need showcases CrowdStrike's differentiation. Our AI trained on cybersecurity's richest data set drives the industry's most comprehensive protection and automation. We couple the right technology platform with cybersecurity's best and brightest incident responders and the expertise that comes from curating the industry's leading threat intelligence.\nThe need for stopping breaches is not just an enterprise concern. The problem is just as pronounced in the SMB market, especially the S of SMB, where businesses remain stuck on legacy signature-based AV, oftentimes not knowing that better exists for them. Falcon Go is fit for purpose, delivering big protection for their small business.\nWith our latest release of Falcon Go, we delivered a whole new user experience, creating the easy button for cybersecurity. Removing the need for CrowdStrike users to have cyber or IT skills. The new console is intuitive and preconfigured for immediate SMB success. We're always looking to remove the friction from the customer experience and this new release makes Falcon Go as easy as one click to accelerate customer adoption. Falcon Go is a major step for SMB cybersecurity, and we are now investing in go-to market. We launched sales of Falcon Go on Amazon business, a marketplace where over 6 million SMBs purchased everything for their businesses. With Falcon Go, our mission of stopping breaches extends to businesses of all sizes large and small.\nOur go-to-market is propelled by our partner ecosystem. Partners bring CrowdStrike into new accounts and drive platform adoption in existing customers. Year-to-date, 62% of all our new logo wins were partner sourced. The efficacy and success of our channel-led growth was reported by Canalys, the channel's leading industry analyst firm in their most recent cybersecurity research. Canalys reported CrowdStrike's endpoint market share as #1 ahead of Microsoft. In addition, the research highlights CrowdStrike as the fastest-growing cybersecurity vendor in the channel ahead of Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks, among others.\nWe are setting new records. We announced surpassing $1 billion in AWS Marketplace sales, being the first and fastest cybersecurity vendor to reach this milestone exemplifies CrowdStrike's leadership position as the cloud's cybersecurity platform of choice, and our AWS momentum is not slowing. This past quarter was a CrowdStrike record AWS Marketplace quarter. Our global systems integrator alliance partners are increasingly engaging with us across the entire Falcon platform.\nFor example, E&Y built a 150-person strong and growing global LogScale next-gen SIM practice based on the demand they are seeing for SIM transformation and are technological superiority. In addition, E&Y refers their clients to CrowdStrike for incident response engagements and secured digital transformation projects. To date, we have done over $160 million in business with E&Y across 24 countries.\nIn closing, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, which impacted even the largest cybersecurity vendors, we delivered a record Q3, accelerating double-digit net new ARR growth, record free cash flow and record profitability, surpassing $3 billion of ARR as the fastest and only pure-play cybersecurity software vendor in history to achieve this milestone validates CrowdStrike's market leadership.\nOur Q4 setup is strong with a record pipeline and the competitive gap between CrowdStrike and other players in the market continues to widen. I'm excited about the path we are on and the progress we are making to $10 billion in ARR. Today's cyber environment is exactly why I built CrowdStrike. The adversary is moving faster and the rise of dark AI significantly increases attacker sophistication. Falcon has made cybersecurity easy and effective for small businesses to the world's largest enterprises. Simply put, CrowdStrike is cybersecurity's platform consolidator of choice. The platform is winning at scale. Our customers are looking to Falcon for more workloads, more use cases and more security outcomes. CrowdStrike remains unrelenting in our focus and promise, stopping the breach.\nWith that, we have a busy and exciting Q4 ahead of us, and I will now turn it over to Burt for commentary on our financial performance.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. Additionally, the results we are reporting today include the acquisition of Bionic, which closed during the quarter and was de minimis to revenue and ARR.\nOutstanding execution from the CrowdStrike team resulted in a record third quarter despite a continued challenging macro environment. Financial highlights in the quarter included an acceleration in net new ARR growth, driving ending ARR well above the $3 billion milestone. 96% year-over-year growth in operating income and record operating margin, record net income, which more than doubled year-over-year, record GAAP profitability for the third consecutive quarter and record free cash flow.\nIn the third quarter, we achieved record net new ARR of $223.1 million, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 13%. Demand in the quarter was broad-based as we expanded our leadership across the market from large enterprises to small businesses. New customer acquisition, strong expansion business within existing customers and a record quarter with the U.S. federal government contributed to the acceleration in net new ARR growth and ending ARR reached $3.15 billion, up 35% year-over-year.\nWe continue to be very pleased with our platform strategy as subscription customers with 5 or more, 6 or more, and 7 or more modules now represent 63%, 42% and 26% of subscription customers, respectively. Our gross retention rate remained high, and our dollar-based net retention rate was slightly below our benchmark in Q3, as the mix of net new ARR from new customers has remained above our expectations and we continue to land bigger deals.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 35% over Q3 of last year to reach $786.0 million. Subscription revenue grew 34% over Q3 of last year to reach $733.5 million. Professional services revenue was a record $52.6 million, representing 57% year-over-year growth.\nThe geographic mix of third quarter revenue consisted of approximately 69% from the U.S., 15% from Europe, Middle East and Africa, 10% from the Asia Pacific region and 6% from other markets. Our investments in data center and workload optimization that we outlined in our Falcon investor briefing in September, continuing to bear fruit, resulting in record subscription gross margin performance above 80% in the third quarter.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were $436.1 million or 55% of revenue versus $348.6 million last year or 60% of revenue. Q3 sales and marketing and R&D expenses grew 23% and 31% year-over-year, respectively. We continue to invest aggressively in innovation and growth while exceeding our profitability expectations. Third quarter non-GAAP operating income grew 96% year-over-year to reach a record $175.7 million, and operating margin increased by 7 percentage points year-over-year to reach a record 22%.\nAs we outlined during our Falcon investor briefing in September, we have once again raised our target model which now calls for subscription gross margin of 82% to 85%, operating margin of 28% to 32%, and free cash flow margin of 34% to 38%. We expect to achieve our new target model within the next 3 to 5 years as we also flight the company to reach $10 billion of ARR over the next 5 to 7 years.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q3 grew to a record $199.2 million or $0.82 on a diluted per share basis, each more than doubling year-over-year. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate third quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to Crowdstrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 244 million shares.\nWe ended the third quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $3.17 billion and reflects the $238.7 million payment net of cash acquired for the acquisition of Bionic. Cash flow from operations was a Q3 record of $273.5 million. Free cash flow reached a record $239.0 million or 30% of revenue, achieving a Rule of 66 on a free cash flow basis.\nMoving to our outlook. As George outlined, strong demand for the Falcon platform is driving our pipeline to new heights. However, the macro environment remains challenging with continued increased budget scrutiny, and as a result, we are not expecting to see the typical Q4 budget flush.\nBalancing these factors, we are maintaining our net new ARR assumptions, which call for in line to modestly up net new ARR for the full year and double-digit year-over-year net new ARR growth in the second half. As our guidance reflects, we are raising our full year revenue and profitability expectations for the year. Additionally, we are maintaining our target of 30% free cash flow margin for the full fiscal year.\nMore specifically, for the fourth quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $836.6 million to $840.0 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 31% to 32%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $186.5 million to $189.0 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $199.6 million to $202.1 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.81 to $0.82, utilizing a weighted average share count of 245 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3046.8 million to $3050.2 million, reflecting a growth rate of 36% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $633.6 million and $636.2 million. We expect fiscal 2024 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $715.2 million and $717.7 million. Utilizing 243 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $2.95 to $2.96.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.",

Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter, we exceeded our guidance across both top and bottom line metrics, delivering strong durable growth at scale and credible leverage and operating within our target model on every metric. Even with a challenging macro backdrop, we delivered an impressive quarter highlighting CrowdStrike's structural competitive moat making Falcon the definitive cybersecurity platform for the cloud era.\nFinancial highlights for the quarter include: ending ARR of $2.9 billion up 37% year-over-year, with record contribution from cloud security, identity protection and log scale next-gen SIM, together surpassing $500 million in ARR. Record non-GAAP operating margin of 21.3%. Record non-GAAP net income, which grew 109% year-over-year. GAAP profitability for the second consecutive quarter. Record Q2 free cash flow of $188.7 million and an over 80% year-over-year increase in deals involving 8 or more Falcon platform modules.\nOur commitment to operational excellence and the utilization of AI within our platform and across our entire organization is driving enviable leverage in our financial results even as we aggressively invest in fueling growth. As Burt will discuss, we are raising our revenue outlook for the year and bringing in our time line to sustainably achieve our non-GAAP target operating model. We now expect to exit Q4 within our target non-GAAP operating margin model and to remain within our target model on an annual basis starting in FY '25.\nIn an increasingly digital cloud-defined world, cybersecurity is becoming more important than ever. The SEC's recently enacted cybersecurity disclosure requirements substantiate the growing gravity of cybersecurity threats, elevating the category from an operational concern to an urgent Board level and CXO spend priority. At CrowdStrike, we continue to build cybersecurities platform of choice, offering a simple and powerful promise. We stop breaches.\nHeading into the second half of the year, we see increased momentum in the business, driven by record levels of new logo and upsell pipeline, record deal registrations from our market-leading partner ecosystem and record levels of customers proudly trusting CrowdStrike to be their long-term security platform consolidator of choice. We are also observing substantial changes in the competitive landscape, uniquely benefiting CrowdStrike.\nWith the business momentum we see and competitive market dynamics, we believe our second half performance will yield double-digit net new ARR growth. Working in cybersecurity for the past 30 years, I have recognized and created tectonic shifts in this industry and we are in the midst of 1 right now. Organizations need better, faster and more cost-effective protection for a digital society. Organizations need seamless, not stitched together automation to break down legacy data silos. Organizations need lower TCO and more efficient ROI-driven investment. The competitive battlefield of cybersecurity today reflects these realities, separating the wheat from the chaff. Those who have platforms versus those with point products masquerading as platform stories.\nWhat was a market littered with dozens of companies is quickly consolidating to several vendors. Smaller, narrower point product companies are being left behind. These companies are quickly going the way of legacy AV, already in the hands or looking for the safe hands of strategic or private equity buyers. Point products, single feature cloud security companies are learning the hard way that platforms built by design win at scale. Today's competitive landscape solidifies CrowdStrike's leadership position and turns what were once competitors into immediate shared donors.\nCrowdStrike is purpose-built for this market. We have the technology innovation, mission-driven team and sizable scale to lead cybersecurity platform consolidation.\nShifting from competitive market dynamics to CrowdStrike, here are the reasons I see us winning in the second half and beyond. The Falcon platform enables real consolidation with best-of-breed outcomes, and we are flighting XDR transformations across cloud security, identity protection and large scale next-gen SIM. Each of these 3 platform solutions are high-growth, sizable businesses. Each are examples of IPO worthy companies in their own right and each are seamlessly integrated components of the Falcon platform.\nLet me first provide commentary on CrowdStrike as cybersecurities consolidator, and then I'll follow up with updates on our cloud, identity and next-gen SIM Falcon platform businesses. The Falcon platform has not only become the standard for delivering AI-powered cybersecurity, it has become the foundational cybersecurity platform for our customers. Our revolutionary cloud-native architecture consists of an AI-powered data platform and lightweight sensor form factor, which remains the easiest and fastest to deploy with no reboots. Our form factor was made for the digital anywhere enterprise, not bound by operating system or hardware-defined network perimeters. CrowdStrike has the visibility to detect and prevent attacks and the workflow integrations and automation to remediate. We have the prime enterprise real estate on devices and multi-cloud workloads to automate and consolidate cybersecurity.\nCustomer after customer I met with at the Black App Security Conference wants to anchor their cybersecurity on the Falcon platform. These customers see us as their core partner in their security journey. With consolidation being a hot topic, let's talk about what security outcomes really mean.\nStopping the breach. This is the most important outcome. Companies need vendors who are trusted partners that can understand, prevent and respond to threat actors to stop breaches. CrowdStrike is uniquely positioned to stop breaches with our technology, threat intelligence and services.\nSaving time, delivering everything in a single modern console coupled with generative AI reduces dwell time and makes cybersecurity faster and easier. Saving money with most enterprises still buying north of 60 cybersecurity point products, there's too much cybersecurity shelf wear. Individual products require learning and maintenance, building integrations and higher staffing costs. Eliminating the time managing, integrating, updating and operating superfluous tools represents real savings regarding product, people, process and cost.\nAnd finally, doing more, CrowdStrike's Falcon unlocks new capabilities for organizations such as deploying their first code to cloud security, identity protection, exposure management, attack surface reduction, next-gen SIM and more, all in 1 integrated platform. The breadth of native Falcon capabilities in our prime real estate within the enterprise and SMB technology stack is our advantage and creates significant customer expansion path. Our open XDR platform, the ability to take in first-party and third-party data is quickly becoming the enterprise data destination. We see data gravity for the management of cybersecurity, but also broader observability use cases as a competitive moat for CrowdStrike.\nCustomers gain greater value with every module they adopt, reducing agents, security gaps, complexity and cost, enabling them to transform and consolidate their security stack with the Falcon platform.\nLet me share several recent new customer wins that speak to this. First is a major auto manufacturer that tried but failed to consolidate their security on Microsoft E5. This company's security team quickly realized Microsoft's complexity, multiple consoles, lack of integration, miss detections and complex deployments hampered their ability to defend themselves and consolidate. This customer is now consolidating on the Falcon platform with Falcon Complete for endpoint, identity and cloud. Now with a single agent, single user interface and single platform, they have complete visibility across their end points, cloud and identities and the ability to stop threats in real time.\nBy moving from expensive Microsoft E5 to CrowdStrike, organizations can save 50% plus per user per year on Microsoft licensing costs, adding up to millions of dollars of savings.\nAnother 7-figure consolidation win was with a leading residential construction manufacturer who took their Falcon Complete subscription to the next level. Beyond the endpoint, this customer purchased Falcon Cloud security, identity protection, log scale and Falcon Surface, our external attack surface management offering. Falcon has become the platform of consolidation and trust for this enterprise, reducing spend with 3 other vendors by more than 60% and wholly eliminating multiple vendors from their stack.\nConsolidation is not only fueling bigger new logo lands but also increased platform adoption, especially in the areas of cloud security, identity protection and log scale, which, in aggregate, contribute well over $0.5 billion in ending ARR. Financial services, technology, retail and manufacturing industry verticals continue to demonstrate strong demand with large deal sizes. In Q2, we closed over 80% more deals involving 8 or more modules than a year ago as customers increasingly look to CrowdStrike to consolidate their security stack.\nLet me now discuss our momentum in the platform areas of cloud, identity and log scale, next-gen SIM, where we are setting new records. Let's start with cloud security, where net new ARR growth accelerated meaningfully and reached a new record during the quarter. Ending ARR for Falcon modules deployed in a public cloud grew to $296 million up 70% year-over-year, larger than almost every single vendor in cloud security today. Driving this inflection is our focused innovation on Falcon Cloud Security, our CNAPP suite offering, which unifies agent and agentless cloud-native security capabilities into a single offering, providing immediate time to value across all major cloud environments. Net new ARR growth for Falcon Cloud Security accelerated to 70% quarter-over-quarter. We have made it easier for customers to consume Falcon Cloud Security with a single SKU and customers are rapidly standardizing on CrowdStrike as their cloud security platform of choice.\nCustomers are eager to move away from multiple point product vendors to Falcon's unified best-of-breed platform. We added many new capabilities to our CNAPP offering, including infrastructure as code, side scanning and attack path analysis, creating the most comprehensive CNAPP solution on the market. Combined with Falcon Surface, our external attack surface monitoring solution that we acquired last year, we now provide a complete outside in and inside-out view of a customer's security posture.\nThis past quarter, we executed a go-to-market emphasis on cloud security, hosting a virtual cloud security summit with over 12,500 security and DevOp participants followed by cloud-focused partner and sales plays. Our integrated cloud suite, easy management and lower TCO value propositions are resonating at scale. We closed a record number of cloud customer wins in Q2, including multiple 7-figure cloud expansions with Fortune 500 customers together in excess of $20 million in deal value.\nAn iconic Fortune 50 retailer prioritized a full, not phased, Falcon Cloud Security purchase of $5 million in deal value, choosing CrowdStrike over a point product cloud security scanner and displacing their firewall vendor. Additionally, a major Fortune 500 manufacturer sought product superiority and a single-platform approach replacing WIZ with Falcon Cloud Security. Other cloud wins include New Lance, with financial, technology, media and healthcare companies as well as public sector accounts.\nFinally, I want to highlight a cloud expansion with a Fortune 1000 retail brand facing increasing costs from their incumbent cloud security vendor and struggling with limited visibility over their cloud assets. This customer launched an initiative to unify their security stack and remove gaps between traditional endpoint, cloud runtime security and posture management. CrowdStrike is the only vendor that met these requirements and a unified platform and helped them drive down their overall operational costs.\nThe cloud security market opportunity is massive and growing rapidly with the potential to reach $18 billion in calendar year 2026. Cloud exploitation by adversaries increased 95% year-over-year and the only way to stop threats at all time is with a fully fledged agent and agentless cloud suite like Falcon. Only CrowdStrike delivers a fully integrated CNAPP solution that unifies cloud workload protection, cloud security posture management, cloud infrastructure entitlement management, threat intelligence and threat hunting in 1 platform across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\nOur leadership in cloud security was recognized in Frost & Sullivan's recently published 2023 Frost Radar, Cloud Workload Protection Platform report based on our impressive CWPP business growth, our comprehensive cloud visibility and our unrivaled cloud detection and response services.\nIdentity Protection also stands out with over $200 million in ending ARR, up 194% year-over-year. Identity-based attacks represented 62% of all interactive intrusions we observed in the last 12 months. CrowdStrike's Falcon Identity Protection delivers the best protection against identity attacks recently winning the CRN's Tech Innovator Award as the best solution on the market. The identity protection adoption rate for new customers grew more than 100% year-over-year and the total number of deals tied to identity increased 200%.\nHighlighting this in Q2 is a financial services firm that initially turned to CrowdStrike for incident response following a breach where an attacker used legitimate credentials to bypass the company's existing security products and remain undetected for a week. Following remediation by CrowdStrike incident responders, this customer consolidated on the Falcon platform, adopting Falcon Complete, Falcon Identity Complete and Falcon Cloud Security Complete, displacing and consolidating 4 vendors in the process, Microsoft, SentinelOne, Arctic Wolf and Sophos.\nMoving to log scale. Net new ARR from log-scale next-gen SIM reached a new record as customers increasingly adopt a solution to sell multiple use cases. The number of customers using log scale grew more than 3x year-over-year. Log scale ending ARR grew over 200% year-over-year and is quickly approaching the $100 million ARR milestone, which we expect to achieve in Q3. A Fortune 500 manufacturing company expanded on the Falcon platform with a nearly $4 million deal value log scale purchase after becoming frustrated with their legacy SIM vendor due to its increasingly prohibitive costs, complex licensing and poor forced on-prem to cloud migration experience. Given log scale's unparalleled speed and flexibility and cost-effective licensing model, this customer is now leveraging the Falcon platform to transition away from legacy SIM, supercharging the speed of both their observability and security use cases.\nFalcon is a platform that brings the benefits of generative AI to life for every SOC, CISO, CXO and enterprise. We do it with proprietary threat data, and we do it with industry-leading AI expertise. Charlotte AI is the engine powering our portfolio of generative AI capabilities across the platform utilizing CrowdStrike's high-fidelity data advantage. Charlotte AI helps Falcon users of all skill levels to do more in the platform by automating workflows, which fuels module adoption and reduces the mean time to detect and respond. The net benefit to customers from our pioneering use of AI in a single platform is faster results, better security outcomes and lower overall cost, ushering in a new era of machine speed security.\nWe showcased Charlotte AI earlier this month at BlackHat where we're the only vendor of consequence to showcase a live, not PowerPoint, demo of generative AI in action. Public reception was fantastic, and we will release Charlotte AI pricing at Falcon.\nMoving to partners. 64% of new customers from large enterprises to SMBs were sourced from our partners in the quarter. Our industry-leading partner ecosystem is embracing the broader Falcon platform building long-term differentiated businesses with CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike is AWS' largest cybersecurity go-to-market partner. And we recently won their ISV Partner of the Year Award, validating our cloud security category leadership, commitment to innovation and go-to-market success, particularly in cloud security.\nFinally, the initial momentum we are building through our partnership with Dell is exciting, delivering 8 figures in deal value in just a few months. As we highlighted previously, our resell agreement with Dell hit the market in Q1 delivering in-quarter new deals in every major geography region. In the second quarter, we went live with attached device sales globally and rapidly achieved industry-leading device attach rates.\nDemand in our markets has remained resilient. And even as we continue to operate at a time of macro uncertainty and increased deal scrutiny, our win rates remain high. The momentum we are building with consolidation deals specifically tied to cloud security, identity protection, next-gen SIM and increased partner engagement is driving our pipeline to record levels. Additionally, Fal.Con, our annual customer conference, is our biggest selling event of the year, and this year, registration is already up 80% from last year.\nThe Falcon ecosystem will be on full display with over 70 technology go-to-market partner sponsors in attendance. I would like to invite our investors and analysts to join us at Fal.Com. Similar to last year, in conjunction with the event, we will hold an investor briefing featuring conversations with customers and partners. This year's briefing will also include a financial discussion led by our CFO, Burt Podbere. Please note that customer sessions will not be available on the webcast, so please join us in person.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP.\nWe delivered a strong second quarter amid a continued challenging macro environment. In Q2, we scaled the business to new heights and drove significant operating leverage. New milestones in the quarter included record operating margin, which was within our target operating model for the first time in company history, record non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike, which more than doubled year-over-year, and GAAP profitability for the second quarter in a row.\nThe demand environment remained resilient, and we built record levels of new logo and upsell pipeline. We achieved Q2 net new ARR of $196.2 million, which was above stated assumptions as our relentless focus on sales execution enabled us to perform well even as we continue to see heightened deal scrutiny and elongated sales cycles. We ended the quarter with ending ARR reaching $2.93 billion, up 37% over last year.\nWe continue to be very pleased with the success of our land and expand strategy with our dollar-based net retention rate effectively at our benchmark in Q2. Subscription customers with 5 or more, six or more and 7 or more modules increased to 63%, 41% and 24% of subscription customers, respectively.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 37% over Q2 of last year to reach $731.6 million. Subscription revenue grew 36% over Q2 of last year to reach $690.0 million. Professional services revenue was $41.7 million, setting a new record for the 12th consecutive quarter and representing 44% year-over-year growth.\nDuring the quarter, we also saw strength in Latin America, the Middle East and Japan. International revenue grew 43% year-over-year. Our second quarter non-GAAP gross margin performance remained strong. Total non-GAAP gross margin was 78%, and we achieved subscription gross margin of approximately 80% for the second consecutive quarter.\nWe look forward to discussing the initiatives and investments we are making to drive subscription gross margin higher and beyond our target model in more detail at our Fal.Com Investor Briefing in September.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were $412.5 million or 56% of revenue versus $321.4 million last year or 60% of revenue. Q2 sales and marketing and R&D expenses grew 26% and 35% year-over-year, respectively. We expect sales and marketing and R&D expenses to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of in-person events, marketing and technology development programs.\nAs a result of our dedication to operational excellence and profitable growth at scale, in Q2, we achieved multiple new milestones for the profitability of the business. These milestones included record non-GAAP operating income of $155.7 million, growing 78% year-over-year, achieving our target model range for non-GAAP operating margin for the first time in company history and a record 21% of revenue, well ahead of our planned timeline. More than doubling non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike, which grew to a record $180.0 million or $0.74 on a diluted per share basis. And finally, achieving GAAP profitability for the second consecutive quarter.\nThese achievements speak to the power of our financial model and focus on running an efficient business. We are accelerating our time line to reach the target model. As implied in our guidance, we now expect to exit Q4 within our target non-GAAP operating margin model and to remain within our target model on an annual basis starting in FY '25.\nWe ended the second quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $3.17 billion. Cash flow from operations grew 17% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $244.8 million. Free cash flow grew 39% year-over-year to a Q2 record of $188.7 million or 26% of revenue, achieving a rule of 63 on a free cash flow basis.\nLooking at the first half of fiscal year 2024, free cash flow grew 42% year-over-year to reach $416.1 million and 29% of revenue, putting us well on track to reach our stated goal of 30% free cash flow margin for the full fiscal year.\nMoving to our outlook. We are raising our revenue guidance for the fiscal year and maintaining our net new ARR assumptions for the second half and fiscal year, which call for in line to modestly up net new ARR for the full year. For the third quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $775.4 million to $778.0 million reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 33% to 34%.\nWe expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $154.4 million to $156.3 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $179.8 million to $181.8 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be approximately $0.74, utilizing a weighted average share count of 244 million shares on a diluted basis.\nWe are raising our revenue and profitability guidance for the full fiscal year 2024. We currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,030.7 million to $3,042.9 million, reflecting a growth rate of 35% to 36% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $601.3 million and $610.5 million. We expect fiscal 2024 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $680.4 million and $689.7 million. Utilizing 243 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.84.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.",

I would like to note that we are conducting today's call from 1 of our European offices, and ask for your patience in the event of technical difficulties.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us. Our continued execution despite a challenging macro environment translated to strong growth and exceptional margins, which drove record non-GAAP profitability record free cash flow and GAAP profitability for the first time in company history. We exceeded our guidance across both top and bottom line metrics, increased gross margin cost discipline and moderated headcount growth contributed to our strong bottom line results, reaching GAAP profitability so early in our life as a public company provides insight into the strength of the model we have built and what we can achieve over time.\nBurt will cover the financial results in more detail. I will focus my comments on why we believe CrowdStrike has a clear and sustainable advantage as 3 mega trends continue to unfold, AI, consolidation and cloud. Let's start with AI. Since inception, CrowdStrike has been and will continue to be at the forefront of leveraging AI to drive better customer outcomes and efficiencies within our own business. In addition to industry-leading detection and rapid remediation for customers, utilizing AI has benefited our business by lowering cost and yielding higher margins.\nOne example of AI benefiting our financial model is Falcon complete. For years, our use of AI has enabled us to rapidly scale that business to a leadership position with an exceptional product margin that exceeds our overall company gross margin. The margin profile and scale we have achieved for our managed offering would not have been possible without our innovations in AI. While others are just now jumping on the AI bandwagon, we have transformed cybersecurity with an AI-powered cloud business from inception. Generative AI is transforming the world and security is no exception. Large language models or LOMs, are only as good as the data on which they are trained and human-annotated content mix for the best training data, driving better customer outcomes relies on having a data advantage and the context derived from that data. While we expect that LLM will become commoditized over time, the data on which they are trained will not. CrowdStrike is uniquely positioned to benefit from this new technology. Our data set spans petabytes and captures trillions of new vest daily from our global fleet of sensors. Combine that with our over 10 years of attack data at [indiscernible] graft that has been paired with high-quality human analysis from Overwatch, complete intelligence and into the response services, and you get unrivaled telemetry Simply put, we believe CrowdStrike has a sustainable data advantage, the most powerful and unique set of correlated human and machine-generated data across all of cyber. Our data advantage creates a unique competitive moat, yielding better models, better automation and better outcomes. We see the rapidly growing adoption of generative AI as a democratizing force within cybersecurity from both an adversarial and protection standpoint.\nFrom an adversarial perspective, we expect that the adoption of LOMs will lower the barrier of entry for malicious actors to create sophisticated cyberattacks. Generative AI is expected to make it even easier for less advanced attackers to craft nation-state caliber campaigns. We believe this will catalyze even greater demand for modern cybersecurity technologies like Falcon. From a protection standpoint, we see generative AI as a democratizing force by dramatically lowering the learning curve for practitioners, transforming even a novice analysts into a power user. With all of this in mind, we introduced Charlotte AI, an exciting new generative AI security analysts, utilizing CrowdStrike's high-fidelity data advantage.\nWe believe Charlotte AI will empower our newly minted Tier 1 analysts to yield the results of an advanced Tier 3 analyst. The net benefit to the customer, faster results, better security outcomes and lower overall costs. Starwood AI represents CrowdStrike's latest innovation helping security teams worldwide compared with the cybersecurity skills gap, response to threats faster and reduce operational cost. Charlotte AI will uniquely benefit from a continuous human feedback loop with our Overwatch, Falcon Complete and Intel teams.\nThis continuous feedback loop on human validated content is critical. And because of this, no other vendor in cyber, we'll be able to match CrowdStrike's approach degenerative AI, demonstrating our commitment to lead and protect the industry through this next wave of innovation we came up with AWS to develop powerful new generative AI applications that help customers accelerate their cloud, security and AI journey. Through this initiative, CrowdStrike and AWS will bring together their solutions and teams to keep customers safe across a range of AI services while meeting stringent security requirements. CrowdStrike already has a leadership position in helping protect AI innovators. A perfect example of this is a recent expansion with the B2B generative AI research and development company. This customer leverages significant public cloud resources to support their solutions, also aware of the dangers others have faced from adversaries compromising cloud environments. This customer expanded to Falcon Cloud Security Complete to support their small team with fully managed coverage, provide both cloud runtime protection and posture monitoring across their multi-cloud environment. and scale seamlessly with their growth, all without having to deploy multiple products or hire more people. Another mega trend continuing to unfold in cybersecurity is consolidation. The macro backdrop has only accelerated the need for customers to reduce vendor sprawl, reduce agents, reduce costs and protect their businesses with the best of SaaS platform. On average, enterprise customers can realize over 200% ROI with Falcon. With ROI results like this, it's no surprise companies turn to Crocitto protect power and drive efficiencies for their businesses. In Q1, net new ARR from our million-plus customers grew year-over-year even at these larger, more complex deals can have longer sales cycles. We delivered $174.2 million in net new ARR for the quarter, which exceeded our stated assumptions. Our momentum with large customers, record Q2 pipeline, and success tracking deals to close gives us confidence in the back half of the year. In Q1, we closed over 50% more deals involving 8 or more modules compared to a year ago. We believe this speaks to increasing customer demand for consolidation using the Falcon platform. When we look at our pipeline for the remainder of the year, we expect this trend to continue giving us confidence in our ability to deliver net new ARR growth in the back half of the year. Over the past few months, I have personally met with many of our customers, prospects and partners. These conversations all centered on the same topic Customers want to consolidate the security stack with Falcon and drive greater cost efficiencies while unlocking new capabilities. Let me share a few recent customer wins highlighting ways companies use craft right to consolidate while improving their cybersecurity outcomes. First, our wins with 2 new Fortune 100 customers. These organizations are consolidating on Falcon, a single modern XDR platform, unifying their approach to security across their different business units. Each of these new CrowdStrike customers purchased multiple modules with 1 adopting 9 modules displacing legacy and next-gen vendors in their environment and standardizing on CrowdStrike. One of my favorite customer wins this quarter. was with a regional health care customer brought to us by our partner, Dell. This organization was frustrated by the volume of false positives generated by their legacy security product, which hampered their security teams efficiency and obscured critical incidents, recognizing the increased value they could gain by modernizing their security stack and consolidating on CrowdStrike. This customer adopted 8 Falcon modules, including Falcon Complete, Identity Threat Protection and log scale and a 7-figure total value deal. In addition, our managed services teams have catapulted Cross strive to a leader position in the forester way for managed detection and response and the #1 market share position for the second consecutive year in Gartner's MBR for managed security service report. CrowdStrikes MDR leadership extends beyond our managed services and into our MPR partner ecosystem. Of the top 25 MDR vendors by market share defined by Gartner have built their MDR services on top of the Falcon platform. Showcasing Falcon as their modern XDR platform of choice. We are proud that the Falcon platform powers so many different partners enabling them to build their businesses on top of CrowdStrike.\nOur industry-leading partner ecosystem continues to expand rapidly, contributing meaningfully to our growth. CrowdStrike recently entered into a strategic partnership with PAX the leading MSP cloud marketplace with over 30,000 MSP partners across North America, EMEA and APJ that serve the SMB market. This partnership provides CrowdStrike born in the cloud route to market for MSP consumption and a prime opportunity to displace the legacy AV in NextGen product vendors taxa partners use today.\nMSPs are increasingly turning to the paste marketplace for ease of product purchase, rapid software deployment and fully integrated billing to run their businesses, including cybersecurity. PAC MSP partner base will now be able to protect their end customers with the same cutting-edge XDR technology selected by the world's leading and largest enterprises. Our momentum in the public sector continues to expand. Public sector wins in the quarter included a Falcon Complete win at a top 20 U.S. government contractor and a win with a major U.S. federal agency. Today, we announced CrowdStrike was granted in Impact Level 5 or IL-5 provisional authorization from the Department of Defense. IL-5 certification positions us well to extend our reach into the massive defense IT and cybersecurity market. The competitive environment has not changed since our deep dive in April, where we disclosed that 8 out of 10 times when an enterprise customer tests. They choose CrowdStrike over Microsoft and our win rates across all competitors remained strong in the quarter. Organizations today more than ever before, need security partners with deep expertise that can stop reaches while driving efficiencies in their security programs. However, for Microsoft, companies experience added complexity, less coverage and higher costs. One enterprise customer with over 50,000 employees told us -- the upgrade cost of moving from Microsoft E3 to E5 would be at least 2.3 million more than their CrowdStrike subscription, and that's just for the upgrade. With Microsoft's excessive annual cost increases, as we grew to $4.7 million by year 5, excluding the additional costs required for support or a SIM solution or increased staff to manage the extra complexity. When customers map it all out, they quickly realize that using Microsoft E5 for security is more expensive, requires more headcount and increases their cyber risk. The cloud is the third megatrend representing a long and sustainable tailwind for our business. The cloud is rapidly emerging as the new adversary battleground. We have observed a 95% year-over-year increase in cloud service exploitation and a 288% increase in threat actors that know how to operate in cloud environments. Securing cloud assets is paramount today and will continue to grow in importance. As a leader in protecting some of the largest and most critical cloud companies, we have seen strong net new ARR growth for modules deployed in public clouds. Our Falcon cloud security offering unifies our agent and agent-less cloud-native security capabilities into a single offering that's easy to deploy from build to run time across all major cloud environments and is driving incredible customer momentum as customers consolidate their cloud security, replacing multiple cloud point products with Falcon. Tying this all together, the rapidly evolving and expanding threat environment demonstrates why it is so critical to have your endpoint, cloud identity and data protection on 1 unified modern XDR platform, Falcon. We've covered a lot today, and you can see that our relentless innovation continues to widen the gap between CrowdStrike and the competition. In closing, I will reiterate a few key points.\nFirst, CrowdStrike has a clear data advantage built over the past 12 years by combining our unmatched AI and human threat intelligence expertise. For customers, CrowdStrike's advantage means better faster and more cost-effective cybersecurity. For our business, CrowdAI excellence shines through our differentiated business model efficiencies. Second, we ushered cybersecurity into a new era with the introduction of Charlotte AI. Third, companies must consolidate their security stack to reduce complexity reduce agents and reduce costs without sacrificing coverage or security. They need to protect their cloud environments from build to run time with a single unified platform to achieve this, customers choose crowd strength. And fourth, we believe that in addition to building a winning platform, we built a robust business model capable of generating rapid growth at scale earnings and durable free cash flow. With that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nChief Financial Officer, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers, except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP. We delivered a strong first quarter, even with the continued challenging macro environment with revenue subscription gross margin, operating income, net income and free cash flow all exceeding our guidance and reaching new records. We believe our financial performance speaks to the strength of our business model and the operational excellence ingrained in the fabric of CrowdStrike's culture, which includes diligence and discipline when balancing growth and profitability. The demand environment remains resilient. .\nAlthough we continue to see increased deal scrutiny and longer than typical sales cycles, especially for larger consolidation deals with our relentless focus on sales execution, we achieved Q1 net new ARR of $174.2 million, which was above stated assumptions. We ended the quarter with ending ARR reaching $2.73 billion up 42% over last year. The quarter was well balanced with the mix between new logos and expansion cross-sell, net new ARR similar to Q4. We continue to be very pleased with the success of our land and expand strategy with our dollar-based net retention rate once again above the 120% benchmark in Q1. Subscription customers with 5 or more Six or more and 7 or more modules now represent 62%, 40% and 23% of subscription customers, respectively. Moving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 42% over Q1 of last year to reach $692.6 million, Subscription revenue grew 42% over Q1 of last year to reach $651.2 million. Professional services revenue was $41.4 million, setting a new record for the 11th consecutive quarter and representing 48% year-over-year growth.\nDuring the quarter, we also saw strength in Europe, the Middle East and Japan. International revenue grew 53% year-over-year. Our first quarter non-GAAP gross margin performance was outstanding with both total and subscription non-GAAP gross margins ascending to new heights Total non-GAAP gross margin was 78% and subscription gross margin crossed the 80% milestone for the first time. Our investments in data center and workload optimization drove our gross margin improvement in the quarter. As we have said in the past, we expect subscription gross margin to fluctuate by up to 1 point on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we balance optimization investments with capacity growth and new platform functionality. We expect these investments to drive further margin enhancement in the future. as we continue to execute on our long-term plan to drive subscription gross margin sustainably above 80%. We Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $424.6 million or 61% of revenue versus $291.0 million last year or 60% of revenue. The sequential increase in sales and marketing reflects the timing of in-person events and marketing programs. In Q1, our magic number was 1.0 and and we achieved a rule of 75 on a free cash flow basis, both metrics reflecting the continued efficiency of our model. First quarter non-GAAP operating income grew 40% year-over-year to reach a record $115.9 million, and we reported operating margin of 17%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q1 grew to a record $136.4 million or $0.57 on a diluted per share basis. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate first quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 241 million shares. We also reached GAAP profitability for the first time in company history. While we are very proud of this milestone, we have yet to reach sustained GAAP profitability. Q1 benefited significantly from fewer net new hires in Q1, which we expect to pick up throughout the remainder of the year, albeit at a much more moderated pace in comparison to FY '23. We believe reaching this milestone demonstrates that our financial model will deliver GAAP profitability in due time. We ended the first quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increas\ned to approximately $2.93 billion. Cash flow from operations grew 40% year-over-year to a record $300.9 million. Free cash flow grew 44% year-over-year to a record $227.4 million or approximately 33% of revenue. Before I move to our guidance, I'd like to provide a few modeling notes. We are raising our revenue guidance for the fiscal year and maintaining our net new ARR assumptions for the first half and fiscal year, which call for a 10% year-over-year headwind to net new ARR in the first half and in line to modestly up net new ARR for the full year. Our strong Q2 pipeline and momentum with large consolidation deals give us confidence in the remainder of the year, including the back half where we expect to return to year-over-year growth in net new ARR. Also, as a reminder, given the timing of expenses, billing seasonality and the midyear ESPP purchase, the second quarter is generally our lowest cash flow generation quarter of the year. This year, we expect to see more pronounced seasonality and maintain our target of achieving 30% free cash flow margin for the fiscal year. As we discussed during our investor briefing in April, this is inclusive of estimated full year impacts from billings duration and cash taxes, bounced by the positive tailwinds of increased operating leverage, higher interest income and lower CapEx. And lastly, our assumptions on interest income, cash outlay for income taxes and capital expenditures are unchanged. For the second quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $717.2 million to $727.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 34% to 36%. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $116.4 million to $123.8 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to Crowdstrike to be in the range of $129.5 million to $137.0 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.57 and utilizing a weighted average share count of 242 million shares on a diluted basis. We are raising our revenue and profitability guidance for the full fiscal year 2024. We currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $3,000.5 million to $3,036.7 million, reflecting a growth rate of 34% to 35% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $498.9 million and $526.2 million. We expect fiscal 2024 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $562.8 million and $590.1 million. Utilizing 243 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.43. George and I will now take your questions.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the call over to Maria Riley, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nVP of IR, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth and expected performance, including our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2024 and any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us. CrowdStrike delivered a record fourth quarter that exceeded our expectations across the board. I will focus my comments today on a few key points.\nFirst, CrowdStrike is executing exceptionally well in a challenging macro environment. We believe this is best showcased by the fourth quarter's record net new ARR of $222 million, record net new customers of 1,873, strong retention rates, record operating income, record free cash flow of $209 million and a Rule of 81 on a free cash flow basis.\nSecond, the dual mandate of high efficacy and low total cost of ownership faced the CrowdStrike strength as a leading consolidator. CrowdStrike's growing market share showcases the Falcon platforms, advanced AI and technology leadership that drives better security outcomes, automation and lower TCO for customers.\nAnd third, our conviction in CrowdStrike's expansive opportunity continues to grow. We see a massive opportunity to leverage our AI-driven collect data once, reuse many times platform to expand share across our markets. As Burt will discuss, we are continuing our thoughtful and balanced approach to investing to drive both top line and bottom line growth. We remain steadfast in our vision to grow ending ARR to $5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2026 and to reach our target operating model sometime within fiscal year 2025.\nThe key to our success in the fourth quarter was execution and strong market demand for the Falcon platform. We converted our pipeline into wins and built a record Q1 pipeline even as sales cycles elongated as we saw late in Q3, and we did not see the typical budget flush as organizations continue to work through macro concerns. Our competitive win rate remained high and ASPs remained consistent, and we ended the year with a best-in-class gross retention rate and a strong net retention rate.\nWe believe our strong fourth quarter performance and record Q1 pipeline demonstrates the mission-critical nature of cybersecurity for modern businesses, the resiliency of our market and CrowdStrike's growing leadership as the cybersecurity platform of record. I'd like to thank each and every CrowdStriker for their dedication and hard work in making the fourth quarter our best quarter to date. As a team, we should be proud of the amazing accomplishments we have achieved and excited about the opportunities ahead of us.\nWe'll take a moment to highlight several year-over-year milestones that CrowdStrike team delivered in FY '23 that I'm most excited about. Ending ARR grew 48% to reach $2.56 billion. Net new ARR grew 22% to reach $828 million, setting a new record. Our emerging product category contributed $182 million to net new ARR, which was 22% of all net new ARR and a 97% increase.\nEmerging products ended ARR growing 116% to $339 million, surpassing CrowdStrike's total ARR at the time of IPO in 2019. This included a standout year for our Identity Protection modules, which contributed over $100 million in ending ARR and over 1,000 net new identity customers. Additionally, LogScale posted over 200% ending ARR growth.\nFrom a public cloud deployment view, ending ARR surpassed the $200 million milestone to reach $224 million. And we added a record 6,694 net new customers for the fiscal year to bring us to 23,019 subscription customers, a 41% increase. CrowdStrike now serves 556 of the Global 2000, 271 of the Fortune 500 and 15 of the top 20 U.S. banks.\nOn the bottom line, FY '23 operating and net income growth well outpaced revenue growth, showcasing the leverage in our model. Non-GAAP operating income grew 81% year-over-year to reach a record $356 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 130% to reach a record $1.54. Free cash flow grew 53% to reach a record $677 million, and we achieved at least 30% free cash flow margin for the third consecutive year.\nOur market leadership continues to grow as customers are voting for their platform of choice with their wallets. CrowdStrike ranked first in IDC's annual Worldwide Modern Endpoint Security Market Share report for the third consecutive year with 17.7% market share, outpacing all vendors by posting the largest increase in revenue and market share.\nThe efficacy of the Falcon platform continues to be widely tested and recognized for delivering superior outcomes regardless of whether you are looking at MITRE, TrustRadius, G2, Frost & Sullivan, Forrester Wave, SE Labs, Gartner Peer Insights or Gartner Magic Quadrant, Falcon's superior technology has been awarded a lead or a #1 position.\nThis was most recently highlighted by winning the 2023 SE Labs Award for Best EDR and Best Product Development. This is the third consecutive time that CrowdStrike has won in the Best EDR category, further reinforcing our innovation in endpoint security and putting us in the pole position to help customers enter the XDR era.\nAdditionally, CrowdStrike was once again positioned as a leader furthest to the right for completeness of vision in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for endpoint protection platforms for the third consecutive year. We believe this recognition highlights our long-standing track record of disruptive innovation, including our use of AI and indicators of attack to stop cyber adversaries in real time.\nWhile the use of AI has become the new topic of the day, it is not new to CrowdStrike. We were a pioneer in applying AI and cybersecurity. The Falcon platform was designed from the ground up to effectively process and correlate the massive volume of data required for effective AI and leverage it across our entire platform from prevention through to detection and response. This enables Falcon to spot fainter signals and identify activity earlier in the kill chain. We have become experts at leveraging data science to deliver best-of-breed attack discovery and prevention for our more than 23,000 customers. This drives immense leverage across the platform and better, more efficient outcomes for our customers.\nThere is a clear mandate from customers. They want to reduce cost and headcount, reduce the number of point products and agents, reduce complexity and simplify operations. This mandate is even more acute for customers given the current macro climate, and it is the exact imperative that Falcon platform was built to deliver from day 1 with its advanced AI engine and collect once, reuse many architecture.\nCrowdStrike delivers on these customer mandates where with our hallmark immediate time to value that accelerates cost savings for the customer. Let's take a look at a few customers that are using CrowdStrike to drive consolidation, lower TCO and realize better outcomes within their environment.\nOne of our marquee enterprise customer wins this quarter was with a leading financial institution in the Fortune 50 that is consolidating on Falcon and replacing 4 vendors and multiple point products including Symantec, Trellix, Trend Micro and Aqua. Their testing proved Falcon's superior visibility, protection and threat hunting capabilities of our both incumbent and prospective new vendors. These factors, along with Falcon's holistic approach to protecting the cloud environment with our integrated CNAPP offering, drove the decision to adopt the Falcon platform.\nAnother customer win I'd like to highlight was with a multinational fintech company looking for a security partner to consolidate their hodgepodge of legacy and next-gen vendors. This customer identified 8 vendors they could eliminate with their initial deployment of Falcon, including Microsoft, Carbon Black, Trellix, Trend Micro, Sophos, ESET, F-Prot and ClamAV. The Falcon platform provides them the ability to significantly reduce their complexity, reduce agent bloat, reduce TCO and improve security outcomes. Additionally, this customer purchased LogScale to store its security data to gain better performance and avoid the high cost associated with existing log management solutions.\nAnother LogScale win this quarter was with a leading global financial institution that wanted to increase the volume of Falcon data retained as well as gain faster query results and avoid the high cost associated with expanding the usage of their legacy log management system. Their testing showed that LogScale delivered query speeds orders of magnitude faster than their existing tools. This customer is now ingesting close to 40 terabytes of data per day with plans to standardize on LogScale across their organization over time.\nThe next exciting win I'd like to share with you is an expansion to Falcon Complete with one of the largest global transportation and logistic companies. In a highly targeted sector by cyber adversary, this customer wanted a round-the-clock 365-day SOC. While this customer had budget and head count reserve to build out an internal SOC, after performing a thorough cost-benefit analysis, this customer determined that Falcon Complete, including Falcon Complete for Identity Threat Protection, would deliver the best coverage, protection and value without adding head count. Falcon Complete for Identity Threat Protection was a key aspect to the win as they sought to run an effective and mature identity security program without the burden, cost and time associated with managing it internally.\nEven if doing more with fewer internal resources has become the new normal for many companies, the outcome of stopping breaches remains the #1 priority for CISOs and CIOs. As cited in our global threat report, the threat landscape remains elevated with an observed 50% increase in the number of interactive intrusion campaigns and 95% growth of the number of cloud exploitation cases in 2022.\nCompromising on security can easily translate to compromised coverage, added complexity and catastrophe. Let me be clear, there is no participation trophy for coming in second place when up against cyber adversaries. Good is never good enough on the cyber battlefield and perceived free is never free. To demonstrate my point, I'd like to share a recent win with a company that suffered a breach after relying on an OS vendor that claimed their legacy signature-based product was good enough to take on today's threat actors.\nThis company had initially chosen Microsoft to replace existing AV products across their estate, but quickly ran into trouble when they discovered that Defender could not be fully deployed within their heterogeneous environment, leaving their service vulnerable. Unfortunately, it did not take long for threat actors to find these gaps and breach their environment.\nThey turned to one of our incident response partners, a leading global SI that uses Falcon as a key part of the responsive remediation service. During engagement, the customer found that Falcon provided 2.5x more coverage than Defender and was much simpler to operationalize. It quickly became obvious to this company why AI protection was far superior to signature-based technologies, and they need world-class protection across heterogeneous operating systems. The CISO also determined that excluding the cost to remediate the breach, Defender cost twice as much and would still fall short of the functionality, simplicity and efficacy of Falcon. Having lost faith in Microsoft's low-cost, good enough promise, this new CrowdStrike customer adopted Falcon Complete.\nOur professional services organization is a strong lead generation engine for the Falcon platform. The average ARR per dollar of professional services revenue derived from organizations new to CrowdStrike through our incident response or proactive services grew to $6.07 as of January 31, 2023. To summarize, every dollar from these professional services engagements in the past 2 years has turned into $6.07 of ARR.\nOur thriving partner ecosystem is also growing to become a powerful source of lead generation. In FY '23, MSSP ending ARR grew over 100%, and partner-sourced ending ARR grew over 50% year-over-year. Additionally, revenue through channel partners grew to 83% of total revenue. Strategically expanding and investing in our partner ecosystem with the goal of further expanding our reach within the enterprise as well as down market in the SMB is one of our top initiatives in FY '24.\nAs we recently announced, we entered into a new multifaceted strategic partnership with Dell to deliver the Falcon platform to Dell's customers globally. The Falcon platform is now offered through Dell's global go-to-market organization via several avenues, including a traditional resell agreement on device for new purchases made through Dell's direct sales team and as the cornerstone to Dell's managed cybersecurity service offering. While it's still early days for this new go-to-market partnership, we expect it to significantly expand our reach across the market from large enterprises to the small S in the SMB. Customers have chosen CrowdStrike as the platform of choice and so has Dell.\nWe had tremendous initial success with our Falcon Go bundle, which was specifically designed as a starter package or a landing point for smaller businesses with 100 endpoints or less that may be more price sensitive. We launched Falcon Go a little more than 2 quarters ago and have already added over 1,000 net new customers through the program. We believe this early success reaching the S in the SMB demonstrates the immense demand for CrowdStrike's best-in-class endpoint protection, even among the smallest and cost-conscious organizations.\nIn late January, we launched the next-gen iteration of our e-commerce engine with the goal of removing even more friction out of the buying process and driving higher connection between digital top of funnel and conversion into buying. We view these advancements in our e-commerce engine as a differentiator. And within just a few weeks post launch, we have seen a dramatic increase in no-touch digital conversions.\nThe market dynamics in the SMB are velocity-driven and very different from our traditional enterprise customer base. To accelerate growth and drive market share within the massive SMB opportunity as well as increased growth through all of our channels, we changed the organizational structure and created a new leadership role with the appointment of Daniel Bernard as Chief Business Officer. Daniel has a proven track record in leading channel partnerships and business development at several high-growth SaaS, cloud and cybersecurity companies and is most recently recognized for transforming SentinelOne's market awareness.\nI'd also like to welcome Raj Rajamani to the CrowdStrike team who also joined us from SentinelOne. Reporting to Amol Kulkarni, Raj is our Chief Product Officer for data, identity, cloud and endpoint. I've worked with Raj in the past, and I'm excited to have him join our team as we continue to drive disruptive innovation.\nAnd finally, I'm extremely proud to congratulate Mike Sentonas on his promotion to President. Mike has been an invaluable contributor to CrowdStrike's success, and as President, he has responsibility for leading the company's product and go-to-market functions. These leadership changes are designed to drive greater focus and alignment across our key growth initiatives and enable me to spend more time with customers as we scale CrowdStrike to achieve our vision of $5 billion in ending ARR and beyond.\nIn summary, CrowdStrike is executing across all facets of our strategy, winning in our markets and providing customers with protection that powers them.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers, except revenue, mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP.\nWe delivered an exceptional fourth quarter and a strong finish to the year with $221.7 million in net new ARR, bringing ending ARR to $2.56 billion, up 48% over last year. In the quarter, we saw strong expansion within our customer base, including an 8-figure net new ARR expansion. Ending ARR for the $1 million-plus cohort grew 57% year-over-year. We now have over 400 subscription customers with ending ARR over $1 million at an average of 10 modules. Overall in Q4, we landed a record number of net new customers, fueled by growth in enterprise, nonenterprise and public sector accounts.\nWe continue to be very pleased with the success of our land-and-expand strategy. Our dollar-based net retention rate was above the 120% benchmark throughout the year, ending Q4 at 125.3%, which is higher than last year and on a much bigger base. For the interim FY '23 quarters, net retention was 127.6% in Q3, 127.6% in Q2 and 125.5% in Q1. Our best-in-class gross retention rate remained exceptionally strong at 98.0% as of year-end.\nSubscription customers with 5 or more, 6 or more and 7 or more modules grew 52%, 62% and 75% year-over-year, respectively. Now the respective module adoption cohorts represents 62%, 39% and 22% of subscription customers, respectively. Given the strong momentum we have seen with our Falcon Go bundle of 3 modules for very small businesses, we are now excluding these customers from our module adoption metrics and have provided comparable metrics for prior periods in the investor presentation on our website.\nAdditionally, given the growing number of smaller end customers that we serve through our MSSP partners, which we estimate exceeds 18,000, and our downmarket bundles, as George discussed, we don't believe that quarterly fluctuations in our new logo metric appropriately reflects the health of our business as we have discussed previously. Therefore, we are moving to reporting logo metrics on an annual basis only. We look forward to providing additional details, including the usual annual deep dive of our customer cohorts on our investor webinar scheduled for April 4.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 48% over Q4 of last year to reach $637.4 million. Subscription revenue grew 48% over Q4 of last year to reach $598.3 million. Professional services revenue was $39.1 million, setting a new record for the tenth consecutive quarter and representing 53% year-over-year growth. This brings total revenue growth for FY '23 to 54%.\nIn terms of our geographic performance in Q4, we continue to see strong growth in the U.S. at 44% and international revenue growth at 57% year-over-year. Fourth quarter total and subscription non-GAAP gross margins were 75% and 77%, respectively. Looking into Q1, we expect subscription gross margin to increase by up to 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter driven by cost optimization.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 were $385.0 million and $1.35 billion, respectively. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2023 were 60% of revenue compared to 63% of revenue in fiscal year 2022. In Q4, our magic number was 1.1, reflecting the continued efficiency of our go-to-market engine. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income grew 19% year-over-year to reach a record $95.6 million, and we reported operating margin of 15%. Looking at fiscal year 2023, non-GAAP operating income growth outpaced revenue growth, increasing 81% year-over-year to reach $355.6 million and 16% of revenue, picking up 235 basis points of operating margin for the year.\nAs our magic number and Rule of 40 reflect, we have a highly efficient model. For the past 3 years, we have grown operating income faster than revenue, and we remain focused on continuing to drive efficiency, balancing robust growth with increased leverage. In FY '23, we took advantage of opportunities we saw in the labor market and expanded the team by 46% over last year. We are now more than 7,000 CrowdStrikers strong. This gives us a significant head start to achieving our goals for FY '24 and enables us to significantly moderate the pace of new hires while continuing to invest responsibly for the long term.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q4 grew to a record $111.6 million or $0.47 on a diluted per share basis. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 240 million shares.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to approximately $2.71 billion. Cash flow from operations grew 71% year-over-year to a record $273.3 million. Free cash flow grew 65% year-over-year to a record $209.5 million or approximately 33% of revenue. This brings free cash flow for the year to $676.8 million or 30% of revenue.\nBefore I move to our guidance, I'd like to provide a few comments about how we view the ongoing impact of the current macro climate on our business and a few modeling notes. We delivered a record Q4 and have a record Q1 pipeline. However, given continued increased budget scrutiny and elongated sales cycles, we believe it is prudent to maintain the FY '24 ARR assumptions we discussed on our last earnings call that normalized the first half of the year for the current macro environment with a full year net new ARR assumption of roughly flat to very modestly up year-over-year, albeit on a higher base than expected 3 months ago. This would imply a low 30s ending ARR growth rate for the year.\nAs our guidance implies, we expect to deliver operating margin leverage for the full year with operating income growing faster than revenue. In terms of seasonality, we expect operating margin leverage to be more weighted to the back half of the year in comparison to FY '23. We expect to deliver a free cash flow margin of approximately 30% of revenue in FY '24. This assumes CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be between 6% and 8% for FY '24 and approximately $32 million in cash outlay for income taxes compared with $12 million in FY '23. The midpoint of our FY '24 non-GAAP net income guidance assumes $129 million in interest income, and we expect interest expense to remain consistent with FY '23. And lastly, as implied in our guidance, we expect weighted average diluted share count to increase less than 2% in fiscal 2024.\nFor the first quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $674.9 million to $678.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 38% to 39%, with subscription revenue being the dominant driver of growth. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $107.1 million to $109.5 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $121.1 million to $123.5 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.51, utilizing a weighted average share count of 241 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $2,955.1 million to $3,014.8 million, reflecting a growth rate of 32% to 35% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $474.0 million and $518.7 million. We expect fiscal 2024 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $535.9 million and $580.7 million. Utilizing 243 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $2.21 to $2.39.\nWe look forward to sharing additional details about our business on our next investor webinar scheduled for April 4.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.",

Welcome to CrowdStrike's Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Maria Riley.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nVP of IR, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth and expected performance, including our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 as well as any assumptions for fiscal periods beyond that, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call. While we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in the company's quarterly and annual reports.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures disclosed on this call will be non-GAAP. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release, which may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to George to begin.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us. Let me start with a summary of our results. In Q3, we delivered 53% revenue growth year-over-year, 15% non-GAAP operating margin and record non-GAAP net income, all of which were ahead of our guidance. Additionally, we achieved record free cash flow of $174 million or approximately 30% of revenue.\nThere are many positive trends we see in our business, including strong competitive win rates, consistent ASPs, exceptional retention rates and the mission-critical nature of cybersecurity. However, I would first like to address the increased macroeconomic headwinds we saw in the quarter, which caused Q3 net new ARR to come in below our expectations.\nAs we discussed on our last earnings call, organizations were starting to respond to macroeconomic conditions by adding extra layers of required approvals and extending the time it took to close some deals. As Q3 progressed and fears of a recession grew, this dynamic became more pronounced.\nIn our smaller, more transactional non-enterprise accounts, we saw customers increasingly delay purchasing decisions with average days to close lengthening by approximately 11% and net new ARR contribution decreasing $15 million from Q2. This also impacted our net new logo additions in the quarter, even though our quarter-over-quarter POV win rates increased meaningfully over more complex vendors that require more headcount to manage. While sales cycles lengthen, we believe the vast majority of these deals are not lost, just delayed.\nIn the enterprise, sales cycles or average days to close remain consistent with last quarter's modestly higher level. In Q3, these larger customers continue to prioritize their CrowdStrike investments, but some also had to manage timing issues related to OpEx budgets and cash flow amidst the rapidly evolving macro. To achieve this, some customers signed contracts that have multiphase subscription start dates, which pushes their expense and CrowdStrike's ARR recognition into future quarters. While every quarter, we have some deals with multiphase subscription start dates, in comparison to last quarter, in Q3, we saw approximately $10 million more ARR deferred into future quarters.\nWe expect these macro headwinds to persist through Q4. Additionally, given the increased scrutiny on budgets, we're not going to expect a typical Q4 budget flush, leading us to adjust our Q4 net new ARR expectations, as Burt will discuss in more detail. But this caution does not deter our confidence in the long-term market position of CrowdStrike or the resiliency of the cybersecurity market.\nWe see strong inherent demand for our products, and we entered Q4 with a record pipeline. Pipeline expansion is even more important in times of an evolving macro and elongated sales cycles. We are working to stay out in front of pipeline creation. With Jennifer Johnson, our recently appointed CMO, now at the marketing helm, we are realigning our marketing initiatives and increasing our focus on ramping more top-of-funnel initiatives and brand awareness to drive pipeline to even greater heights. We also gained significant leverage from our partner ecosystem, with partner-sourced ARR growing 55% year-over-year.\nThere were many positives in this quarter highlighted by the record number of customers contributing at least $1 million in net new ARR in the quarter. Additionally, ending ARR for the $1 million-plus cohort surpassed the $1 billion milestone in Q3 with a 67% year-over-year growth rate. These larger customers are standardizing on Falcon, consolidating vendors and prioritizing expansion projects that represent sizable cross-sell and upsell opportunity that are moving forward even under uncertain macro conditions. Marquee brands that are new to our $1 million-plus cohort included a Global 500 manufacturer that landed with 10 modules, providing unprecedented visibility and protection to all areas of their environment and allowing them to consolidate 4 agents and vendors with their initial deployment of Falcon. Two Global 500 financial institutions who chose Falcon for its ability to replace multiple legacy security products and bolster their security posture through a single agent, a Global 500 consumer goods manufacturer that is now leveraging Falcon Complete for a fully managed approach to protecting its critical infrastructure and a Fortune 500 luxury brand, leveraging Falcon to protect both its traditional end points and cloud workloads.\nIn the third quarter, we also delivered strong results in the public sector driven by a Falcon Complete land with one of the largest U.S. federal agencies now standardizing on the Falcon platform and a strong quarter for our SLED business with the U.S. state government standardizing on CrowdStrike in the quarter as well as wins and expansions across multiple U.S. state and local government agencies and educational institutions.\nTo date, 40 U.S. state governments are CrowdStrike customers, of which 21 in the District of Columbia have standardized on Falcon. Additionally, we secured a win with one of the largest federal systems integrators that will be using Falcon to protect its internal estate as well as integrate it into its MSSP offering.\nMoving to our expansion and retention performance. Our dollar-based net retention rate was well above Q3 of last year and consistent with our Q2 performance, which was at the highest level in 7 quarters. Our best-in-class gross retention rates remained at record levels above 98%. We are also seeing more customers standardizing the Falcon platform and adopt more modules.\nQ3 subscription customers with 5 or more -- 6 or more and 7 or more modules were 60%, 36% and 21%, respectively. This represents a 55%, 66% and 81% year-over-year increase in these respective module adoption cohorts.\nIt was another record quarter for our emerging product category, which includes our Discover, Spotlight, Identity Protection and LogScale modules. Our identity protection solutions are the largest contributor to ARR within the emerging category, and Q3 was another record quarter. Net new ARR for identity protection solution grew to a new all-time high, and the attach rate on net new logos continues to grow rapidly. With close to 80% of cyberattack leveraging identity-based tactics to compromise legitimate credentials and use techniques like lateral movement to evade detection, identity protection is core to stopping breaches. Our identity protection capabilities are a game changer in shoring up active directory as well as stopping ransomware and lateral movement.\nTo punctuate the value of our identity protection capabilities, I'd like to share a recent 7-figure expansion with a leading global brand. This customer has a very capable security team that spent years building a dedicated identity and access management team and implementing a privileged access management solution or PAM. Even with these efforts, shortly after turning on Falcon's identity protection in the POV, we identified several misconfigurations, including dozens of domain administrator accounts that were not being managed by their PAM solution, a multitude of accounts without password expirations, thousands of users with compromised passwords and a potential attack path from unprivileged accounts to privileged ones. With Falcon Identity, this customer is shutting down routes to illegitimate access and significantly hardening their defenses.\nQ3 also marked another record quarter for LogScale as we secured wins across multiple verticals, including financial services, insurance, technology, retail, energy and telecommunications. Notable wins included a statewide insurance provider in the U.S. and previously mentioned new Global 500 financial institution where Falcon LogScale is enabling both organizations to log more data, retain it longer and reduce the cost of their existing log solutions, resulting in better security and more visibility across their environments.\nDuring the quarter, we acquired external attack service management, EASM vendor, Reposify, to help our customers identify and eliminate risk from vulnerable and unknown assets before an attacker can exploit it. The acquisition closed in early October, and we expect to launch our external attack surface management module this quarter, which will bring us to 23 modules available across the Falcon platform.\nOn the public cloud front, we continue to build momentum with ending ARR for modules deployed in a public cloud setting growing over 100% year-over-year. Our CNAPP solution continues to gain industry recognition, including winning Best Cloud Security in CRN's 2022 Tech Innovators Award. Falcon Complete continues to shine with net new ARR growing close to 20% quarter-over-quarter as customers embrace our extended lineup of complete services, including Identity Complete and Cloud Complete. Additionally, we launched Falcon Complete LogScale during Q3 and already secured several wins.\nIn a more challenging economic environment, there is appeal for a solution like Falcon Complete that allows companies to decrease headcount or hold headcount stable.\nThe significant advantages of CrowdStrike's Falcon Complete offering were showcased in the first MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation for security service providers. Out of 16 participants evaluating, the Falcon platform's integration of industry-leading technology and human expertise enabled us to deliver the highest coverage. This was MITRE's first closed door test, which means the participants did not have prior knowledge of the adversary, and retesting was not allowed. We believe this evaluation demonstrates why CrowdStrike is the clear leader in EDR and XDR, whether our capabilities are delivered as a fully managed service from CrowdStrike or through our network of MSSP partners or operated independently by our customers.\nThe Falcon platform also won SE Lab's EDR ransomware detection and protection test. This well-regarded third-party testing firm involved 270 ransomware variations and deep attack tactics. Falcon achieved 100% ransomware prevention with 0 false positives. Let me repeat, 0 false positives, which we believe reflects our superior AI and machine learning models and the data mode advantage we derive from our unique graph technology in Threat Graph. Falcon's exceptionally low false positive rate represents a tremendous operational win for our customers as it enables them to significantly increase their speed to triage, investigate and remediate a verified alert.\nBased upon our business value assessment and realized analysis, we estimate that, on average, enterprise customers observed a 68% increase in operational efficiencies with the Falcon platform, equating to an offset of approximately 3.5 full-time employees. We believe today's macro pressures on businesses and the escalating threat environment make Falcon's value proposition as a consolidator more important today than at any other time in CrowdStrike's history. In order to solve agent bloating complexity within the security and IT stack while also protecting the business from cyber adversaries and reducing operating costs, companies need to consolidate on a truly integrated platform, not acquired technologies stitched together by an invoice.\nCrowdStrike Falcon continues to be the gold standard and the security platform of record.\nWhile the cybersecurity market is not immune to macro pressures, it is a mission-critical technology. The adversaries don't stop. As detailed in our latest threat hunting report, OverWatch observed a nearly 50% year-over-year increase in interactive intrusion campaigns. We believe cybersecurity investments is resilient and is prioritized, especially among the world's largest organizations as represented in our $1 million-plus customer cohort and best-in-class retention rates and module adoption rates.\nWith the escalating threat environment, expanding attack surface and extensibility of the Falcon platform, it is our belief that we are still in the early innings of CrowdStrike's growth journey. We believe the early and rapid success of our identity protection solution best demonstrates our ability to leverage our unique and vast threat intelligence to create and dominate new and legacy markets. We intend to continue our disruptive innovation, expand our technology leadership and bring new modules to market. Even with these investments, we are responding to current macro conditions and plan to balance growth with profitability and free cash flow, as Burt will discuss in more detail.\nWe remain steadfast in our vision to grow ending ARR in $5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2026 and reach our target operating model in fiscal year 2025.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers, except revenue mentioned during my remarks today, are non-GAAP.\nBefore we get started, I will note that the results we are reporting today include the acquisition of Reposify, which was de minimis to revenue and ARR, contributing less than $1 million to Q3 ARR.\nIn the quarter, ending ARR grew 54% year-over-year. Net new ARR grew 17% year-over-year to $198.1 million. Given the elongated sales cycles due to macro pressures in smaller non-enterprise accounts that George discussed, the composition of net new ARR in Q3 was weighted more heavily toward our $1 million-plus customer cohort with no outsized contribution from any one deal.\nOur dollar-based net retention rate was above our benchmark and consistent with Q2, maintaining the highest level since Q3 in fiscal 2021. Gross retention also maintained its record level, demonstrating our strong commitment to stopping the breach, delivering value to customers and restoring trust to the security posture of companies worldwide.\nAs George mentioned, we are also seeing more customers standardize on the Falcon platform and adopt more modules. We believe these trends will create an enduring business opportunity for the years to come.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 53% over Q3 of last year to reach $580.9 million. Subscription revenue grew 53% over Q3 of last year to reach $547.4 million. Professional services revenue was $33.5 million, setting a new record for the ninth consecutive quarter and representing 46% year-over-year growth.\nIn terms of our geographic performance in Q3, we continue to see strong growth in the U.S. at 46% and international revenue growth at 72% year-over-year.\nThird quarter total and subscription non-GAAP gross margins remained relatively consistent at 75% and 78%, respectively. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter were approximately $348.6 million or 60% of revenue versus $239.0 million last year or 63% of revenue.\nIn Q3, our magic number was 1.2, reflecting the continued efficiency of our go-to-market engine. We believe a magic number in excess of 1.0 indicates very favorable go-to-market efficiency and supports our current investment plan.\nAs George mentioned, we are focusing marketing investments on specific initiatives with the goal to drive an even bigger pipeline in response to the macroeconomic environment while at the same time maintaining our disciplined approach to unit economics.\nThird quarter non-GAAP operating income grew 77% year-over-year to reach a record $89.7 million, and operating margin improved by 2 percentage points year-over-year to reach 15%.\nLooking at the first 9 months of fiscal year 2023. Non-GAAP operating income grew 125% year-over-year to reach $260.1 million and 16% of revenue. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q3 also more than doubled over the prior year, growing to a record $96.1 million or $0.40 on a diluted per share basis.\nOur weighted average common shares used to calculate third quarter non-GAAP EPS attributed to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 240 million shares.\nWe ended the third quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately $2.47 billion and reflects the approximately $19 million payment net of cash acquired for the acquisition of Reposify. Cash flow from operations grew 53% year-over-year to a record $242.9 million. Free cash flow grew 41% year-over-year to a record $174.1 million or approximately 30% of revenue.\nBefore I move to our guidance, I'd like to provide a few comments about how we view the ongoing impact of the current macro climate on our business. We are maintaining our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2023 while raising our bottom line guidance.\nAs George mentioned, even though we entered Q4 with a record pipeline, we are expecting the elongated sales cycles due to macro concerns to continue, and we are not expecting to see the typical Q4 budget flush given the increased scrutiny on budgets.\nWhile we do not provide net new ARR guidance given the current macro uncertainty, we believe it is prudent to assume that Q4 net new ARR will be below Q3 by up to 10%.\nLooking into FY '24. Assuming an approximately 10% year-over-year headwind in the first half of the year on net new ARR, and for the full year, net new ARR would be roughly flat to modestly up year-over-year. This would imply a low 30s ending ARR growth rate and a subscription revenue growth rate in the low to mid-30s for FY '24.\nSimilar to how we partnered with customers during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are exercising more flexibility with new contract payment terms as organizations navigate macroeconomic conditions. We also expect more multiyear deals converting to 1 year renewals than in previous quarters. As a result, we expect free cash flow as a percent of revenue to be in the range of 28% and 30% for FY '23.\nThroughout fiscal year 2023 to date, we have taken advantage of market dynamics and brought on superb talent in key functions at an accelerated pace. At the same time, employee retention rates have increased. As of the end of Q3, we have grown our team by 40% in FY '23, putting us in a really good position to execute on our plan for next year. This allows us to shift our near-term focus to enablement and productivity while significantly slowing the pace of new hires needed to execute our plans.\nAssuming the macro environment does not materially weaken from current levels, we see a path to free cash flow margin of 30% of revenue in FY '24, and we plan to generate modest incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage in FY '24 as we continue to march toward our target operating model.\nFor the fourth quarter of FY '23, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $619.1 million to $628.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 44% to 46%, with subscription revenue being the dominant driver of growth. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $87.2 million to $93.7 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $100.9 million to $107.5 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.45, utilizing a weighted average share count of 241 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2023, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $2,223.0 million to $2,232.0 million, reflecting a growth rate of 53% to 54% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $347.2 million and $353.8 million. We expect fiscal 2023 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $357.6 million and $364.4 million. Utilizing 240 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $1.49 to $1.52.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program may be recorded.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Maria Riley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nVP of IR, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth and expected performance, including our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2023, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call.\nWhile we believe any forward-looking statements we make are reasonable, actual results could differ materially because the statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information on these and other factors that could affect the company's financial results is included in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in the company's quarterly and annual reports.\nAdditionally, unless otherwise stated, excluding revenue, all financial measures discussed on this call will be non-GAAP. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results is currently available in our earnings press release, which may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.crowdstrike.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to George to begin.\n\nGeorge R. Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us. The CrowdStrike team delivered a strong second quarter headlined by record net new ARR of $218 million as growth accelerated to 45% year-over-year, record net new customer additions and record non-GAAP operating profit.\nWe achieved several additional milestones in the quarter. Ending ARR grew to $2.14 billion on a 59% year-over-year growth rate. We believe this makes us the second fastest software company reported to reach the $2 billion ARR milestone. Ending ARR for our emerging products grew to $219 million, up 129% year-over-year. This included record-setting net new ARR for both Identity Protection and Humio, and we also achieved record net new ARR for modules deployed in a public cloud.\nQuarterly revenue exceeded $500 million for the first time. We added over 1,700 net new customers, another first for the company. Gross retention climbed to a new record for the second consecutive quarter, and dollar-based net retention reached its highest level in 7 quarters. We achieved these results while also driving record non-GAAP operating profit of $87 million, a 147% increase over Q2 of last year, and growing free cash flow of 84%.\nAs Burt will discuss in a few minutes, we are raising our revenue guidance for the year and remain committed to delivering non-GAAP operating leverage and 30% or greater free cash flow margin for the year while investing in key initiatives that will further widen the gap between CrowdStrike and the competition.\nMoving to our markets. The competitive environment remains favorable, and our win rates remain consistent. We continue to see strong demand even as organizations responded to macroeconomic conditions. For CrowdStrike, this primarily manifested in the form of increased levels of required approvals on some deals as companies evaluated investment priorities, which can extend the time it takes to close deals. However, cybersecurity is not a discretionary line item.\nCybersecurity is a priority for CIOs, CEOs and CFOs and Boards of Directors, and our value proposition resonates strongly with these stakeholders. Deals committed to close in the quarter did close in the quarter, and we entered Q3 with a record pipeline.\nOver the past several months, I have had many discussions with CIOs, and the message is clear. They are looking to consolidate on a platform like Falcon. They want fewer point products, fewer agents and technologies that consume fewer resources. They need to reduce complexity and simplify operations in their security and IT stack.\nComplexity is the enemy of security, efficiency and TCO. This business imperative is even more crucial in times when budgets are tightening, which accelerates standardization on trusted platforms that deliver immediate ROI and lower TCO such as CrowdStrike's Falcon platform. We believe that with increased scrutiny comes increased opportunity for CrowdStrike over the long term given the Falcon platform empowers customers to consolidate technologies and achieve better protection with less time, fewer resources and lower total cost. This differentiates us from others in the market and we believe positions us well for continued success even in the current macro environment.\nAnd we are seeing this dynamic in our business as the #1 vendor by market share in both IDC's 2021 worldwide corporate endpoint security and modern endpoint security categories. Customers are increasingly standardizing on the Falcon platform, driving module adoption, greater wallet share and larger customers, the trademark characteristics of a generational platform.\nQ2 subscription customers with 5 or more, 6 or more and 7 or more modules were 59%, 36% and 20%, respectively. This represents a 70%, 84% and 105% year-over-year increase in these respective module adoption cohorts. As customers adopt more modules, Falcon is increasingly embedded in their operations and workflows, which we believe leads to higher retention rates and even more opportunities for future expansion.\nCustomer retention is also driven by advanced capabilities built into the platform such as Fusion, our customizable security automation and remediation engine. Utilization of Fusion by customers has continued to increase since its launch. And in just 1 year, approximately 35% of our customers now use Fusion workflows.\nIn the quarter, momentum was strong among customers of all sizes from large enterprises to medium-sized businesses and smaller accounts. We believe our diversified customer base adds to our resiliency and our ability to deliver durable ARR growth over the long term. Ending ARR growth from our $1 million or more ARR customers accelerated in Q2 and continued to grow faster than our corporate average. These larger customers are standardizing on Falcon, consolidating vendors and prioritizing expansion projects that represent sizable cross-sell and upsell opportunities that are moving forward even under uncertain macro conditions.\nWe are also seeing increased strength in the public sector, which, in Q2, was driven by record sled performance and wins within the U.S. federal and international government agencies. To date, 20 of the 37 U.S. states that our CrowdStrike customers as well as the District of Columbia have standardized on Falcon. One noteworthy development in Q2 was with the state of New York, which is exclusively using Falcon EDR for the newly established joint security operations center.\nAs part of the shared services initiative, New York's cities and counties in the program will be protected by Falcon. The JSOC program is designed to house cybersecurity assets for multiple levels of government under 1 roof to protect against attacks across New York's interconnected network and IT services. We believe this is a model program that other states will look to emulate as their communities grapple with the heightened threat environment and cybersecurity skills gap.\nThe second quarter was also a record quarter for our e-commerce sales engine, which is a key factor in our strategy to efficiently reach and serve the small business community at scale. To further support small businesses, during the quarter, we launched our newest bundle, Falcon Go. This starter package is specifically designed as a landing point for smaller businesses with 100 endpoints or less that may be more price-sensitive and looking to transact through our e-commerce or trial program.\nWe also serve small businesses through the MSSP channel. The Falcon platform empowers MSSPs to stop breaches for their customers, simplify operations and drive cost efficiencies. MSSPs are a rapidly growing component of our partner ecosystem, with Q2 year-over-year ending ARR increasing more than 150% and a rapidly growing customer base that is excluded from our reported logo metrics.\nIn Q2, we added over 1,700 net new customers, bringing the total number of reported customers that rely on Falcon to protect their business to 19,686, a 51% increase year-over-year. I'm especially proud to announce one of our new customers this quarter included a leading incident response firm that purchased Falcon for their internal use. We are also pleased with our strong module performance across the Falcon platform.\nI'd like to highlight a few standouts in Q2. First is Falcon Complete, which has continued to gain strong momentum in the market as companies look to address the growing cybersecurity imperative and contend with the cybersecurity skill shortage. Over 1,000 customers have adopted Falcon Complete since the start of the fiscal year. By leveraging the advanced automation in the platform, Falcon Complete offers customers and partners a way to quickly and cost effectively scale and fortify their cyber defenses with gold standard expertise and technology while lowering their total cost of ownership. As we add modules to the Falcon Complete lineup, customers are standardizing on Complete. An example in Q2 is a payments company that adopted our full suite of Falcon Complete offerings, which includes managed identity and managed cloud workload protection.\nNext is our emerging product category that solves use cases outside of traditional endpoint protection but are rapidly becoming core in the minds of customers. This category includes our Discover, Spotlight and Identity Protection modules as well as Humio. We delivered record net new ARR from our emerging products, propelling the ending ARR for this category to $219 million, up 129% year-over-year.\nOur Identity Protection lineup achieved a record quarter and quickly grew to become the largest contributor to ARR within our emerging category. In Q2, the number of customers subscribing to our Identity Protection modules grew more than 100% quarter-over-quarter driven in part by a new logo attach rate that tripled, with close to 80% of cyber attacks leveraging identity-based tactics to compromise legitimate credentials and use techniques like lateral movement to quickly evade detection. Identity Protection is core to stopping breaches.\nWe see many parallels between this new market and the early days of the EDR market, including a massive greenfield opportunity with an estimated $3.7 billion TAM in calendar year 2022 and a sizable uplift to ASP, which can be north of 30%. With our early and growing momentum, we believe CrowdStrike is well on the way to defining and leading the identity protection category. CrowdStrike Falcon Identity Threat Protection is unique in the industry as it can detect and stop in real time identity-based attacks. And with one easy-to-deploy agent, the Falcon platform can respond to modern attacks with endpoint, identity and workload context without the multi-platform complexity and post-processing other solutions require.\nHumio had a record Q2 as we secured wins across multiple verticals, including financial services, health care, retail, manufacturing, transportation and professional services. Notable wins included a multinational financial services firm with ingestion requirements of up to 4 terabytes a day that adopted Humio to displace its legacy provider whose query speeds and data ingestion capabilities were inferior and an IT and security services provider in APAC that is now leveraging Humio as the engine to collect and store security and observability data from its growing customer base.\nMoving from a module perspective to a deployment environment view. Our public cloud business delivered a record Q2 with ending ARR growth accelerating quarter-over-quarter for the second consecutive quarter to reach $174 million. Building on the cloud-native application protection platform or CNAPP capabilities we introduced last quarter, this quarter, we announced new CNAPP capabilities to extend support within AWS Fargate to Amazon's Elastic Container Service, introduced the first AI-powered indicators of attack, comprehensive fileless attack prevention and enhanced visibility for cloud intrusions and introduced Falcon OverWatch cloud threat hunting, the first stand-alone cloud threat hunting service for threats originating, operating or persisting in cloud environments.\nCloud is another evolving market where we believe we can significantly expand our share, especially as CIOs look to consolidate vendors and move away from point products. As we discussed last quarter, CrowdStrike's cloud capabilities stand alone in the market by delivering agent-based and agentless solutions natively from the Falcon platform in a single user interface with a shared data back-end in threat graph. The combination of agent-based and agentless capabilities in the cloud enables prerun time and run time protection whereas agentless-only solutions can only offer partial visibility and cannot provide run time security.\nTaking a moment to summarize and put everything we have shared with you today into context. Customers want a trusted platform that seamlessly unifies endpoint, cloud, identity and data, redefining what core cybersecurity means. CrowdStrike is leading this replatforming with Falcon, and we see no other competitor with a comparable offering.\nI believe the CISO of a county on the East Coast said it best, and I quote, \"It's hard to remember the days when I didn't have immediate 24/7 remediation, vulnerability reports on every device, discovery of every asset on my network and a clear understanding of every account login, but I'm never going back.\"\nI want to thank each and every CrowdStriker for your passionate focus to make us the best in the business. It is your work that earned CrowdStrike's recognition as a winner in the Best Security Company category for the 2022 SC Awards U.S. and Falcon XDR as a winner in the Best Emerging Technology category for the SC Awards Europe 2022.\nBefore I turn it over to Burt, I would like to invite our investors and analysts to join us at Falcon in Las Vegas in September. Similar to last year, in conjunction with the event, we will hold an investor briefing featuring conversations with customers, partners and industry experts. To join in person, please contact our IR team for the registration information. The briefing will also be webcast live on our IR website.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers, except revenue, mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP.\nWe delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance on all metrics. Strength in multiple areas of the business and superb execution by the CrowdStrike team translated to rapid growth at an increased scale, record non-GAAP operating profit and strong cash generation.\nIn the second quarter, we continued to maintain very high unit economics, drive leverage and remain very capital-efficient. We also continued to execute on our investment plan for the year, fueling innovation on the Falcon platform, expansion into new markets and growing the CrowdStrike team.\nOur second quarter results are a testament to the resilience of our markets, value of our platform and the ongoing durability of our SaaS business model that provides excellent visibility and enables us to deliver high growth with strong profitability and free cash flow.\nIn the quarter, ending ARR grew 59% year-over-year to surpass the $2 billion milestone. Net new ARR growth accelerated to 45% year-over-year. We delivered a record $218.1 million in net new ARR, representing our strong momentum in the market. The composition of net new ARR in Q2 was very well balanced across deal size with no outsized contribution from any 1 deal.\nOur dollar-based net retention rate was above our benchmark, reaching its highest level since Q3 in fiscal 2021. Gross retention reached a new record for the third consecutive quarter, demonstrating our strong commitment to stopping the breach, delivering value to customers and restoring trust to the security posture of companies worldwide.\nAs George mentioned, we are also seeing more customers standardize on the Falcon platform and adopt more modules. We believe these trends will create an enduring business opportunity for the years to come.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 58% over Q2 of last year to reach $535.2 million. Subscription revenue grew 60% over Q2 of last year to reach $506.2 million. Professional services revenue was $29.0 million, setting a new record for the eighth consecutive quarter and representing 32% year-over-year growth.\nIn terms of our geographic performance in Q2, we continued to see strong growth in the U.S. at 53% and international revenue growth at 73% year-over-year. Second quarter total and subscription non-GAAP gross margins remained relatively consistent at 76% and 78%, respectively. As we continue to invest for growing demand, we are pleased with our strong subscription gross margin performance, which remains within our target model range.\nDuring the quarter, we executed on our plan to invest in new technologies, international geographies and marketing programs. We are also executing our 2023 hiring plan and pleased to report that we added a record number of net new hires for the second consecutive quarter. Bringing on and retaining top talent is a cornerstone to supporting our product road map, future growth and market share gains in new markets. We believe the investments we are making today will lead to sustained growth over the long term and maintain our position as a trusted security partner of choice.\nGiven our strong top line, disciplined approach to investing and efficient sales motion, we were able to make these investments while also driving increased leverage and profit. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were approximately $321.4 million or 60% of revenue versus $222.4 million last year or 66% of revenue.\nIn Q2, our Magic Number was 1.3, reflecting the phenomenal efficiency of our go-to-market engine. We believe a Magic Number in excess of 1.0 indicates very favorable go-to-market efficiency and supports our current investment plan.\nSecond quarter non-GAAP operating income more than doubled, growing 147% year-over-year to reach a record $87.3 million. And operating margin improved by 6 percentage points year-over-year to reach 16%.\nLooking at the first half of fiscal year 2023. Non-GAAP operating income grew 162% year-over-year to reach $170.3 million and 17% of revenue. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q2 also more than tripled over the prior year, growing to a record $85.9 million or $0.36 on a diluted per share basis. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate second quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 239 million shares.\nWe ended the second quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately $2.32 billion. Cash flow from operations grew 94% year-over-year to $209.9 million. Free cash flow grew 84% year-over-year to $135.8 million or 25% of revenue and reflects our planned increased capital investments, which more than doubled year-over-year.\nMoving to our outlook. Given the growth drivers of our business as well as our strong second quarter performance, record pipeline and record gross retention rate, we are raising our revenue guidance for the fiscal year 2023. At the same time, we have factored in what we believe is an appropriately pragmatic view with respect to the current global macroeconomic backdrop.\nWhile we do not guide to net new ARR, given the unseasonal strength in net new ARR delivered in both Q1 and Q2 of this fiscal year, we believe it is prudent to assume less pronounced quarter-to-quarter seasonality in the back half in comparison to prior years.\nAlso, as a reminder, we suggest that investors adjust their seasonality expectations to exclude the impact of significant large deals such as the 2 approximately 8-figure accounts we discussed in Q4 of last year.\nOn the bottom line, we are also raising our guidance for fiscal year 2023. And as our guidance reflects, we remain committed to deliver non-GAAP operating margin leverage for the year while continuing to invest in the business. We also remain committed to achieving 30% or more free cash flow margin for the year.\nFor the third quarter of FY '23, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $569.1 million to $575.9 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 50% to 52%, with subscription revenue being the dominant driver of growth. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $72.7 million to $77.7 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $73.0 million to $78.0 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.32, utilizing a weighted average share count of 241 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2023, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $2,223.0 million to $2,232.0 million, reflecting a growth rate of 53% to 54% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $321.8 million and $328.5 million.\nWe expect fiscal 2023 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $313.7 million and $320.5 million, utilizing 240 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis. We expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $1.31 to $1.33.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.",

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the CrowdStrike Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nVP of IR, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for your participation today.

Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us. I will start today's call by summarizing 3 key points. First, fiscal 2023 is off to a fantastic start. We believe our Q1 results exemplify that we have a winning formula that includes scale, growth, profitability and free cash flow. Second, we saw strength across the platform, including a record quarter for modules deployed in the public cloud and over 100% year-over-year ending ARR growth for our emerging product group, which includes our Discover Spotlight, Identity Protection and Log Management modules.\nAnd third, we are seeing more and more customers standardize on the Falcon platform. The number of customers adopting 6 or more and 7 or more modules both grew more than 100% year-over-year. We believe this underscores our wide competitive moat and our opportunity to drive long-term sustainable growth in both our core and expansion markets.\nNow let's discuss our results in more detail. The CrowdStrike team achieved another outstanding first quarter. Building on our historic Q4, this quarter, we delivered net new ARR of $190 million, topping our expectations. We delivered ending ARR growth of 61% year-over-year to exceed $1.9 billion, record non-GAAP operating profit of $83 million and free cash flow margin of 32%.\nIn 8 out of the last 10 quarters, we have delivered 30% or greater free cash flow margin. Our powerful combination of growth, profitability and cash flow is reflected in our continued performance well in excess of the SaaS industry's Rule of 40 benchmark. In Q1, we achieved a Rule of 78 on a non-GAAP operating income basis, and when calculated on a free cash flow basis, a Rule of 93.\nGiven our market opportunity, platform, subscription business model and high unit economics, we believe we have the ability to continue to grow at scale, generate cash and invest in initiatives that will further widen the gap between CrowdStrike and the competition, especially at a time when companies are forced to reduce their spending and hiring plans.\nI'd like to thank those of you who joined our investor briefing in April, where we showcased the simplicity and the power of the Falcon platform. We also demonstrated how our differentiated single-agent architecture that does not require reboot, enables a frictionless go-to-market motion with an e-commerce engine. We believe this is unique to CrowdStrike and translates to increased module adoption, deal sizes, ARR growth and sales efficiency. And in Q1, we saw the flywheel effect and strong differentiation of the Falcon platform in motion.\nThe demand environment we see is more robust today than this time last year as cybersecurity is not discretionary. Additionally, the competitive environment has remained favorable to CrowdStrike. Our growing leadership in the market is reflected in IDC's most recent report where CrowdStrike leapfrogged to the #1 position amongst all vendors in the 2021 market share for worldwide corporate endpoint security and once again took the top spot in modern endpoint security.\nIn Q1, we executed well across all market segments with over 1,600 subscription customers of all sizes choosing CrowdStrike for the fourth consecutive quarter. This brings the total number of customers that rely on Falcon to protect their business to 17,945, a 57% increase year-over-year. The first quarter was a record quarter for our e-commerce engine. Late in Q4, we significantly expanded our trial program, increasing the number of modules available for trial to 12, up from just 4 modules in the prior quarter.\nThe expanded trial program provides an even larger foundation to drive velocity through our e-commerce engine and makes it even easier for companies to trial and purchase more modules on the Falcon platform, and we are very pleased with the record performance in Q1. Our ability to rapidly innovate on the Falcon platform and solve a growing number of security imperatives for our customers with a single-agent platform provides CrowdStrike strong differentiation, wide competitive moat and multiple growth engines in both our core and expansion markets.\nOur frictionless adoption motion drives larger deal sizes among both large and small customers over time and has translated to increasing module adoption metrics quarter-after-quarter. In Q1, subscription customers with 4 or more, 5 or more and 6 or more modules increased to 71%, 59% and 35%, respectively. Given subscription customers with 4 or more modules surpassed the 70% milestone and is now commonplace, we are retiring this disclosure and raising the bar by introducing a new metric customers with 7 or more modules, which reached 19% at the end of Q1. We are pleased with our strong module performance across the Falcon platform in both our core and expansion markets.\nI'd like to highlight a few standouts in Q1. First is Falcon Complete, our industry-leading full turnkey managed detection and response offering that uniquely blends technology and services to stop breaches for customers of all sizes. Q1 was a record-breaking quarter for Falcon Complete with net new ARR reaching an all-time high. Falcon Complete has continued to gain momentum in the market as companies look to address the growing cybersecurity imperative and contend with the cybersecurity skills gap.\nBy leveraging the advanced automation in the platform, Falcon Complete offers customers and partners a way to quickly and cost effectively scale, fortify their cyber defenses with gold standard expertise and technology. We believe our massive success with Falcon Complete is a testament to the increasing trust customers place in CrowdStrike every day.\nAs one of our largest customers recently posted on LinkedIn, \"CrowdStrike's Complete team allows our team to focus on the bigger picture without sacrificing the quality and detail of Tier 1 response.\"\nOur growing leadership in the MDR market is also recognized by market research firms. In Gartner's recent Market Share Managed Security Services Worldwide 2021 report, CrowdStrike was ranked #1 by market share. As we have added modules to the Falcon platform, we have introduced new complete offerings that extend beyond core endpoint, including a complete for Cloud Workload Protection and Complete for Identity Protection. This ability to create new extended offerings within the Complete product line generates new multidimensional avenues to drive ARR growth.\nMoving to the public cloud. Building on top of a strong Q4, the first quarter was a record quarter with ending ARR growth for public cloud deployments accelerating quarter-over-quarter. As organizations are moving more workloads to the cloud, the adversaries are quickly following, and traditional security tools are not enough to keep pace with the ever-changing nature of cloud environments.\nCrowdStrike's cloud capabilities stand alone in the market by delivering agent-based and agentless solutions delivered natively from the Falcon platform in a single user interface with a shared data back end in Threat Graph. The combination of agent-based and agentless capabilities in the cloud enables pre-runtime and runtime protection whereas agentless-only solutions can only offer partial visibility and lack remediation capabilities.\nAdditionally, the (inaudible) of the public cloud put an even higher emphasis on the importance of a lightweight agent. The time we took at the inception of CrowdStrike to design the agent with the lightest footprint amongst all competitors and that doesn't require a reboot makes our agent perfectly suited for cloud deployments.\nOne of our marquee wins this quarter was a global financial software company that was looking to protect its private cloud and growing public cloud environment. In this cloud win, CrowdStrike was chosen over the competition given Falcon's unified interface across public, hybrid and multi-cloud assets, ease-of-use, superior performance and speed of detections.\nIn the quarter, we introduced new Cloud Native Application Protection Platform or CNAPP capabilities to accelerate threat hunting for cloud environments and workloads and reduce the meantime to respond. The new capabilities we announced provide the visibility, automation and cloud hygiene necessary to defend against today's adversaries.\nIdentity Protection is another emerging area where we are seeing growing success in the market with the number of customers subscribing to these modules growing more than 30% quarter-over-quarter. Our Identity Protection solution is a game changer in the fight against ransomware and preventing lateral movement. This was demonstrated in the recent MITRE prevention evaluation in which Falcon achieved 100% prevention and our Identity Protection module stopped the would-be attacker before it could even gain access to the target environment, redefining what it means to stop the breach.\nIn terms of opportunity, we see many similarities between this new emerging market and the EDR market at its inception, with customers not knowing how much they need it until they saw it in action. To demonstrate this point, I'd like to share feedback I personally receive via text from a long-standing Falcon customer. \"We are doing our POC of identity protection, and it alerted us that all members of domain users errantly had permissions to reset the machine for one of our domain controllers. We fixed it immediately and identified the root cause. We never would have found this in 1 million years, and it could have been used to do great harm. We really are in love with this product. Thanks to you and the team for building these amazing tools for us.\"\nAnd on the Humio front, we are seeing increasing momentum in the log management space with customers. Additionally, our resellers, MSSPs and technology partners are excited about building their businesses with Humio. With the recent sales enablement and quota assignment for the global CrowdStrike sales team, our pipeline of log management opportunity rapidly growing. Specifically in Q1, we secured wins with new and existing CrowdStrike customers, including a Fortune 100 industrial company, a Fortune 500 materials manufacturer and a large health services provider.\nMoving to the market dynamics and threat environment. We continue to see powerful tailwinds fueling our market, and we do not currently see any indication that these trends will abate anytime soon. These tailwinds include a rapidly expanding attack surface and digital supply chains as organizations embrace digital transformation and move more workloads to the cloud, the cybersecurity skills gap in a heightened threat environment.\nWe remain in a shields-up threat environment with adversaries rapidly evolving their tactics. Ransomware is no longer enough for advanced e-criminals. They are now weaponizing the data they extract by periodically leaking it to the public in an effort to extort their victims and drive even higher paydays.\nOver the past few months, I spent significant time traveling to meet with customers, prospects, partners and fellow CrowdStrikers. I found it energizing and inspiring to resume in-person engagement, and I would like to share with you a few recurring themes from my conversations.\nFirst, cybersecurity is an essential technology that underpins modern business, and we see this growing as regulators sharpen their lens on cybersecurity requirements. As a result, cybersecurity is a growing priority, words of directors and initiatives to fortify an organization security posture and reduce enterprise risk are being discussed, evaluated and funded at the highest levels.\nSecond, in order to cope with the skills gap, organizations are looking for technologies that help them achieve more with fewer human resources. CIOs and CISOs are looking for a true platform that delivers on the promise to consolidate agents, reduce complexity, simplify operations and reduce operational costs. This includes replacing legacy log management and SIEM products, and that is why they are so excited about Falcon XDR.\nAnd that brings me to my third point, trust. I heard directly from Boards, CIOs and CISOs that when it comes to cybersecurity, the importance of trust increasingly eclipses price during the buying decision. In fact, we saw this exact dynamic and a key win with a leading-edge tech innovator and S&P 500-listed company where we were competing against Microsoft. Even though this new customer is a Microsoft-first shop, we were told that the buying decision, which the Board of Directors was actively involved in, ultimately came down to who they trusted to protect them from their worst day.\nBefore I hand it over to Burt, I will share one more recent new subscription customer win where the incumbent vendor fell short of expectations. This global business process service provider based in Europe was struggling with their Microsoft deployment as complexity and misconfiguration pitfalls were hampering their efforts to protect their heterogeneous environment.\nAfter months of continuous issues, they fell victim to a breach and turned to CrowdStrike for incident response and endpoint recovery services. During the remediation process, this customer was able to experience firsthand the value of trusted expertise and the ease and speed of deploying Falcon across their environment. This led them to adopt Falcon Complete, which was fully up and running only 24 hours after the expanded engagement was completed. Falcon Complete is highly differentiated in the market as competing offerings only notify the customer of a problem, whereas Falcon Complete with Fusion no-code security automation will proactively remediate any issues.\nIn closing, I would like to thank each and every CrowdStriker for your passionate focus on making CrowdStrike the trusted cybersecurity company. With that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers except revenue mentioned during my remarks today are non-GAAP.\nMoving to our results. We delivered another outstanding quarter with strength in multiple areas of the business and superb execution by the CrowdStrike team translating to rapid growth at an increased scale, record non-GAAP profitability and record cash generation.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to maintain very high unit economics, drive leverage and remain very capital efficient even as we aggressively invest in the business, innovate on the Falcon platform, expand into new markets and grow the CrowdStrike team.\nDemand in the quarter was broad-based and fueled by strength in multiple areas of the business. These included continued strong customer adoption of our core products, growing success with our emerging product category and cloud modules, strong retention and expansion within our customer base and continued rapid new customer acquisition.\nNet new ARR grew 32% to reach $190.5 million. Our exceptional Q1 net new ARR performance was ahead of our expectations and follows our unprecedented Q4 highlighting our continued strong momentum in the market. Additionally, the composition of net new ARR in Q1 was very well balanced across deal size with no outsized contribution from any one deal.\nOur dollar-based net retention rate was once again above our benchmark, and gross retention reached a new all-time high. Our consistently high gross retention rate reflects our strong commitment to stopping the breach, delivering value to customers and restoring trust to the security posture of companies worldwide.\nAs George mentioned, we are also seeing more customers standardizing on the Falcon platform and adopting more modules. We believe these trends will create an enduring business opportunity for the years to come.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 61% over Q1 of last year to reach $487.8 million. Subscription revenue grew 64% over Q1 of last year to reach $459.8 million. Professional services revenue was $28.0 million, setting a new record for the seventh consecutive quarter and representing 30% year-over-year growth.\nIn terms of our geographic performance in Q1, we continue to see strong growth in the U.S. at 57%, and international revenue growth accelerated to 71% year-over-year.\nFirst quarter total and subscription non-GAAP gross margins remained relatively consistent at 77% and 79%, respectively. As we continue to invest for growing demand, we are pleased with our strong subscription gross margin performance, which remains within our target model range. As planned, we invested aggressively in our business during the quarter, including increasing investments in new technologies, international geographies and marketing programs.\nWe are also executing our 2023 hiring plan and pleased to report that we added a record number of net new hires during the quarter. We believe the investments we are making today will lead to sustained growth over the long term and maintain our position as a trusted security partner of choice. Given our strong top line, disciplined approach to investing and efficient sales motion, we were able to make these investments also driving increased leverage and profit.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were approximately $291.0 million or 60% of revenue versus $202.9 million last year or 67% of revenue. In Q1, our magic number increased to 1.4, reflecting the efficiency of our go-to-market engine and our ability to rapidly onboard and support customers of all sizes. We have put as much thought into our go-to-market as we have into our technology, creating a new paradigm for enterprise cybersecurity sales.\nThe Falcon platform was designed from the start to foster module adoption. And on top of that, we built an e-commerce engine that would not have been possible to achieve without the architectural choices made in CrowdStrike's early days. We also have a thriving partner ecosystem, which includes MSSPs that is contributing to our ability to efficiently scale our business.\nFirst quarter non-GAAP operating income more than doubled, growing 179% year-over-year to reach a record $83.0 million, and operating margin improved by over 7 percentage points year-over-year to reach 17%.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q1 also more than tripled, growing to a record $74.8 million or $0.31 on a diluted per share basis. Our weighted average common share is used to calculate first quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 239 million shares.\nWe ended the first quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately $2.15 billion. Cash flow from operations grew 46% year-over-year to a record $215.0 million. Free cash flow grew 34% year-over-year to a new record of $157.5 million or 32% of revenue and reflects our planned increased capital investments, which more than doubled year-over-year. Given the current geopolitical environment and growing regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, CISA reporting mandates and the forthcoming SEC cybersecurity disclosure requirements, we believe the essential nature of our offerings is increasing.\nThis, along with our corporate customer base, our efficient sales motion, our high gross retention rates, and our SaaS model that includes subscription contracts and multiyear customer relationships will provide consistent cash flow performance. Further, we believe these factors will provide resiliency in any type of environment as we build a durable cash generator for today and years to come.\nBefore moving to guidance, I would like to cover a few modeling notes. While we do not specifically guide to net new ARR, we would like to provide a framework for how we view lease and seasonality trends. Similar to last year, we delivered an exceptional Q1 with significantly muted Q4 to Q1 net new ARR seasonality when normalizing for the 2 accounts that contributed approximately 8 figures each to our unprecedented Q4 results. As a result, looking to Q2, we expect to see seasonality off of Q1 to be similar to last fiscal year.\nNext is on operating leverage. Given our strong Q1 performance and as reflected in our increased guidance, which reflects 56% to 62% year-over-year growth in operating income, we expect to see the year-over-year operating margin leverage for the year materialize in the first half of fiscal 2023. This is primarily driven by our commitment to continue investing aggressively in our massive opportunity and leverage our unique leadership position in the market, current demand and increased unit economics.\nLastly, I will touch on cash flow. As a reminder, given the timing of expenses, seasonality of new hires and the midyear ESPP purchase, the second quarter is generally our lowest cash flow generation quarter of the year.\nMoving to our guidance. We continue to remain optimistic about the demand for our offerings, record pipeline and our ability to execute on the powerful secular trends fueling our markets, and as a result, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2023.\nFor the second quarter of FY '23, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $512.7 million to $516.8 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 52% to 53% with subscription revenue being the dominant driver of growth. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $70.4 million to $73.3 million, and non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $64.9 million to $67.9 million. We expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.28 utilizing a weighted average share count of 240 million shares on a diluted basis.\nFor the full fiscal year 2023, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $2,190.5 million to $2,205.8 million, reflecting a growth rate of 51% to 52% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $306.5 million and $317.8 million. We expect fiscal 2023 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $283.3 million and $294.6 million. Utilizing 241 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22.\nAnd George and I will now take your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference to your host, Ms. Maria Riley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\n\nMaria Riley\n\nVP of IR, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon. and thank you for your participation today. With me on the call are George Kurtz, President and Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike; and Burt Podbere, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I would like to note that certain statements made during this conference call that are not historical facts, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, growth and expected performance, including our outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2023 are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Kurtz\n\nCo-Founder, CEO, President & Director, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you all for joining us. Before we get started, I would like to acknowledge the war in Ukraine. Our deepest thoughts and support are with all of those impacted by this tragedy as we are reminded of the terrible human toll that military conflict brings. We are hoping for peace in Ukraine and the broader region.\nTurning to our financial results. I will start today's call by summarizing 4 key points. First, CrowdStrike delivered an exceptional fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. This quarter's results are headlined by an acceleration in net new ARR growth for the second consecutive quarter to reach $217 million. Record 19% non-GAAP operating margin and record free cash flow of $127 million or approximately $197 million when excluding the IP transfer tax payment related to the acquisition of Humio.\nSecond, our success outside of traditional endpoint security is now punctuated by both scale and hyper growth as we surpassed the $150 million ARR milestone, while growing in excess of 100% year-over-year for our IT hygiene, vulnerability management, identity protection and log management modules collectively.\nThird, we exited the year with tremendous momentum for ARR derived from Falcon deployments in the public cloud, where ARR eclipsed the $100 million milestone and grew 20% quarter-on-quarter as we lead the effort to transform security for the public cloud.\nAnd fourth, as you can see from our outstanding results, our growth engine is executing on all cylinders, which includes our thriving partner ecosystem. One partner I'd like to highlight is AWS. In fiscal 2022, ending ARR transacted through the AWS marketplace grew more than 100% year-over-year.\nFurthermore, CrowdStrike ended the year as one of the top ISV partners by transaction volume on the AWS Marketplace with partner source deals growing strongly throughout the year. We believe this speaks to the success of our partnership with the world's largest public cloud provider and highlights the value we can provide to both partners and customers alike.\nNow let's discuss our results in more detail. Net new ARR growth accelerated for the second quarter in a row to reach $217 million, and for the first time in company history, surpassed the $200 million milestone. Demand was driven by expansion in the core endpoint market as well as a record quarter for cloud, identity protection and Humio.\nGrowth was also fueled by rapid customer expansion among companies of all sizes from large enterprises to small businesses. We added over 1,600 subscription customers for the third consecutive quarter, bringing the total number of customers that rely on CrowdStrike to protect their business to 16,325, a 65% increase year-over-year.\nDemand in the quarter was broad-based and new wins included sizable deals with multiple top global financial services organization, a record number of new Falcon Complete customers, including Fortune 500 and multinational companies across the technology, media, telecommunications, education and government sectors, among many others. Record lands for our cloud workload protection module and Horizon. Our agentless cloud security posture management module, including wins at a large U.S. insurance provider, a Fortune 250 software company and a Fortune 50 energy company.\nWe achieved another record quarter for our identity protection modules, which significantly differentiates Falcon in the field and continue to lead to higher win rates. Key wins included a global leader in customer experience management, a global financial services company, public sector agencies and multiple wins in the Fortune 500.\nQ4 was also another record quarter for Humio with wins across multiple verticals such as retail, financial services, manufacturing, technology and transportation. Our success with Humio this quarter included securing a 7-figure deal with a financial services customer, whose the existing log management solutions have become budget prohibitive given the exponential growth of data being captured by their dev ops team.\nAnd lastly, we are thrilled to announce that Cloudflare, a trusted Crowdstrike technology partner, on a mission to build a better Internet became a new customer in the quarter, adopting both Falcon Complete and Horizon. We look forward to deepening our natural partnership and identifying even more opportunities to work together.\nAmong these many fantastic recent wins, let me take a moment to share some additional details about the expansion with a Fortune 50 financial institution that I think exemplifies our technology advantage in action and why scalability and trust matter. Midyear, this particular customer had chosen CrowdStrike to protect its traditional endpoints and displace the legacy incumbent. At approximately the same time, for relationship reasons, this organization had chosen a next-gen competitor to protect a server environment. But after 6 months, they were still struggling to deploy the other vendors' products in its server environment. They were plagued by forced reboots, significant memory usage and unmet product road map promises.\nWhile they struggle to get their service protected, Falcon was fully deployed across their hundreds of thousands of endpoints in a matter of weeks without requiring a reboot. Side-by-side, we showcased our differentiation on a broad scale and a real production environment. This customer was able to see the rich telemetry Falcon provided in real time and the power of our security cloud, all resulting in better efficacy. This customer terminated the other vendors contract and is now deploying Falcon to protect their services globally. This is just one of many customer stories that demonstrate the fundamental reason why we have earned our leadership with increased win rates and record displacement, efficacy, scalability, manageability, real-time versus batch mode and importantly, our ability to consolidate agents while solving a growing number of real-world business problem.\nQ4 was also a record quarter for our partner ecosystem. In total, for fiscal year 2022, we gained significant leverage from our partner ecosystem. During the year, partner stores ending ARR grew 83% year-over-year with our MSSP business growing more than 200%. Our architecture is fundamentally different from any other vendor we see in the market. While our technology advantages are vast, it all starts with how we design the platform from the beginning with smart filtering capabilities on the agent, which gives us the ability to dynamically adjust our aperture to stream rich telemetry to the cloud in real time. We believe these foundational architectural elements have created a high barrier to entry, while competitors operate batch mode and struggle with storing data on the endpoint.\nWe continue to extend our technology leadership across the entire platform. As we announced yesterday, Humio assessed the standard for streaming index-free data ingestion and reached a new benchmark of over 1 petabyte of data ingestion per day. CrowdStrike will continue to leverage the speed and scale of the Humio engine to extend our position in the XDR space.\nYou have heard me say that CrowdStrike is more than just an endpoint provider. The success of our platform strategy is reflected in the hyper growth we are deriving from many of our modules as well as our strong module adoption metrics, which have consistently increased quarter after quarter.\nIn Q4, subscription customers with 4 or more, 5 or more and 6 or more modules increased to 69%, 57% and 34%, respectively. As both new and existing customers increasingly trust Falcon to solve security challenges outside of core endpoint, we have multiple product areas contributing significantly to ARR growth. We are seeing tremendous growth from our emerging products that solve use cases outside of traditional endpoint protection. This includes our discover, spotlight and identity protection modules as well as Humio. ARR for this group grew more than 100% over last year, contributing $157 million to FY 2022 ending ARR. These modules are significant growth drivers for our overall business with ending ARR for these modules growing 30% quarter-over-quarter and representing approximately 17% of our Q4 net new ARR collectively. Our success to date in these adjacent areas speaks to the extensibility of our platform outside of core next-gen AV and EDR, the data we collect and our ability to make meaningful inroads in accessing new TAMs.\nChanging from a module perspective to a deployment environment view, our public cloud business surpassed the $100 million milestone in Q4 to reach $106 million in ending ARR. This milestone encompasses our modules deployed in the public cloud, including our cloud runtime protection and CSPM modules. We have seen tremendous momentum in this business as we exit the year.\nEnding ARR growth for our business when viewed through a cloud deployment lens outpaced the growth of our overall business, growing 20% quarter-over-quarter and represented approximately 8% of our Q4 net new ARR. Cloud workloads are increasingly targeted by adversaries and are largely underprotected, representing a significant growth opportunity in FY '23 and beyond.\nMoving to the market dynamics. There are powerful tailwinds driving our markets, and we do not currently see any indication that these trends will abate anytime soon. The adversaries are certainly not slowing down, actually quite the opposite. As we've published in our most recent global threat report, 2021 provided no rest for the weary with an 82% increase in ransomware-related data leaks. As the nation's state events of the past few weeks have demonstrated, cyberspace is center stage joining land, air, sea and space as the fifth dimension of warfare. There are no borders in cyberspace and the cyber blast radius has no bounds, putting every organization and government at risk as attacks can extend far beyond their intended targets as we saw with NotPetya.\nLast year, 62% of attacks we observed were malware-less with most of these involving compromised identities. We expect that both e-criminals and nation-state adversaries alike will continue to exploit vulnerabilities across endpoints and cloud environments and ramp up tradecraft around the use of identity and stolen credentials to bypass legacy defenses.\nIn addition to advancing adversary tactics in a heightened threat environment, organizations must contend with the ongoing security skills gap, which we have seen drive increased demand for our Falcon complete offering to help companies combat the increasing threat of compromised identity. Last week, we launched Falcon Identity Threat Protection Complete, the industry's first managed identity solution and a new way to help customers scale their security teams to protect against sophisticated attacks and stop breaches.\nAdditionally, the attack surface is expanding rapidly and the digital supply chain is ever growing as organizations embrace digital transformation and move more workloads to the cloud. We believe our TAM continues to expand, and all of these factors will lead to sustained market growth for the foreseeable future.\nWe also continue to see a very favorable competitive environment and multiyear runway to displacing legacy endpoint vendors, which is bolstering our growth as companies look to transform their security stack.\nBefore I hand it over to Burt, I will provide some final thoughts on the big picture of what we see unfolding. As I shared with you in my opening comments, in addition to our growing leadership in the EPP market, we now have multiple vectors driving our growth and scale that are outside what some might consider our core. We have been very deliberate and purposeful in choosing to enter markets. Enterprise risk is coalescing around 3 critical areas: endpoints or workloads, identity and data, all 3 areas we have been investing, innovating and see as core to CrowdStrike's mission. These areas represent the biggest risk for organizations and customers are increasingly looking to the Falcon platform to solve their most pressing security needs as legacy products in these markets are brittle, complicated and struggle to deliver value to the customer.\nGiven our footprint on the endpoint or workload, the data we collect and the advantages of our architecture and Security Cloud afford, we see great alignment and great opportunity in our approach to solving a multitude of problems for customers as we innovate and disrupt in these emergent categories such as log management, SIM and observability, which is reflected in our growing strength in these newer markets as well as endpoint protection.\nIn closing, I would like to thank every CrowdStriker around the world for their tireless dedication to protecting our customers, which ultimately translates to the financial success of our company. I'm humbled and inspired by the commitment level of execution and hard work CrowdStrikers exemplify on a daily basis. They are the everyday champions that make results like the fourth quarter possible. Thank you.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Burt to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nBurt W. Podbere\n\nCFO, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a quick reminder, unless otherwise noted, all numbers, except revenue mentioned during my remarks today, are non-GAAP.\nBefore we get started, I will note that the results we are reporting today include the acquisition of SecureCircle, which was de minimis to both revenue and ARR, contributing less than $1 million in Q4 ARR. The acquisition of SecureCircle resulted in the addition of 26 net new customers in the quarter.\nWe once again delivered exceptional results to top off a phenomenal year. We finished the year with over $1.73 billion in ending ARR. And in fiscal year 2022, we delivered 65% ARR growth, 66% total revenue growth, 215% operating income growth, 157% net income growth and record free cash flow of $442 million or 30% of revenue. This is the second year in a row CrowdStrike delivered 30% or better free cash flow margin, which is in line with our target model.\nImportantly, we accomplished these results while also aggressively investing in the business and expanding our remarkable team by 46%. We believe our strong performance highlights that in addition to our clear and defined mission and our cloud-native architecture, our business fundamentals possess the hallmark characteristics of SaaS leaders that have transformed and come to dominate their respective markets, including rapid growth at an ever-increasing scale, best-in-class gross retention rates, enduring market dynamics and a growing leadership position as well as a highly leverageable model with the ability to deliver phenomenal free cash flow. As we continue to capitalize on our unique market position, I firmly believe CrowdStrike's best days are ahead.\nNow moving to the fourth quarter. Net new ARR growth accelerated for the second consecutive quarter. Demand in the quarter was broad-based, fueled by strength in multiple areas of the business and reflects continued strong customer adoption of our core products. Growing success with our newer product initiatives including identity protection, log management and cloud, record expansion business and continued rapid new customer acquisition.\nNet new ARR grew 52% to reach a new all-time high of $216.9 million. The composition of net new ARR was very well balanced across deal size, even though 2 large accounts contributed approximately 8 figures each to net new ARR this quarter. We believe this represents our continued leadership in the enterprise segment, expanding deal sizes and the pricing leverage attributable to our distinct product differentiation. Our dollar-based net retention rate was once again above our benchmark. We continue to be very pleased with the success of our land and expand strategy.\nOur gross retention rate remains high and best-in-class at 98.1% at year-end. Our dollar-based net retention rate was above the 120% benchmark throughout the year. Net retention was 123.9% as of the end of FY '22, which is essentially a similar level to last year but on a much bigger base.\nFor the interim FY '22 quarters, net retention was 121.8% in Q3, 120.4% in Q2 and 123.4% in Q1. Our professional services organization is a strong lead generation engine for the Falcon platform. Among organizations who first become a customer after February 1, 2020, for each $1 spent by those customers on their initial engagement for our incident response or proactive services. As of January 31, 2022, we derived an average of $5.71 in ARR for those subscription contracts, up from $5.51 reported last year.\nMoving to the P&L. Total revenue grew 63% over Q4 of last year to reach $431.0 million. Subscription revenue grew 66% over Q4 of last year to reach $405.4 million. Professional services revenue was $25.6 million, setting a new record for the sixth consecutive quarter and representing 26% year-over-year growth.\nFourth quarter total and subscription non-GAAP gross margins remained relatively consistent at 77% and 79%, respectively. We continue to be pleased with our strong subscription gross margin performance as we continue to invest for growing demand.\nTotal non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately $250.8 million or 58% of revenue versus $170.3 million last year or 64% of revenue.\nIn Q4, we ended with a magic number of 1.3 as we continue to ramp investments to capture more of the market opportunity at hand and expand globally. Our continued exceptional unit economics speaks to the efficiency of our go-to-market engine and our ability to rapidly onboard and support customers of all sizes.\nWe also believe that a magic number of 1.3 continues to indicate that we should increase investments even more given the massive market opportunity. The leverage we generated this year demonstrates the efficiency in our model and enables us to step up investments in new technologies, new international geographies and other marketing programs as well as continue to hire aggressively. We believe the investments we are making today will lead to sustained growth over the long term and maintain our pole position as the trusted security partner of choice.\nFourth quarter non-GAAP operating income more than doubled growing 134% year-over-year to reach a record $80.4 million, and operating margin improved approximately 6 percentage points over Q4 of last year to reach 19%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike in Q4 also more than doubled, growing to a record $70.4 million or $0.30 on a diluted per share basis. Our weighted average common shares used to calculate fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS attributable to CrowdStrike was on a diluted basis and totaled approximately 238 million shares.\nWe ended the fourth quarter with a strong balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately $2 billion and reflects the $61 million cash payment, net of cash acquired for the acquisition of SecureCircle and the approximately $70 million cash payment for IP transfer tax related to the acquisition of Humio.\nCash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was a record $159.7 million, and free cash flow grew to a new record of $127.3 million or 30% of revenue. Excluding the approximately $70 million IP transfer tax payment related to the acquisition of Humio, free cash flow would have been approximately $197 million or 46% of revenue for Q4 and $512 million or 35% of revenue for the fiscal year.\nBefore we move to guidance, I'd like to cover a few modeling notes. First, I would like to note that we have entered the quarter with the strongest pipeline ever for Q1. While we do not specifically guide to ending or net new ARR, given the incredible performance of Q4, which included 2 accounts that contributed approximately 8 figures each to net new ARR, I'd like to provide a framework for how to think about net new ARR for Q1. As you may recall, last year, we significantly overperformed in Q1, and it was not indicative of typical seasonality. Consistent with years prior to that, 11% to 13% sequential seasonality was more typical for net new ARR, which we would expect this Q1 after adjusting for the 2 large contributors in Q4, and this is implied in our revenue guidance.\nSecond, as we continue to invest for future growth and scale and invest to remain ahead of any potential supply chain delays, we expect capital expenditures as a percent of revenue to be between 10% and 12% in fiscal year 2023. We anticipate these investments will be more weighted to the first half of the year than the second. At the same time, we are planning to maintain free cash flow margin at 30% of revenue for the year, weighted more towards the second half.\nMoving to our guidance. We are starting the new year with a robust pipeline, and we remain optimistic about the demand for our offerings and the powerful secular trends fueling our growth.\nFor the first quarter of FY '23, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $458.9 million to $465.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 52% to 54% with subscription revenue being the dominant driver of growth. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $61.7 million to $66.4 million and non-GAAP net income attributable to Crowdstrike to be in the range of $52 million to $56.7 million.\nWe expect diluted non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24, utilizing a weighted average share count of 240 million shares on a diluted basis. For the full fiscal year 2023, we currently expect total revenue to be in the range of $2,133.1 million to $2,163.2 million, reflecting a growth rate of 47% to 49% over the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP income from operations is expected to be between $289.2 million and $311.8 million.\nWe expect fiscal 2023 non-GAAP net income attributable to CrowdStrike to be between $251.1 million and $273.6 million. Utilizing 243 million weighted average shares on a diluted basis, we expect non-GAAP net income per share attributable to CrowdStrike to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.13. We look forward to sharing additional details about our business on our next investor webinar scheduled for April 7.\nGeorge and I will now take your questions.",

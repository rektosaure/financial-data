[Operator Instructions] Please be advised this call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Eric Hill, Vice President of Investor Relations for opening remarks and introductions. Mr. Hill, please go ahead.\n\nEric Hill\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's quarterly earnings call. With me today are Kelly Ortberg, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Malave, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This quarter's webcast, earnings release and presentation, which include relevant disclosures and non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website.\nToday's discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. We including the ones described in our SEC filings. As always, we will leave time at the end of the call for analyst questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Kelly Ortberg.\n\nRobert K. Ortberg\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Rockwell Collins, Inc.\n\nThanks, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'd like to take a moment to welcome our new CFO, Jay Malave. It's been great to have Jay on board and officially welcome him to his first quarterly earnings call for Boeing.\nSo now let's take a closer look at our business as we enter the final quarter of the year. Our sustained focus on safety and quality is driving better performance across the enterprise, and we are reearning the trust of our stakeholders, including customers, regulators and employees. Our focus on culture change continues to energize our teams and improve how we work together. By August of this year, we have delivered more commercial airplanes than all of last year. Our defense business is well positioned in the current geopolitical environment, and our service business continues to deliver in a robust aftermarket. Across all of our market segments, we continue to see strong demand, which is reflected in our growing backlog. We marked important milestones in our recovery as the operations generated positive free cash flow in the quarter for the first time since 2023. And earlier this month, we jointly agreed with the FAA to increase 737 production to 42 airplanes per month.\nWhile returning the corner, we're well aware of the work ahead of us to fully recover our performance, particularly on our commercial development and certification programs. We'll talk more about our status but I want to emphasize that we're exploring every lever to deliver better performance on all of our programs. Now turning to the businesses. Let me start with Boeing Commercial Airplanes. We're making meaningful progress in line with our safety and quality plan and our investments here continue to improve the health of our factories. Notably, we've seen 75% reduction in traveled work on our 737 and and a reduction of 60% across all airplane programs. Supported by greater stability, we successfully ramped up the 737 production to 38 airplanes per month as we had planned. We then focused on enablers such as improved quality, training and workplace coaches to help stabilize at that rate and demonstrate that all of our key performance indicators are healthy. Once we are satisfied with the sustained health and stability of the production system, we then presented our disciplined plan to the FAA to increase production to 42 airplanes a month.\nWe continue to be guided by our safety and quality plan and we'll monitor our performance against these 6 KPIs as we methodically move to higher rates. As a reminder, we expect rate increases beyond 42 per month will go in increments of 5. And while rate increased breaks won't be earlier than 6 months apart, we will remain disciplined and we won't move to higher rates until we achieve stability and readiness. Also in the quarter, the FAA announced it will allow delegation to Boeing to issue airworthiness certificates for some 737 MAX and 787 airplanes. Our team continues to work under the oversight of the FAA in building safe, high-quality commercial airplanes that comply with all airworthiness certification requirements, and we appreciate the FAA's confidence in Boeing and earning limited delegation authority is a responsibility we take very seriously. On the 787, the team is performing well, and the program continues to work towards demonstrating stability at rate 7.\nAs we previously shared, we'll be guided by our KPIs before we transition to planned higher rates and aim to move to 8 per month in the near future, having recently completed a successful rate Capstone review with the FAA. At the same time, we're investing in the expansion of our South Carolina site to ensure we're prepared to meet exceptional market demand, and we look forward to an exciting future for the 787 program. Turning now to our development programs. On 777X, as we announced earlier this morning, we have delayed our expectations for certification and first delivery, resulting in a $4.9 billion noncash charge during the quarter. As we've previously said in the third quarter, completion of our certification program is taking longer than expected. We have worked to understand the implications to our go-forward plan and now we anticipate first delivery of the 777-9 will occur in 2027. Jay will provide further details on this in his prepared remarks. We've accumulated more than 4,000 flight hours, more than double a typical flight test program. And so far, there are no major technical issues on the airplane or on the engine.\nIn the quarter, we completed critical testing of the airplanes brakes, engines, takeoff performance and aerodynamic performance. However, we still have a significant portion of the slight test certification program to go and our team is executing plans to complete this certification as part of the schedule we shared today. The airplane in the engine are performing well Demand for the airplane remains strong, and we remain confident that the 777X will be the next flagship airplane for our global customers. This is obviously a disappointment, but we just need more time to complete the certification process. With this charge, we now have a higher confidence that we'll complete the certification within the financial estimate. Other news on the 737-7 and 10 programs. With more than 3,000 hours of lab testing and analysis, we now have a final depth of design changes to permanently address the engine anti-ice issue. This effort remains on the critical path, and we're now following the lead of the FAA as we work to certify the suite of design updates.\nAs we previously shared, we anticipate certification for the 737-7 and the -10 to happen in 2026. Looking now at our defense business. We continue our active management approach, and we're making progress to derisk our development programs. We again demonstrated stability on our EACs in the quarter, and our BDS team is working hard every day to earn trust of our customers. We also continue to proactively engage with our customers and suppliers. In many cases, we've been able to revise contract baselines to lower execution risk and create win-win outcomes for the customer and for Boeing. We still have work to get these programs through the development phase. And as I've said before, you're never done until you're done, but we clearly are making progress. In the quarter, BDS had several notable milestones, including delivery of the 100th KC-46 tanker across our combined U.S. Air Force and global customer base. We're proud our platform continues to provide unique value and capability to our customers. We also secured key contract awards in the quarter.\nThe U.S. Space Force awarded Boeing a $2.8 billion contract for the Evolved Strategic Satcom program, solidifying our position as a leader in the national security space. More recently, we signed multiyear contracts valued at $2.7 billion to produce additional PAC-3 seekers, leveraging the advanced investments we've made to ramp up quickly and meet the demand. In St. Louis, we are executing our contingency plan as our IAM representative workforce remains on strike. While of course, we prefer not to be in this position, the team continues to work in support of our customers. We are building JDAMs without IAM workforce at about the same production rate as before the work stoppage and the team is progressing on our MQ-25 and T7 development programs. We'll continue to manage through this with focus on supporting our customers.\nNow moving on to Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter, delivering exceptional performance for our company as they support our defense and commercial customers. The U.S. Navy awarded Boeing contracts totaling more than $400 million for the repair of the F-18 landing gear and outer wing panels. We're still on track to close the sale of Jefferson and the other portions of our digital business later in this quarter. At the same time, BGS team continues to secure deals for the digital capabilities that we'll retain related to fleet maintenance, operations and repair. A good example, we recently announced an agreement with Eva Air that includes digital diagnostic tools and advanced analytics to improve efficiency and maintenance operations. Now lastly, I'll share another update on our company's culture change. This remains a topic of interest and conversations with many of our stakeholders. I'm pleased with how the employees have embraced culture change. You'll recall that we use feedback and direct employee input to help shape our new values and behaviors earlier this year. Since then, as I've traveled around the company, I'm excited to see how many teams are using the values and behaviors to effect change in their daily work.\nFor example, I have come across production teams that are using their daily tier meetings to call out which values and behaviors help them work better with each other. And during my recent visits in Miami and are some of our global sites, teams told me how championing our values around safety and quality is strengthening our relationships with our customers. I'm confident that with our new values, behaviors and the processes we're putting in place with performance management, leadership development and new training opportunities will continue to see positive culture change. Before we close out the year, we're also going to do another voice of employee survey like we did back in February. We'll get a feel for how we're doing on the culture change and get feedback on the areas that are working and where we still need to improve. All this work is going to take time to really take hold. And while I don't expect overnight improvement, we'll continue to listen to our people and use the values and behaviors.\nNow before I finish my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our employees for their dedication to safety and quality and enabling another quarter of improved performance. While we're all disappointed with the 777X delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making. Our customers are giving us great feedback on the quality and delivery performance. We're increasing production rates. We turned cash positive in the quarter, and we're winning in the market. We're well positioned to build on the momentum, delivering on our more than $600 billion backlog and restore Boeing to the company, we all know it can be. Now let me hand it over to Jay to further discuss our operating results. Jay?\n\nJesus Malave\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that it has been an honor to join Boeing at such an important time in the company's history, and I'd like to thank the team here for the warm welcome these last few months. Throughout my career, I've always been impressed with Boeing's people, products and services and iconic legacy. I'm very excited to partner with Kelly in support of our continued recovery and delivering for our global customers and stakeholders. Boeing is in a much stronger position than it was a year ago, and it's my job to help Kelly and the leadership team build on that progress. I'd also like to thank Brian West for his role in getting us to where we are and for his support throughout this transition. Now let's start with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was up 30% to $23.3 billion, primarily driven by improved operational performance across the business. including higher commercial deliveries and defense volume. The core loss per share of $7.47 primarily reflects the $6.45 impact of the $4.9 billion charge on the 777X program. which I'll discuss in more detail shortly.\nFree cash flow was positive $238 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher commercial deliveries and working capital that improved compared to both the prior year and the prior quarter. Importantly, this was the first positive free cash flow quarter since the fourth quarter of 2023 and serves as an important progress point in our company's recovery. These free cash flow results were better than expectations in July, driven by higher commercial deliveries as well as the potential DOJ payment shifting to the fourth quarter. Turning to BCA on the next page. BCA delivered 160 airplanes in the quarter, the highest quarterly delivery total since 2018. Revenue was up nearly 50% to $11.1 billion primarily reflecting higher deliveries compared to last year. Operating margin of negative 48.3% was impacted by the charge on the 777X program. BCA booked 161 net orders in the quarter, including 50787 airplanes for Turkish Airlines and 30 737-8 airplanes for the Norwegian group. Backlog in the quarter ended at $535 billion and includes more than 5,900 airplanes with the 737 and 787 both sold firm into the next decade.\nNow let's click down to the commercial programs. The 737 program delivered 121 airplanes in the quarter, including 41 in September. On production, the factory stabilized at 38 per month in the quarter. Importantly, we jointly agreed with the FAA in October to increase to 42 per month and the program is now focused on continuing to drive a stable production system as they transition to this new rate. Spirit continues to deliver fuselages with improved quality and flow, which sets us up well for both our future production ramp and the planned reintegration. That transaction is still expected to close this year. The quarter ended with approximately 5 737-8 built prior to 2023, down 15% from the second quarter. Importantly, we completed the rework on the last of these airplanes and shut down the shadow factory in the third quarter. On the -7 and -10, inventory levels were stable at approximately 35 airplanes. As Kelly said, we have made good progress on the suite of engine anti ICE design updates over the past few months and continue to work with the FAA on the certification path for these programs.\nOn the 787, we delivered 24 airplanes in the third quarter and ended with approximately 10787 airplanes in inventory that were built prior to 2023, down 5 from last quarter. We still expect to deliver these airplanes through 2026, which is aligned with our customers' fleet planning requirements. Finally, on 777X, during the quarter, we recorded a $4.9 billion loss provision net of a cost-based extension benefit to reset the development and production schedule on the program with first delivery now expected in 2027 versus the prior expectation of 2026. To provide more background and color. We received approval to begin the second phase of certification flight testing in early 2025 and had anticipated authorization to start the next major phase of certification play testing in the third quarter. However, this authorization has been delayed as Boeing and the FAA work through the supporting analysis that enables the next phase of certification flight testing. Given this delay and our assessment of the time line to enter future certification phases, we have shifted a flight test and production schedules to reflect these learnings. We now expect the next major phase to start later this year or early 2026.\nThe certification program delay, coupled with our reassessment of production costs constitute the basis of the incremental loss provision this quarter. The charge amount includes additional customer concessions, the cost of incremental rework on build aircraft, learning curve adjustments and the carrying cost of production operations spread out over a longer period of time. On a comparable basis to last year's total charges on the program, the costs are higher due to rework on build aircraft, incremental production disruption and learning curve adjustments. As far as the cash profile, we see 2 impacts. The first is related to delivery timing, where we expect headwinds of about $2 billion in 2026 as deliveries move to the right. This converts to a tailwind later in the decade as we deliver delay units. Second, the cash roll off of the $4.9 billion accounting charge is expected to be spread into the next decade. While disappointing, the reset allows us to operate to a higher confidence plan and allows our customers to manage their operations accordingly.\nAs Kelly mentioned, this confidence also stems from our completion of dry run flight tests. While we have not received certification credit with the FAA for those flights, we have obtained important verification data to support technical risk burned down. Okay. Let's shift over to BDS on the next page. BDS delivered 30 aircraft and 2 satellites in the quarter. and revenue grew 25% to $6.9 billion on improved operational performance and higher volume. Operating margin of 1.7% was up significantly compared to last year, also reflecting the better operating performance in the third quarter. These results also included immaterial impacts associated with the IAM work stoppage as we continue to execute our contingency plans. BDS booked $9 billion in order during the quarter and backlog grew to a record $76 billion. Overall, we continue to make progress stabilizing our fixed price development programs even with minor cost updates on a few programs, such as for the tanker, which absorbed additional average shared costs from the 777X update. We have seen benefits from our active management approach and retiring risk and developing win-win opportunities for both us and our customers.\nWe remain focused on delivering these important capabilities to our customers and met several important milestones in the quarter. For example, on a T-7A program, we achieved 4 additional customer milestones under the MOA and started assembly on the first production representative test aircraft. The remainder of the portfolio continues to benefit from exceptional demand supported by the global threat environment constructing our nation and allies. Performance on these programs also continue to stabilize and build on the improved operational performance that began earlier this year. Overall, the defense portfolio is well positioned for the future as evidenced by our record backlog, and we still expect the business to return to historical performance levels as we continue to drive execution and transition to new contracts with tighter underwriting standards.\nMoving to Global Services on the next page. BGS continued to perform well, again delivering strong financial results in the quarter. Revenue was up 10% to $5.4 billion, primarily reflecting improved commercial and government volume. Operating margin was 17.5% in the quarter, up 50 basis points compared to last year, unfavorable commercial volume and mix. Both our commercial and government businesses again delivered double-digit margins. The business also received $8 billion in orders with a year-to-date book-to-bill of 1.2. Okay. Shifting to cash and debt. Cash and marketable securities ended at $23 billion and the debt balance ended at $53.4 billion. The company also maintains access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. We remain committed to strengthening the balance sheet and supporting our investment-grade rating. Regarding cash flow, we still expect the fourth quarter to be positive before any impact from a potential DOJ payment. This outlook continues to assume significant capital expenditures for future products and growth, particularly in St. Louis and Charleston. This ramp-up was seen in our third quarter CapEx spend, which we now expect to be closer to $3 billion for the year.\nNet-net, even with the higher CapEx, our better-than-expected performance year-to-date supports updating our 2025 outlook to a free cash flow usage of about $2.5 billion, barring the impact of a prolonged government shutdown. Okay. Let's sum it all up. Another quarter of progress in our recovery. While the 777 reset was disappointing, our overall performance continues to trend favorably. This includes receiving limited FAA delegation to issue 737 and 787 airworthiness certificates, transitioning to higher 737 and 787 production rates delivering improved performance across the company as well as generating positive free cash flow in the quarter. Broadly speaking, the markets we serve continue to be significant in our backlog of more than $600 billion demonstrates the strength of our portfolio. Long term, these fundamentals underpin our confidence in managing the business with a long-term view built on safety, quality and delivering for our customers. With that, let's open up the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session, are being broadcast live over the Internet.\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for opening remarks and introductions. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's quarterly earnings call. With me today are Kelly Ortberg, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThis quarter's webcast, earnings release and presentation, which include relevant disclosures and non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website. Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainty, including the ones described in our SEC filings. As always, we will leave time at the end of the call for analyst questions.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kelly Ortberg.\n\nRobert K. Ortberg\n\nChairman, CEO and President, Rockwell Collins, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and thanks to everyone for joining in today's call.\nLet me start out by saying that we had a really solid quarter of performance across the business, and I'm pleased to report that our recovery plan is in full swing and showing signs that it's being effective. Albeit early, I do like what I'm seeing. In BCA, we continue to implement our safety management system and remain on schedule with our safety and quality plan that we've established with the FAA. The key performance indicators that we're using to measure our production stability continue to progress and we delivered 130 airplanes in the quarter, which was better than our internal plan. I want to remind you that we plan to ramp up conservatively so that we had some capacity to deal with unknown challenges.\nIn BDS, we had improved performance on our fixed price development programs and held our EACs for the quarter. We continue to make progress on our active management approach on the programs to improve performance and reduce our future EAC risks. And of course, winning the F-47 program was a transformational accomplishment to be selected the contractor for the world's first sixth-generation fighter is a testament to our focused investment in some pretty difficult time and to our dedicated team. This will secure our fighter franchise for decades to come. And our BGS business continued to deliver strong results, and we reached a milestone event by delivering our 100th 767 freighter conversion.\nSo let me dig a little deeper into our 4-point plan for our recovery. Recall from previous calls that I highlighted 4 key areas: the first, stabilizing our business; second, improving the development program execution; third, changing our culture; and fourth, building our new future.\nSo for stabilizing our business, our balance sheet has been an important focus. The equity raise at the end of last year was sized to provide us the ability to restore our production system to help. With the better-than-expected delivery performance, we naturally had less drain on cash in the first quarter so we continue to be on solid footing here.\nAs we announced yesterday, the expected divestiture of portions of our digital aviation solutions business will also provide a significant cash infusion. The key to cash generation will be continued progress on the 737 MAX ramp. We are currently producing in the low 30s per month and expect that we'll get to the 38 per month cap over the next few months. We'll ensure that the KPIs are showing a stable production system and then request an increase to 42 per month with the FAA later this year. We've stayed very close to the new Department of Transportation and FAA leadership, and we remain aligned on the criteria to move to the next rate.\nIf you look back before the strike last fall, we've seen about a 50% reduction in traveled work and a 25% reduction in rework hours on the 737 line. So the changes we've made to strengthen our quality system are delivering results.\nEven more importantly, almost every customer I talk with report an improvement to the quality of the airplanes. On 787, we continue to produce at 5 per month, and I'm pleased to report that we've completed the work on the last joint verification airplane in Everett, which now allows us to close our shadow factory and redeploy the people and facilities dedicated to that work. We're poised to move to 7 per month this year, provided our KPIs indicate a stable production system, and they're currently looking very good.\nAs we highlighted last quarter, we continue to work through seat certification issues affecting some deliveries, and I expect this will be a challenge for us for the balance of the year. With the current cash balance and the production ramp status, I feel we are well on our way to stabilizing the business even in the face of the tariff situation, which I'll address in a moment.\nNow let me switch to the next priority, which is improving the development program execution. As I mentioned, a quarter with EAC stability in defense is a good start, but our efforts run deeper than that. During the last quarter, I mentioned that we had reached an MOA with the customer on the T-7 program, for which we termed [ active management ] . And we've since completed our first 2 incentive milestones associated with that agreement.\nOn VC-25B, we continue to work with the customer to revise the program plan to allow for an earlier first delivery while maintaining our focus on safety and quality. And we recently transferred our MQ-25 aircraft to our new production facility in Illinois to begin final assembly, which is the last production step before we move to ground and flight test later this year. And this next quarter will be an important one for us as we begin to baseline the performance of our F-47 plan.\nOn commercial development programs, we reached authorization from the FAA to expand the 777X flight test activities to include additional aerodynamics, brakes and engines. The aircraft are flying daily and performing well in flight testing. Along with the 777X, the 737-7 and the 737-10 continue with their certification programs and there is no change to our previously shared certification time line on any of the commercial programs. So while there's still a tremendous amount of work to do across all of our development programs, I am seeing an improved sense of urgency around the baseline management and risk management on these programs.\nNow the third area of focus is changing the culture at Boeing, and we've made some good progress there as well. In the quarter, we had a series of employee meetings talking specifically about culture change. We formed an enterprise working group to help us refresh our values and behaviors. And we've recently completed an all-employee survey, the first in 5 years and got very constructive feedback on what's needed to improve the future of our company. We've introduced the new values and behaviors to the entire organization, and we'll be incorporating those into our new performance management system, our leadership training and leadership selection criteria. Our people are passionate about the culture change, so I really want to seize the moment to make the necessary changes within the company.\nNow the last area to discuss is building our future. The planned divestiture of portions of our digital aviation solutions business is an example of the portfolio streamlining that I highlighted on earlier calls. There are a couple more steps that we are considering in this regard to help us keep focus on the right products and capabilities for Boeing's future. And obviously, the F-47 win is a key step for building our future, cementing our franchise in the fighter business.\nSo that brings me to the current tariff environment and the impact to our plan. I would break this down into 2 categories: input tariffs that affect our cost to manufacture our products and then the potential impact of retaliatory tariffs like those we are seeing in China. Brian will walk you through the financials, but the input tariffs incurred in the first quarter were immaterial, and we really didn't see any impact to deliveries in the first quarter.\nMuch of our supply chain is based in the United States, and many of our imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt under the USMCA agreement. We do have suppliers in countries subject to the new U.S. tariffs, most notably in Japan and Italy, where our suppliers do significant structures work on our wide-body airplanes. We are currently paying the 10% tariff on those components, but we should recover tariff costs for those aircraft that are subsequently exported which is a large portion of our widebodies. I hope over time that these tariffs can be resolved through negotiated agreements, but until that happens, we will have to manage our way through these increased input costs.\nThe other issue is impact of potential retaliatory tariffs from other countries, which could affect our ability to deliver aircraft. The only region that we have an issue with aircraft delivery today is China, and due to the tariffs, many of our customers in China have indicated that they will not take delivery. Given the uncertainty, we are taking a very straightforward approach to dealing with these deliveries. We have approximately 50 China deliveries in our plan for the balance of the year. We're in close communication with our China customers, and we're actively assessing options for remarketing already built or in-process airplanes. And for the 9 airplanes not yet in the production system, we're engaged with our customers to understand their intentions for taking delivery and if necessary, we have the ability to assign those positions to other customers.\nIt's an unfortunate situation, but we have many customers who want near-term deliveries, so we plan to redirect the supply to the stable demand. And we're not going to continue to build aircraft for customers who will not take them. We founded our exposure and until we get more clarity, we're going to do our best to keep the China situation from impacting our production flow. We've put in place a conservative recovery plan this year, anticipating some perturbations or risk.\nSo I feel really good about our overall plan for the year even though I expect the China situation, we'll take away some of the headroom we've built with our strong first quarter deliveries at BCA. We continue to work this situation proactively with the administration, and it's clear that they understand the importance of the aerospace industry to the U.S. economy and the role that Boeing plays as a top U.S. exporter.\nSo before I wrap up my prepared remarks, I want to recognize and thank our employees for their work in the quarter. We've really had a good start to the year, and I'm glad we put a conservative plan together that will allow us to deal with the tariffs. Let me also give a special shout out to Matt Welch, who is moving on to his new role as BCA CFO, he has done a great job for us. So congratulations, and thanks, Matt, for all you've done.\nNow let me hand it over to Brian to detail the operating results before we take your questions. Brian?\n\nBrian J. West\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & Corporate Audit and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $19.5 billion, up 18%, primarily driven by higher commercial delivery volume. The core loss per share of $0.49 was a significant improvement compared to last year, driven by higher commercial deliveries and improved operational performance across the business.\nFree cash flow was a usage of $2.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting higher commercial deliveries and a working capital usage that improved compared to both the prior year and quarter. Our free cash flow was better than expectations shared last month driven by volume and favorable working capital timing. These financial results reflect only tariffs enacted as of March 31, which was not material.\nTurning to the next page, I'll cover BCA. BCA delivered 130 airplanes in the quarter. Revenue was $8.1 billion, and operating margin was minus 6.6%, primarily reflecting higher 737 and 777 deliveries as well as lower period costs. BCA booked 221 net orders in the quarter, [ including 20 ] 777-9s and 20 787-10 airplanes for Korean Air and 50 737-8 airplanes for BOCA. Backlog in the quarter ended at $460 billion, which was up more than $25 billion sequentially. This includes more than 5,600 airplanes that translate to over 7 years of production. And importantly, the 737 and 787 are sold for into the next decade.\nNow I'll give more color on the key programs. The 737 program delivered 105 airplanes in the quarter, including 33 in March. On production, the factory gradually increased rate during the quarter and monthly production was in the low 30s in March. Importantly, the operational KPIs continue to progress, and we still expect to be in a position to go to 38 per month over the next few months. Spirit continues to improve the quality and flow of fuselages, which sets us up well for the reintegration and the deal is expected to close around midyear. More broadly on the master schedule, we continue to make adjustments as needed and manage supplier by supplier based on inventory levels.\nOver the past year, our buffer inventory has grown to promote stability across our production system. As production stabilizes and rates increase over time, we plan to deliberately return buffer inventory to more normal levels. Today, we have about 30 737-8s built prior to 2023, which is down 25 from year-end and includes 25 airplanes for customers in China. We still expect to complete the rework on these airplanes and shut down the shadow factory by midyear. On the 7 and 10, inventory levels were stable at approximately 35 airplanes and certification timelines are unchanged. On the 787, we delivered 13 airplanes in the quarter generally in line with expectations outlined on our last earnings call. The program continues to stabilize production at 5 per month in the quarter, and we remain intent on demonstrating stability in the production system and supply chain prior to making the next rate increase to 7 over the next few months.\nToday, we have about 20 airplanes in inventory built prior to 2023 that required rework, down 5 from year-end. 4 of these 20 are for customers in China. Importantly, we finished the rework and shut down the shadow factory in the quarter and expected to deliver about half of the remaining airplanes this year. Finally, on the 777X, the program took another important step in its certification timeline as it received approval from the FAA to expand flight testing activities. We'll continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process and still expect first delivery in 2026. 777X inventory was up approximately $800 million in the quarter and will continue to grow as we move towards entering service as we've previously shared.\nMoving on to the next page, in BDS. BDS booked $4 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog ended at $62 billion. Importantly, in the quarter, BDS was selected by the U.S. Air Force to design, build and deliver its next-generation fighter aircraft, the F-47. This order was not included in our first quarter backlog, pending the completion of the source selection and evaluation review process. Revenue was $6.3 billion, down 9% on planned lower volume, including the impact from commercial derivatives associated with the production restart. BDS delivered 26 aircraft in the quarter.\nOperating margin was plus 2.5%, up 30 basis points compared to last year and reflected stabilizing operational performance in the quarter. We made important progress in 1Q and the game plan is to get BDS back to high single-digit margins over time. Our core business remains solid, representing approximately 60% of our revenue and performing in the mid- to high single-digit margin range. The demand for these products remains very strong. supported by the threat environment confronting our nation and our allies. The roughly 25% of the portfolio is primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs, operational performance improved in the quarter. which drove favorable margin trends.\nLastly, on our fixed price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue, we continue to work to stabilize and mature these programs. This quarter's results reflected stabilizing operational performance, and we remain focused on retiring risk each quarter and ultimately delivering these mission-critical capabilities to our customers.\nDuring the quarter, the MQ-25 program successfully transported the first engineering development model aircraft to the new production facility in Illinois, where it began final assembly, the last production step before ground and flight testing begin later this year. On the T-7A, we achieved the first 2 EMD performance milestones outlined in the MOA that was finalized with the U.S. Air Force in January. This continues to be an important example of how we are working with our customers to find better overall outcomes for both parties.\nOverall, the defense portfolio is well positioned for the future. and we still expect the business to return to historical performance levels as we continue to stabilize production, execute our development programs and transition to new contracts with tighter underwriting standards.\nMoving on to the next page, in BGS. BGS continued to perform well, delivering very strong financial results in the quarter. The business received $5 billion in orders and the backlog ended at $22 billion. Revenue was $5.1 billion, stable year-over-year. Operating margin was 18.6% in the quarter, up 40 basis points compared to last year on favorable performance and mix with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins.\nIn the quarter, BGS delivered the 100th 767-300 Boeing converted freighter to SF Airlines and received a modification contract from the U.S. Air Force to integrate electronic warfare systems for the F-15 Eagle. It remains a terrific long-term franchise focused on profitable, capital-efficient service offerings and continues to execute very well.\nTurning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. Cash and marketable securities ended at $23.7 billion, primarily reflecting the free cash flow usage in the quarter. Debt balance ended at $53.6 billion, down $300 million due to the paydown of maturing debt and leaving $550 million of debt maturities remaining in the year. The company maintains access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. We remain committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner with 2 main objectives: first, prioritize the investment-grade rating; and second, allow the factory and supply chain to stabilize. As you saw yesterday, we entered into an agreement to sell portions of our digital aviation solutions business for $10.55 billion, which is an important component of our strategy to focus on our core businesses and strengthen the balance sheet.\nStepping back, let me provide some additional context on the macro backdrop before getting into the free cash flow outlook. We continue to closely monitor recent policy developments and believe that the administration understands the aerospace industry's importance to our economy broadly and U.S. manufacturing jobs specifically and is focused on keeping our U.S. industrial base globally competitive for the long term. Given our position as a significant U.S. exporter, free trade policy across commercial aerospace remains very important to us. As noted recently on the supply side, roughly 80% of our annual commercial supply chain spend goes directly to U.S.-based suppliers, and we'll work closely with all our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and pursue options to mitigate cost pressures.\nConversely, on the demand side, about 70% of our commercial deliveries this year are planned for customers outside the U.S. And importantly, the company has a large and diverse backlog of over $0.5 trillion with our key commercial programs sold out into the next decade. Specifically on China, it represents approximately 10% of our commercial backlog, and if we need to redirect supply to more stable demand, a strong market backdrop across the rest of the world still supports our planned production rate increases.\nRegarding free cash flow. We set a conservative plan for the year and had a strong start operationally, which we believe puts us in a position to largely offset any potential cash flow impact of China deliveries this year as well as higher expected input costs due to tariffs. Regarding deliveries, our plan for the rest of the year was to deliver roughly 50 airplanes to customers in China. There is strong demand for these airplanes, and we are actively assessing options should we need to redirect the 41 China airplanes that are already built or currently in production. We will continue to monitor the demand situation and if tariff-related impacts expand beyond China, we would expect to see additional pressure.\nBroadly, the markets we serve continue to be significant, and our backlog of more than $0.5 trillion demonstrates the strength of our core product portfolio. Long term, these fundamentals underpin our confidence in managing the business with a long-term view built on safety, quality and delivering for our customers.\nAnd before I open it up for questions, I too would like to thank Matt Welch for his partnership over almost 4 years, and we all knew they weren't easy 4 years. He's a terrific Boeing leader and we wish him all the best in his new promotion, and we welcome Eric Hill [ in his IR ] role.\nWith that, I'll open up for questions."

    "content": "Full Year 2024 BAE Systems PLC Earnings Call\n\nFull Year 2024 BAE Systems PLC Earnings Call\n\nBA.LONDONFEB 19, 4:00 AM\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the BAE Systems 2024 Preliminary Results Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Charles Woodburn, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles Nicholas Woodburn\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm incredibly proud of the results we're reporting today and of the contributions our people have made to achieve another year of strong financial and operational performance as we continue to support our customers around the world. There are 3 areas I'd like to focus on today.\nFirst, our 2024 financial performance, where we produced strong top line and earnings growth with better-than-expected cash flow and order intake. Second, the steps we've taken to continue shaping our portfolio to higher growth, technology-focused and strategically important domains such as space, drones, counter-drones and electronic warfare. And third, confidence in our outlook, which is driven by our record backlog, reflecting the sustainability of our value compounding business model.\nTaking a look at the broader backdrop, spending globally has continued to strengthen since this time last year, reflecting the elevated threat environment. Our programs and technologies across the group, including our electronic warfare and space capabilities, precision strike and tactical systems, AI, ARCUS and the Global Combat Air Program, or GCAP, are delivering for our customers today and helping shape the future of defense capabilities. At the same time, we are improving the efficiency and agility of our own operations to succeed in an environment in which many of our government customers are seeking greater efficiency and affordability.\nIn the U.S., we remain closely aligned to the U.S. national defense strategy, which is largely focused on the Asia Pacific threat environment, and we look forward to working with the new administration.\nIn the U.K., the ongoing strategic defense review is set to conclude in the near future. The government has already signaled its intent to increase defense spending, and we expect that our major U.K. programs, including submarines, Type 26 frigates, GCAP and others will continue to be well supported.\nElsewhere in the world, there is upward pressure on NATO defense budgets with discussions about increasing the 2% target in the years ahead. We also expect Australia, Japan and countries in the Middle East to significantly increase their spending on defense in the coming years. So our growth opportunities are significant, and we remain focused on consistently executing our long-term strategy to deliver top line growth, margin expansion and solid cash generation. Our strong 2024 results continue the momentum we've built over successive years of solid financial and operational performance.\nDemand for our products remained strong as reflected by our GBP 34 billion order intake, which propelled our total backlog to a new record of GBP 78 billion. This visibility supports our confidence in the growth outlook over the medium term. Our relentless focus on operational performance has enabled us to consistently convert our large order backlog into strong sales growth.\nWe set a new record in 2024 of GBP 28.3 billion in sales, together with sustained margins and excellent cash flow, which was boosted by several advanced payments on new contracts towards the end of the year. In 2025, we expect a similar organic growth trajectory, which Brad will cover in more detail. It's worth restating that our current order backlog is largely driven by our incumbent positions on existing long-term programs. It's widely understood that even when hostilities in Ukraine end, the threat environment in Europe, the Asia Pacific and the Middle East will remain elevated as well the need to replenish inventories.\nIn 2024, we maintained a strong balance sheet, enabling the same disciplined capital allocation approach that we've taken for the past several years, and we expect to continue in 2025.\nOur financial results and continued confidence in the outlook mean we're announcing a proposed final dividend of 20.6p per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 33p. The a 10% increase on last year and continuing our track record of over 20 years of consecutive dividend growth.\nOur order intake has significantly exceeded our sales over the past 3 years with 2024s order flow driving our backlog to the new GBP 78 billion record. Our sustained positions on our major long-term programs and expansion in space and drone capabilities, coupled with further progress on AUKUS and GCAP have all added to our medium-term outlook. As a reminder, our combined order backlog and pipeline of opportunities from our positions on those long-term programs provides exceptional visibility of our medium-term sales growth.\nLooking more closely at our backlog and the global nature of our business, you can see we are positioned for this year and in the years ahead. This chart shows that many of our short- and medium-term growth drivers are already in our backlog and we also benefit from incumbent positions on long-term programs, some of which are expected to endure for multiple decades.\nThere is also ample scope for us to win new opportunities in these established lines of business. Our focus on agility, efficiency and innovation mean there should be more opportunities in the defense technology space, well suited for our innovation centers in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia. With that in mind, I want to highlight some of the investments we're making in technology. We regularly engage with our customers to understand and anticipate their evolving requirements so that the capabilities we're developing are relevant now and will be critical in the future.\nTo fuel our innovations, we are continuing to increase our self-funded R&D, up 30% in 2024, focused on areas such as space, air and subsea autonomous systems, counter-drone and quantum devices. In addition, we have carefully deployed capital to fund accretive acquisitions to evolve our portfolio and position ourselves as a leader in the markets of the future. Chief among them was the Ball Aerospace acquisition, which significantly expanded our presence in space. We also made smaller acquisitions of Malloy, Callen-Lenz and Kirintech, strengthening our drone and counter-drone capabilities. Bringing products forward from concept to deployment at pace has never been so important. This is one of the key lessons of the Ukraine conflict and is critical to addressing the increasingly complex threat environment. That's why we're investing in solutions that save time and costs, while enabling greater agility for our business and our customers. This includes using digital transformation and advanced manufacturing techniques, as we evolve the way we design, develop, manufacture, test and upgrade our products and systems to meet this challenge.\nI'll wrap up by saying 2024 was another excellent year for the company. We made significant progress on 2 multinational strategic collaborations, AUKUS and GCAP. Early stage design work on SSN-AUKUS is underway in the U.K. And in Australia, we were selected alongside ASC to deliver the country's new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.\nOn GCAP, we reached agreement with our international partners in Japan and Italy to form a new joint venture. And we completed the Ball Aerospace acquisition 1 year ago to form our new Space & Mission Systems business. This progress was made while we continue to invest in the business through increased levels of CapEx and to ensure we can execute our backlog with efficiency and develop a portfolio of cutting-edge technology. None of this will be possible without the amazing people who carry out the immense responsibilities of our mission to protect those who protect us.\nIn 2024, we welcomed a large number of new employees to our team, including 5,200 people who joined us with the Ball Aerospace acquisition. Their collective knowledge, talent and skills are already benefiting the company, and we're delighted to have them as part of the BAE Systems family.\nOn that note, I'll now hand it over to Tom for an update on SMS. Over to you, Tom.\n\nThomas Arnold Arseneault\n\nExecutive Director\n\nThanks, Charles. I'm happy to spend a few minutes on our Space & Mission Systems business, or SMS, which is part of our Electronic Systems Reporting segment. This is a very exciting business and our integration teams have done a great job achieving key milestones just as we planned through our first year. As we have come together, we have consistently seen that our cultures are very well aligned. We share a core belief in operating with efficiency, affordability and speed to deliver the very best capabilities to our customers. This has been instrumental in our first year, and it will also position us to achieve even more going forward.\nStarting with our 2024 performance. As we guided during our results, SMS continued to deliver for our customers and second half sales came in 10% higher than the first half. In fact, second half sales were 12% higher than the same period in 2023. The SMS end-year margin was strong at 11.7%, reflecting good underlying program performance and putting us ahead of our acquisition case.\nCash was also well aligned with our expectations and SMS backlog rose to $3.7 billion, up 25% over year-end 2023. With the transition year behind us, this strong backlog provides excellent visibility into our future sales growth. Overall, integration is proceeding very well. The bulk of business systems, including compensation, benefits, finance and IT operations transitioned as planned in September of last year. As expected, supply chain integration has been a key driver of cost synergies along with numerous efficiencies achieved through our combined systems and operations. The collaborative work of the 2 businesses, supply chain teams has ensured a smooth transition of services, suppliers and customers. The resulting synergies are driven by increased spend volume and efficiency gains has confirmed our assumptions, and I'm really pleased with the progress in this area. As a result, we remain well on track to achieve our near-term objective of $30 million per year.\nIn addition to cost synergies, we are also excited about opportunities to grow our top line over time. Since we announced the acquisition of Ball Aerospace, the teams have been working to bring our collective strengths to bear to address our customers' highest priorities in the most efficient and affordable manner possible. Our top line revenue work streams have focused on opportunities in space, electronic warfare, C&I and superbusis. We're finding interesting way to combine existing electronic systems, technologies and payloads, with SMS Mission Systems to position us for roles neither business would have pursued along.\nThe recently announced U.S. Iron Dome initiative will likely yield such opportunities, as it will leverage space-based and precision technologies core to our sector strengths. Our positions on programs like FAD and our technology offerings in advanced communications, sensors and space-qualified electronics place us well for promising opportunities such as this. We just marked our first year of operations with Space & Mission Systems. As I reflect on our performance, I am extremely proud of how well the teams have worked to become one seamless and efficient organization and to create a foundation for sustained growth.\nOver to you, Brad.\n\nBradley Madsen Greve\n\nCFO & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Tom. Before I get into the results and outlook, I'd like to thank our teams across the company who produced the strong numbers I'm about to present. The results reflect a familiar picture of a business that continues to grow by adding value for our customers and delivering strong returns for our shareholders.\nOur backlog is the driver for continued growth and strong visibility. And as you can see, this closed at a record GBP 78 billion on the back of another strong year of order intake.\nOur sales rose by 14%, taking our 3-year compound annual growth to 10% over that period. Underlying EBIT grew by 14%, exceeding the GBP 3 billion mark for the first time. Over the last 3 years, EBIT has grown more than 10% annually. We delivered GBP 2.5 billion of free cash flow in 2024 on the back of strong operating cash conversion and customer advances received late in the year. This number is net of GBP 1 billion of CapEx as we continue to invest in our business to support the growth embedded in our order backlog and pipeline.\nWe returned GBP 1.5 billion to shareholders with a proposed 10% increase in the dividend, along with continued share repurchases. All of this means we ended the year with records for order backlog, sales, underlying EBIT, EPS and dividend, and we are well positioned for this operating and financial rhythm to carry on into 2025 and across the medium term.\nIn the slides that follow, I will take you through some more of the details on the key metrics before moving to guidance and capital allocation. Order intake for the year was GBP 34 billion, expanding our backlog by 11% to a record GBP 78 billion, including the GBP 3 billion from SMS. Notable contract awards were booked for our space business CV90s, Air Defense for Eastern Europe with MBDA, Typhoons for Italy and Spain and the 3 ship order for Australia's Hunter class program.\nSales of GBP 28.3 billion increased by 14%, including the results of SMS. Excluding the impact of all M&A in the year, the organic growth rate was 9%. Our Electronic Systems sector, including SMS, increased by 35% to GBP 7.2 billion with an organic growth rate of 9%. As Tom mentioned earlier, SMS achieved double-digit growth in the second half of the year and is positioned for double-digit growth in 2025. ES also had strong growth in precision strike and sensing, which was at 33%.\nPlatforms & Services sales grew by 15% to GBP 4.4 billion with our U.S. combat vehicle business up 18%. Hägglunds grew by 45% on European volumes and Bofors grew at a similar pace, led by Archer sales.\nOverall, P&L delivered over 600 vehicles in 2024 compared with just over 500 in 2023. ES sector rose by 7% to GBP 8.5 billion. Activity increased in MBDA and KSA, while the GCAP program continued to ramp up. The sector also posted growth in Falcon Works, where we are rapidly expanding our portfolio of drone capabilities.\nMaritime sales grew 12% to GBP 6.2 billion. Australia sales led the way on Hunter ramp-up, while the Type 26 and the subs portfolio in the U.K. continued to add to sector growth along with munitions. The design work on the SSN-AUKUS submarine made a material contribution to sector growth, more than doubling over last year with another doubling expected over the next 2 years.\nFinally, Cyber & Intelligence sales grew by 6% to reach GBP 2.4 billion. I&S in the U.S. was up by 7%, primarily on work for the U.S. Air Force. The digital intelligence business in the U.K. was up by 4%, largely on the growth in counter-drone sales from the newly acquired Kirintec business, along with modest growth in National Security Cyber. EBIT of GBP 3.015 billion was up GBP 0.144 and the return on sales of GBP 0.106 was up by 5 basis points. Strong operational delivery and accretive benefits for recent acquisitions more than offset the mix from continued high growth in the maritime sector.\nThere was a 20 basis point impact from higher R&D investment, primarily in attractive margin accretive technology opportunities in Electronic Systems. The ES sector delivered 14.9% Ross, including the SMS business, which delivered a group accretive margin of 11.7%. ES expanded margin by 110 basis points to reach 10.2%, supported by full rate production volumes for AMPV as well as growth from Hägglunds and Bofors and improved operational delivery and ship repair.\nThe Air sector maintained a strong 11.8% ROS as EBIT exceeded the GBP 1 billion threshold for the first time on higher sales volume. Maritime profit was up 12%, in line with sales. And finally, Cyber & Intelligence margins of 8.3% were in line with guidance.\nThe group delivered GBP 3.1 billion of operating cash flow, significantly above our expectations with higher-than-anticipated customer advances received late in the year. We continue to allocate capital to protect and grow the business with over GBP 1 billion in capital expenditures to drive growth, improve efficiency and continue to modernize our footprint.\nNet debt ended the year at under GBP 5 billion. The business generated GBP 2.5 billion of cash flow, and we returned GBP 1.5 billion in dividends and buybacks. The outflows acquisitions of GBP 4.6 billion include the SMS transaction Malloy, Callen-Lenz and Kirintec, net of divestments. After successfully financing these acquisitions, net debt-to-EBITDA finished at a healthy 1.3, excluding leases and 1.8, including leases.\nTurning next to guidance. Building on the group continued strong growth over recent years, we once again expect to see high single-digit growth on the top line at 7% to 9% and continued margin expansion. EPS is expected to grow in line with EBIT at 8% to 10%, with a higher tax rate offset by share repurchases. Bearing in mind the acceleration of customer advances in late 2024, free cash flow should exceed GBP 1.1 billion. As a reminder, our cash guidance provides a baseline, which excludes material customer advances. With this guidance, the average annual cash flow of '24 and '25 is more than GBP 1.8 billion per year, which outpaces our previous guidance.\nWhile we do not give medium-term guidance on sales and EBIT, the backlog and pipeline that Charles outlined earlier provides strong visibility for growth and positions us well to carry on this financial rhythm into the future.\nThe strong cash delivery over the years as demonstrated here with the 2024 outturn of GBP 2.5 billion, taking the 3-year total to over GBP 7 billion for the '22 to '24 period. The significant upside versus guidance comes from peak of material customer advances. And as mentioned previously, we continue to exclude material advances from our cash guidance.\nWe are upgrading the in-flight cash guide for the 3-year period ending in 2025 with our new target seed GBP 6 billion. I'm confident that we should be generating between GBP 5 million and GBP 6 billion in subsequent 3-year period, with the variability come from customer advances.\nOur 10% sales compound annual growth rate over the last 3 years, together with the growth implied in our backlog and pipeline demonstrates that we are a growth company. Our increasing cash delivery fully supports our approach to capital allocation, which over these last several years has been very consistent. We prioritize investing in our people, our delivery infrastructure and in promising technologies.\nWe pay a dividend, which is covered around 2x by earnings and has grown significantly over the years. We are dynamic with our portfolio by acquiring high-quality assets, while divesting noncore activities and we continue to use our buyback program to deploy surplus cash. We do all of this with a balance sheet that is managed within the parameters of an investment-grade credit rating, providing us with the flexibility to execute our strategy.\nBefore finishing, I would just like to spend a few moments highlighting our capital allocation and action over the past few years as an example of what we expect to continue delivering. We will continue to prioritize investment in our talent, as demonstrated by the growth in our Skills academies and our early careers programs. Our sales per head has improved significantly over the last 5 years as our investments have contributed to more efficient workflows and modernized skill sets with more to come.\nOver this 5-year period, we have invested over GBP 2.9 billion in CapEx, modernizing facilities, improving our efficiency and building capacity for growth. Examples of these include capacity expansion for Hägglunds, robotic welding in multiple sites, a new ship lift complex in Jacksonville and the construction of a large-scale shipbuilding facility in Glasgow. These investments are giving us a more efficient infrastructure and a strong platform for growth.\nMeanwhile, our self-funded R&D has increased over the last 5 years, and we are successfully converting these investments into sales. I would point out programs such as APKWS and ES and the Tempest program in our Air sector. Others include small form factor technology in the U.S. Tag View, our AI route planning software, ILS, our AI-driven intelligence and our single synthetic training platform called [indiscernible]. These self-funded R&D programs have contributed multiple billions in sales since their launch.\nIn terms of returns to shareholders, our track record on dividends is well established after taking strong actions to derisk the pension in 2020, which is now in surplus, we complemented our dividend policy with share buybacks, reducing our share count by over 8% since program launch in 2021.\nFinally, since 2020, we have taken a more dynamic approach to our portfolio, adding high-quality assets starting with the GPS business and building up to the Essence acquisition last year. Through this acquisition program, we have sought to build capabilities, strengthen differentiation and increase our growth prospects and margin accretive areas, making a substantially positive impact to top line growth and profitability. In fact, since 2020, our acquisitions have added over GBP 3.3 billion to group sales over that time and strengthened our position in promising growth areas like space, AI and precision strike and sensing, all of which tightens our alignment to the national defense strategies of our customers.\nIn summary, our approach to capital allocation in recent years has had a strong value compounding impact on our financial returns. Looking forward, our record backlog and pipeline amounting to over 9x current sales means that our business will continue to grow, and we have created more opportunity to continue compounding value into the future.\nOver to you, Charles.\n\nCharles Nicholas Woodburn\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Brad. I'll conclude by reemphasizing that the breadth of our portfolio, together with our global geographic footprint have become competitive differentiators for us. This means that we're reliant on any single market or program to drive our sales growth. And as I mentioned earlier, the majority of our key markets are expected to increase their defense budgets in the years ahead.\nWe've taken action to shape our portfolio to support our customers in these markets. ensuring we're tightly aligned with their national defense strategies. We offer technology-focused products and services across all domains, air, land, sea, space and cyber and in critical defense technology capabilities such as space, electronic warfare, AI and quantum devices.\nIn closing, I believe we're incredibly well positioned to continue driving the positive momentum of the business into the future. Our order backlog, incumbent positions and strong new business opportunity pipeline give us the visibility and confidence that we can deliver increased sales, higher margins and strong cash performance, all amplified by our disciplined capital allocation model.\nThank you. And with that, we're ready for questions.\n\nBradley Madsen Greve\n\nCFO & Executive Director\n\nWhile you're getting ready for questions, I just wanted to touch on the dynamic events and news headlines from the last few days and likely more that will come in the following weeks. While there is a great deal of discussion right now. These paradigm and European security could drive significantly increased defense spending over the medium term. And as Europe's largest defense company, we are well placed to support our government customers as they confront these challenges.\nAnd with that, we'll now hand over to questions again."

As you will hear this morning, our 2024 interim results reflect an excellent and busy 6 months for the business. Before I go further, I want to thank our employees, trade unions and supply chain partners for all they do to ensure we deliver on our critical commitments to our customers.\nAs we walk through today's presentation, we hope to leave you with 3 clear messages. First, we have upgraded our full year guidance across all our key metrics after another 6 months of strong operational and financial delivery with high-quality earnings growth. Second, we continue to make significant strategic progress that positions us well for the future. In particular, AUKUS; the Global Combat Air Programme, or GCAP; the integration of our new U.S. space business; and the strengthening of our autonomous unmanned aircraft systems and drone capabilities. And third, we have the visibility and are delivering on our value compounding model, with the demand backdrop in the past 6 months enhancing the potential upside to our base case expectations.\nThis has been another excellent half, building on the high operational cadence we delivered in 2023. Good order intake and the inclusion of our space business resulted in a new record order backlog. We've maintained contracting discipline, and our focus on operational performance translated into double-digit percentage sales and EBIT growth.\nEvery one of our sectors contributed to the company's strong growth, enabled by the combination of operational performance, supply chain management and our diverse geography and capability portfolio. We are increasing investment in the business to support our growth profile. This includes expanding self-funded R&D by double digits, primarily in our Electronic Systems business, where we continue to see strong returns on investment. And we increased capital expenditure, primarily in Maritime and Platforms & Services, reflecting programs with good visibility and longevity.\nThe strength and outlook for the company, alongside our disciplined capital allocation, means that we are increasing the interim dividend by 8%. We've also started the follow-on buyback program. And as you'll hear in detail from Brad, we are especially pleased to increase our full year guidance.\nToday, I want to reinforce some key messages we laid out at the prelims in February. The increased threat environment is global, and we are seeing the strength of our broad geographic footprint. A high proportion of our current and future long-term revenue and earnings profile is driven by helping our customers address global threats beyond the current Ukraine conflict. Our alignment to the U.S., U.K., Australian and Japanese defense strategies gives us confidence in the long-term picture.\nOur ambitions for the coming years are built upon these strong foundations and will enable us to continue delivering strong operational performance and contracting discipline, investing appropriately in technology and our people to support growth and our customers' priorities and deepening our partnerships and collaborations. We have unique capabilities to design, build and support air, land, sea and space platforms alongside our industry-leading electronic warfare and defense cyber portfolios. This diversity means we are well positioned to offer superior solutions to our military customers as they focus on critical, multi-domain and interoperable capabilities. Major multinational collaborations like AUKUS and GCAP are great examples of what we can achieve.\nBased on the portfolio and strategy I just detailed, we continue to expand our aspirations for the future, thanks to confidence in long-term defense spending commitments, political alliances and a continued strong order flow and pipeline. The detailed slides we presented in February to illustrate our growth drivers are in the backup material. Today, I want to emphasize the visibility we have right now.\nAt GBP 74 billion, our order backlog continues to expand and provides a strong base for growth. However, we estimate our funded plus incumbent backlog is actually several times higher, and we've detailed some examples of the true long-term value of many of our programs. This includes our 2 leading revenue drivers for the group of Typhoon support and Dreadnought, which highlight the strength of the core business. And remember, the GBP 180 billion plus contains little that is attributable to our U.S. business, nearly 50% of the group, as much of that is subject to the annualized U.S. budget process.\nOn this new slide, we're providing color to the waves of growth drivers as we see them. Many of our major franchises ramp up, then enter steady-state delivery over a long period before being replaced by follow-on programs. We expect good growth from all our sectors in the years to come. Here, I want to pull out some of the highlights.\nIn the coming years, we see our Swedish and U.S. Combat Vehicles, Hunter frigate program and electronic warfare and precision electronics businesses acting as major growth drivers. The next wave comes from the AUKUS ramp-up, Electronic Systems, space, MBDA and munitions acceleration. Then at the end of the decade and into the next, we see GCAP and a continued AUKUS submarine build stepping up. As a reminder, this is just our base view and excludes many of the opportunities we are actively pursuing.\nAs detailed on the slide, the depth and breadth of our opportunity set is increasing and is supported by the global shifts in long-term defense spending. We are actively pursuing new work across all our sectors, domains and major geographical markets. This includes munitions restocking; Electronic Systems content for U.S. FMS sales; exports for Typhoon, MBDA and Type 26; U.S. Combat Vehicles and artillery FMS sales and backfilling as well as backfilling and export of our Hägglunds and Bofors products.\nLooking further out, we are working hard to position ourselves to deliver on space revenue synergies, the AUKUS Pillar 2 work and rapidly evolving autonomy and drone markets. In one slide, this should help you understand our conviction on the delivery of our long-term growth and where we see the opportunities to enhance our already strong outlook.\nWrapping up my section. 2023 was a year of significant strategic progress, and we've maintained that momentum in the first half of 2024. On AUKUS, we've made excellent progress on the U.K. program in reaching key design maturity milestones. In March, as part of the AUKUS trilateral security pact, we were selected to build Australia's new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines alongside ASC.\nOn GCAP, we unveiled a new design a few days ago at the Farnborough Airshow. And we've made good progress on the Tempest flying demonstrator and the industrial construct between the 3 nations.\nWe have been active in shaping our portfolio with the partial disposal of our shareholding in Air Astana, reinvesting the proceeds into high-end technology businesses in the autonomy and drone domains. And of course, we completed the acquisition of Ball Aerospace and established our Space and Mission Systems business.\nAnd on that topic, I'll now hand over to Tom to update you.\n\nThomas Arnold Arseneault\n\nExecutive Director\n\nThanks, Charles. We are just over 5 months into the integration process since closing on the acquisition in mid-February. I am very proud of what the team has accomplished already. Let me give you a brief update on where we stand.\nAs you can see, the SMS backlog has grown significantly since the acquisition as we converted pipeline opportunities into contracts, further establishing its base of business and visibility for future growth. I'll highlight a few of our recent wins a bit later.\nSMS revenue was stable in the first half. Expected growth was temporarily held back due to external factors, such as the extended U.S. budget continuing resolution and the delayed passage of the defense supplemental by Congress, which resulted in delayed awards and program starts. As it stands now, we have the funding and momentum to support our growth outlook for the business. In fact, we see a circa 10% sequential revenue increase from H1 to H2 this year, which will get us to mid-single-digit top line growth for the full year but expanding into 2025 at our expected top line growth rate after a strong second half of 2024.\nOther business performance factors are on track or above plan. Margin came in at 11%, which puts us firmly on track to achieve the circa 12% margins we are targeting over the medium term.\nCash conversion is set to exceed our expectations and contributed to the overall strong group performance. So all in all, we are now hitting our stride in this business, and we remain confident in SMS performance over the medium term.\nAs our largest acquisition to date, integration planning and execution represents a top priority for us, and I am very pleased with the progress thus far. At the heart of things, we remain focused on our new Space & Mission Systems employees, more than 5,200 strong, to ensure that we're retaining the diverse talent and expertise in the business. Preparations are on track to fully transition SMS employees onto our systems and HR plans to close out the Transition Services Agreement with Ball Corporation during the second half.\nIn other functions, we have identified and, in some cases, already implemented new systems and operating models where we can offer greater efficiencies. We continue to identify and pursue both cost and revenue synergies, and we're on track to deliver on both to achieve our acquisition plan.\nAs I touched on earlier, we remain keenly focused on unlocking the extraordinary value we saw in this acquisition through both top and bottom line synergies. We are on track to achieve our projected cost synergies of approximately $30 million per year within the targeted medium-term time frame. In terms of revenue synergies, the team has held cross-sector and cross-functional synergy summits to identify opportunities where collaboration among SMS, Electronic Systems as well as other segments will yield new business. In fact, we are already starting to submit joint bids on opportunities that neither of our companies would likely have pursued on our own.\nMeanwhile, we've had a lot to celebrate operationally since closing. The first few months with SMS as part of BAE Systems has been marked by a number of notable accomplishments, both in achieving key program milestones and winning new awards. Within weeks of closing, we watched the launch of MethaneSAT, a program the team has been working on since 2019, which will perform methane emission monitoring around the globe. In April, the Weather System Follow-on - Microwave mission was launched to support military operations with accurate, actionable environmental information.\nAs you may have seen in May, the team won 2 more contracts as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's GeoXO, or Geostationary Extended Observations mission. With these significant wins, we have now been selected to build all 3 hyperspectral instruments for the platform. The 3 contracts totaled approximately $1.3 billion and are scheduled to launch in the early 2030s as NOAA's current geostationary weather satellites near the end of their planned mission.\nThese achievements underlying the strong position SMS enjoys on large programs as well as the long heritage of technology and know-how that will continue to position the business for growth well into the future. This, together with the impressive pipeline, strong backlog and revenue synergy opportunities our teams are identifying underpins the confidence we have in the business outlook. I look forward to sharing another update after our first year during our preliminary results next February.\nWith that, I will hand over to Brad.\n\nBradley Madsen Greve\n\nCFO & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Tom. As you've heard from Charles, it's been another strong period of growth for the business, with all of our key performance indicators demonstrating that our business continues to compound value.\nThe rising demand backdrop yielded GBP 15 billion of new orders. Combined with the contribution from SMS, our record backlog reached GBP 74 billion. Top line sales of GBP 13.4 billion increased by 13%, with organic growth approaching 10% with all of our sectors contributing. EBIT grew 13%, and with higher tax and interest, underlying growth in earnings per share was 7%. After increasing investments in our people, R&D and CapEx, the group posted over GBP 200 million of free cash flow, and we allocated over GBP 800 million for shareholder returns in the form of dividends and buybacks.\nThese strong results reflect the focus, care and commitment that our team show every day, and I want to thank all of my colleagues for their hard work. We won a number of notable orders in the period, including a GBP 4.6 billion order for Hunter Class frigates in Australia, full-rate production orders for AMPV and P&S along with continued high orders for CV90s. MBDA posted strong orders in the air sector, and our new U.S. space business landed several key wins.\nOn sales, our 13% top line growth featured strong contributions from each of our sectors. Like-for-like growth was 10%. The biggest sector gains were in Electronic Systems, up 34%, which includes 4 months of activity from Space & Mission Systems. Excluding SMS, ES was up by 11% organically. Within ES, precision strike led all other business in terms of growth, while flight controls and avionics and electronic combat also made strong progress.\nThe Maritime sector rose by 14%, with large gains on the Hunter program in Australia, Type 26 in the U.K. and continued growth in submarines. P&S delivered a 13% increase on the ramp of CV90 and full-rate production of AMPV volumes. The Air sector rose 7%, with sales surpassing GBP 4 billion for the half year with the growth in Typhoon support and MBDA helping to offset the maturing Qatar program.\nCyber & Intelligence sales were up 4%, lifted by higher activity with the U.S. Air Force. It's also worth noting that at the head office level, this year's half year shows a drop of around GBP 130 million from the IPO of Air Astana in February.\nMoving to EBIT. The group was up 13% to nearly GBP 1.4 billion. The return on sales of 10.4% highlights our strong operational delivery and the benefits of the margin-accretive acquisition of SMS, all helping to offset the 30 basis points of margin headwinds of in-year FAS/CAS pension effects at group level. We expect this year to be the last material reduction to margin from the diminishing FAS/CAS impact. At sector level, the FAS/CAS effects show up in the ES margins of 14%, while the move to full-rate production on the AMPV helped drive P&S margins into double digits.\nIn line with our guided range, Air delivered over 11% return on sales, with the prior year benefiting from the timing of risk retirements. Maritime's EBIT grew by 19%, with margins expanding slightly to reach 7.8%. Cyber & Intelligence also posted some margin expansion to reach 8.5%.\nOperating cash flow was GBP 474 million. The decrease from last year was driven by lower advances in the Air and P&S sectors. The group continued to invest in CapEx, including key projects to improve efficiency of our delivery like the ship assembly hall in Glasgow. As usual, we expect to see a strong second half weighting for cash flow, and we are upgrading our guidance, as I'll talk about shortly.\nWe started the year with net debt of just over GBP 1 billion. After free cash flow of GBP 200 million, shareholder returns of GBP 800 million and the M&A activity, we ended the period with net debt of GBP 6.1 billion. We were pleased to see the strong oversubscription to the debt issuance for the Ball transaction, with interest rates below our original guidance across a desirable maturity range.\nAll 3 credit rating agencies affirmed our ratings last summer when we agreed to acquire Ball Aerospace, reflecting the quality of the acquisition and the continued strength of the balance sheet, and there was a subsequent upgrading by Moody's to Baa1. With the higher overall debt, we still expect to exit the year at a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 1.7 with expectations of continued deleveraging.\nTurning now to guidance. With the strong first half delivery across the group, we are pleased to be in a position to upgrade our key numbers. We now expect sales to be up 200 basis points from previous guidance to up 12% to 14%. EBIT will be up in line with sales at 12% to 14%, and we're upgrading the earnings per share range by 100 basis points with a new increase of 7% to 9%. Free cash flow is expected to exceed GBP 1.5 billion. And with this upgraded outlook for free cash flow, we are on target to deliver over GBP 6 billion in free cash flow for the 3-year period ending in 2024. Refined guidance on finance costs and tax are also shown here.\nWe have been consistently delivering against our now well-established approach to capital allocation. That includes investing in our people, as you can see with the soon-to-be completed shipbuilding skills academy in Glasgow. Our increase in CapEx once again underlines our focus on efficient delivery as well as building capacity to deliver growth while our investments in R&D help to enhance our longer-term ambitions and widen our considerable technologies.\nEven after increasing these key investments, the profitable growth in our business allows us to increase our dividend in line with a coverage ratio of about 2x earnings. The group's strong balance sheet has been put to work with M&A activity that strengthens the portfolio and enhances earnings and cash flow over the medium term with a clear intention of maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. Finally, we continue to deploy surplus cash to repurchase shares.\nThat brings me to our ambitions for the medium term and how we will deliver them. While it is hard to quantify the impact of company culture, I am convinced that it has been a key enabler of our strong performance and allows us to do a better job of retiring risk rather than consuming it. This focus on operational excellence ultimately leads to better financial outcomes, and our close partnership with our customer and alignment to their current and future needs drives the way we've been shaping our portfolio, whether that's in our new Space & Mission Systems business or smaller acquisitions in the uncrude platform space.\nOur record backlog and opportunity set gives us a very strong platform for continued top line growth, margin expansion and strong cash conversion. We will allocate our growing returns in ways that continue to create value. In turn, this will provide the platform for a reliable compounding business model, featuring consistent growth in sales and earnings with our cash flow deployed with discipline to drive even higher returns.\nOur half year results and the across-the-board upgraded guidance for the full year are evidence of this approach in action. And in this time of rising global tensions, we are proud of the role we play in helping to protect those who protect us."

Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Matt. Good morning and thanks for joining us. Although we report first quarter financial results today, I will direct my comments toward the dramatic actions we've taken since the Alaska Airlines accident in January. First, we began with taking responsibility. We immediately and transparently began supporting the NTSB to identify the cause of the accident.\nWe supported the FAA investigation of the 737-9 fleet in its entirety to do comprehensive airline inspections, and the aircraft were cleared to go back into service. We immediately acted, working alongside our supply chain to ensure the door plug depressurization event doesn't ever happen again. We held quality stand-downs across all of our production lines in BCA and sought the advice and counsel of more than 70,000 employees to improve our factory disciplines and adherence to our quality standards. All in all, we collected over 30,000 ideas, and the list continues to grow. We have categorized and prioritized all. Employee engagement has been energizing for all. Actions are being taken across all of our factories, and areas of focus include training, particularly on the job, taking advantage of our slowdown, and adding hundreds of hours of training for each of our manufacturing employees.\nTooling, more of it and improved maintenance. Work instructions, simplify, simplify, simplify. Compliance checks, discipline, traveled work controls, don't travel work, incentive structures, employee listening, and maybe above all, culture improvement. We transparently engaged with the FAA and immediately went to work on a 90-day plan of quality action to drive improvements throughout our production system. We completed our 30-day review, and we're regularly checking in with the FAA as we complete our 90-day plan. We engaged a team of independent quality experts to systematically review our quality control process and bring forward long-term recommendations. They are roughly 60 days into their work, beginning with Renton and Spirit, and we expect them to stay for several years. We have appointed several new leaders into critical BCA leadership roles in the last couple of months. All have jumped in with both feet alongside our world-class workforce.\nThey are seasoned operators and all with a critical eye. Effective 1 March, we moved inspection and rework teams to Wichita. Since then, we have only allowed fully inspected fuselages to be shipped to Renton, which has dramatically reduced our non-conformances entering the Renton factory. This started as a trickle, and it has been slowly improving as time goes on. The visibility in Wichita will help the Spirit team prevent non-conformances from being created in the first place. We are already beginning to see signs of more predictable and reduced cycle times in our factory as a result of these enhanced quality control standards. We expect this will continue to improve. We have extended our commitment to reduce traveled work across all of our assembly lines and deep into our supply chain.\nWhile near-term delivery shortfalls hurt and will affect our performance during our first half of the year, the long-term benefits from a synchronized supply chain will be substantial. We are absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to make certain our regulators, our customers, and most importantly, our employees and the flying public are 100% confident in Boeing. While I have shared my plans to step down as CEO by the end of the year, I will be very focused every day on seeing that commitment through. As we move through this period, it is important that our people and our stakeholders understand how promising Boeing's future looks. Demand across our portfolio remains incredibly strong. Our people are world-class. There's a lot of work in front of us, but I'm proud of our team and remain fully confident in our future.\nWhile this effort will slow our recovery timing, we are now seeing these proof points that give us confidence that we'll begin to stabilize and improve performance moving forward. By the end of this year, we expect to have largely delivered our 737 and 787 inventory, effectively shutting down our two large shadow factories. Our commercial business will be more stable. Our defense unit will be progressing toward more historic levels of performance, and our services team will continue to deliver exceptional results. And most importantly, we will have embedded all of the important lessons we've learned in the last few months and over the last several years. During that time, I've had the opportunity to speak to many of our frontline team members, engineers, and mechanics.\nI continue to be amazed by the pride they take in their work, their commitment to getting things done the right way, the safe way, and their willingness to raise their hands and offer ideas for how to do things better. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $16.6 billion, down 8% versus last year, primarily reflecting lower 737 delivery volume. The core loss per share was $1.13, a slight improvement versus last year, also reflecting lower 737 deliveries. Free cash flow was a usage of $3.9 billion in the quarter, a higher usage than last year and in line with the expectations shared last month. Cash was impacted by lower commercial deliveries and unfavorable timing of receipts and expenditures. Turning to the next page, I'll cover Boeing commercial airplanes.\nBCA booked 125 net orders in the quarter, including 85 737-10s for American Airlines and 28 777Xs for customers, including Ethiopian Airlines. The backlog grew to $448 billion and includes more than 5,600 airplanes. BCA delivered 83 airplanes in the quarter. Revenue was $4.7 billion, and operating margin was -24.6%. These results were significantly lower than last year, primarily reflecting lower 737 deliveries and the 737-9 grounding impact for customer considerations of $443 million. Now I'll give more color on the key programs. On the 737, we delivered 67 airplanes in the first quarter as we deliberately slowed production below 38 per month to incorporate improvements to our quality and safety management systems, including reducing traveled work and addressing supplier non-conformances. These continued efforts will cause April deliveries to be more in line with February levels as we complete our work.\nProduction will remain below 38 per month for the first half of the year and will be higher in the second half as we move back to 38 per month, with a timing of rates beyond 38 predicated on the work we're doing with the FAA. We've recently made adjustments to the master schedule and will continue to manage supplier by supplier based on inventory levels and rate ramp readiness. Our objective remains to keep the supply chain paced ahead of final assembly to support stability and minimize traveled work. The quarter ended with approximately 110 737-8s built prior to 2023, the vast majority for customers in China and India. This is down 30 airplanes from last quarter and in line with our plans. We still expect to deliver most of these inventoried airplanes by year-end as we work toward shutting down the shadow factory.\nThere were about 95 additional airplanes in inventory, about 35 of which were -7 and -10s, and the remaining are WIP airplanes impacted by factory and supply chain constraints. On the anti-icing, the timeline is unchanged, and we're making good progress towards resolution. As it pertains to the certification of the -7 and the -10, we've coordinated with our customers and added more 8s and 9s into the skyline in the near term to mitigate impacts to their fleet needs and stabilize our production plans. The program margin has been updated to reflect these impacts as well as the slower production ramp. On the 787, we delivered 13 airplanes in the quarter. We're slowing near-term production and plan to return to five per month later this year. We expect to achieve rate increases, including 10 per month by 2026.\nWe ended the quarter with about 60 airplanes in inventory, about 40 of which require rework, which continues to progress steadily and in line with our expectations. We still expect to finish the rework airplanes and shut down the shadow factory by year-end, with most of these airplanes delivering in the year. Finally, on 777X, we continue to progress along the program timeline and still expect first delivery in 2025. We'll follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the process, including working to obtain approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. Moving on to the next page, we'll go to Boeing Defense, Space & Security. BDS booked $9 billion in orders during the quarter, including awards for 17 P-8 aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the German Navy, and securing the final F/A-18 new-build production contract from the US Navy.\nThe backlog grew to $61 billion. Revenue was $7 billion, up 6% on improved volume, and BDS delivered 14 aircraft in the quarter. Operating margin was 2.2%, another quarter of sequential improvement, but still more work to do. First quarter results were impacted by losses on two fixed price development programs totaling $222 million, $128 million on the tanker, and $94 million on the T-7A. Our game plan to get BDS back to high single-digit margins by the 2025-2026 timeframe remains intact. We've made important progress in Q1. Our core business, representing about 60% of our revenue, is seeing solid, consistent performance in the mid to high single-digit margin range, with strong demand across the board. On the 25% of the portfolio, primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs, operational performance further stabilized in the quarter, which drove improved margin trends.\nWe still expect a return to the strong historical performance levels as we roll into new contracts with tighter underwriting disciplines as we move into the 2025-2026 timeframe. Lastly, we have our fixed price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue. Despite the relatively modest updates in the quarter, we continue to retire risks and remain focused on maturing these programs quarter in and quarter out. Importantly, on the MQ-25 program, the program was awarded a cost-type contract modification from the US Navy that included two additional test aircraft, demonstrating our progress and our commitment to stronger underwriting disciplines in the area of the development programs. The program also delivered the first static test article to the Navy, and the airframe is ready to begin stress testing.\nOn the Starliner, the program continues to progress toward a 6 May crew flight test as the spacecraft was recently integrated on top of its Atlas V rocket, and pre-launch testing is underway. Lastly, the T-7A test aircraft completed climate lab testing in February, and the program continues to progress with Air Force flight testing. Overall, the defense portfolio is well-positioned. As seen in the initial FY25 presidential budget, there's strong demand across the customer base. The products are performing in the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive executability will return this business to performance levels that our investors recognize. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter. They received $5 billion in orders, and the backlog is at $20 billion. Revenue was $5 billion, up 7%, primarily on higher commercial volume, and favorable mix.\nOperating margin was a strong 18.2%, an expansion of 30 basis points compared to last year. In the quarter, BDS opened a maintenance facility in Jacksonville, Florida, supporting our military customers, and the US Navy exercised options on a P-8 sustainment modification contract. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. On cash and marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $7.5 billion, reflecting the debt repayment activity and use of free cash in the quarter. The debt balance decreased to $47.9 billion as we paid down $4.4 billion of the $5 billion of maturities due this year. We continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. While we're still not in a position to provide a more detailed 2024 outlook today, I want to provide some additional context on the path forward.\nThe 2024 free cash flow outlook I shared last month is still expected to be negative in the low single-digit billions. Cash flow should improve as we move through the year and be back-loaded, driven by BCA deliveries and receipt timing, including an expected Lot 11 award on the tanker. Q2 free cash flow is expected to improve sequentially but be another sizable use of cash. We're committed to managing the balance sheet in a prudent manner with two main objectives. One, prioritize the investment grade rating, and two, allow the factory and supply chain to stabilize for a stronger trajectory as we exit this year. As we operate at these lower production rates, we're actively monitoring our liquidity levels and believe we have significant market access and are continuously monitoring and evaluating opportunities should we decide to supplement our liquidity position.\nLonger term, we remain confident in our ability to achieve $10 billion of free cash flow. However, given our continued focus on safety, quality, and stability, we continue to expect that this goal will take us longer than we originally planned and later in the 2025-2026 window, primarily tied to the 737 and 787 production delivery ramps of 50 per month and 10 per month, respectively. Moving on, discussions with Spirit are ongoing. As with any large and complex deal, there are a number of terms and issues we need to work through, including price, financing, and other key items, and the best approach to handling and potentially divesting certain work that Spirit does for other customers. We believe in the strategic logic of a deal, but we'll take the time needed to get this right before we decide to enter into agreement.\nIn the meantime, the focus is on factory stability in Wichita and in Renton. As you saw yesterday, we agreed to advance Spirit $425 million, virtually all of which will be repaid in Q3. This will be accounted for as investing cash. Looking forward to the balance of the year, we're taking the time now to ensure our BCA factories are stable and positioned to ramp production. We'll also continue to make progress on other important objectives, including shutting down the shadow factories, maturing and de-risking the defense fixed price development programs, and building on the continued strong results and services. Our backlog of nearly $530 billion speaks to the breadth of our portfolio, and this demand backdrop underpins our commitment to drive long-term results, all enabled by the everyday execution of 170,000 incredibly talented and dedicated team of Boeing employees. With that, why don't we turn it over to questions?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And in order that your question be clearly heard, we ask that you not use your speakerphone, cell phone, or headset. Please use your handset to ask a question. If you're on a speakerphone, please be sure to mute your phone. The mute function is switched off so your signal can reach our equipment. Again, if you have a question, please press one, then zero. And as a reminder, in interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to one single-part question. And our first question will come from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nHello.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYou gave color on the April MAX deliveries similar to February, but I'm really more interested in the production output, how it's going on the line, where you are relative to where you were when you started to give the no traveled work policy, how that's improving or not, and what specific metrics you're looking at to allow you to go higher over the next six months.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nSo why don't I start this off? It is going to stay sporadic through Q2. The real pivot for us is the number of clean fuselages we get out of Spirit with the new inspection protocols. It started slow. In the meantime, we've been working on all the fuselages that were already trapped in the pipeline that did not go through that inspection process. So that's why it's slow and lumpy here in these couple of months. But we will be through that process within the next 60 days, and then we will just be dealing with clean fuselages out of Wichita. So far, we're quite encouraged at just how clean they are and how quickly they move through our production cycle, substantially better, faster than before. So as we exit Q2, we will know exactly what numbers are coming out of Wichita and what expectations are. We are not going to rush it. We're simply going to demand that they be clean. But I like all the signals. I was walking through the factory yesterday. When we get a clean one, it whistles through the factory, and that's the most important thing.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thank you. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nYes. Thank you. Good morning.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nHi, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nWhen you look at production on the 737, when you talk about going to $10 billion in free cash flow, maybe by late by the end of 2026 or even 2027, this seems to be very much contingent on getting to this 50-a-month rate. But when you look at that process, if I go back even pre-grounding for the Max, Spirit had never successfully done a rate break to 50 a month before. And given the restart mode that they're in right now, how do you see the pathway to getting up from where they are today, getting through the quality issues, and getting to 50 a month there within two years?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nWe do. Spirit's committed to it. I think the acquisition of Spirit will factor in significantly into that prospect. Clean fuselages in Spirit and in Wichita and fix on all those non-conformances will reduce their cycle and improve their output. So there's a lot of things that contribute to it, Doug. If we get ourselves to 38, which is our first objective, and we do it in a steady fashion, moving up another 12, in my view, is doable in the window that we're talking about. So that's the bet we're making, and I'm confident we can get there. But job one is the six months that commenced post-Alaska and the inspection protocols and the non-conformance fixes that are then embedded into the Wichita facility.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes. Thank you. So as a result of the production slowdown, you've had some, presumably you'll have late deliveries to customers. Traditionally, late deliveries require compensation. Could you give us some color in terms of what sort of a number we're going to look at? And basically, where are we going to see it? Is that going to be front-loaded, back-loaded? How should we think about that?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nCai, I'll take that one. Why don't we talk about in the context of 737 overall margins? The program booked about 300 basis points of impact in the quarter, and that was primarily driven by the delayed rate ramp that you're describing, as well as mixing in more eight to nines for tens in the near term so that we can support our customers in their fleet planning. So that will all roll through, and the timing will be expanded over the next couple of years.\nWhat our expectation is over time is that while these program margins won't get back to the 2018 levels, they will expand. And that will largely be driven by the rate ramps that Dave described. And the reason why they'll be different from where they were in 2018 is largely, as you know, because of the customer mix and these delayed considerations. So all in all, when we step back and think about long-term, structurally, particularly on the cash margin front, not a lot has changed. We just have to work through getting from here to those higher levels, including the consideration that we've described that we booked in the quarter. Overall, long-term, we still think we get there.\n\nCai von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. And good morning.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nGood morning.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nBrian, you talked a little bit about the cash balance and liquidity. I don't know if this is necessarily the right way to think about it, but I feel like there's this conventional wisdom out there that Boeing should have roughly $10 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Maybe that can dip a little bit lower intra-year as we see now. But burning cash in the second quarter, kind of how low can that cash balance get before you have to do something? When you talked about additional sources of liquidity, what were you talking about? And how much room do you think you still have with the rating agencies to avoid getting put on a negative watch?\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Seth. First and foremost, remind everyone that we do have $17 billion of liquidity today, comprised of the cash on hand as well as our credit lines. What we're focused on is a first-half cash usage that is resulting from all of the actions we're taking to stabilize both the factory and the supply chain to set ourselves up for success as we move to the second half into 2025. To that end, any supplemental funding that I talked about would do two things. First of all, it would restore our cash balance to the historical level that you point out, that $10 billion-ish. It also means that we want to continue our practice to stay well ahead of our near-term maturities. By near-term, I mean roughly the next 12 months. That's what we're thinking about as we sit here today. We will be prudent and thoughtful. We believe the market would be open to us.\nAs we've said consistently, the most important thing is our investment-grade credit rating that we think a lot about, and it is a priority.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Good morning, Dave and Matt. Can we talk about the 737 rate again? How much of that is self-inflicted versus the FAA processes that are in place? And when we think about the 90-day timeline, that comes to a head with the IAM negotiations over the summertime, I would assume. So how do we think about the IAM progressing as well, and how much was incorporated into the $10 billion free cash flow target?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nOkay, Sheila. That's like a three-parter.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nSorry about that.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYeah. I'll do my best. So all of the 737 disruption that it goes on today, in my view, is self-inflicted in the sense that we've made the decision that the amount of traveled work, particularly as it relates to the fuselage that was embedded and normalized in our factory, that we would make a dramatic reduction in it. So that move we made with all the inspectors and all the rework operators down to Wichita, the visibility we've provided to the Wichita workforce with respect to the rework that we were doing, the FAA didn't demand that. We demanded it because we're determined to get ahead of it.\nWhat the FAA is doing, and they have been very diligent and businesslike in the way they've approached this, is they want a control plan, and they want a control plan in 90 days that, in essence, monitors and measures whether our production system is in control moving forward. And if it ever gets out of control, the signals are clear both to the FAA and to us, even more importantly, and that we won't extend. We won't rate up. We won't do anything until it is under control, and it has to stay that way. So 90 days isn't like a wave a magic wand and everything's great and you guys can go from 38 to 40. It's quite different. It is simply a set of metrics and controls that we both agree are the right ones to monitor the performance of our factories.\nI am confident it'll be a good set of controls and something that we can live up to. We're going to work our way through this one. As I said, the most important thing that occurs over the next six months, or frankly, starting in January when we launch this effort, is going to be the pace at which clean fuselages come out of Wichita. That is the most essential part of this equation. With respect to IAM, as you know, we worked through the summer. There's a lot of discussions going on between our team and their teams. It feels productive. While we're doing that, we have huge engagement with a relatively new workforce across our factories in light of what we've just experienced. That engagement helps. It doesn't hurt.\nI can't ever tell you I'm perfectly confident that we rushed to an agreement, but we're all going to try to solve for continuous production. I think our chances are good. We're not going to know until we get really close to the deadline, and that's just real life in labor negotiation. Anyway, I think that covers most of what you asked. Was there any other part I missed?\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThe 10 billion free cash flow, does it incorporate the IAM negotiations?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nOh, yes.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Good morning, everybody.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nHey, Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nI guess this is sort of asked, and you've alluded to pieces of the answer to this, but I'm just going to ask it anyway because it seems to be the most important thing, which is just how long does it take to do everything you need to do on product quality, and how much of it needs to be done before you can increase production again versus how much of it can be done as you're increasing production again? Because I've heard you now reference six months a few times, and you've referenced the back half of the year looking a lot different than the first half of the year. And six months isn't a short window of time. But in the context of what you're doing and referencing 30,000 ideas, and if you're going to take Spirit in, that hasn't even happened yet, and it's almost May.\nWhen you were working with the FAA on 787 a few years ago, you didn't deliver one for 18 months. So I don't know what you can say to that, but how do we get confident that the time just doesn't keep ripping by and you're not iterating back and forth and there isn't a much longer window of time needed to do everything you need to do to start to ramp again?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYeah. So no, I'll address this one. First of all, I'm glad you asked about the six months. When I say six months, I'm talking about the first half of this year. Because remember, we commenced all of these actions the day after the Alaska Airlines accident. Our determination, the big factor here, in my view with respect to the essence of the question, is this move to eliminate traveled work in our factory, and specifically, and most importantly, the fuselage. So that action was commenced on 1 March, inspection line in place, full inspections being performed in Wichita. Our rework teams with respect to non-conformances that were worked up in Seattle, those teams have been visiting regularly down to Wichita. And I fully expect for them to come up to rate with clean fuselages here as we get into the second half. That, again, is the big productivity driver in the Renton factory, and the cycle time improvements also double up as capacity improvements for us and for them. So that is the big question.\nThe 30,000 ideas, that is a long list of stuff that just provides for continuous improvement from this day until forever. So that's not something that all has to get processed and completed before we can sort of flip the switch and go. It's quite the opposite. It is a set of continuous improvement concepts and ideas that we simply set out with our workforce and our leadership team over time. And that's recognized by our employees and by our leadership team. So that's how I think about this sequence.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Have you guys thought about framing and disclosing some version of that timeline of work maybe in big buckets or categories that you would provide to the investment community? Because it feels like everybody's guessing and has no visibility. And if you said traveled work is one category, Wichita, I don't know what the categories would even be, but if there was four or five of them and you could provide an update on which are complete and how complete the other ones are as you report, just some version of milestones that investors could follow on your progress here.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nI think that's fair. No, the most important one, the essential one, and that we will have to report as we close Q2 is going to be the number of clean fuselages that we're receiving from Wichita and the prognosis for that going forward. So that will be the most essential part of the equation I think you're trying to solve. I think all the other stuff we'll categorize for you. That's not hard. We do it for the FAA. We do it for our own teams. But that is not going to be rate limiting. None of that is going to factor into the rate limit. What is going to factor in is this determination to make sure traveled work doesn't come back to us and that Wichita is up to the rate increases.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Dave, Brian, you mentioned that the H1 2024 deliveries for the 737 will be under pressure as you focus on quality. But then again, stability of the supply chain is also a priority. So in the event that 737 MAX production and deliveries continue to be under pressure beyond H1 2024, how long can you keep the supply chain at a higher rate? What does it mean to keep them stable? And then also, as a follow-on to that, if this were to play out, can you talk about the puts and takes of free cash flow generation in the second half of the year?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYeah. I'm sure Brian's dying to answer this one, but let me start. We have a rate increase plan. As everyone knows, it gets us up to 50 here as we get into that 2025-2026 window. So our job now, given the slowdown here in these six months and then sort of the push out of those rate increases, is to make sure we have all the inventory we need to satisfy that 50 number and to have the buffers where they need to be to make sure that the supply chain can demonstrate the capacity to meet those numbers. So this slowdown, in my view, is an opportunity for us to shore up whatever supply chain issues were out there, sort of one supplier at a time, and to get there. Now, if we get to a moment because the slowdown has gone on too long, if we get to a moment where the buffers exceed that requirement, we will curtail, but not until they exceed that requirement. Brian?\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, Boeing Company\n\nAll I would add is that tactically, we have adjusted the master schedule at a supplier-by-supplier basis. It's all out there. They know it. We will continue to pace final assembly in line with that master schedule so that we don't sacrifice stability. Because what we're talking about is a very important near-term investment that we have to stay laser-like focused on so that we don't take a step back. And that's what we're focused on. And we believe that we can handle the cash flow fluctuations as we get through the first half into the second half and position ourselves for 2025.\n\nKristine Liwag\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question is from Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nScott, good morning.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nDave, could you further characterize what you're seeing with respect to supply chain performance on the 787 and where the constraints are that are driving you to drop back below 5 a month? And then I'm curious if there's been any change to the plan on the 777X ramp. Thank you.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYeah, no change on the latter. But we really have two constraints to think about on the 787. One is discrete. It's well understood and known, and it's heat exchangers. This is a product that used to be built in Russia.\nWhen the invasion happened, it got moved, and the capacity of that supplier has not kept pace with us. But the improvement plan that we all see gets us where we need to be by Q4, and we have a lot of confidence in it. So again, discreet, well-known, etc. The other one that affects us is not necessarily our suppliers, but as you may know, the seat suppliers out there are in shorter capacity. A lot of that is buyer-furnished, but nevertheless, it holds up an airplane. And so that one's a little more medium-term-ish. Capacity is being built out. I think people will get ahead of it, but that'll be a little longer than the heat exchanger. And anyway, so that will affect us a bit. And when you have a buyer-furnished problem like that, you don't have consequences attached to it, as you probably know.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you. And then, Brian, did you get an advance on the large P-8 contract that you won this quarter?\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, Boeing Company\n\nSo we're going to not talk about that specifically in terms of that award, but I did want to come back to two things that you asked about. I want to make sure there's color out there. 777X, as we described, no changes, but I would like to indicate that we're starting to see the inventory implications of that ramp. And that's something that's big and important as we move through this year, and we're excited to be able to put that in service. But that does create some working capital pressure that I don't want to have lost on anyone. And as it pertains to the 787, very nice progress in terms of our inventory liquidation, progressing well.\nKeep in mind, not all of that will get delivered. All that will get reworked and completed, but the deliveries are going to lag. As far as production's concerned, we will be a couple lower than that five per month for most of the year as the supply chain catches up. As Dave mentioned, we do have a recovery plan, and we are optimistic. One bright spot is that that second line has now been activated. So as soon as that supply chain is positioned, we'll be ready to go. But it will be lower as we move through this year.\n\nScott Deuschle\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks. Good morning. Wanted to clarify on your comments around the balance sheet and liquidity. Is equity concerning equity issuance? Is that still off the table as you think about the balance sheet and potentially funding Spirit?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nWell, as we stand for what I described in terms of what we're looking at right now, working closely with the rating agencies, we believe we can do the move I described in the near term with market access without that. As it pertains to Spirit, we talked about that this is a deal where discussions are ongoing. It's complicated. There's other parties involved. What this means is that once it does get signed, we expect it to, then it's going to take time to close. In that time between signing and closing, we're going to explore the optimal financing for that transaction in order to maintain the investment grade rating. That's important. How exactly that looks, don't know. We've got the time.\nAnd importantly, at the same time, we're going to have a factory that we expect to get more and more stable. So we're going to get to the optimal answer. We're going to protect the investment-grade credit rating. And how the pieces play out, stay tuned.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay. And a quick follow-up there as it relates to Spirit. How engaged is Airbus in this process at this point in thinking about potentially taking back their own work? And does the deal need to wait until you get full clarity on what might happen with that Airbus business, or do you think you can move forward without full clarity there?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nNo, we can move forward without full clarity. And as you probably know, we're not going to get involved in that, whatever's going on there. We encourage Spirit to do whatever they need to do to try to remedy or improve their business relative to our potential acquisition. So I don't have a lot of insight into that, but I encourage Spirit to try to resolve that kind of stuff as quickly as they can. But we are not – we're not being held hostage to that.\n\nDavid Strauss\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nThanks very much.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning, Dave and Brian. Dave, can you talk about your pending kind of leadership change? I mean, you've been on the board for many years. You've been CEO for five years during – was obviously been a very challenging environment with the MAX, COVID, 787. But it kind of, as we think about it in reality, Boeing's in kind of a position to have a multi-year improvement story. So what do you think is the right leader that's needed to execute kind of what is a very complex company?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYeah. I appreciate you asking that, Peter. First of all, the process we have in place is a good one. Steve Mollenkopf in the chair role, Bob Bradway in the governance role, the board at large, they're going to look at the market every way they can. They know I have an internal candidate that I think the world of. They will balance sort of their perspectives and get to the right conclusion with my full support. I do not expect that to happen in the next month or two. So let's all be clear about that. Look, my prescription is pretty simple. You know as well as anybody, maybe better than anybody, how long-term this business is.\nYou also know that mistakes that matter are usually in the development of another airplane, not so much in the production issues that we face today or the supply chain issues that were created from COVID. These are, in the context of aviation, short-term issues that have to get wrestled through slowly in a disciplined way. On the other hand, when you get big development programs wrong, you pay a price, and you pay it for a long time. And I know an awful lot about that. So my view is that next leader has to be prepared to make smart long-term decisions and get the development programs right. So that's the prescription that I've offered to the board that I offer to pretty much everybody. And again, I have an internal succession plan broadly that I like. And anyway, we'll see where things turn out. But either way, they have my full support.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Analyst, Baird\n\nAppreciate it, Dave. Thanks.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nYep.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Boeing Company\n\nLois, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And that question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer, Citigroup\n\nOkay. Great. Good morning, everybody. Recognizing that you've got two other segments, the last caller here, nobody's touched on BDS or BDS. Maybe I can throw in a couple of things.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nGo, Jason. Thank you.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer, Citigroup\n\nSo first on the services business, look, the operating margins there have been quite healthy over the last year or so. And I think are operating well above kind of your targeted margin range for that medium-term targets out there in 2025, 2026. So the question is, can we sustain the margins that we've got, that we're seeing today, out into that period? Then over on BDS, the incremental charges seem like they're coming down quarter on quarter. But Brian, just kind of curious, are there any significant milestones or risk retirements that you could point to here over the next 12, 18 months that kind of give us a little bit of an idea of when those things completely go away and we begin to start seeing that financial model that you've talked about start to lock in for that 2025, 2026 timeframe? Thanks.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, Boeing Company\n\nLet's split this, Brian. I'll do the services. You can handle the defense contract. Services, the one thing that I don't think anybody's factored into margin for us in services, a big profit pool that we have is our distribution business. This was the acquisitions of Aviall, KLX over the years. This calendar year, we have a full integration of those two distribution companies in mind.\nI've reviewed this program. This will be another important productivity stepping stone for the business that, in my view, provides for sustainable margin improvement and just a better, smarter, simpler way of doing business around the world. So that project is in full swing. We will likely do the change somewhere in the Q4 or Q1 of next Q4 of this year or the Q1 of next year. We'll let that team tell us when they want to pull the trigger. But that one's a pretty big one, and it's a pretty important one. It's one I've always wanted to get done. It'll take those brands out of play. It'll simply be a Boeing brand. And the integration in the warehouses broadly across our company is pretty significant. So you want to hit that?\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, Boeing Company\n\nStart on BDS, Jason, characterize it in a couple of ways. We're retiring risk every day, particularly on a program like VC-25B, which we'll move our way through, and we will deliver two airplanes, and then that will be over as a program. The ones that are interesting to us in terms of the real development side would be the T-7 and the MQ-25. T-7, we expect to get through the flight test program. Good progress with the customer. It's proceeding well. That's an important milestone as we exit this year. Similarly, on MQ-25, we will get to the build. We will get to the software integration, and we will be able to get through an important milestone with the customer as we exit this year. Importantly, on the MQ-25, as I mentioned, we just signed with the customer two additional airplanes that are going to be cost-type. That's important. Another move towards our intent to de-risk.\nAnd then on the commercial crew, we've got a launch coming up that will continue to de-risk that program. And the tanker, the tanker continues to show good progress. It does get impacted somewhat by our determination to reduce traveled work. But long-term, the tankers are performing in the field. We're getting a better handle on what that needs to look like over time, and we're confident that we're de-risking it. So by and large, we still feel confident that we'll work our way through it. And that will result in a BDS margin level as we get to the 2025, 2026 timeframe that we believe is going to be in the high single digits. Nothing's taken us off that, and we look forward to retiring these risks.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer, Citigroup\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Boeing Company\n\nAnd that concludes our call today. Thank you, everybody, for joining.

In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nThank you, Matt. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us while we report on our fourth quarter results. Today, my focus is on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and the actions we are taking as a company to strengthen quality and earn the confidence of our customers, the confidence of our regulators, and the flying public. Brian will cover the financials. I will keep my comments strictly to the issue at hand. I'll start up front by apologizing again to Alaska Airlines, to their crew, and to their passengers, and more broadly, to all of our customers who were affected by the 737 MAX 9 grounding. The NTSB's investigation into the accident is ongoing.\nI have an amazing amount of confidence in the work that they do. They bring experts to the investigation and they take all the time that's necessary to draw accurate conclusions. And we intend to be there with them.\nAs part of that NTSB process, I cannot comment on any specific root cause or speculate a root cause. As a participant in the process, I do believe the investigation will narrow quickly whatever conclusions are reached. Boeing is accountable for what happened, whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be. An event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better. Our customers deserve better. I want to remind everybody what a great job the pilots and the crew at Alaska Airlines did in responding to a desperate moment. I also want to remind everybody what a terrific job the leadership at Alaska Airlines did, grounding the airplanes and ensuring safety. Alaska Airlines did exactly what companies like Boeing would hope that they do at a moment like that.\nThat is why the airline industry is as safe as it is.\nWe caused the problem, and we understand that. Over these last few weeks, I've had tough conversations with our customers, with our regulators, congressional leaders, and more. We understand why they are angry, and we will work to earn their confidence.\nThere is no message, no slogan that will accomplish that. It's all about real, demonstrated action, and absolute transparency every step of the way. So let's talk about those steps. Our team has worked diligently to help our customers restore their 737-9 airplanes to service. The FAA approved the detailed inspection protocol last Wednesday, and today all 737-9 operators are safely returning their airplanes in service.\nMore broadly, we are taking immediate and comprehensive action to strengthen quality at Boeing and within our supply chain. We instituted additional quality controls and inspections at Boeing and at our supplier.\nWe issued bulletins to suppliers to strengthen the focus on conformance and reducing the risks of quality escapes. We opened our factories to 737 operators for additional direct oversight. We appointed an expert quality advisor to conduct a comprehensive and independent review of our commercial airplane quality management system, and they will remain with us for many years. Most importantly, last week we paused 737 production for the day as more than 10,000 teammates across Renton, Seattle, and Moses Lake stopped to focus on safety and quality, and only safety and quality. This was a quality stand down at a scale we have never done before. We're going to keep doing them across our commercial factories. In addition to our internal actions, the FAA has announced new oversight of our 737 manufacturing. We will cooperate fully and transparently with the FAA at every turn.\nWe respect their role as our regulator, and we will follow their direction in every step on production. Today, we're producing 737s at a rate of 38 per month. We will remain at that rate until the FAA and Boeing are satisfied with our quality and manufacturing process.\nThis increased scrutiny, whether it comes from us, from our regulator, or from third parties, will make us better. It's that simple. Over the last several years, we've taken close care not to push the system too fast. We have never hesitated to slow.\nDown, to halt production, or to stop. Deliveries, to take the time we need to get things right. Nobody knows that better than our investors.\nAs you know, we stopped delivering 787s for over a year to ensure that each conform to our exacting specifications prior to delivery. On the 737 line, we have regularly slowed rate breaks to support the stability of the overall production system and to correct nonconformances when identified. This accident makes it absolutely clear we have more work to do. I know that these moments that impact delivery schedules can frustrate our customers and our investors. Quality and safety must come above all else. Our customers and our investors know that and are in there with us.\nOn that note, as you will see, we are not issuing financial outlook for 2024 today. Now is not the time for that. We won't predict timing. We won't get ahead of our regulator. We will go slow to go fast. And we will encourage and reward employees for speaking up to slow things down, if that's what's needed. We will simply focus on every next airplane and ensuring we meet all the standards that we have, all the standards that our regulator has, and that our customers demand.\nAs we go about that work, we remain confident in our recovery. Since day one, we've been focused squarely on inculcating safety and quality into everything that we do and getting back to our legacy of having engineering excellence at the center of our business. That focus and commitment is unwavering and we will continue to strengthen our processes and our execution every step of the way. Most importantly, we will be transparent every step of the way. And with our 170,000 employees in mind, I'd like to close with a message directly to our team.\nWe have confidence in you and we have confidence in Boeing. We have confidence in our airplanes.\nI know how seriously you take your work. Our men and women on the manufacturing floor and in our engineering offices know exactly what we must do. You know your work better than anyone else on the planet. Use your voice, speak up. Focus on every next detail. We will seek out and act on your feedback. We're in a challenging moment. We will earn trust back through demonstrated action and a commitment to total transparency. I'm confident in you. I'm confident in our company, and that together we will do just that. Brian, over to you.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let's start off with the total company financial performance for the quarter. Revenue was $22 billion. That's up 10% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix.\nThe Core Loss Per Share was $0.47 better than last year, primarily on improved commercial volume, better mix, and lower abnormal costs. They were offset by lower defense margins and higher period expenses, including R&D, which we expected.\nFree cash flow was $3 billion in the quarter, in line with the prior year and up sequentially from third quarter, primarily due to improved commercial deliveries and strong order activity which drove favorable advanced payment timing, some of which was anticipated in first quarter 2024. Turn to the next page. I'll cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\nBCA booked 611 net orders in the quarter, with 411 737s, including an order with Akasa for 98 777Xs largely in Emirates order, and 83 787s. We have over 5,600 airplanes in backlog, valued at $441 billion. BCA delivered 157 airplanes in the quarter and revenue was $10.5 billion. That's up 13% driven by higher wide body deliveries and favorable mix.\nOperating margin was just positive at 0.4% driven by returning to normal 737 delivery levels in the quarter. Improved mix as well as lower abnormal costs associated with getting to 5 per month on the 8, 7, and resuming production on the 777X. Now I'll give more color on the key programs. On the 737 we delivered 110 airplanes in the quarter and 45 in December. The program also began FAA certification flight testing on the 737-10 in December.\nFor the year, we delivered 396 airplanes on the upper end of the revised guidance range we provided in October. Per the FAA announcement, we'll maintain production at 38 per month and work transparently with the FAA to complete all requirements for future increases. At the same time, we'll continue to prioritize the master schedule to avoid disruption in our supply chain. On the 737-9, we're actively supporting our customers return to service activities and as of today, the majority are back flying in our factory. We have 10 Dash 9s in production, all of which will undergo the FAA-approved inspection process prior to delivery. Spirit has also adopted this inspection routine in its factory.\nThe quarter ended with about 200 MAX airplanes in inventory. It's important to think about this inventory in three buckets. First, there are 140 737-8s built prior to 2023. The vast majority are for customers in China and India. We still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year end as we work towards shutting down the Shadow Factory.\nIn the second bucket, there are around 25 airplanes produced in 2023 that are still in WIP given the disruptions in the second half of last year, and we expect these to deliver in 2024. Lastly, there are approximately 35 Dash 7s and Dash 10s that we will deliver once those airplanes are certified, the timing of which will be determined by the FAA. Moving on to the 787, we delivered 23 airplanes in the quarter, including 11 in December. For the year, we delivered 73 airplanes within the guidance range we originally outlined for 2023. The program successfully transitioned production to 5 per month in the quarter and still plans to steadily work our way to 10 per month in the 2026 timeframe. We ended the quarter with approximately 60 airplanes in inventory, about 50 of which require rework, which continues to progress steadily.\nWe still expect to deliver most of these airplanes by year end as we finish the rework and shut down the Shadow Factory.\nWe booked $77 million of abnormal cost in the quarter and have approximately $300 million left to go that will wind down by year end in line with our expectations on the 777X. We resumed production in the quarter and continue to progress along the program timeline, which remains unchanged during the quarter. The Emirates order for 90 777Xs brought the program backlog to more than 400 airplanes and also extended the accounting quantity. We continue to follow the lead of the FAA as we progress through the certification process, including working to obtain approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. We booked $71 million of abnormal cost in the quarter, which is now fully behind us after resuming production in line with our expectations. Moving to the next page, Boeing Defense, Space & Security.\nBDS booked $8 billion in orders during the quarter, including the Lot 10 award from the US Air Force for 15 KC-46A tankers. The backlog is now at $59 billion. Revenue was $6.7 billion, up 9% on the tanker award and improved volume, and BDS delivered 52 aircraft and two satellites in the quarter. Operating margin was minus 1.5% in the quarter, a sequential improvement from 3Q, but still we have more work to do. 4Q results were impacted by cost true ups on three fixed price development programs totaling $139 million as well as unfavorable performance and mix on other programs. Our game plan to get BDS back to high single digit margins by the 2526 timeframe remains unchanged. Our core business remains solid, representing 60% of our revenue and performing in the mid to high single digit margin range.\nThe demand for these products is very strong and we need to execute, compete, and grow these offerings on the 25% of the portfolio primarily comprised of fighter and satellite programs. Operational performance stabilized as we exited the year and as a result fourth quarter saw improved margin trends. Although still negative, we still expect to return to the strong historical performance levels as we roll into new contracts with tighter underwriting disciplines as we move into the 2025-26 time frame.\nLastly, we have our fixed price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of revenue. Despite the relatively modest cost growth in the quarter, we continue to focus on maturing these programs and retiring risks quarter in, quarter out, and we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. In addition to capturing the Tanker Award from the US Air Force, the program delivered nine aircraft in the fourth quarter, continuing to build positive momentum in spite of the supply-related disruptions to the factory that we faced earlier last year, and on the T-7A. The first Red Hawk arrived at Edwards Air Force Base in November, formally starting the Air Force development flight test campaign for the aircraft. Overall, the defense portfolio is poised to improve on the strong demand across the customer base.\nThe products are performing in the field and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business to performance levels that our investors recognize. Moving on to the next page, Boeing Global Services.\nBGS had another strong quarter. They received $6 billion in orders, and the backlog is now at $20 billion. Revenue was $4.8 billion, up 6% primarily on favorable commercial volume and mix. Operating margins were a very strong 17.4%, an expansion of 350 basis points versus last year as both our commercial and government businesses were delivering double-digit margins in the quarter. BGS opened a parts distribution center in India and received a follow-on contract to provide sustainment for the C-17. Turning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt, on cash marketable securities. We ended the quarter at $16 billion.\nOn debt. The balance remained flat at $52.3 billion, and over the next few days we'll pay down $4 billion of the $5 billion of maturities coming due this year from our available cash on hand.\nWe continue to maintain access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn. Our liquidity position remains strong, our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a priority, and we're developing and deploying capital in line with the priorities we've shared previously. Invest in the business and pay down debt. Turn to the next page. I'll cover full-year financials.\nFull-year revenue was $77.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Growth was driven by improved commercial volume, primarily on higher 787 deliveries. The core loss per share was $5.81 better than prior year, primarily on improved commercial volume and mix as well as lower fixed price development charges. In defense.\nFree cash flow was $4.4 billion for the year, up versus prior year, primarily on higher 787 deliveries and favorable receipt timing that was partially offset by higher expenditures as we increase production rates and invest in the business.\nWhile we're postponing issuing 2024 guidance today, given our current focus, we're committed to sharing timely and transparent updates. Moving forward, I would like to provide some additional context on our path forward. We always knew 2024 was going to be an important year in our recovery. Based on what we know today, we expect another steady year free cash flow driven by the 737 production at 38 per month, ongoing execution of the 787 toward our long-term objectives, continued liquidation of our 737 and 787 inventory, and continued focus to wind down both shadow factories. Our defense business will continue to improve as we mature fixed price programs and transition recently challenged programs with better underwriting disciplines that we've already started to see. BGS will continue to generate strong free cash flow.\nLonger term, we're focused on quality and stability, which will ultimately drive free cash flow.\nNothing has changed on the demand front, and the backlog is strong and growing. Remember, our 2025-2026 guidance was based on achieving stability, and we have to earn that by applying resources to fix our issues and demonstrate predictability one airplane at a time, side by side with our regulator. This team is up to the challenge and will apply any and all resources to get back to deliveries that satisfy our customers and underwrite the long term demand profile. We're still confident in the goals we laid out for 2025-2026, although it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated. We won't rush the system with that. I'll turn it back to Dave for closing comments.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Brian. We're addressing you from Renton, home of 737 MAX family.\nWe're living in the here and now and we're working with all of our people. I couldn't be more impressed with their commitment, dedication, and the comprehensive nature around which they will look at this. Boeing will get better. I am confident in that. We will address, we will address everything that needs to be learned from the accident, and we'll move forward. Thanks, happy to take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. In order that your question be clearly heard, we ask that you not use a speakerphone, cell phone, or phone headset. Please use your handset to ask a question. If you're on a speakerphone, please be sure to use your mute function or, I'm sorry, that your mute function is switched off so the signal can reach our equipment. As a reminder, in the interest of time, we're asking that you limit yourself to one single part question. Our first question is from the line of Peter Arment; please go ahead.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Baird\n\nYeah. Good morning, Dave and Brian.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nHi, Peter.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Baird\n\nDave, thanks for the initial open color on the MAX situation and the steps being taken. So I guess just to follow on that, Dave, I wanted to ask you about where you assess you are in kind of the recovery of the MAX program. When we think about what has been a successful transition to Rate 38 and some of the progress in stabilizing the supply chain and you've commenced deliveries to China. And I know we're not talking about 25, 26 targets, but directionally there's been a lot of improvements since last fall and since your investor day when you laid out this long term outlook. Thanks.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nYeah, Peter, I appreciate that. By the way, one stat which I was just handed, which I track all the time, is the number of our Dash 9s that have been returned into service. We're at 129. That is progressing at a very quick rate based on the inspection protocols that our FAA and we all agreed with.\nI am very proud of the progress that we've made, and I feel great about it. Of course, with one exception, and it's too big an exception, which is the Alaska. I also know that as the NTSB investigation narrows and concludes, and I do believe that will happen in relatively short order, all the learning that can be extracted from it and all the learning that can be extracted from all those inspections of all those airplanes flying day in and day out that will inform us on what improvements we can make on our quality systems. First and foremost, we will run the Door Plug, literally from the second a door is received at Wichita through their lines, all 12 positions, through our 11 positions here. Inspections will be added at every turn. It is on lockdown.\nAnd we've had help from our FAA. We've had help from our customers, et cetera. So that's sort of step two. The next one is how do you take all of that learning and apply it through all the supply chain lines? And we have some medium and long term efforts just beginning to make sure that we do that.\nMy confidence comes from quality systems always can get better. And when you have a moment like this, you take everything, you literally look at everything, and we're all keenly aware of everything. So we're going to run that play as hard as we can, and we're going to take the time to do it. And the FAA, I'm sort of glad they called out a pause because that's a good excuse to just take our time, do it right. And I wish I had called that out on the first day, but maybe I would have. We've been good at taking pauses. I've probably taken more pauses in the last three years, and I'll apologize to all our investors now than have been taken in the 10 years before it. But this is what we do and how we get better.\nI also say, Peter, as you know, one of the nagging issues that we've been facing have been shortages here and there.\nWhere we have to pause. Our line buffer inventory is not quite as robust as we'd like them to be based on supply chain weaknesses. We will run our Master Schedule in accordance with the plans that preceded this. Each and every part we receive, and all the buffer inventories that we get, will stabilize production from here on out. Less travel work in our line. All good things come from that.\nSo I feel really good about it. I also have confidence in our airplanes that will be certified.I like the respect that the FAA and Boeing are showing one another.\nAgain, maybe too long a diatribe, but there are lots of sound reasons for why I'm feeling good. In some ways, this moment will accelerate recovery, not delay it.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Baird\n\nAnd just initial progress on China. Thanks.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nYeah. So, Peter, as we've talked many, many, many times, we have stood by our customers in China day in, day out. They have been flying MAXs now for the better part of the year. They are performing extremely well. And we'd always hoped and expected they would begin to take deliveries. And I think everybody has noticed that those deliveries have started. So we are just going to stay diligent, stay with each and every one of them, and make sure our Chinese customers get what they've ordered and paid for.\n\nPeter Arment\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Managing Director, Baird\n\nThanks so much, Steve. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nMorning, Dave and Brian. Maybe if you could update us on how you're thinking about the MAX 10 and the MAX 7 certification timing. Just given the MAX 7 exemption being withdrawn, what does it mean for the 10 and how does that phase in as you think about ramping production to 50 a month and the profit profile of the MAX slide if there's no MAX 7 or 10?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nSheila, thanks for that question. I'm going to just give a little bit of a moment on why we made that decision on the time-limited exemption. I'll let Brian help quantify it.\nI visited Capitol Hill for a lot of reasons. My biggest one is to own the problem, be transparent, and convey that to all of our workforce so that they know we're willing to do that and then we can all be honest, clear with each other every step of the way in this process. And so I'm glad I made the visit. I was not expecting when I met with Senator Duckworth. The conversation t hat we had.\nYou know. She's a pilot and a decorated pilot.\nShe listened to everything I had to say. We didn't have a debate about the safety of the MAX 7. And the MAX 7 in its certification work was moving along at a pretty steady pace. She had a way different argument for me, and it was right. She said, you want to introduce this new airplane, a derivative, yes, but a new airplane, and nine months from now you'll have an engineered solution to it, to this issue. And why is that the right call? In my view, it was a sound, principled position to take.\nI went home for the weekend. I talked to our customer, you know who that is.\nUnbelievably constructive and this is the right thing to do for aviation. So that is really how it happened. And it was that simple. But the, you know, the passion and the argument that Senator Duckworth presented to me, I'm so glad I heard. Anyway, that's what happened. The MAX 7 will have to move until we get that engineered fix in place. And then I'll let Brian sort of quantify the. Okay, now what?\nYeah, and on the MAX 7, the work at hand, we will design an engineering solution. We're applying the resources. Our view that that could be within a year. But on the MAX 7, remember, while it's a very, very important customer, the number of deliveries you're talking about is relatively small. As I mentioned, we've got 35 of Dash 7 and Dash 10s in inventory. At the end of the quarter, there's a handful of 10s. They're mostly MAX 7. So we'll sort that out as the process works and that airplane for the FAA gets certified. On your question on the Dash 10, I prefer not to get into what ifs. It is a great airplane. Customers love it and there's great demand for it and it'll get certified at some point when the FAA decides.\n\nSheila Kahyaoglu\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Brian, you alluded to 2024 being another. I think the words were steady year of free cash flow. I think in follow-on descriptions you gave a lot of uppers to what's going to happen year-on-year. So is steady meaning growth in free cash flow and? Or can you give some of the offsets to the uppers? Thanks.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nYeah, thanks, Mal. So I did describe some of the key ones. Obviously BCA volume up, BDS less of a drag, BGS steady. There's a big investment in there that probably should have called out. Now that you're asking is the 777X investment. That's important and that's big. And also we got a plan for, you know, making sure that we stay laser-like our supply base on the master schedule. We don't want them to take their foot off what they're doing.\nIf that means we got to hold more inventory, so be it. It's important because at this moment it will allow us to have any of our suppliers that might have been at the line, short of the line. They get a chance to catch up. All that in the mix are levers that we got to deal with as we move into the year. In terms of what steady means, you know, our belief we stand here today, the bottom end will look a lot like it did last year and maybe a little bit of growth. Once we know more, we'll put more specificity around it and we'll give normal guidance when adequate and when appropriate.\n\nMyles Walton\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much and good morning.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nGood morning Seth.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nBrian, you talked a couple of times about the shadow factories and the path toward winding them down over the next year and change. Is there any way to quantify how you think about what the cost of those shadow factories was in 2023 or what you expect it to be in 2024?\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nYeah. So thanks. I would. The impact you're not going to see in 2024 just because we still have to move that work through the system, but as we exit it will largely behind us. As we think about our expectations on BCA profitability over time, we've always talked to it getting back to normal. A lot of that productivity will be not only what volume might look like. Can't say a lot about that now. But also we don't have this resource with these shadow factories, so we won't quantify it specifically.\nBut it is an important component as we think about going from what our profitability has looked like at BCA historically, where we think we can get to.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nMaybe I'll just add and refresh everybody's memory because we've talked about it a couple of times in our shadow factories. We put more hours into those airplanes than we do to produce it in the first place. So anyway, that's a metric I know everybody understands.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Maybe if I could sneak in one more the advances. It was a nice tailwind in 2023. You know, how do you think about that in 2024?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nYou know, right now we plan for obviously not to be quite what it was in 2023. That's factored into my comments. The good news is that we still have a pretty robust demand environment, and our commercial teams are working hard to chase every next order. So we're not counting on a big one. But we know that our teams can go win campaigns.\n\nSeth Seifman\n\nExecutive Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning everybody. Brian, just maybe a quick clarification or maybe Dave and then a question on defense. The clarification on the rate 38 a month.\nYou guys still firing some blanks so that the number that you're actually producing is a little bit less than that. Just kind of curious what rate 38 means. On defense, Brian, you've historically broken things down into that 60, 25, 15 bucket. You talked a little bit about the 25% bucket and the 15% bucket in your remarks. I was wondering if you just comment on the 60%, the remaining part of the portfolio, and how that's performing and where maybe margins are in that slug of business at this point. Thanks.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nSure.\nI'll take the first one. Yep. We've cycled to 38 per month. We said that. Keep in mind it always takes time for that to equate into deliveries. We're not firing blanks. On your question on the 60% of the portfolio on BDS, you know, they've consistently, quarter in, quarter out, still been able to deliver some very good performance on some products that the customers need. You know, the laundry list that we talked about, things like Apache and all that sort of stuff, missiles and weapons, things that are needed right now in this environment that we live in. They're performing well, and they're in that mid to high single digit margin rate. When we step back, if we think about going from where BDS is with margins, two things have to happen.\nThat 25% that's wrapped around fighters and satellites, that has to get better. We feel expected to get better and look a lot like it used to. You've got 85% of your portfolio clicking at stable, consistent, mid to high single-digit rates, and we know we can get there. Then you've got this 15% of the portfolio on fixed-price development programs that we expect to be less of a drag as we retire risk over time. We expect that to play out.\n\nJason Gursky\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat.Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGood morning. Thank you.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nHi, Doug.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nHi. I want to go back to the MAX 7 and the MAX 10 certification. The question I have is when you look forward and given there is uncertainty on the timing of the certification of each one of those, you look at both the mix in your customer demand, and certainly you've had more demand than you can respond to given supply chain issues.\nFirst, let's say that mix changes because of the timing of certification on those two variants. Do you still see your line as full because it could be moved around between MAX 7s, MAX 8s, MAX 9s, MAX 10s, and then, second, what kind of operational challenges, if any, do you have when you have to have some flexibility about what variant you're producing.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nYou know, Doug, I'll just start by saying I think it's manageable. We will have. If there's a delay in any way, we're not going to know at the last second. We're going to know with a considerable time frame, in my view. By the way, right now.\nThe status on the MAX 7 and the MAX 10 was progressing reasonably well. I don't believe the FAA has taken anybody off the course, and we haven't taken anybody off the course. They are making real progress. I think we were almost close to the finish line had we not pulled, you know, the time-limited exemption. I don't.\nAgain, I'm never going to suggest a date or anything like that for the FAA, but they're working diligently on it, and they know how to separate these two. The issue we're wrestling with in our factory from the cert efforts, and I believe we're going to have plenty of time, and we'll be able to manage our product mix reasonably well. There won't be anything dramatic by way of change. If there are some subtle change from quarter to quarter, first or second, you'll know it pretty early, and so will we. I think it's quite manageable.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nIs it fair to say that the supply chain ramp is probably still the governing constraint on your production ramp, not things like mix here?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nYes, although I will say if this pause goes on for a little while.\nI Don't want to pause my customers, but the pause is going to be helpful for us in so many ways, in the sense that that supply chain, they're going to keep running according to that master schedule.\nIt's good for us if some buffers get developed, and some of the more stressed suppliers get ahead of the game. There is important progress that will get made despite this momentary pause.\n\nDoug Harned\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nVery good, thank you.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Doug.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nHey, Ron. Good morning.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. How are you? If I may, I have a two-part question, if that's okay. The first one, if you guys could walk through 787 a little bit. You mentioned the rate, what's going on in that line, that sort of thing. We get questions about that. I'll come back with the second part in a sec.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nYeah. On the 787, there's nothing new. On the 787, team's doing a very nice job. We'll produce at the 5 per month rate like we described. We expect to steadily increase those rates over time and liquidate a lot of inventory, a lot of inventory. You know, we'll give more dimensions around the specifics in line with normal guidance. The program's doing just fine, and the backlog's big.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah, it's been doing great. Maybe the second question, this one's a little more difficult. I'm still trying to get my head around how we got here.\nMeaning if you go back to the beginning of the MAX issue, wasn't the 737 line like the most scrutinized production line in the world? What happened to get to where we got today? I understand that revamping the quality system and all that, it's all great news, it's a positive move forward, but why did that have to happen now? I just don't understand that.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nWell, Ron.It should never happen. The question about now is not so relevant. It should never and can never happen.\nI am incredibly proud of the work that our people do on the 737 line. I think it has steadily progressed. Quality numbers have gotten better. When you have an escape and then when everybody concludes exactly what happened in that escape.\nThat lights another fire. You take another step forward with respect to all things quality, and you make certain that whatever it was that created that opportunity for failure in the sky or in flight can never happen again. That has already happened, and we'll learn from everything. Yeah, I think I understand your underlying context for the question, but I probably take exception to that premise.\n\nRon Epstein\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is on the line of Cai Von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nCai Von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYes, thanks so much. Now that you've waived the exemption on the engine anti-icing and you're designing the new system, you said it would take about a year.Have you accelerated that at all?\nCould you accelerate it more? Because my assumption is that is going to be the long pole in the tent in terms of when the FAA can certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nI think that is an accurate statement you just made, given the fact that we made this decision.\nJust a couple of days ago. Needless to say, we will throw more engineers at it, we're going to put more work into it, and I hope we can accelerate it. The nine months that I discussed with Senator Duckworth was based on my understanding of that project before I made this decision. The answer is yes, we'll step up resources, we'll step up whatever testing is required. We will do everything we can to inform the FAA about that particular part of that program. That's where we stand today. You are correct.\nThat is the pole in the tent. All of us should be watching.\n\nCai Von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nTerrific. Thank you. Then another quick one. You know, with the supply chain running at the master schedule, but you're delivering not quite as many, should we think about a fairly large build in the inventory account here in the next couple of quarters until you get beyond that?\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nYeah. There are two things, Cai, that are going to be things we have to deal with in cash flow. One is going to be the 777X investment I discussed, as well as what you just described. That's contemplated in my description of what we thought the bottom looked like. We just have to go run the play and work through what's in front of us. More work ahead, and we'll describe it more specifically as we move through the year.\n\nCai Von Rumohr\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nHey, Lois, we have time for one more question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That question will come from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nHey, Noah.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nHi, Noah.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nMight go over one if I'm last, but Brian, recognizing that there's some limitation here in how you can discuss it, maybe just trying to talk out max units this year with assumptions of not breaking to higher rates.\nYou know, you made it a point to say you're at 38. I know, I know. You know that rate final assembly, where the entire supply chain is, is always a different number. You know, if I just simply said 31 for six months and 38 for six months, that's in the low 400s. Then you unwind 5 to 10 of inventory a month, you know, I can kind of get, you know, somewhere near 500 or just decent growth from 2023. Is that just a reasonable starting point as we wait to learn more from the FAA?\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nYou know, I completely understand the question. Those are the inputs I described. You know, out of respect for the process that we need to go through with the FAA, I just got to steer away from specificity. It's just not the right time. We've got work in front of us, and I promise when appropriate, we are going to be more specific. Anyway, it's probably going to be on the specificity of those numbers. Wait and see. It's just not appropriate.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nFair enough. Fair enough. Are you willing and able to speak to just updating what the cap is these days on the monthly inventory unwind, and how China plays into that.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nI don't know. We think about a cap. We've got these shadow factories that have been working for quite a while, and they know the routines, and they've been pretty steadily on both 737 and the 787, consistently meeting month in, month out liquidation targets and expectations for customers. I don't think there's any kind of cap. We're just focused on, we know exactly the pile of inventory. It's 140 on the 737 that I described. It's 50 on the 787 that have to get the rework. We're just going to move through this year with real focus in order to be in a position where we start shutting these shadow factories down. We're just going to run that play as hard as we can.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Is China officially fully 100% taking deliveries? We see it in the press, we see the reading of the tail number websites, but can you just declare that that's just fully officially on at this?\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nPoint one at a time, and yes.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Brian, just one more defense. You know, the margin still, still not where you want it, but better sequentially. Any framework you can provide around how that progresses through 2024? What was the final defense cash burn in the 2023 cash, so we can think about where, you know, what to work off of as we go into 2024?\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nYeah, the cash burn. We put out some numbers a year ago and we thought the operating cash flow is by division, BDS, the worst case. For them in that range, they were much worse than that. All what we described last year, and we expect it to be better this year, and that's behind us. Yep, they did a lot worse, obviously offset by BGS and BCA doing better, but it was worse.\nThe first part of your question on margins, you know, we expect margin trajectories to get better over time, particularly as we focus on this 25% of the portfolio that is very specific, and there's a lot of efficacy activity around it. We will get better. They will eventually get to the point where we're putting positives on the board. What I'm most interested in is the team that's got to execute over the next between now and 2025, 2026 in order to get these margins back in the high single-digit range. I will remind you that that's how we describe our defense margins. You really got to put two points on top of that, which is what we account for in our global services division for the defense side.\nIt's really looking more like a double-digit defense external view that we are aiming to get towards because we think that's a pretty decent business.\n\nNoah Poponak\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nRight? Okay.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nYou squeezed in three.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nWe got in. We got them all in. Got the rest in. Thanks so much for the time. I appreciate it.\nThanks. Noah.\n\nDave Calhoun\n\nPresident and CEO, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, everyone.\n\nBrian West\n\nEVP and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThat completes The Boeing Company's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.\nWe're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the conference over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's quarterly earnings call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information is included in today's press release.\nFurthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.\n\nThank you, Matt, and thanks to all for joining us this morning. Let me start with a comment on the conflict in Israel and Gaza. We were saddened to see the horrific attacks [indiscernible] real and the escalating conflict in the region that is resulting in a significant humanitarian emergency. We will continue to monitor the situation. We will focus on the safety of our employees, and we will aid those in need. As always, we'll follow the lead of the U.S. government, and we'll coordinate closely with government agencies, customers and suppliers, always with safety, security and well-being as our top priority.\nNow let me turn to the quarter. As you know, we ran into a few challenges over the last several months, but we've demonstrated that we know how to overcome obstacles, and we will continue to do just that. We knew 2023 would be a bumpy ride. We have more work to do, but overall, we're making progress in our recovery. And we are on track to meet the financial goals we shared for this year and for the '25, '26 time frame, a time frame I refer to as stability.\nAs you know, free cash flow has been our primary financial metric through this recovery. And based on our performance year-to-date, we still plan to be in the guidance range for the year as well as the $10 billion target by 2025 and 2026. This is a complex, long cycle business, and driving stability takes time, especially as an entire industry works its way back from the impact of a global pandemic.\nWe expect challenges to come our way. And when they do, we are transparent. We take action, and we move forward. So month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter, it can be tough to predict. But we're focused on the long term, and we're taking the tough actions now to ensure that the long-term future is strong.\nSo with that, I'll highlight a few key updates around the business. Boeing Commercial, BCA. In commercial, demand continues to be incredibly robust. We booked about 400 net orders in the quarter, including 150 737 MAX 10s for Ryanair, 50 787s for United Airlines and 39 787s for Saudi Arabian Airlines.\nWith demand strong, our focus remains on delivering airplanes. We are seeing increased stability and quality performance within our own factories, but we're working to get the supply chain caught up to the same standard.\nOur production system is poised for steady and efficient increases, but we won't push the system too fast, and we'll ensure the supply base is in lockstep with us. On the 737, we're moving through rework on the most recent nonconformance in the aft pressure bulkhead. That work slowed production and deliveries down in the course of the quarter. And given our year-to-date total, we now expect 737 deliveries for the year to be in the 375 to 400 range.\nWhile a setback, we'll regain our momentum as we progress through the issue. We are keeping our suppliers hot according to the master schedule. We plan to complete the production transition to 38 per month by the end of the year and still plan to reach the key rate of 50 per month by that '25 and '26 time frame.\nImportant to note with respect to our supply chain, delivery shortfalls have been driven by nonconformances, not actual supply chain constraints. On the 787, the program is demonstrating improved stability. We're now transitioning production from 4 to 5 per month and expect to meet our delivery range of 70 to 80 for the year. And longer term, we're on track for the rate step up to 10 per month by '25 and '26.\nTo ensure our broader recovery and return to more normal margins, the key focus continues to be on liquidating our 787 and 737 inventory so that we can eliminate those shadow factories and focus our resources on the production floor, all of our resources. Nonconformance costs are exponentially higher on all of those finished airplanes. We still plan to deliver most, if not all, of the inventory by the end of next year, which will set us on a strong path for '25 and '26.\nWith respect to China, we are encouraged by recent signs of progress and continue to work closely with our customers on the timing of returning to delivery. As I mentioned, supply chain performance will be a key enabler.\nAs Spirit Aerospace Systems brings in new leadership, we're looking forward to working with Pat. Pat Shanahan is known by The Boeing Company. We have great respect for his abilities on the shop floor, and we're pleased to have recently established a mutually beneficial agreement that will enhance stability of our production system and help us deliver on our customer commitments, a true win-win.\nLastly, on the development side, we're progressing across our commercial programs, and our timelines are unchanged on the 737-7 and the -10 and the 777X and 777-8 freighter. A reminder, as always, the FAA will ultimately control the timing.\nBoeing Defense Systems, BDS. In Defense and Space, we still have more work to improve operating performance. Results this quarter were impacted by higher estimated costs on the VC-25B program. We are maturing through this build process, incorporating engineering changes to better support the installation process, and we resolved important supplier negotiations over the course of the quarter. I'll note that none of these items will impact the performance and capability of the end product.\nThe increased estimates reflect the process by which we build the airplanes. And in a fixed price environment, any unplanned hurdles can introduce unrecoverable costs. At the end of the day, we have 2 airplanes to build. We're getting past these hurdles and are committed to delivering 2 exceptional airplanes for our customer.\nSeparately, as you saw, we are also expecting higher costs on a satellite program as we build out the Constellation and meet our life cycle commitments for our customer. We're working on real innovation and advanced capabilities in this space and see real potential market as we deliver against this commitment.\nMore broadly across BDS, we're stabilizing operations and taking comprehensive actions to improve performance, including lean initiatives, contracting disciplines, factory improvements, engineering investments and more. We're seeing some early signs of progress, but financial improvement at BDS' lower volumes takes time.\nRecovery in BDS is slower than we'd like, slower than I'd like, but we're confident in the future and our path to normalizing BDS margin performance by that '25 and '26 time frame is intact. The confidence is due in part to key milestones we're starting to hit and the strong demand we're seeing.\nFor example, we delivered the first T-7A to the U.S. Air Force this quarter. We also captured a key award from the U.S. Army for 21 Apache helicopters. Additionally, we continue to invest and position ourselves for significant opportunities in proprietary programs.\nThe backlog at BDS is $58 billion, and nearly 30% of that is outside the United States. We're proud of the role our products play in protecting global security and national defense. Demand is strong, we're confident in the business, and we will continue to improve operational performance to more normalized levels.\nBoeing Global Services, BGS. In Global Services, the team had another strong quarter, both on the commercial and the government side with improved revenue and earnings relative to the third quarter of 2022. The financials were again driven by strong operating performance and the team's ability to hit key milestones and capture new business.\nIn the quarter, BGS delivered the 150th 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter, received an award from the U.S. Navy for P-8 trainer upgrades and signed a digital maintenance agreement with multiple airlines. Our services team represents Boeing with our customers nearly every minute of every day. The work they do to keep military and commercial fleets flying is best-in-class, and we're proud of the performance that they're delivering.\nA step back with respect to the market outlook. Looking across all 3 business units, demand for our products and services continues to be incredibly strong. Our backlog is at $469 billion, including over 5,100 commercial airplanes. Over the next 10 years, the value of the markets we serve across commercial, defense, space and services is estimated at $10.7 trillion according to our most recent Boeing market outlook.\nOur products deliver exceptional capability in strong and growing markets, and our portfolio is well aligned with our customers' needs. The demand is there to support our recovery. It is on us to perform, and we will remain disciplined and patient in the process.\nBrian, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nBrian J. West\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & Corporate Audit and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to the next slide and start with total company financial performance. Third quarter revenue was $18.1 billion. That's up 13% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher commercial volume, primarily on higher [indiscernible] deliveries.\nCore operating margin in the quarter was minus 6%, and the core loss per share was $3.26. Margins and EPS were negatively impacted by unfavorable defense performance, which I'll cover in a moment; lower 737 deliveries that were in line with expectations set last month; and expected abnormal costs and period expenses.\nFree cash flow was a usage of $310 million in the quarter. This reflects the lower 737 deliveries and in line with our expectations.\nWith that, I'll turn to the next page and cover Boeing Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 398 net orders in the quarter, including 150 MAX-10s for Ryanair, 50 87s for United and 39 87s for Saudi Arabian Airlines. BCA now has over 5,100 airplanes in the backlog valued at $392 billion.\nBCA delivered 105 airplanes in the quarter, and revenue was $7.9 billion. That's up 25% year-over-year driven by the higher 787 deliveries. Operating margin was minus 8.6%. We saw the impact of the lower 737 deliveries as well as expected abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D spending primarily on the 777X investment.\nNow I'll give a little more color on the key programs. On 737, we delivered 70 airplanes in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the recent supplier fuselage nonconformance. Since our early September update, additional areas of the aft pressure bulkhead were identified that require further inspection and rework, which you likely read about.\nThis additional scope impacts units that had already gone through the initial rework and will take us more time to stabilize production and deliveries. We founded the issue, understand the rework steps required and booked a nonmaterial financial impact in the quarter.\nConsidering these latest facts, we expect October deliveries to be in line with September and now expect to deliver between 375 and 400 airplanes for the year. Performance ultimately will be dictated by the pace of a fuselage recovery.\nThe quarter ended with approximately 250 MAX airplanes in inventory, 85 of which are being held for customers in China. We still expect most of the MAX inventory aircraft to be delivered by the end of 2024 but more are likely to slip into 2025 tied to the fuselage recovery.\nTo support stability, suppliers are continuing with planned rate increases, and we're selectively managing inventory levels on certain parts where prudent. We expect to complete the 737 transition to 38 per month by year-end, and we're maintaining plan to increase to 50 per month in the '25, '26 time frame.\nOn the 787 program, we had 19 deliveries in the quarter and 50 year-to-date. We still expect 70 to 80 deliveries this year. We started transitioning production to 5 per month in October and still plan to reach 10 per month in the '25, '26 time frame.\nWe ended the quarter with 75 airplanes in inventory. Rework is progressing nicely, and we still expect most to be delivered by the end of 2024. We booked $244 million of abnormal costs, in line with expectations. The total estimate is now $3 billion, up a bit, and we still expect to be largely done by year-end.\nMoving to the 777X program. Efforts are ongoing. The program timeline is unchanged, and we plan to resume production later this year. We booked $180 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations. The total estimate is unchanged at $1 billion, and we expect to be done this quarter.\nImportantly, as Dave mentioned, we recently reached an agreement with Spirit on commercial terms associated with the 737 and 787 programs. We believe this agreement is a win-win for both companies and directly promotes our goal to drive stability and support our airline customers.\nMoving on to the next page, Boeing Defense and Space. BDS booked $6 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog now stands at $58 billion. Revenue was $5.5 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, and we delivered 28 aircraft.\nOperating margin was minus 16.9% in the quarter. In early September, we indicated that margins would be around minus 9%, the driver being a $482 million charge on VC-25B fixed price development program due to higher estimated manufacturing costs related to engineering changes, labor instability and the resolution of supplier negotiations.\nAs we closed the books at quarter end, we saw another 8 points of margin erosion driven by, first, a $315 million loss tied to customer considerations and higher estimated costs to deliver a highly innovative satellite constellation contract that we signed several years ago; and second, we had smaller less material cost pressures across a couple of programs totaling $136 million primarily driven by the MQ-25 program.\nThese are disappointing results in the quarter and year-to-date. This performance is below our expectations, and we acknowledge that we aren't as far along in this recovery as we expected to be at this stage.\nI'd like to point out that the team is executing a game plan to get BDS back to the high single-digit margins by the '25, '26 time frame, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide. We're driving lean manufacturing, program management rigor and cost productivity consistently across the division.\nWe have invested in new training program to accelerate performance on the factory floor, and we've deployed resources at our suppliers to support their recovery. Perhaps most importantly, we instituted much tighter underwriting standards. As you know, part of the challenge we're dealing with are legacy contracts that we need to get out from under. Rest assured, we haven't signed any fixed price development contracts nor intend to.\nThese moves are all fundamental to accelerating the recovery by the '25, '26 time frame. We have detailed metrics and milestones to evaluate our performance and progress across the 3 areas that we previously highlighted.\nFirst, we have a solid core business representing about 60% of our revenue that performs in the mid- to high single-digit margin range. The demand for these products is strong. In particular, volume for missile and weapons products as well as the Apache are very robust, given the current threat environment. And we need to keep executing, competing and growing these offerings.\nThen we have a 25% of the portfolio representing specific fighter and satellite programs that have negatively impacted margins the past several quarters. In these areas, we took on fixed price production contracts in a pre-pandemic environment with real technical innovation that we're working our way through.\nWe fully expect to see recovery in these areas as we improve execution, deliver next-generation capabilities and roll into new contracts with stronger underwriting disciplines that more accurately reflect the prevailing economic conditions. We expect to return to the strong performance levels that we've demonstrated historically on these programs as we move into the '25, '26 time frame.\nLastly, we have our large fixed price development programs that represent the remaining 15% of the portfolio, and we continue to be focused on maturing and retiring these risks. Specifically, on the KC-46A program, we're stabilizing the production system. We've seen signs of progress and improved productivity. And as of this month, we have delivered 77 tankers to the customer.\nFor the VC-25B, we're now maturing through the build process. And the key milestones ahead are power on and first flight, both of which will essentially be behind us as we move through the '25, '26 time frame and represent a significant derisking of the program.\nFor commercial crew, while it has been a long road, we're preparing to execute a successful crewed flight test next year and then fulfill operational launch commitments, all of which will be completed as we exit '25, '26. On T-7A, we just delivered the first aircraft for the Air Force this quarter and have begun critical phases of the flight test program.\nOn MQ-25, we'll get through key build and flight test milestones and transition out of the development phase as we move through the '25, '26 time frame. We remain very confident in the T-7A and MQ-25 investments that will deliver innovative performance to the customer with a strong long-term demand profile.\nSo for BDS, this recovery is challenging at the moment, but we believe the actions we're taking will begin to gain traction and then accelerate. Fast forward to that '25, '26 time frame, fixed price development contracts will be substantially derisked. We'll have a healthy order book underwritten with much better economics and underwriting disciplines and resilient employee base and supply chain that's executing at a much higher level.\nMoving on to the next slide, Boeing Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter. They received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog sits at $18 billion. Revenue was $4.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year primarily on favorable commercial volume and mix. Operating margins were a strong 16.3%, in line with our expectations. Importantly, our commercial and government business continued to deliver double-digit margins.\nWith that, we'll turn to the next page and cover cash and debt. On cash marketable securities, we ended the quarter at $13.4 billion. And on debt, the balance remained flat at $52.3 billion. We had access to $10 billion of revolving credit facilities at the end of the quarter, all of which was undrawn.\nOur liquidity position is strong. The investment-grade credit rating continues to be a priority. And we're deploying capital in line with the priorities that we've shared: invest in the business and pay down debt through strong cash flow generation.\nAnd flipping to the last page on our outlook. The overall financial outlook for 2023 is unchanged from what we previously shared, including $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow generation, although updated 737 deliveries now point more towards the low end of the free cash flow range. We also expect R&D to come in slightly above our original guide tied to the higher 777X investments that I touched on earlier.\nStepping back to address the state of the market. Commercial demand remains strong across our key programs and services. Global passenger traffic was up nearly 30% year-on-year in August and is at 96% of pre-pandemic levels, 109% domestic and 89% international. Cargo remains healthy, and August was the first month with annual cargo growth since early 2022.\nDefense demand is also robust, and FY '24 budget continues to be in line with our expectations. Our portfolio and capabilities are well positioned to support the needs of the nation and of our allies. With demand strong, we still find ourselves in a supply-constrained environment, and our focus continues to be on execution, both within our factories and the supply chain as we steadily increase production. We're squarely focused on a meaningful step-up in operating performance, including deliveries, revenue, margins and cash flow, all of which we expect to improve as we finish out the year.\nOn 4Q specifically, we expect BCA margins to improve sequentially but remain negative, more in line with 2Q, and we're still not anticipating much in terms of BDS profitability. On the tax expense side, we still expect full year tax expense of approximately $250 million.\nAs we look into early 2024, we have seen a number of key milestones that give us confidence in building momentum across the business. The 737 factory should be recovered from the current nonconformance. And we'll be stabilizing production at 38 per month with step-ups as we move to 50 per month by '25, '26.\n787 will be stabilizing production at 5 per month, with a focus on stepping up to 10 per month by '25, '26. We'll be further along in our inventory unwind with better line of sight to the elimination of the 737 and 787 dual factories.\nKeep in mind that correcting nonconformances gets exponential easier when this inventory has been delivered to our customers. BDS will be further along in recovery, as I described earlier.\nBGS will still be generating mid-teen margins, executing on its high cash conversion, capital-efficient disciplined growth model. And all of this will underwrite our continued strong liquidity position and enable us to further delever the balance sheet early next year.\nWith that, back over to Dave for closing comments.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.\n\nYes. Thanks, Brian. In closing, I just want to make a couple of comments and delve down on the resiliency of our recovery. We've had no shortage of challenges this year. You all know that. Conformance items, development hurdles, external challenges within the supply chain and even logistics routes. These are not uncommon in our industry.\nI've heard from a few of you wondering if we've lost a step in this recovery. You might not be surprised to hear that I view it as exactly the opposite. Over the last several years, we've added rigor around our quality processes. We've worked hard to instill a culture of speaking up and transparently bringing forward any issue no matter the size so that we can get things right for a bright future.\nAs a result, we're finding items that we need to resolve. They're not newly created defects in the system. Instead, thanks to the culture we're building, we identified items from the past that we now have the rigor and the focus to fix once and for all. Our shadow factories will be shut down.\nSo this process of transparency and change can be difficult in the moment, but I'm proud of our team. I'm confident we'll look back on this time period as when we got things right and we set Boeing on the right course.\nWe still have work to do, but progress is clear, and our focus is long term. We're on the right path to restoring our operational and financial strength, and we thank you for your patience.\nOkay. Now let's turn it over to questions."

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAnd as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information included in today's press release. Furthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release for presentation -- and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.\n\nThank you, Matt. Welcome, everyone. As usual, I'm going to make a few comments upfront with respect to the quarter. The quarter was solid, very solid for all of our businesses. We continue to make steady progress on our recovery.\nWe do have challenges. The supply chain notably is the most significant, but it's steadily getting better. Overall, we feel good about our operational and financial outlook, including the free cash flow and delivery ranges that we set for 2023 as well as for that 2025 and '26 time frame.\nWe're particularly encouraged by generating $2.6 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. Cash flow is the best metric that we have to measure progress against this recovery. We had a very strong second quarter, and we're confident in the $3 billion to $5 billion target for the year.\nI'd like to highlight a couple of updates around the businesses. Commercial Airplanes had a very solid quarter. Demand remains high. We booked 460 net orders in the second quarter. And we're proud to announce or firm up key orders, I should say, 220 for Air India, and we secured our commitment for up to 300 with Ryanair.\nBroadly, demand is strong and resilient. The need for 42,000 airplanes over the next 20 years is what the industry is telling us. And with demand strong, the supply side of the system is beginning to settle down. Our focus remains on execution and driving stability in the production and the supply chain, and we're making steady progress.\nWe delivered 136 commercial airplanes in the quarter, including 103 737s and 20 787. Given the progress through the first half of the year, we are on the right path to reach our 737 and 787 delivery guidance for the year. And we're steadily increasing our rates on each program with focus on stability every step of the way.\nWith respect to the Spirit quality escapes, the work stoppage and the bridge impairment, all have been contained [indiscernible] remedied as we exit the third quarter. So it will cost us a few deliveries in the quarter itself.\nWe're also progressing across our key development programs: the 737-7, the -10, the 777X and the 777-8F. This quarter is a solid proof point that we're beginning to stabilize our operations and are on the right path, and the financial results speak for themselves.\nSo I'd like to recognize our team and our customers on the 737 MAX return to service. As of this month, the fleet has flown more than 5 million flight hours and over 2 million flights since returning to service, all with exceptional reliability.\nThe return to service in China is now largely complete as well with more than 90% of the 737 MAX aircraft back in service. More broadly, in China, we're encouraged by recent signs of progress. It's an important market for us. We're committed to our customers there, and we'll be ready to deliver when that time comes.\nBoeing defense. In defense and space, we still have more work to improve operating performance, but the portfolio is well positioned, and we're making progress. Results impacted by continuing losses on 3 fixed price development programs, Commercial Crew, the T-7A and the MQ-25 have hit us in the quarter.\nOn Starliner, we're in lockstep with our customer. We prioritize safety, and we're taking whatever time is required. We're confident in that team and committed to getting it right.\nOn MQ-25, schedule pressure added cost to the program, but we've had some recent successes that give us confidence that we're heading in the right direction. We're approximately 25% of the way through the build of our first MQ-25. The static test article fuselage is complete with preparation underway for the start of static testing this quarter.\nAnd on the T-7A, the impact was not due to any performance challenge within the quarter and was more associated with our estimates for higher supply chain and production costs in the future, similar to what many in the industry are facing. Even with the cost growth, we're hitting some key milestones on the program.\nThe Air Force successfully completed its first flight of the T-7. We're heading towards the start of a flight test in earnest. We're looking at the program. And if you look at the program from award to this moment, we've had some very important successes. We moved from firm concept to early flight testing in just 36 months on this program. And a combination of model base [indiscernible], 3D design and our advanced manufacturing increased first-time quality by 75% and reduced our assembly hours by 80%.\nWe're also making progress on other key BDS programs. On the tanker, for example, we have now completed rework on the production aircraft acquiring it, and we have resumed deliveries to the Air Force. As we move through each quarter, we're progressing through these contracts and getting closer to putting them in the rearview mirror.\nDespite the challenges, we're hitting some important milestones that increase our confidence. Most importantly, these programs will meet or beat the high-performance standards of the war fighter.\nGiven the fixed price nature of some of our contracts, we're very transparent about these financial impacts. And we're working to stabilize, to derisk and mature them through development.\nQuarterly charges have declined significantly over the last 18 months. Demand side of BDS is strong. We see solid order activity. In the quarter, we booked orders valued at $6 billion, including key contracts from the U.S. Army for 19 Chinooks, and Germany also shared its plans to purchase 60 Chinooks.\nWe remain confident in our defense business. Demand is strong, and we will continue to improve operational performance to more normalized levels.\nFollowing Global Services, another very strong quarter both on the commercial and government side of BGS, healthy revenue and expanding earnings and margin. We're really proud of this team. They've had solid, steady performance. And they've enabled both commercial and military customers to keep fleets flying through a very dynamic time.\nSome of our highlights this quarter include the expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution site, Japan Airlines adopting Boeing Insight Accelerator, our digital predictive maintenance solution for the 787 fleet.\nTo wrap up my comments, we had no shortage of challenges pop up to the start of this year, and we knew that would be the case. We've had conformance items that we've identified or external challenges within the supply chain, even logistic routes, including washed out [indiscernible].\nThis is a complex business. We expect items to come up. And when they do, we're transparent. We take action, and we move forward. This is what progress looks like. We're proud of the team. We are well positioned for the year and for the long term. Relative to the strong demand, we will remain in a supply-constrained world for the foreseeable future.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. West\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & Corporate Audit and CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the total company financial performance. Second quarter revenue was $19.8 billion. That's up 18% year-over-year. The growth was primarily driven by higher commercial volume, including increased 787 deliveries.\nCore operating margin in the quarter was minus 2%, and the core loss per share was $0.82. Margins and EPS were driven by expected abnormal costs and period expenses as well as losses on 3 fixed price development programs in our defense business, which I'll cover later.\nFree cash flow, as Dave mentioned, was positive $2.6 billion in the quarter, significantly better versus last year and last quarter driven by higher commercial deliveries and favorable receipt timing. Relative to our expectations shared at the last earnings call, the strong order activity in the quarter drove over $2 billion of favorable advanced payment timing. Keep in mind, most of this was expected to incur in the third quarter.\nTurning to the next page, I'll cover Commercial Airplanes. BCA booked 460 net orders in the quarter, including 220 with Air India, 39 with Riyadh Air and signed a purchase agreement with Ryanair for up to 300 737 MAX-10s. We now have over 4,800 airplanes in backlog valued at $363 billion.\nRevenue was $8.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year on 136 airplane deliveries driven by the 87 program. Operating margin was minus 4.3%, a sequential improvement versus the first quarter as anticipated but remains negative as we continue to be impacted by expected abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D spending. As Dave noted, we worked through a number of operational challenges so far this year. We're making steady progress, and we'll continue to focus on stability as we look to increase production on key programs.\nOn the Spirit work stoppage, we were pleased to see a quick resolution, and we will work through any limited impacts to production. Overall, this is not expected to change our production and delivery outlook.\nOn to the programs. On the 737, we had 103 deliveries in the quarter, including 49 in June, a positive proof point that the production system is stabilizing. In regards to the Spirit fitting issue that we discussed last quarter, in May, we resumed deliveries of rework airplanes and also began producing newly built airplanes meeting our specifications.\nIn light of this progress, we are now transitioning production to 38 per month and still plan to increase to 50 per month in the '25, '26 time frame. As we move to the higher rate, we'll continue to prioritize stability, and it will take some time to consistently deliver at 38 per month off the line. We still project full year 737 deliveries of 400 to 450 with sequential improvement in the second half.\nWe ended the quarter with approximately 228 MAX airplanes in inventory. This includes 85 for customers in China and 55 that have now been remarketed as part of the plan we've previously discussed. We still expect most MAX inventory airplane to be delivered by the end of 2024.\nMoving on to the 87 program. We had 20 deliveries in the quarter and still expect between 70 and 80 deliveries this year. We increased production to 4 per month during the quarter and still plan to reach 5 per month by year-end. We ended the quarter with 85 airplanes in inventory, and rework is progressing nicely. And we still expect most to be delivered by the end of 2024.\nWe booked $314 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations. And there's no change to the total estimate of $2.8 billion, which is largely done by year-end.\nFinally, on the 777X program, efforts are ongoing, and the program timeline is unchanged. Abnormal costs were $136 million as expected, and we've lowered our total estimate from $1.5 billion to $1 billion, which reflects plans to resume production later this year rather than early 2024.\nMoving on to the next page and defense and space. BDS booked $6 billion in orders in the quarter, including an award from the U.S. Army for 19 CH-47 Chinooks, and backlog is now at $58 billion. Revenue was flat at $6.2 billion, and we delivered 38 aircraft in the quarter.\nOperating margin was minus 8.5% primarily driven by 3 fixed price development programs. The first was related to Commercial Crew tied to scheduled delays that we've previously shared and had a $257 million impact; the second on MQ-25 related to a schedule shift that drove a $68 million impact; and lastly, on the T-7A production contract, we revised the long-term production cost estimates that will occur over several years starting in the 2025 time frame, which drove an impact of $189 million.\nThese determinations were mostly made over the last few weeks as we closed out the quarter. Similar to last quarter, roughly 60% of the portfolio is generating solid levels of performance, in line with historical margins. But we continue to see operational impacts from labor instability and supply chain disruption on other programs that contributed to lower margins.\nLooking at BDS in aggregate, it will take time to return to normalized levels of performance. We're confident and we're focused on the path to high single-digit margins in 2025, 2026. The strong demand across the customer base, the portfolio is well positioned, and we're focused on execution.\nMoving on to the next page, let's cover services. BGS had another very strong quarter. BGS received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog is $18 billion. Revenue was $4.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year primarily driven by favorable volume and mix in both commercial and government services.\nOperating margin was 18%, an expansion of 110 basis points versus last year with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins. Operating margins in the quarter were higher than expected due to favorable mix, which we don't expect to continue at these levels.\nIn the quarter, BGS announced an expansion in Poland with a new parts distribution site, a collaboration with CAE. And the Japan Airlines has adopted the Boeing Insight Accelerator for their 787 fleet.\nTurning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion of cash and marketable securities. And our debt balance decreased to $52.3 billion. In the quarter, we repaid $3.4 billion of maturing debt and provided a $180 million cash advance to Spirit as previously shared.\nYear-to-date, we've repaid $5.1 billion of debt, which is essentially all of our maturities for the year. We also maintained $12 billion revolving credit facilities at the end of the quarter, all of which remain undrawn.\nOur liquidity position is strong. [indiscernible] grade credit rating continues to be important. And we're deploying capital in line with the priorities we've shared: invest in the business and pay down debt, strong cash flow generation.\nAnd flipping to the last page, I'll cover our outlook. The 2023 overall financial outlook is unchanged from what we previously shared, including $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow generation. The operating cash makeup by division will likely be different with BCA and BGS better than expected and BDS lower than expected due to the lower operating performance. Net-net, we still have confidence in the $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow for the year.\nStepping back to address the state of the market. Commercial demand remains strong across our key programs and services. Cargo remains healthy. Global passenger traffic was up 39% in May and is at 96% of pre-pandemic levels, 105% domestic and 91% international.\nChina pass-through traffic in May was at 87% of pre-pandemic levels with domestic traffic up more than 300% year-on-year and above pre-pandemic levels. Defense demand is also robust, and the FY '24 budget continues to progress in line with our expectations.\nOur portfolio and capabilities are well positioned to support the needs of the nation and of our allies. With demand strong, we still find ourselves in a supply-constrained environment. And our focus continues to be on execution, both within our factories and the supply chain as we steadily increase production.\nRelative to the first half of 2023, we continue to expect operating and financial performance to improve in the second half. On the third quarter specifically, we expect BCA margins to improve sequentially but remain negative, and we're not anticipating much in terms of BDS profitability.\nThe 2Q effective tax rate of 63% included cumulative adjustments related to the projected valuation allowance. These adjustments will continue to weigh on the tax rate for the remainder of the year. And given the strong results in 2Q cash flow, 3Q will be lower sequentially, still positive and likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\nAll things considered, we feel good about where we're at on the road to recovery. Right now, we're squarely focused on meaningful operating performance improvement, including deliveries, revenue, margins and cash flow, all of which will improve as we progress through 2023.\nAnd while the challenges remain, we're headed in the right direction. Ultimately, we expect our operational and financial performance to continue to accelerate, aligned with the plan we laid out at our IR Day last November. And we are confident in $10 billion of free cash flow in 2025, 2026.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dave with some final remarks.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Boeing Co.\n\nAgain, a solid quarter. We are wrestling our way through the BDS contract [indiscernible] price contract exposures that we have. We're confident we will see them through. And as I've said before, most importantly, the products that we deliver, warfighter will perform as or better than expected.\nSo with that, I'll open it up to questions."

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and the slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for Boeing. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nAnalyst, Loomis Sayles\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information is included in today's press release.\nFurthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDavid Calhoun\n\nThanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We had a solid first quarter, and we continue to make real progress, steady progress in our recovery. Challenges remain. There's more to do. But overall, we feel good about the operational and financial outlook shared last November, including cash flow and delivery ranges set for 2023 as well as for the 2025, 2026 time frame, where we can see $10 billion in annual free cash flow.\nLet's start with an update on our 737. Our team has been working hard over the last week. We've been progressing in our early inspection of affected airplanes. The issue's understood. It's isolated to two specific fittings, and we know what we have to do.\nThe work will impact the timing of our deliveries over the next several months. However, we still expect to deliver 450 737 airplanes this year. Unfortunately, the timing of these delivery shortfalls will impact summer capacities for many of our customers, and we feel terrible about that. Deliveries and production will be lower near term, but we will recover over the coming months, and we plan to increase our rate to 38 per month later this year.\nAs mentioned last week, we're also not changing the supplier master schedule to ensure that they can keep pace, and we're comfortable adding parts inventory. Stepping back, we appreciate that Spirit promptly notified us of this issue. They're an important partner. We're working closely on the recovery plan, and we are working in a very constructive way.\nWe will continue to work transparently with the FAA as always. As well, we will work transparently with our customers to support their fleet planning and scheduling requirements. As we mentioned last week, there's no immediate safety of flight issue, and the fleet can continue to operate safely. We will work diligently through this process together. We will prioritize safety. We will prioritize quality and transparency every step of the way.\nTaking a wider view. I couldn't be more proud of the MAX team and the progress that we have made. We now have over 1,000 737 MAX airplanes flying in the fleet. And since our return to service, the fleet has safely flown more than 4 million flight hours with exceptional reliability.\nAnd with respect to China, our focus has been and is on supporting our customers and their return to service. All MAX operators have returned to flying airplanes in service, and 45 of their 95 airplanes are back in the sky.\nIn addition, the CAAC released their 737 Aircraft Evaluation Report. It's an important step toward the delivery of aircraft that are currently in Boeing's possession. We will follow the lead of our customers.\nMoving to BCA. I'll start with orders. Demand remains very strong across all of our product lines. We booked 107 net airplane orders in the first quarter. And on top of this, we were proud to announce major customer commitments earlier this year: Air India, 190 737 MAX, 20 787s and 10 777Xs; and Riyadh Air, the newly established airline in Saudi Arabia; and Saudia, ordering up to 121 787 airplanes.\nOn the subject of deliveries, with strong demand, we're working to meet our customer commitments. We delivered 130 commercial airplanes in the quarter, including a strong month in March with 64 deliveries. However, variation in monthly deliveries remains high, and we still have work to improve stability. Of course, that starts with the 737, as I mentioned earlier.\nOn the subject of production, we are also steadily increasing rates across key programs to meet the robust demand. And we'll prioritize our stability and not push the system too fast. And yes, we will pause when we are notified of defects.\nOn development, we're progressing across all of our key development programs. And certification time lines have not changed on the 737-7, -10 or the 777X.\nNow let me switch to BDS, Boeing Defense. In defense and space, we still have more work to do to improve our operating performance. But our portfolio is well positioned, and our products are performing well in the field.\nFirst quarter results were impacted by the added cost on the KC-46A Tanker program, driven by a supplier quality issue that we previously shared last month. The good news is we understand it, and we're progressing through that rework.\nOn the operational side, the tanker is continuing to perform its mission well. Customers' decision on the KC-Y is a great opportunity for us, and it reflects the capabilities the tanker is delivering for the United States Air Force.\nOn the demand side, we're continuing to see solid order activity. In the quarter, we booked key orders on the tanker, the Apache and E-7. In addition, we are accelerating the delivery of missiles and weapons in response to our customers' needs.\nWe're also encouraged by the initial presidential budget request recently released. It's in line with our expectations. And our portfolio and capabilities are well positioned to support the needs of the nation and our allies, both in the short and the long term. Our defense business is well positioned, and we'll continue to improve operational performance to more normalized levels.\nIn Boeing Global Services, another very strong quarter. Solid, steady performance has enabled both commercial and military customers to keep fleets flying through a very dynamic time. The services business has now fully returned to pre-pandemic levels. I'm very proud of the team and the progress that they have made.\nAll things considered across the businesses, we remain on the right path. We'll work through most recent MAX issue transparently and in partnership with our customers and our suppliers. We're focused on the long term, and we'll continue to drive stability across the business and the supply chain.\nIn our November guidance, we did not predict significant supply chain improvement until well into 2024. We remain in the same place today and share that same view. That said, we've seen improvement, and our line of sight is getting better every day. Demand is strong and our portfolio is well positioned. We have a robust pipeline of development programs, and we're innovating in new capabilities to prepare for the next generation of products.\nLots of work to do, but we're on track to restore our operational and our financial strength. And we still feel good about the outlook that we've shared, both for this year and for our longer term.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian West\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to the next page and cover the total company results. First quarter revenue was $17.9 billion. That's up 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher volume in both commercial and defense.\nCore operating margin was minus 2.5%, and the core loss per share was $1.27, both big improvements versus last year due to higher commercial volume and improved operating performance. Margins and EPS were negative driven by expected abnormal costs and period expenses as well as a charge on the KC-46 Tanker program that I noted last month.\nFree cash flow was a usage of $786 million in the quarter, significantly better versus last year driven by the higher commercial deliveries as well as an advanced payment tied to lot 9 on the tanker program, another important award for the KC-46 franchise. As we noted in our last earnings call, cash was lower this quarter than the fourth quarter due to lower wide-body deliveries and expected seasonality.\nTurning to the next page, I'll cover Commercial Airplanes. Let's start with orders. BCA booked 107 net orders in the quarter, including JAL and Lufthansa, and we have a backlog of over 4,500 airplanes valued at $334 billion.\nMoving to the figures on the left. Revenue was $6.7 billion, up 60% year-over-year, driven by 130 airplane deliveries with increases on both the 87 and the 37 programs, partially offset by 87 customer considerations. Operating margin was minus 9.2%, which was significantly better than last year. But margins are impacted by expected abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D spending.\nLet's take a minute on the 737 program. The 37 had 113 deliveries in the first quarter, up 31% year-over-year, including 53 deliveries in the month of March.\nPicking up where Dave left off regarding the supplier fuselage item. We found the issue. We booked a nonmaterial financial impact in the quarter. We understand the rework steps required, and we started repairs on several airplanes. And although near-term deliveries will be impacted, we still expect to deliver between 400 and 450 737s this year.\nApril and 2Q deliveries will be lower, but the first half monthly average will be about 30 airplanes per month, in line with what we said previously. The second half deliveries are expected to be around 40 per month, with sequential quarterly improvement in the back half. While the high end of the delivery range is pressured, ultimate performance will be dictated by the pace of the fuselage recovery.\nRegarding inventory, we ended the quarter with approximately 225 MAX airplanes in inventory, including 138 that were built for customers in China and roughly 30 -7s and -10s. Within these 225 inventoried airplanes, roughly 75% will require the fuselage rework. And the number of inventoried airplanes will likely increase in 2Q, and we still expect most to be delivered by the end of 2024.\nOn production, we're completing airplanes in final assembly and expect to recover in the coming months, paced by fuselage availability. We're supporting Spirit through this recovery, including manufacturing and engineering resources as well as a cash advance. To support overall supply chain stability, we're not changing the master schedule, including anticipated production rate increases and we've contemplated any near-term parts inventory builds into our forward look.\nWithin final assembly, as Dave mentioned, we expect to increase our rate to 38 per month later this year and 50 per month in the '25, '26 time frame.\nMoving on to the 787 program. We had 11 deliveries in the first quarter and still expect 70 to 80 deliveries this year. We're producing at 3 per month and still plan to reach 5 per month by year-end. We ended the quarter with 95 airplanes in inventory, most of which will be delivered by the end of 2024.\nWe booked 379 of abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations, and there's no change to the total estimate of $2.8 billion. We still expect abnormal to be largely done by the end of this year.\nFinally, on the 777X program, efforts are ongoing. Both the program time line and the abnormal estimate of $1.5 billion are unchanged. We booked $126 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations.\nWith that, let's turn to the next page and go through defense and space. BDS booked $10 billion in orders during the quarter, including awards for the U.S. Air Force for 15 KC-46 Tankers and an E-7 development contract as well as 184 Apaches for the U.S. Army. The BDS backlog is $58 billion.\nMoving to the figures on the left. Revenue was $6.5 billion, up 19% year-over-year, driven by the KC-46 Tanker award, program milestone completions and underlying volume. We delivered 39 aircraft and 3 satellites in the quarter and also began production of the MH-139 Grey Wolf.\nOperating margin was minus 3.2%, significantly higher than last year but still negative, driven by a $245 million pretax charge on the tanker program, which I noted last month.\nLet me give you a little bit of context on the overall BDS portfolio. Remember, 15% of the revenues in the quarter are the firm fixed-price development contracts. These contracts get a lot of attention, and there is a commitment to derisk these programs as much as we can as we move through the development cycles and into full-scale, stable production.\nNext and importantly, over 60% of revenues in the quarter collectively delivered double-digit margins. We have many important programs that are performing to historical performance levels.\nThe balance of the 1Q revenue is made up of a small number of established programs that are experiencing negative margins on certain contracts due to specific near-term supply chain and factory stability pressures that we've highlighted previously. It will take time to work through these issues, and we fully expect that these programs will improve through the course of this year and return to normal margin levels over time.\nThe BDS team is fully committed delivering the development programs to our customers. We've implemented new contracting disciplines, accelerated efforts around lean manufacturing and we're investing in innovation and in our people, all of which underpin our plans going forward.\nOverall, the defense portfolio is well positioned. There's strong demand across the customer base, the products are performing in the field, and we're confident that our efforts to drive execution and stability will return this business to performance levels that our investors would recognize.\nTurning to the next page, I'll cover Global Services. As Dave mentioned, BGS had another very strong quarter. We received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, and the backlog is $19 billion.\nLooking to the figures on the left. Revenue was $4.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by our commercial parts and distribution business. Operating margin was 17.9%, an expansion of 330 basis points versus last year, with both our commercial and government businesses delivering double-digit margins. Operating margins in the quarter were higher than expected due to favorable mix, and we don't assume that will repeat.\nIn the quarter, BGS announced the first Boeing Converted Freighter line in India, delivered AerCap's 50th 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter and broke ground on a new component operations facility in Jacksonville, Florida.\nTurning to the next page, I'll cover cash and debt. We ended the quarter with $14.8 billion of cash and marketable securities, and our debt balance decreased to $55.4 billion. We paid down $1.7 billion of debt maturities in the quarter and absorbed the expected cash flow usage driven by seasonality. We also had $12 billion of revolving credit facilities at the end of the quarter, all of which remain undrawn.\nOur liquidity position is very strong. The investment-grade credit rating is a priority, and we're deploying capital in line with the priorities we've shared: generate strong cash flow, invest the business and pay down debt.\nAnd flipping to the last page on our outlook. The 2023 financial outlook is unchanged from what we previously shared, including $3 billion to $5 billion of free cash flow generation. Commercial demand remains strong across our key programs and services. Passenger traffic in February increased over 55% year-over-year and is at 85% of pre-pandemic levels, comprised [indiscernible] domestic and 78% international. Defense demand is robust, and the initial FY '24 presidential budget is in line with expectations. As Dave mentioned, our portfolio and capabilities are well positioned to support the needs of the nation and of our allies.\nOn the supply chain front, as you'll recall when we set out our 2023 framework last November, we predicted the supply chain instability would likely continue. The good news is that we plan for it within our financial and delivery guidance. There's progress in many areas of the supply base, but we will likely face pockets of variability through the rest of this year. We continue to make key investments, including higher inventory buffers and forward deployment of resources as we take appropriate actions to mitigate impacts and improve predictability.\nFrom a quarterly perspective, we continue to expect financials to improve throughout the year. On 2Q specifically, we expect core EPS will be roughly in line with 1Q '23 performance absent the tanker charge, as the 737 delivery impacts would be largely offset by higher wide-body deliveries.\nWe expect free cash flow to be breakeven to slightly negative as we work through the 37 recovery. All things considered, we feel good about what's in front of us. And we remain on track to achieve our long-term guidance, including $10 billion of free cash flow in the '25, '26 time frame.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Dave for any closing comments.\n\nDavid Calhoun\n\nYes, not much to add. Just a reminder that in November, when we did finally set out guidance for all of our investors, we described an environment that would continue to be strained through 2023 and through most of 2024. We still see the world exactly that way. Demand is as robust, if not more than what we had thought back in November, and so we remain confident.\nSo thanks for your time, and let's take some questions."

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. (Operator Instructions) At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVP of IR, The Boeing Company\n\nThank you, and good morning. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation at boeing.com. As always, detailed financial information is included in today's press release.\nFurthermore, projections, estimates and goals included in today's discussion involve risks including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Matt. Good morning. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Last time we were together was the second of November, where we had a chance for the first time, at least in my 3-year tenure to talk about guidance and expectations for the years ahead. The good news is we had a very solid fourth quarter, a quarter that, in my view, puts us in good stead to step forward and meet the guidance that we have delivered to all of you.\nNot only have we taken big steps to reduce the risks that, of course, we've faced over the last 3 years but importantly, we're well on our way to restoring the operational and financial strength that we got used to prior to our MAX moment. Challenges remain, we have a lot to do, but overall, we're feeling pretty good about the way we closed '22 and we're well positioned for '23 and beyond.\nOur key metric, as everybody knows, is free cash flow. Importantly, we were able to generate more than $3 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter driven by the progress in our performance and importantly, continued strong demand. And this helped us generate positive full year cash flow for the first time since 2018, a very important turnaround metric for us.\nSeveral key milestones and events that I'd like to highlight. Let's start with the BCA deliveries, which I know everyone tracks. '22 total was 480 with 69 deliveries in December. Notably, the 737 deliveries, we had 387 and exceeded our target of 375 and it included 31 787s as we unwound inventory and delivered from the production line following the important return to delivery over the course of the summer.\nOn the order front, and on the market side, we continue to see very strong demand across the portfolio. More than 800 net orders on the year, driven by the 737 MAX and the 787 highlighted most recently by the very historic deal with UAL, United Airlines in December. In 2022, we sold 200-plus net wide bodies. That's the most since 2018.\nMore broadly, the 737 MAX team has made tremendous progress. Fleet is performing exceptionally well. Production is stabilizing, demand is strong. We delivered 1,000-plus 737 MAXs in total now. And since our return to service, the fleet has surpassed 3 million flight hours. It's safe and it's the most reliable of the airplane fleets.\nProduction, we've all gone from 0 to 31 a month and we're prioritizing stability, which we have not yet achieved, but we're on a steady course to do so. And orders, more than 1,500 gross orders to date. 737 MAX returning to service in China is another indication of this overall improvement in our business.\nThis month, of course, we all know that, that occurred. We have more airplanes on the tarmac in China to bring back into service just as we did here in the U.S. before we began any deliveries of any sort. And I'm not going to guess going forward, when deliveries may or may not start, as everyone knows in our guidance, we have derisked for that possibility.\n737 MAX 7 and 10, everybody knows, we got our extension approved and attached to legislation at the end of the year. That was a very important moment. I'll remind everyone that, that doesn't mean that these were certified. It simply means that the FAA and Boeing can follow the existing application and do that job and do it the right way. So we feel very, very good about having derisked that moment as well. I will also want to point out, every argument we made on behalf of that extension related to safety. The premise for our chosen course and the application that we filed with safety first and it will always be safety first.\nFollowing defense. Our SLS launch, this was an enormous emotional upper for our company and for our team broadly. The Artemis I launch in November, which was powered by the SLS rocket was more than a little inspiring. And I'd like to congratulate the NASA team broadly for the succession of the Starliner mission.\nIt's an incredible success, incredible, and it went beautifully and almost flawlessly every step of the way. So again, a significant accomplishment for space travel in general. But that rocket, again, just shows what Boeing is capable of when we put our minds to it, we follow our disciplines, we stay patient and ultimately prove to the world that there's more to do in space.\nFollowing Global Services, another terrific story, it is simply following the recovery of our industry in general and everywhere in the world. So we had a great quarter pretty much across the board. We continue to grow. We continue to invest so that we are prepared to support our customers as they bring their airlines back to where they were before COVID. So we'll reaffirm our guidance.\nAnd with this progress, which we feel good about both the financial and the operational outlook that we shared with you in November, and that includes the cash flow, the delivery ranges that we set for '23 as well as for the 2025 and 2026 time frame.\nOur realities are still the same, a difficult, difficult supply chain. And while average deliveries met our objectives, we continue to face a few too many stoppages in our lines simply so that we do not travel work as we run into supply chain shortfalls. So those stoppages, while they are coming down are not where they need to be as we think about stable rates going forward.\nI will not, in this discussion and/or in Q&A, highlight any 1 supplier within the supply chain. Know that we're working with all of them. There's a significant amount of transparency in those discussions between them, between us and everybody is focused on the rate improvements that we have outlined to all of you. All things considered and reflecting on these last few years, we're feeling pretty good about where we stand heading into this year.\nDemand, very strong portfolio, very well positioned. We have faced plenty of tests in a number of orders all around the world with some of our toughest customers, and we know this portfolio is well positioned. We have a robust pipeline of development programs, including broadly across our defense business, and we're innovating new capabilities that prepare us for the next generation of products.\nOne of the more significant achievements was recently announced by NASA in their Sustainable Flight Demonstrator contract. This is a set of technologies that's intending to cut fuel emissions by up to 30%. Those are the kind of standards that, in our view, are required to ultimately launch a new commercial airplane wrapped in sustainability.\nWe've derisked major aspects of the business, and our performance is improving. We're embedding lean across our operations to drive productivity ultimately to achieve the kinds of targets that we've set out. We've got work to do, but we're feeling really good about our progress. We're proud of our team, and we're confident in the future. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian West.\n\nBrian J. West\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to the next page and cover the fourth quarter financial results. Revenue in the fourth quarter came in at $20 billion. That's up 35% year-over-year, driven by higher commercial volume. Core operating margin was negative 3.3%, and the core loss per share was $1.75. Both the margin and the loss per share were significantly better than prior year and impacted in the quarter by period expenses and abnormal costs.\nFrom a free cash flow perspective, our primary financial metric was positive $3.1 billion for the quarter, up significantly versus the prior year on higher deliveries and strong order activity and up sequentially versus the prior quarter and a bit better than our original estimate. I'll take a minute to go through each of the business units. Moving on to the next page with BCA. BCA revenue in the fourth quarter was $9.2 billion.\nThat's up 94% year-over-year driven by higher 787 and 737 deliveries, partially offset by 787 customer considerations. On the operating margins, they were negative 6.8% in the quarter, seemingly better than a year ago and in the quarter driven by abnormal costs and higher period expenses, including higher R&D spending.\nI'll take a minute to go through a few highlights of the major programs, starting with the 737. We had 110 deliveries in the fourth quarter and 387 for the full year, slightly ahead of our estimate. We ended the year with 250 MAX airplanes in inventory, 30 of which were Dash 7 and Dash 10s, and we had 138 for customers in China.\nWe do expect the monthly deliveries from inventory to slow slightly as fewer airplanes will be available, combined with some impact from the Dash 7, Dash 10 builds. We still expect most inventoried airplanes will be delivered by the end of 2024. On the 787, we had 22 deliveries in the fourth quarter and 31% for the full year. We ended the year with 100 airplanes in inventory, most of which will be delivered by the end of 2024.\nWe booked $350 million of abnormal costs in the quarter, taking the total to date to $1.7 billion. We're increasing the abnormal accounting estimate by about $600 million to roughly $2.8 billion in total as we will be under the 5 per month production rate a bit longer than expected due to a supplier constraint that has temporarily slowed production.\nWe still expect to hit 5 per month this year. Our total year delivery guidance of 70 to 80 is unchanged, and there is no change to the 2023 cash flows. 77 orders were strong in the quarter, and we've added 100 airplanes to the accounting quantity, which increases our GAAP program margin. On the 777X, the program timeline is holding and efforts are ongoing. Abnormal costs were $112 million in the quarter, and there is no change to the $1.5 billion total estimate.\nOn the customer settlement front, we continue to make good progress resolving contractual issues on the 3 big programs. The 737 MAX is near the finish line with the vast majority of customers settled.\nOf the original $9.3 billion that [were] set aside, there's only 3% left. On the 787, a year ago, we included a significant provision in the program, which has been very stable. There are far fewer customers in the MAX, and we've already reached agreement with several, all in line with our estimates. On the 777X, there are even fewer customers and discussions are ongoing.\nKeep in mind that the revenue and cash impact of these settlements will be over several years and all contemplated in both the near- and long-term financial guidance. Finally, on the orders front for BCA, we booked 376 orders in the quarter and have over 4,500 airplanes in backlog valued at $330 billion.\nMoving on to the next page, I'll cover BDS. BDS revenues in the fourth quarter were $6.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Operating margins were 1.8%. And if you include services, defense margins would be 200 basis points higher to 4%. There are 2 things impacting BDS margins in the quarter.\nFirst, we felt the operational impact of supply chain constraints in labor and stability. Second, we saw adverse timing of certain cost accrual true-ups, including higher pension costs that flow through the P&L in the quarter a big focus for the BDS leadership team to improve execution stability both in the factory and in the supply base.\nSome additional highlights, as Dave mentioned, we're very proud of Artemis I successful mission to the moon last November, and we delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, including the first P8 to New Zealand as well as 3 satellites, including the first 2 O3B mPower units. We received $7 billion in orders during the quarter. including a contract for 2 KC-46A Tankers from Japan and an award for 12 Chinook helicopters from the Egyptian Air Force. The BDS backlog is at $54 billion.\nMoving on to the next page, Global Services. BGS had another strong quarter, primarily driven by our parts and distribution business. BGS revenue was $4.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year and operating margin was 13.9%.\nCommercial volume was very strong, partially offset by some softness in the government space. We received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including an F-15 depot support order for the U.S. Air Force, and we opened up the Germany distribution center. The BGS backlog is $19 billion.\nMoving on to the full year, the next page. Full year financial results, revenue came in at $66.6 billion. That's 5% up year-over-year driven by higher commercial volume, offset by lower defense revenue. Core operating margin was negative 7% and the core loss per share was over $11 both a bit worse reflecting the impact of defense charges taken earlier in the year.\nAnd on free cash flow, we generated $2.3 billion positive free cash flow in the year up significantly from the prior year driven by higher deliveries and order activity. Moving on to the next page. I just want to put that $2.3 billion of free cash flow in perspective.\nAs you can see from the chart on the left, we've made a lot of progress over the last 3 years. 2020 was a usage of $20 billion of cash, 2021 improved but was still a usage of $4 billion of cash, in 2022, $2.3 billion positive. As Dave mentioned, a lot of work that's been done and more work to do.\nThe team is pretty proud to get back to positive territory. It's been the 737 return to service and the deliveries that are ramping. It's been the 787, it's been restarted. It's been the commercial market recovery that's been a benefit along the way with a very strong order book, reflecting our customers' confidence in our product lineup. And of course, our service business has held up incredibly well. It was a good exit to 2022, and we expect momentum to continue for 2023.\nMoving on to the next page, cash and debt. On the cash and marketable securities front, we ended the year with $17.2 billion, up $3 billion versus the third quarter and we had $12 billion of revolving credit facilities, all of which remain undrawn.\nOn the debt side, we finished the year with $57 billion in debt. And as a reminder, our investment-grade credit rating continues to be a top priority. Our liquidity position is strong, and we're very comfortable satisfying near-term maturities, and the overall plan continues to be deliver airplanes, generate cash, pay down debt.\nMoving on to the next page, 2023. Our financial outlook for 2023 is unchanged from what we shared in November. Operating cash flow in total will be between $4.5 billion and $6.5 billion. We'll reinvest about $1.5 billion in CapEx for a net free cash flow of $3 billion to $5 billion in 2023.\nAs we start the year, overall demand remains strong. Global pass-through traffic increased almost 70% in 2022, and we're at 75% of pre-pandemic levels globally. If you take out China, that number grows to over 90%. So demand is pretty robust and reflective of our order book. Our priority continues to be execution stability. And while we still see some disruptions in the factory and the supply chain, we're hard at work with our partners to address these issues and ultimately focused on meeting our customer commitments.\nOn the segment operating cash flow, same numbers as November, BDS, we expect to be a usage of between $0.5 billion and $1 billion of cash. BGS will generate between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, and BCA will generate between $2.5 million and $3.5 billion. On the commercial delivery front, 737 deliveries are unchanged and between 400 and 450 airplanes, 787 deliveries are unchanged between 70 and 80 airplanes, and we've added a couple of items on the expense front.\nWe expect R&D for 2023 to come in at about $3.2 billion versus $2.9 billion in 2022. The vast majority of this increase will be in BCA. We also have unallocated eliminations in other which will be relatively in line with 2022 at $1.6 billion. One important thing to note is on the quarterly phasing, it will look very similar to last year as both deliveries and the financials will improve throughout the course of the year.\nOn the first quarter specifically, EPS will be an improvement over 4Q 2022 but remain in a loss position. And cash will still be a usage in the first quarter, although an improvement from the first quarter of 2022. Overall, we're squarely focused on free cash flow. And it's so far so good as we enter 2023.\nMoving on to the last page, 2025, 2026 long-term guidance. Same page we showed you in November, $10 billion of free cash flow is still our objective. And it's important to note that margins and EPS are important, but they will be uneven over the next 2 years. As we unwind the BCA inventory, we put the BCA abnormal costs behind us, and we get the BDS margins back on track to its normal trajectory.\nWe're still confident that this plan is underpinned by things we largely control, one, productivity; two, the commercial rate ramp; three, services growth; and four, the transition of key defense programs from development to production. Overall, we're as confident today as we're back in November, and we feel good about the way 2023 is starting. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave for any final comments.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nYes. I think, Brian, the numbers speak for themselves. We couldn't be more pleased with the way the year closed with very few surprises. We're heading into the year. We know the supply chain is going to be tough and constrained, but we also believe that we control that environment. It's our job to get ahead of it. So thank you. We're happy to take some questions."

Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session, are being broadcast live over the Internet. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVP of IR, The Boeing Company\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today.\nProjections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nMatt, thanks. Welcome to everybody. Thanks for joining us. I will acknowledge upfront that our plans for the investor conference middle of next week. We're looking forward to them. We hope we can give some guideposts for the forward look in the Boeing company. So many of our comments today will be a little shorter than usual and focused strictly on the quarter.\nThis quarter was a big one for us. We hit a marker, a marker we've set since the beginning of our turnaround effort in the beginning of 2020, and that was to generate positive free cash flow. So we generated $2.9 billion in the quarter. That puts us on the path that we projected for 2022, which was positive. So again, a very important accomplishment for us and I think begins the real turning point for the company.\nAt the same time, we took a charge on our fixed-price development contracts. These are contracts that we have talked about now repeatedly on these calls. We believe, as we always do, that the charge that we took is meant to complete these contracts ultimately to deliver them to satisfy customers in the Air Force or the armed forces. And anyway, we're not embarrassed by them. They are what they are, and we intend to deliver against these contracts and satisfy our customers.\nWithout a doubt, and you've heard it from all of the earnings calls over the course of the week, the supply chain, inflation, labor shortages, macroeconomic challenges are challenging for everybody. That is reflected in these third quarter calls. Again, the charges in our fixed price development world, et cetera, all of that's embedded. We're not anticipating or suggesting that the supply chain world is going to get much better in the near term. We expect it will continue to be challenged over the course of 2023.\nOne of our problems is not demand. Demand is very strong. It's strong across the portfolio of products, and it's strong across the world with all of our customers. Why? Because their demand is strong. Bookings in pretty much every geography is strong with the exception of China. But also there are concerns about the very supply constraints that we're all referring to sort of force them to want to get in line and get their orders in so that they have the lift they need as the world returns to some normal state.\nWhat's our job in this supply-constrained world? We're in the factories, we don't push the system too fast. We slow down when we have to and we try not to compound problems that may arise from the supply chain or from our own shops. We've added more than 10,000 people this year, and we are investing in training and development to accelerate their experience curve and improve our productivity over time. And we're driving stability in the supply chain. We've introduced all kinds of on-site technology, digital tools to watch what they're doing, but also we've added people to those organizations that are more challenged than others. And we've increased inventory, safety stock wherever we can. Truth is it will still take time to normalize. And our objective in the investor conference that lies ahead is to give you that projection as to how and when we think that is likely to happen.\nDespite the challenges, I'm very pleased with the progress broadly. Our 87 deliveries have returned. It's a reflection on us focusing on the right things. Strict conformance with respect to our manufacturing processes is very important. We've gotten it right, and the delivery process has started, and so far, so good.\nOn the 737 MAX, return to service. Again, philosophy is one at a time. 1 million revenue flights, exceptional schedule reliability, that's what we've experienced. And that is why the folks who have leaned into the MAX continue to lean into the MAX and continue to place orders with us. In total, over the quarter, 227 orders for airplanes, West Jet, UPS, Cargolux, China Airlines, just a few, again, very strong. You probably have seen today, Alaska has upped their commitment to the MAX, and we greatly appreciate it from all of them.\nIn a strong demand and yet supply-constrained world, our inventory, the fixed -- finished goods inventory that we have is an asset, not a liability, and we use it to de-risk that delivery outlook. And as for China, we continue to derisk. That's been our objective. We still would like to deliver airplanes to China. We continue to support our customers. We continue to support the regulator. As we all know, the COVID restrictions and policies in China have reduced demand for airplanes in general. And we hope that is what is restricting the acceptance of our -- of the airplanes that they have on our tarmac. But we also have clear eyed about the geopolitical risks that are out there, and we are not going to impart new risks on our investors, and we believe we can derisk what we have.\nWe're progressing on our development programs, the -7, the -10, the 777-9 and the -8 freighter. All of these are progressing well. As everybody knows, we are up against a deadline here at the end of the year. We remain confident that we can get an extension of that deadline because this is the safe answer. And we've heard from airlines, we've heard from pilots, we've heard from our workers, associates, and we know that the FAA has been putting in the work to certify these airplanes. So we remain not just hopeful but confident that we can get this across the finish line.\nAnd then those airplanes, as many of you know, complete that narrow-body portfolio in a way that allows us to compete head-to-head with our important competitor, Airbus. BDS, Boeing Defense, yes, we have these fixed price development challenges. But we have a rich portfolio. We delivered 4 MH-139 Grey Wolf test aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. We received contracts for additional KC-46A tankers for both the U.S. Air Force and the Israeli Air Force. And despite the challenges on our real development programs that the tanker T7 and MQ-25, we still remain confident in the long-term success and contribution to our cash flow.\nAnd then Boeing services, BGS, just another very strong quarter. They're trying to keep up with demand the best they can. They delivered their 100th contracted 737-800 Boeing freighter conversion to AerCap. We've got key awards in both commercial and defense customers and things are going well and margins continue to expand.\nAnd then finally, we have not stopped investing in our foundational capabilities. We had some pretty good examples of that over the course of the quarter. We opened 3 advanced facilities across the country, composite fabrication, additive manufacturing and an important autonomy investment alongside MIT just in Cambridge.\nAlso very excited about Wisk's unveiling of the world's first autonomous self-flying 4-seat all electric vertical takeoff and landing air taxi. There's a very bright future ahead for that. And with respect to autonomy and its advancement in the world of certification, it's a very, very important part of our strategy.\nSo we're making great progress. I feel good about our turnaround. I do think the cash flow numbers in the quarter are, in fact, a marker for us. We've been focused on it. We will continue to manage the company on the basis of the cash economics that we support our investors with. And that will be that. So I'm happy to turn it over to Brian now for some color on the quarter.\n\nBrian J. West\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nThanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right in. Cash flow, as Dave mentioned, is our primary financial metric, and it was positive in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion, and free cash flow was $2.9 billion, both up pretty significantly versus both prior year and prior quarter, essentially driven by higher deliveries and some receipt timing. Revenue earnings both impacted by charges in our defense business, where we took a $2.8 billion hit across 5 fixed price development programs, which I'll go into.\nThe macro environment challenges that Dave described required us to make certain adjustments, including a reassessment of future period cost forecast. These adjustments are important to our go-forward momentum as we derisk our defense portfolio and move to more predictable performance. And we still think about our performance in 3 parts and are positioning ourselves for an improving trajectory.\nFirst, we have reached important milestones across the business and made progress on commercial deliveries with the resumption of the 787 in August. Also, the 737 MAX return to service is largely complete, and we're derisking the near-term delivery skyline for China.\nNext, we started to see improvement in our primary financial metric of free cash flow. This third quarter performance puts us on track to be positive for both the second half and the full year of 2022.\nAnd finally, as we look to 2023, our operational and financial performance should continue to improve. Now the acceleration will not be as significant as previously anticipated, and our path to recovery is taking a bit longer than expected driven by the challenging macro environment. The longer term, there is a significant opportunity for our company to return to sustainable growth. As we liquidate the 37 and the 87 inventory, we improved execution on a de-risked BBS portfolio and achieve certification on the MAX -7, the -10 and the 777X development programs. We look forward to sharing our plans at our investor conference next week.\nBefore getting into the financials, I want to make a few points on the current business environment. Slide 3. While the turnaround is taking a bit longer, one thing that remains strong is demand for airplanes, as the commercial market recovery is playing out better than expected. We still see overall passenger traffic returning to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. And although the economic indicators point to challenges ahead, this demand has proven resilient.\nIn August, domestic traffic was at 85% of 2019 levels led by the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Going forward, the recovery will be driven by China domestic and international traffic, which remain below 2019 levels at 62% and 67%, respectively. In aggregate, commercial passenger traffic was at 74% of 2019 levels. So even with economic headwinds, we see the strength of demand continuing as air traffic recovers to its historic levels.\nIn Defense & Space, we see solid long-term markets, both domestically and internationally. In the U.S., there's broad support for increased defense spending in Congress to meet current challenges. And internationally, ongoing global tensions are driving our partners and our allies to announce plans for increased spending and additional capabilities for national defense, and we're working hard to support their needs. In services, our business is well positioned with a broad set of offerings and will continue to benefit from the growing commercial fleet, a robust cargo market and increasing defense budgets.\nTurning to the supply chain. Constraints continue to impact production in both our commercial and defense businesses. On the commercial side, we're focused on a few key areas, namely engine deliveries, which is the primary constraint to 737 production rate stabilization and subsequent increases. Customers are counting on us to resolve the situation with our supply chain partners, and we will. We're taking actions to mitigate these impacts and support the supply chain. And as Dave described, we've increased our on-site presence at first tier and sub-tier suppliers to support work movement and address industry-wide shortages.\nAnd we're utilizing our own internal fabrication for surge capacity and managing safety stock inventory levels and increasing where necessary to protect risk. With overall healthy demand, finished goods inventory and a diverse backlog, we feel well positioned to navigate the current environment and are confident that our product lineup is well suited to meet our customer needs.\nWith that backdrop, let's turn to the financials on Slide 4. Third quarter revenue of $16 billion increased 4% and Core operating earnings were negative $3.1 billion, resulting in a loss per share of $6.18, largely driven by $2.8 billion of defense charges. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow, a significant improvement from the same period last year primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and favorable receipt timing. Also, similar to the same period last year, we benefited from a tax refund of $1.5 billion in the quarter.\nLet's move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $6.3 billion, up 40% primarily driven by the resumption of the 787 and higher 737 deliveries. Operating losses of $0.6 billion and the resulting negative margin rate reflect abnormal costs and period expenses.\nOn the 87 program, we delivered 9 airplanes in the quarter and have 115 airplanes in inventory. The pace of deliveries from inventory going forward will be based on finishing rework as well as customer fleet planning requirements. We expect most of these airplanes to be delivered over the next 2 years. We continue to produce at low rate and will gradually return to 5 airplanes per month over time. Near term, the supply chain remains a key watch item for 87 production and deliveries. Longer term, with more than 400 airplanes in backlog, we anticipate higher production rates due to the expected wide-body market recovery.\nAs customers return to medium-term fleet planning, we continue to have positive discussions with our customers on the 87. We recorded [$303] million of 87 abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations, and we still anticipate a total of about $2 billion, the most will be incurred by the end of 2023. These costs are driven by rework and production rates below 5 per month.\nMoving on to the 37 program. We delivered 88 airplanes in the quarter, below our previous expectations, primarily due to supply chain disruptions, which impacted factory flow time. We continue to work towards stabilizing deliveries. However, given our delivery to date, we now estimate about 375 737 airplanes this year. The monthly delivery trend is expected to remain in the low 30s into next year.\nWe ended the quarter with 270 MAX airplanes in inventory, down 20 versus last quarter. There were 35 deliveries out of storage, largely in line with our plan, but we also began positioning for MAX 7 deliveries and built 13 airplanes in the quarter. Of the inventoried airplanes, 138 are for customers in China. We continue to explore options to remarket some of these airplanes as we derisk our near-term delivery plan. Based on our latest assessment of China and the -7 -10 certification time lines, we now expect most of the inventoried airplanes to deliver in 2023 and 2024 with some moving into 2025.\nMoving on to the 777-9 program. Development efforts are ongoing, and the program time line is unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025 and continue to coordinate with the FAA to prioritize resources across our development programs.\nWe booked $111 million of 777X abnormal costs in the third quarter, in line with our expectations, and we still expect to record about $1.5 billion of these costs through 2023, while 777-9 production remains paused. During the quarter, we booked 227 commercial airplane orders, as Dave mentioned, the customers who are proud to serve. In September alone, we received orders for each of our programs, including the 737 MAX, the 767, 787, 777, 777X. And at the end of the third quarter, we had over 4,300 airplanes in backlog valued at $307 billion.\nLet's now move to Defense, Space and Security on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $5.3 billion down 20%, and operating margin was negative 52.7%. Results were driven by approximately $2.8 billion of losses on certain fixed price development programs. KC-46A and VC-25B made up the bulk of these charges at $1.2 billion and $766 million, respectively. We also recorded losses on the T-7A, MQ-25 in commercial crew programs and saw pressures across other programs. These losses reflect a comprehensive review of program financial estimates. While some changes resulted from new information or developments during the quarter, others were the result of our most recent assessment of estimated future performance. Adjustments were primarily due to higher estimated manufacturing and supply chain costs as well as technical challenges, which are expected to continue longer than anticipated.\nThe cash impact of the losses we recorded year-to-date are now heavily weighted in the near term, resulting in a cash flow usage at BDS for both 2022 and 2023. While current performance doesn't reflect where we'd like to be, for sure, we're focused on driving execution stability. These programs have an outsized impact on BDS margins and will be key to margin recovery in future periods.\nOn the demand side, we received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including tanker awards from both the U.S. and Israel, resulting in BDS backlog of $55 billion. Additionally, the Apache helicopter has been selected by the Polish military.\nNow let's turn to Global Services results on Slide 7. The Global Services business had another strong quarter primarily driven by our parts and distribution business. Third quarter revenue was $4.4 billion up 5%, and operating margin was 16.5%. Results were driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix partially offset by lower government volume. We received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including a tanker support contract for the Italian Air Force and an F/A-18 depot expansion contract. The BGS backlog is $19 billion.\nWith highly valued commercial capabilities and support for our defense portfolio, our service business is positioned to see continued growth. Based on what we've seen so far this year, we anticipate healthy total services top line growth for 2022 and similar growth in 2023.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 and cover cash and debt. We ended the third quarter with strong liquidity with $14.3 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, an improvement of $2.9 billion since the end of the second quarter driven by free, cash flow generation. During the quarter, due to our improving cash flow and business outlook, we chose to reduce the size of our revolving credit facility capacity from $14.7 billion to $12 billion, which remains undrawn.\nYear-to-date operating cash flow was a generation of $55 million, and free cash flow usage year-to-date was $841 million. We expect our primary financial metric free cash flow to be positive for the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by commercial deliveries.\nOur debt balance is consistent with the end of the last quarter at $57.2 billion. Our investment-grade credit rating is a priority, and we remain committed to reducing debt levels through strong cash flow generation over time.\nIn conclusion, while we have more work to do, we're executing on our turnaround, and we've come quite a long way over the last 3 years. We remain focused on our own performance and taking the right actions to drive stability and growth for the future. We also continue to invest in key capabilities that will lay the foundation for the future. And through it all, our team is demonstrating exceptional resilience and dedication. More work ahead, but we're confident that we're on the right path. With that, over to Dave for closing comments.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nYes, I'll keep it short and sweet. We're on a turnaround. We've been on a turnaround. We've made very important progress with our regulators. We've made very important product -- progress with our customers and even more importantly, the flying public. And now we're wrestling through supply chain constraints. And when we get through it all, we'll get back to normal and ultimately deliver what our shareholders are expecting. So I'll leave it at that and open up to questions."

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company.

I am Matt Welch, and with me is Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAnd as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation.\nIn addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation.\n(technical difficulty)\n\nOperator\n\nAnd this is John with AT&T, please continue.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nStart over? Okay. Sorry, we were muted. It's good to be with all of you. Thanks, Matt, for the intro. I want to start my brief comments upfront with just a revisit at the Farnborough Air Show a little over a week ago. It was important for us. It was an emotional outcoming for our company and our people.\nWe always look a little better when we are standing next to our products and the flight teams who are operating them. It was great to see, and I think everyone witnessed the 777X in flight, which was more than magnificent, the Dash 10 also in flight and our investment in Wisk and its product in the important eVTOL market.\nWe met with our customers, we met with suppliers, partners, the usual, except it didn't feel like the usual because it had been a while. We're proud of the orders that we collected over the course of that week, over 200 orders and commitments. And importantly, it covered the whole line, the 737 MAX, our 87 and the 777X. And it shows the extent to which our airlines are already -- our airline customers are already anticipating fleet renewal projects and their willingness to bet forward on that prospect. Needless to say, they're all as busy as they can be trying to get their own fleets up and running and the supply constraints they face dealt with.\nLooking at the quarter, a lot of things good happened over the quarter. We are on the verge of returning to the 87 delivery process. I won't give a date. I never have. That's up to the FAA. But we've been working closely with our customers and the regulator on those final steps.\nWe're proud of our team. We're proud for the discipline and the detailed work they applied over this long course. And it will be worth it. In the end, we'll have a predictable and high-quality line, and our customers will be pleased with the products. And a reminder to everyone that this 87 fleet that's out there has been working harder than it's ever worked. And it's been performing incredibly well.\nTurning to the MAX. Again, one airplane at a time, the fleet is performing incredibly well, oftentimes exceeding the specification and expectations our customers had when they originally placed their orders.\nAnd we continue to work hard on predictability of the delivery chain. And we're focused mostly on the engine supply lines and then those second-tier constraints that those engine suppliers are facing. And I think we've made an awful lot of progress on that front. Brian will give you sort of our best guess on how this year turns out with respect to those deliveries. But it is -- it's now, I think, based on a far better knowledge of what those supply constraints are and commitments from our supply side engine suppliers.\nIn BDS, I don't want to skip over the Starliner. It was important. It was an emotional up for all of us at Boeing to get back on track. We had a wet dress for the space launch system rocket, the biggest rocket yet. We're looking forward to that launch. So we had a good sort of engineering coming out with respect to those achievements. And yes, we're still working through some of the challenging macro environment issues, especially with respect to our fixed price development contracts. And Brian will also walk you through that.\nAnd then finally, on the services side, like pretty much everyone that's been reporting, it is coming back, and it's coming back in a rapid way. Our commercial service business was up 30%. It carries strong margins with it. And so it's a big and important contributor to our overall cash flow story.\nAnd again, the result of all of this work, a big step forward with respect to stability. We did debt to cash flow -- operating cash flow positive. So that puts us a little bit ahead of our internal plan, and we feel good about that. And we are still committed to be cash flow positive for the calendar year 2022.\nIt's underpinned by a very strong commercial market. I think you all know that. Everyone has spoken to it. A lot of supply constraints out there with respect to the operators of our airplanes, the airlines and what they've got to do to get the fleets running efficiently and build their capacity where it needs to be.\nBut they are out there in the market trying to rebuild their fleets for the future and to meet that significant demand. And so far, we have not seen any drawback on that demand. While we understand the sort of recession fears that are growing out there, so far, it has not impacted the aviation industry or our customers.\nSo mostly what we're focused on, and I don't think it will surprise anyone, and I think I've heard it in most of my peers' reports is the supply chain, stabilizing it, making sure that it's predictable and consistent. And for us, in particular, with respect to the commercial side of our business, it relates to engine production, engine availability so that we can predictably deliver airplanes to our customers.\nWe think we've made an awful lot of progress on that front. I know you've heard directly from the engine suppliers. They are making progress, and we've adjusted all of our delivery rate expectations at least in the near term to satisfy those constraints.\nA comment quickly on regulatory and geopolitical. I'll start with geopolitical, China. The good news is that because of the strong demand in the marketplace, we've been able to manage our risk going forward with respect to the airplanes that we have built and are awaiting delivery.\nWe intend to stand by our Chinese airlines, stand by the CAAC and get those airplanes back. But the timing, which has been pushed and deferred in light of some of the COVID management issues in China and some of that geopolitical overhang, we can suffer our way through that and will. And it should not impact the cash flow positive posture that we've taken for the year.\nSo it's a little easier to manage for us. It's no less important, and we will continue to encourage our administration to work as closely as they can with the Chinese to reopen the trade card or with respect to aviation, a relationship we've enjoyed for over 50 years. And we'll continue to support our customers. Medium and long term, it does represent the difference between commercial aerospace leadership or not, given the size and scale of the China market.\nAnd then on the regulatory front, we are working constructively with the FAA. We have our heads down. We're working towards certification by year-end on the Dash 7 and the Dash 10. And we believe what we're working on is, in fact, the safe option with respect to all options in the narrow-body space. And so we're going to just keep plugging away.\nAnd anyway, that's enough said. As we navigate through this environment, stability is the watch word for all of us. We want to be predictable. We think that will differentiate us. And that's why we've got -- we're focused on it.\nWe continue to increase our investment in research programs, the readiness program with respect to the next big commercial airplane, all the digital modeling tools that are required to be ready for that, we continue to invest aggressively in. And we continue to enhance those underlying digital technologies that we will bring ultimately to the services market as well. Safety, quality, transparency, these are values, and this is what we remain focused on.\nSo before I turn it over to Brian, the MAX, it's on track. And it's performing for customers, in many cases, exceeding expectations. We think we're through the most difficult parts of COVID-19. Starliner, a pivotal and emotional test for The Boeing Company, and we feel good about it, and we're ready for the crewed flight.\nGlobal Services, on its way back in a big way. We feel terrific about their progress. And now we are at the detailed moment to get ready for 787 deliveries, the moment we've been waiting for. And we look and feel as though we're on the verge of doing so. So we've taken a long view. We continue to take a long view. And we do believe we're in the middle of a turnaround, and it's beginning to show itself.\nSo with that, I'll end my opening comments and turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. West\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. This was an important quarter. We made good progress on key programs and a pretty dynamic macro environment affected by inflation, labor availability and supply chain constraints, all of which impacted both us and the industry.\nDespite these challenges, we improved our quarter-over-quarter cash performance and importantly, generated positive operating cash flow. Cash was driven by higher commercial delivery volume as well as order activity and advanced payment timing. This keeps us on track to generate positive free cash flow for the year and higher cash flows in 2023.\nWe still think about our performance in 3 parts and remain confident about the trajectory. First, as Dave mentioned, we made progress on key milestones. We're nearing a return for the 87 and are preparing airplanes for delivery. We continue to focus on 37 production stability of 31 MAXs per month. And we've derisked China from our near-term delivery profile.\nNext, as we see continued progress on these programs, we anticipate improvement in our performance metrics, including deliveries, revenue, margin and cash flow in the back half of the year. We also expect cash flow benefits from order activity and favorable receipt timing over the next 2 quarters.\nFinally, our financial performance should start to accelerate into 2023. Going forward, there is a significant opportunity for our company to return to sustainable growth. And we look forward to sharing our plans at our Investor Day on November 1 and 2.\nBefore getting into the financials, I want to make a few points on the current business environment on Slide 3. Demand for commercial airplanes is strong, especially in the freighter market. We've seen cargo traffic increase from 2019 levels largely driven by e-commerce and the efficiency of air freight. With more than 90% share of the freighter market, our lineup is well positioned to capture continued growth.\nOn the passenger side, traffic has recovered significantly but is still well below where it's been historically relative to global GDP. As airlines are currently in the middle of the summer high season, operational and supply constraints are becoming the pacing item for air traffic growth in the markets leading the recovery.\nThat said, the commercial traffic recovery is accelerating. And passenger traffic has reached its highest point since 2019 in both North America and Europe. Domestic traffic remained relatively stable at 77% of 2019 levels as of May. While China still lags significantly, we saw some improvements in flight operations in June as travel restrictions lifted. Excluding China, domestic traffic was over 90% of 2019 levels.\nInternational traffic is gaining momentum at 64% of 2019, up from just 48% in March, especially in regional markets such as intra-Europe, transatlantic and U.S.-Mexico as well as notable improvements via the Middle East and in some parts of Asia. Overall, our commercial passenger market recovery expectations are in line with what we've shared previously. We still see overall passenger traffic returning to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame.\nTaking all of this into consideration, we recently released our 2022 commercial market outlook, which forecasts a total addressable market valued at more than $3.3 trillion over the next decade and demand for nearly 20,000 airplanes. The forecast closely aligns to what we laid out last year and reflects the market's continued recovery.\nMore specifically, we anticipate demand for more than 14,000 narrow-bodies or over 120 per month on average over the next 10 years. From a 20-year perspective, we project demand for more than 41,000 new airplanes, including 940 dedicated freighters.\nWe are very confident in our product lineup, which is well suited to capture this long-term demand. And we feel very good about last week with over 200 orders and commitments at Farnborough. We appreciate the trust and confidence our customers are placing in us.\nOur services business also continues to benefit from growing commercial fleet and strong cargo markets with several Boeing converted freighter and materials management agreements recently announced. Over the next 10 years, we see a $3.3 trillion service market that aligns well with our broad customer-focused portfolio of offerings.\nIn Defense and Space, we see solid long-term markets, both domestically and internationally. In the United States, there is support for increased defense spending in Congress to meet the challenges of today. Internationally, many of our fellow NATO members, partners and allies have announced plans for increased spending on national defense, and we look forward to more specifics around these priorities.\nTurning to the supply chain. We continue to experience real constraints. We're taking action to mitigate risk in a number of areas, including engines, raw materials and semiconductors. To stabilize production and support our supply chain, we're increasing our on-site presence at suppliers, creating teams of experts to address industry-wide shortages, utilizing internal fabrication for search capacity and managing inventory safety stock levels and growing where needed.\nWith that backdrop, let's turn to financials on Slide 4. Second quarter revenue of $16.7 billion declined 2%, and we generated $0.5 billion of core operating earnings. After accounting for interest expense and taxes, we had a core loss per share of $0.37. Operating cash flow was positive $0.1 billion, in line with our expectations and an improvement from the same period last year.\nLet's move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. Second quarter revenue was $6.2 billion, up 3% primarily driven by higher 37 deliveries, partially offset by lower 87 deliveries. Operating losses of $0.2 billion and the resulting negative margin rate reflect abnormal costs and period expenses, including higher R&D expense as we continue to invest in the business.\nOn the 87 program, we're very close to resuming deliveries. We're readying airplanes together with our customers and have completed flight checks on the initial airplanes. As always, we will follow the lead of the FAA on the specific timing.\nWe have 120 airplanes in inventory and are making progress completing the necessary rework to prepare them for delivery. As stated last quarter, we're producing at very low rates and we'll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 airplanes per month over time.\nSimilar to the 37 program, the supply chain remains a key watch item for 87 production and deliveries. We recorded $283 million of 87 abnormal costs in line with expectations, and we still anticipate a total of about $2 billion with most being incurred by the end of 2023. These costs are driven by rework and production rates below 5 per month.\nIt is important to keep in mind that cash margins on the 87 remain positive and are expected to improve significantly over time. However, as we deliver the first few 87 airplanes, you may see some variability in cash payments as we compensate customers for delays.\nThe 87 continues to be the most utilized wide-body airplane due to its operational efficiency and flexibility. With over 400 airplanes in backlog, recent orders and commitments announced at Farnborough and additional demand as the commercial market recovers, we see a strong future for the 87 program.\nMoving on to the 37 program. We've delivered 189 airplanes year-to-date, below our original expectations due to 3 things: supply chain disruptions, flow time of taking airplanes out of storage and timing of deliveries to Chinese customers. We don't anticipate making up those deliveries in the back half of the year, and we'll continue to experience monthly variability, including a light month in July.\nWe now expect delivery to be closer to the low 400s for 2022, short of what we discussed earlier this year as we drive stability and predictability. We ended the quarter with 290 MAX airplanes in inventory, of which roughly half are designated for customers in China. Given this uncertainty with our customers in China, we now expect more deliveries of airplanes from inventory to shift into 2024.\nDue to overall progress on MAX production, we did not book abnormal costs in the quarter. Additionally, we've reached agreement on over 95% of our MAX customer consideration liability.\nShifting to the 777-9 program, our status is largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025 and continue to coordinate with the FAA to prioritize resources across our development programs.\nWe booked $102 million of 777 abnormal costs in the second quarter, in line with our expectations. And we still expect to record $1.5 billion of these costs through 2023 while 777-9 production remains paused.\nTurning to overall demand at BCA. During the quarter, we booked 184 commercial airplane orders, including 169 orders for the 737 MAX. At the end of the second quarter, we had over 4,200 airplanes in backlog valued at $297 billion.\nLet's now move on to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue was $6.2 billion, down 10% driven by lower volume and operational performance. Operating margin was 1.1% driven by approximately $400 million of charges on fixed-price development programs, most notably $147 million on MQ-25 and $93 million on commercial crew.\nThis total also includes relatively small cost growth on the T-7A tanker and VC-25B, with no one program impacted by more than about $50 million. And the drivers were largely supply chain impact and inflation. All of this will be outlined in the Q.\nWe also saw these same pressures across a few of the mature programs. While this performance was disappointing, we're making progress narrowing our development risk profile and remain confident over the long term.\nWe received $2 billion in orders during the quarter, and BDS backlog was $55 billion. Additionally, the Chinook helicopter has been selected to bring heavy lift capability to the German military. We also achieved important milestones across the portfolio. NASA's Space Launch System completed a wet dress rehearsal, and the KC-46A tanker is now certified to refuel 97% of the military's air refuellable fleet.\nLet's now turn to Global Services results on Slide 7. The Global Services team celebrated its fifth anniversary this month and continues to perform well, especially in our parts and commercial training businesses. We're encouraged by the overall momentum.\nSecond quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 6%, and operating margin was 16.9%. Results were driven by higher commercial services volume now nearly back to pre-pandemic levels and favorable mix. We also discontinued an engine distribution agreement in the quarter, which will impact our government service revenue profile going forward.\nWe received $4 billion in orders during the quarter, including a contract for airlift flight dispatch services for the U.S. Air Force and a contract for avionics upgrades and cybersecurity support for the U.S. Navy. The BGS backlog is $19 billion. With strong support for our defense business and our highly valid commercial capabilities, our services business is poised for growth as the commercial market continues to recover.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 to cover cash and debt. We ended the second quarter with strong liquidity comprised of $11.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet and access to $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn. Our debt balance decreased slightly from the end of last quarter to $57.2 billion driven by repayment of maturing debt. Our investment-grade credit rating is a priority. And we remain committed to reducing debt levels through strong cash flow generation over time.\nAs far as the rest of the year is concerned, we still anticipate 2022 total company revenue to be higher than last year primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 37 and 87 programs and growth in our services business, partially offset by lower defense revenue. Looking into 2023, we expect total company revenue growth from this year.\nBCA revenue is planned to be higher again on 37 and 87 deliveries. The demand outlook for the defense business remains steady, and we expect 2023 revenue to be better than 2022 as the business stabilizes. While we forecast BGS revenue to continue to grow next year, the growth rate will be tempered as we are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to cash. We still expect to generate positive free cash flow this year. And the key drivers of second half improvement are higher 37 and 87 delivery volume, orders of advanced payments, BDS receipts as well as favorable expenditure timing.\nAs we look to 2023, we still expect cash flow will be higher than 2022, and we plan to share more details in November. Overall, our performance is tied to several key items: supply chain, production system and delivery stability, 37 and 87 delivery ramp, successful execution and certification of development programs, the commercial market recovery and the macroeconomic environment.\nWhile our progress depends on some factors beyond our control, we'll remain focused on our own performance and taking the right actions to drive stability and predictability and growth in the future. Taking a step back, this business and our team have come a long way over the last few years. We've seen our fair share of challenges and more hurdles still remain, but we're making progress. Demand for our product is strong. We're investing in our future, and our people are demonstrating exceptional commitment.\nWith that, over to Dave for closing comments.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nYes, I'll keep them brief. We do believe we're in the middle of a momentum shift. We're all anxious and looking forward to delivery of our important airplane, the 787. Again, a reminder of how well it is performing in the field, and therefore, this delivery stream is critically important to our customers.\nSo I'll leave it with that, and turn it over to Q&A.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVP of IR, The Boeing Company\n\nYes. Thanks, Dave. Before we start the Q&A, as I noted at the beginning of this call, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. Please also refer to those materials for a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.\nWith that, as Dave said, we are now prepared to take your questions."

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.\nThe management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. (Operator Instructions) At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVP of IR, The Boeing Company\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAs a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussion this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nYes. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to make a few comments upfront and then turn it over to Brian for a more detailed look at our financials in the quarter.\nFirst, I need to acknowledge that on the 21st of March, Flight 5735 of our good customer, China Eastern, unfortunately crashed and took the lives of 132 passengers and crew. These things always take our breath away, and I want to extend our thoughts and prayers from the entire Boeing company, of course, to the families and friends of those passengers. Those are always rough moments.\nOur technical team is, in fact, supporting both the NTSB and the NTSB as it supports the CAAC, who is, of course, the lead investigator. Those are the only comments that I will make along the lines of the China Eastern accident but know that we are in the middle of that investigation.\n'22 1Q, some challenges presented themselves. Unexpectedly, Russia obviously is the big issue in the news. Inflation continues to take a hard run at pretty much everything we do. And COVID, unfortunately, didn't leave as soon as we would have liked. So the -- at least the first 45 days of the quarter were impacted more than we imagined.\nAll that said, our focus and progress remains consistent with what we shared the last quarter. We still expect to accelerate our performance and the key financial metrics, namely cash flow because that is our key financial metric. That's what we've been focused on for a couple of years, and we will remain focused on.\nAnd we remain committed to the notion that we will have positive free cash flow over the course of '22 and meaningful improvement in 2023. Everything we are doing is leading with safety and quality and ultimately driving stability for our airline customers. And we believe we're taking the right actions for the future.\nWe have progressed on many key milestones. We'll comment on a few of them today. But we're focused on the 37 MAX and the 787 production and the return to service of those airplanes that we have built and stored in behalf of our airline customers. We feel good about all the progress we're making on that front.\nThe commercial market recovery, I'm not going to expand significantly on that. You've heard from almost all of the U.S. airline customers, many of the European customers. Traffic is returning, and it's returning in a pretty big way. Airplanes are being utilized at a fairly high rate. Domestic markets are the first to have recovered, and they're recovering robustly. Regional markets, second, and even long-haul traffic now is beginning to return.\nThe only real exception in that demand scenario is China in light of their current COVID constraints. But we're hopeful and we expect that they'll come out of that and continue to expand their fleet.\nSo that commercial market is very, very strong. And it's particularly strong for our line of airplanes, namely the MAX, the 87 and the 777. And I don't want anyone to forget the 67 because it continues to play a very important role in the freighter world.\nI should comment on the conflict in Ukraine. I think I mentioned the last time we were together, we had 1,000 people in both the Ukraine in Kyiv and in Moscow. And those 2 teams work pretty closely together. So it's been a bit of a gut-wrenching and emotional period for all of The Boeing Company and our associates.\nI'm very proud of the work that we are doing to support our team in Kyiv. We've provided $1.5 million in humanitarian assistance but also matched all of our employee donations to those people who are helping.\nAnd then most importantly, we have Boeing families in Poland and throughout the region who have willingly accepted and opened their homes to our displaced teammates. That's a big deal, and it's been an uplift for all of us to watch that happen.\nWe're following the lead of the U.S. government and strictly adhering to export controls and all the restrictions. We suspended maintenance and support for Russian customers. And in the spirit of doing the right thing, we had suspended titanium imports. Fortunately for us, we had a program of inventory built for quite some time ever since Crimea, such that we believe we are reasonably protected on that front.\nNext, I should comment on the 37 MAX specifically. It's only been a little over a year since that airplane was recertified and put back into service. We now have over 1 million flight hours. It is performing incredibly well at 99%-plus service reliability. Our customers are happy with it in almost every case that I'm aware of. They talk about the airplane exceeding the performance specs that we sold it on. So we feel very good about that, and we feel very good about the skyline and our ability to deliver on that.\nBrian will get into rate discussions in his piece on that one. But we still continue to think about this one airplane at a time, so that we can maintain that high in-service reliability rate.\nWe're applying the same rigor to the 787, and we took a very important step just in the last week by submitting the cert paperwork and the plan to the FAA. We're proud of that work. We touched a lot of operations across our facilities, exacting spec with respect to the 87\n(technical difficulty)\nprecisely. And that's all embedded in the cert paperwork that we presented to our FAA.\nAnd as always, we will let the FAA take the lead with respect to cert and ticketing, and we will work closely with them. They have been involved in this process from the very beginning. So there is no new news embedded in this.\n777 family. I'd like to make a comment with respect to the decision we made on the 777X and the extension of its introduction until 2025. I believe we've made that decision out of a position of strength, not weakness.\nWe've embedded every lesson that we've learned on the 37 MAX certs, and we continue to have 2 of those ahead of us. We've applied all the lessons from the 787 cert, which, of course, we have just submitted and believe that we've got to give ourselves the time and freedom to get this right with the FAA and give everybody the time they need to give us the cert that will last, frankly, for decades and decades into the future.\nIt also, by calling it out now, gives us an opportunity to create some capacity for our traditional metal wing 777 freighter, which right now is in incredibly high demand. So we will extend that airplane life and continue to meet that demand.\nAnd then finally, the 777-8 Freighter, which we introduced with Qatar, is a very big deal with respect to the long-term ramifications of the 777 family in the decades ahead. We're very proud of the 777 family in the post-A380, 747 world. We think it stands on its own, and it will be one of the great contributors to share owner value over the decades ahead.\nBoeing Global Services, I'm not going to get into a lot of detail other than to say we're riding that wave of recovery with respect to fleet utilization pretty much everywhere in the world. And so that business has enjoyed that success and has been able to stay ahead of the supply chain constraints that some are feeling. So all things good on that front.\nAnd then on BDS, a messy quarter. And we got hit where you might expect us to get hit in a supply constrained, still COVID-impacted and inflationary world. And then that is on a group of fixed-price development contracts that I think you're all aware of, where we had to recognize future costs on those program economics. And so we have taken a write-off on those programs, VC-25B, the T-7A and the MQ-25. Brian will talk to you a little bit more about this.\nVC-25B was, by far, the biggest part of that hit. You'll recall it was a public negotiation that happened quite some time ago. We took some risks not knowing that COVID would arise and not knowing that an inflationary environment would take hold like it has. And both of those things have impacted us fairly severely.\nThis will ultimately accrue to 2 airplanes where we will continue to do our work and deliver first-rate airplanes to our customer in the government. As we deliver today's numbers, know that we are increasing our investment, safety and producibility, digital transformation, autonomy and sustainable aerospace are the keynotes with respect to where those investments are going.\nWe feel good about where that's setting us up for the future. We're progressing on our development programs. Are we frustrated with the timing? You bet. But we're progressing. And everyone is getting their feet firmly planted on the ground, both us and our counterparty and the regulators around the world. And so I have to feel good about the progress that we're making collectively and that matters for the long term.\nStability and predictability, it's coming along. It will matter in the years ahead. And above all else, our culture is built around safety, built around quality. And transparency is the word of the day with respect to how we interact with our counterparties everywhere in the world.\nStrong leadership team in place, I'll comment and also congratulate Leanne. Leanne has retired. She's given us over 30 years of service, never had a more diehard and more engaged leader in our company. So I want to congratulate her on that. As you know, she'll be with us until the end of the year and supporting transition activities.\nBut also to congratulate Ted Colbert, who is a fantastic leader and proven himself in our services world and servicing. Half of his business is servicing the U.S. military. So he is ready to go on Boeing Defense, and he'll do a fantastic job.\nAnd then Stephanie Pope in our Services business, it's a bit of an old hat. She was the CFO at our Services business when we stood it up. She did a lot of the hard work associated with that stand up, and we treasure her as an operator, all the right instincts, and look forward to her future leading the Services business. So we feel good about the talent transitions that have occurred.\nAnd then I'll call out before I turn it back to Brian, just the -- thanks to administrator Steve Dickson at the FAA. As many of you know, he has retired. He stood tall during a difficult moment for The Boeing Company and to the FAA in the recertification of the 737 MAX, amongst the other multitude of responsibilities that he's had. We respect the work that he did and ultimately, the courage that he provided in the face of what was otherwise difficult external circumstance. So congratulations to him.\nAnd then the acting administrator Billy Nolen, he can count on our full support as he now takes over. So I'm confident in the milestones that we've been meeting. And we've been focused, I think, on the right things and with respect to long-term share owner value. That is what it's all about, and we intend to deliver on that prospect.\nSo Brian, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nBrian J. West\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nGreat. Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 1Q certainly had a few challenges to navigate: the war in Ukraine, the updated regulatory requirements on our commercial airplane programs as well as a combination of COVID, supply chain constraints, inflation, impacting, in particular, the fixed-price defense development program as Dave mentioned.\nImportantly though, cash performance is on track with our expectations. The utilization in the quarter was in line with what I shared a few months ago. The trajectory throughout the rest of the year remains intact, and we continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow for the year.\nThe business is resilient, and we're encouraged by the momentum we're seeing. We still think about this year in 3 parts. First, we anticipate reaching key delivery milestones. On the 87, we're on a path to restart deliveries in the near term. On the 37, we continue to work towards resuming MAX deliveries to Chinese customers. At the same time, we're re-sequencing our skyline to take advantage of strong customer demand for the MAX airplane and meet delivery objectives.\nNext, once we see progress on these programs, we anticipate improvement in our performance metrics, including deliveries, revenue, margin and cash flow. And finally, as we move through the remainder of the year, our financial performance will accelerate. And going forward, there is significant opportunity for our company to return to sustainable growth.\nThis fall, we plan to host an Investor Day to share our more detailed expectations for the rest of the year and beyond. Before I get into the financials, I did want to make a few points on the current business environment on Slide 3.\nI'll start with one of the stronger segments, freighters. The market remains quite robust with cargo traffic up 12% above 2019 levels in February largely delivered by e-commerce. This continues to be one of the more reliable forms of transportation, and our lineup is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this growth for a very long time.\nThe commercial pass-through market recovery expectations are largely unchanged from what I shared last quarter even as we saw some events that added near-term pressure, including reduced pass-through traffic in and around Russia. Global flight ops are at about 75% of 2019 levels as the global recovery is tempered by China and the impacts of the war in Ukraine.\nWe still see overall passenger traffic returning to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. Domestic traffic continued to lead at 78% of 2019 levels in February with China the notable exception. Ex China, domestic traffic was 84% of the 2019 levels.\nU.S. carriers are providing the best window into the recovery at this point. Our customers are seeing record booking volumes and very strong forward yields for late spring and summer to the point of being able to offset sharply higher fuel prices, and they're also highlighting the return of business travel.\nBeyond domestic routes, we're seeing encouraging signs from intra-regional traffic in both Europe and the Americas. International traffic continues to lag at 40% of the pre-pandemic levels, but we are seeing recovery in regional markets such as intra-Europe and U.S., Mexico, both progressing well with significant reopening now underway across many parts of Asia.\nLong-haul recovery will be led by the trans-Atlantic market this summer as well as Middle East connectors. Time and again, the market has shown its resilience driven by the essential nature of moving both people and goods around the world. And in addition to Commercial Airplanes, the expanding market recovery directly benefits our Commercial Services business.\nIn Defense and Space, we continue to see stable demand. The present FY '23 budget request reflects the important role our products and services have in ensuring our national security, including significantly increased funding for the F-15EX and support for our other critical products and services that support national security.\nOutside of the U.S., we're seeing similar solid demand as governments prioritize security, defense technology and global cooperation given evolving threats. Our operations are well positioned to maintain continuity despite the war in Ukraine, and we see limited impacts to our business. I'll cover the financial impacts a bit later.\nOn the supply side, we are carefully managing supply chain constraints and working through issues as they arise to ensure the stability of our production system. We've experienced some disruption to our production such as some supplier delays and resource availability, including the impacts of COVID. And we're actively working mitigation plans to ensure continuity.\nThe markets we see -- we serve continue to be big. Our competitive position is strong, and we're actively addressing the supply chain, and all of this give us confidence in the fundamentals of our business and the long-term outlook as we work hard to serve our customers.\nWith that, let's turn to the financials on Slide 4. First quarter revenue of $14 billion was down 8%, and the core operating loss in the quarter was negative $1.5 billion, resulting in a $2.75 core loss per share. Operating cash flow was a usage of $3.2 billion, in line with what we expected.\nThese results were impacted by $1.3 billion of charges at BDS, which I will discuss in more detail in a minute. Due to the war in Ukraine and associated impacts to our business, we did record about $200 million in pretax charges in the quarter related to certain asset impairments. And we also reduced the backlog by 86 units and roughly $5 billion. As we review business unit financials, I'll highlight some unique challenges that we're overcoming as we drive stability and position for the future.\nNow let's move to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. First quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, down slightly. It's primarily driven by the timing of wide-body deliveries, partially offset by higher 37 deliveries. Operating losses of $0.9 billion and the resulting negative margin rate reflect abnormal costs and period expenses, including charges for impacts of the war in Ukraine and higher R&D expense as we increase our investment in the business.\nTurning to the 87 program. As Dave mentioned, we've met a very important milestone and submitted the cert plan to the FAA. Deliveries remained paused, and we had 115 airplanes in inventory at the end of the quarter.\nImportantly, we've completed the rework on the initial airplanes and are preparing them for delivery, including conducting our own check flights in advance. As always, we will work closely with the FAA on the remaining steps, and we'll follow their lead on timing of deliveries.\nAs we stated last quarter, we're producing at very low rates, and we'll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 airplanes per month over time. Notably, we're currently rolling out conforming airplanes from the factory.\nWe did not take additional charges on the 87 program in the quarter. We did record $312 million of abnormal costs in line with expectations. And we still anticipate a total of approximately $2 billion of abnormal with most being incurred by the end of 2023.\nConsistent with what we shared last quarter, cash margins on the 87 remain positive and are expected to improve significantly over time. We see a long runway ahead for the 87 program based on a very healthy backlog of 405 airplanes and compelling operating economics for our customers. And we're well positioned to capture future demand as the wide-body market recovers.\nMoving on to the 37 program. We delivered 86 37 airplanes in the quarter, including 37 in March, a slight decrease from fourth quarter of last year despite impacts of COVID, some supply chain delays and typical seasonality. Given some supply chain disruption and timing of taking airplanes out of storage, deliveries were slightly below our expectations, and we ended the quarter with 320 MAX airplanes in inventory.\nHowever, we still anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023. The timing and pace of deliveries to Chinese customers and supply chain stability remain key factors to our delivery profile.\nWe continue to make progress ramping our 37 production rate and are essentially at 31 airplanes per month. As we shared last quarter, 37 abnormal costs are largely behind us. The MAX customer consideration liability also continues to burn down as expected.\nOn our development programs, we're doing everything we can to complete the certification of the MAX 7 and MAX 10 and ensure their respective first deliveries this year and next. We're working closely with the FAA on implementation of Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act legislation and expect any necessary actions to be defined later this year. As always, we will follow the lead of regulator on the timing of certification.\nMoving on to the 777, 777X programs. We remain highly confident in this family of airplanes as Dave outlined. We launched the 777-8 Freighter with an order from Qatar Airlines in January. And as a result, we increased the accounting quantity on the program to 400 airplanes.\nWe continue to perform 777-9 Boeing flight test to retire technical risk with over 2,000 flight hours completed through the end of the first quarter. The airplane is performing well, and our customers continue to see the value in the compelling economics and sustainability benefits this airplane offers.\nBased on an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements, we now anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025. Additionally, we're coordinating with the FAA to prioritize resources across our development programs.\nAs we manage the company for cash flow, we're adjusting our 777-9 production rate, including a temporary pause due 2023. This move will minimize inventory, reduce the number of airplanes requiring change in corporation and avoid capitalizing costs on the balance sheet.\nAdditionally, given the robust market for freighters, we're leveraging this production pause on the 777-9 to add 777 freighter aircraft in the 2023 to 2026 time frame. We anticipate the 777-9 pause will result in approximately $1.5 billion of abnormal costs beginning in the second quarter of this year and continuing until production resumes. We believe this is the best allocation of resources and cash.\nTurning to overall demand at BCA. During the quarter, we booked 167 gross commercial airplane orders, including 134 orders for the 37 MAX. As of the end of the first quarter, we had nearly 4,200 airplanes in backlog valued at $291 billion.\nLet's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 6. First quarter revenue was $5.5 billion, down 24%, and operating margin was negative 17%. These results were primarily driven by lower volume and $1.3 billion in charges on fixed-price development programs, including the VC-25B and the T-7A.\nOn a normalized basis, adjusting for onetime items, revenue across our defense portfolio, including government services, was down 9%, half of which was the impact of COVID and supply chain constraints. The other half was from planned program transitions.\nThe VC-25B program recorded a $660 million charge primarily driven by higher supplier costs, higher cost to finalize technical requirements and schedule delays. The T-7A Red Hawk program recorded $367 million in charges primarily driven by ongoing supplier negotiations impacted by supply chain constraints, COVID and inflationary pressures. We continue to have high confidence in the long runway ahead for the T-7A program. Similar pressures impacted other fixed-price development programs, though to a lesser extent.\nFrom a cash perspective, these charges will be incurred over the next several years. We received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for 6 MH-47G Block II Chinook rotorcraft for U.S. Army Special Operations, and the BDS backlog remains at $60 billion.\nAcross the portfolio, we're focused on improving performance as we transition several development programs into production. And we're making progress but have more work to do as we position ourselves to deliver for our customers. While we recognize charges on these key programs, we remain confident in demand for these future technologies and capabilities, and our Defense and Space portfolio is well positioned for growth.\nNow let's turn to Global Services results on Slide 7. The Global Services team had a great quarter, particularly on our parts and distribution business due to the strength of the portfolio and broad offerings.\nFirst quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 15%, and operating margin was 14.6%, in line with our expectations. Results were driven by higher commercial service volume and favorable mix.\nWe received $3 billion in orders during the quarter, including a fuel-saving digital solutions contracts for Etihad Airways 87 fleet and a contract for KC-135 horizontal stabilizers from the U.S. Air Force. The BGS backlog remains at $20 billion.\nWith commercial services revenue now back to nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, our Service business remains well positioned for growth as the commercial market recovers and the Defense business continues to see strong support.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 and cover cash and debt. We ended the first quarter with strong liquidity comprised of $12.3 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet and access to $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn.\nOur debt balance decreased slightly from the end of the last year to $57.7 billion driven by repayment of maturing debt. Our investment-grade credit rating is a priority. We remain committed to reducing debt levels.\nNow similar to what I shared last quarter, I'd like to review the key drivers of 2022 revenue and cash. In comparison to 2021, we still anticipate total company revenue to increase this year. The growth will be primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 37 and 87 programs and solid growth in our Services business as the commercial market continues to improve.\nAnd while the overall demand outlook for the Defense business remains stable, due to the revenue impacts of the charges we took in the first quarter, we're forecasting a modest decrease in revenue at BDS this year versus 2021. However, we expect 2023 to return to stable levels.\nOn cash, we still expect to generate positive free cash flow this year. The key driver of improvement remains higher 37 and 87 delivery volume. As we described previously, the working capital benefit from delivering airplanes from inventory will be partially offset by a lower advances and progress payments balance. We still anticipate a burn down of our advance balance this year. The profile continues to be dynamic due to customer discussions and timing of deliveries.\nFrom a phasing standpoint, our first quarter cash utilization was in line with what we shared in January. We remain confident that our free cash flow will improve in the second quarter and will make meaningful -- and will meaningfully accelerate in the back half of the year as we achieve the key delivery milestones that I outlined.\nAs we look beyond this year, we expect 2023 cash flow will be materially higher than 2022. And we look forward to sharing more details on our plan in the fall.\nTo wrap up, our performance is tied to several key items: commercial market recovery, return to delivery for the 87 and 37 MAX in China, successful execution and certification of development programs and production system and delivery stability. We remain acutely focused on what we can control.\nMost notably, we continue to focus our efforts to stabilize our production system, including the supply chain and improve our delivery predictability. And while we saw improvements in some of this first quarter, we have more work to do. And we're keenly aware that these activities will be critical to our success and are prioritizing these resources accordingly.\nBeyond these execution priorities immediately in front of us, we continue to invest in our people, technology, manufacturing capabilities and strategic partnerships to ensure we're well positioned for future growth. There's no doubt that the business environment is evolving.\nThat said, we're making good progress driving productivity and cash flow while addressing risks as they arise. And while we do all this, we're laser-focused on safety, quality and stability. We believe these are the right actions and resource calls. And we remain confident in the strength of our business now and in the future.\nWith that, over to Dave for closing comments.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nYes. We believe we're on a real improvement track with respect to engineering and manufacturing of our products and ultimately, the predictability of our business with respect to our commercial customers. We also believe strongly in our defense product line and the prospects for defense orders and growth in the relatively near to medium term.\nSo that's it. I'll turn it over to questions. Let's go."

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Boeing Company's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the Internet. (Operator Instructions) At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'm turning the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nVP of IR, The Boeing Company\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I am Matt Welch, and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian West, Boeing's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nAnd as a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today.\nProjections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and certain -- and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.\nNow I will turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nYes. Thanks, Matt. Just upfront, we've changed in this format just a bit so that I can limit my remarks upfront to some observations and thoughts with respect to where we are in this rebuilding process. And then Brian will take you into more detail on the financial side.\nWith respect to the environment, there's no doubt Omicron has paused the industry recovery. But it has not changed the outlook for the industry recovery, such that while it might be delayed a few more months, the bookings and the customer discussions with respect to fleet plans, medium and long term, are still quite robust. And we are quite confident in that outlook.\n2021 I would characterize for Boeing as a rebuilding year. We came from recovery to rebuilding. And I give our team a lot of credit for, frankly, making a lot of progress on that front. Number one, on the orders front and demand, particularly led by the MAX and the freighter market. I feel very good about where things are and the competitiveness of our product line with respect to that market.\nSupply constraints to date have not constrained us. On the other hand, I think in the medium- to long-term future, it's something we all have to plan for. I've always viewed the unfortunate means by which we got here and the buildup of finished goods inventory, both with respect to the MAX and the 787, as sort of a double-edged sword.\nI hate that we have a lot of inventory. On the other hand, it will probably serve us well in what is likely to be a robust recovery.\nWith respect to fleet rebuilding, I would also just like to highlight the efficiency gains and maybe even more importantly, the emissions gains that our customers enjoy when they replace their current fleet with these new aircraft are significant, and the pressures are severe.\nSo I think that creates some additive pressure with respect to fleet renewals as we move forward. And I don't think either of those will let up.\nThe MAX return to service. I'm quite proud of where we are on that. We have regulatory approval now in almost every jurisdiction in the world. You know that China, Indonesia and Ethiopia all delivered prior to the end of the year.\nWe delivered 245 airplanes in '21. We've flown safely over 800,000 flight hours, 99.3% service reliability. And we've now flown more post the MAX grounding than we did pre-MAX grounding.\nChina is preparing for their MAX return to service and for delivery. And we have set up a plan that allows for that in the first quarter. But of course, they'll take them as the government returns the current fleet to service.\nOur customers are moving methodically and very well with respect to that return to service. 87, very unfortunate charge that we took here in the fourth quarter. It reflects everything we've learned about the rework process itself, the data required to restart deliveries and obtain ticketing and then customer expectations regarding concessions as we move forward. With all that said, I still feel fantastic about the future of the 787 airplane for The Boeing Company.\nAnd anyway, as I think I point out every time we get together, these 87s today, the field -- the fleet and service is flying, is more utilized than any other wide-body airplane. It's -- 99% of it is in service today with respect to the prepandemic levels. And it's the most utilized wide-body out there, 98.99% reliability.\nSo this is a great product line and a competitive product. And as soon as we begin delivery, we feel very good about the ultimate recovery.\nOn BDS, we did hit a bunch of really important milestones. The MQ-25, we experienced our first refueling, and we began carrier tests. The T-7A production line, which is based on significantly improved development process and engineering modeling capabilities, is off to a very good start. And the efficiency associated with that development process is being realized.\nAnd then the tanker. The tanker today despite the charge, again, which we don't feel great about by any respect, but the tanker today is an incredible asset for our customer and now serves 70% of the missions that were intended in the development of the tanker. And our job is to continue to deliver the tanker and to do it more expeditiously as we move forward.\nThe good news is our customer likes the performance of the airplane. And again, we intend to serve that need.\nGlobal Services, it is recovering like all the service businesses that surround aviation. It's on a great path. The team is doing a terrific job. We had a small write-off with respect to materials that ultimately would not be utilized in this recovery. But BGS is doing quite well, and this is experiencing the recovery.\nAnd then I feel very good about the free cash flow that we generated in the fourth quarter. As everybody knows, we have been focused relentlessly on improving our free cash flow situation. It has been our #1 metric. And to be able to achieve that, I think, is terrific news.\nSustainability, it is the one issue every customer wants to talk to us about not with respect to 2050 or 2035, but they want to make sure that we have a program in place that will support them over that time frame. And it is very important to the every next order that we achieve.\nSo believe it or not, the competition for today's airplanes is often built around the future plans that we have with respect to sustainability. And I love where we're going on that and the story we -- that we have for our customers.\nInnovation is strong in every way. I mentioned the MQ-25, the T-7A. Future capabilities with respect to the next development program, we've invested a lot. We continue to invest a lot. It's more important to me that we get our development tools where they need to be, demonstrate manufacturing capability and capacity where we need to be before we call out the spec on the next new commercial airplane. So I remain focused on that as a priority, and so far, so good.\nTalent, we were stable over the course of '21. Turnover was managed, I think, quite well and quite aggressively. And so I feel good about that and our ability to hire as we move forward. But I will also acknowledge that there are shortages out there in critical skills, and we have to be very competitive in order to get them.\nI'll highlight the priorities we have. I don't think any of them should surprise anybody. They may look boring with respect to words like stability, safety, quality management. But that is still our focus, and we're going to be relentless about it.\nThis is a very important year as we begin the year and then exit the year where we can predict to customers and to all of you the deliveries of our airplanes and ensure the quality is what it needs to be, et cetera.\nAnd culturally, our team is getting closer to their work than they've ever been. We feel good about that, and we invest. We're investing heavily in the future capabilities of our company.\nSo that's it with respect to my upfront comments. I'll turn it over to Brian. We can go through the quarter's performance and then a little more time for Q&A.\n\nBrian J. West\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, The Boeing Company\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was a year of recovery for our business. We're optimistic about how we're positioned entering into 2022 and have high confidence in the long-term strength of the company.\nWe remain focused on solidifying our business for long-term success. The lessons we've learned and the changes we've implemented in the last 2 years will help us to do that. We're driving safety, quality, stability into every corner of our operations to enable future growth. And we made solid progress against our goals over the last 3 months.\nIn particular, as Dave mentioned, we're proceeding to get 737 MAX airplanes ready to deliver in China as early as the first quarter and follow the lead of our customers and regulators on next steps. On the 787, while we can't predict when deliveries will restart, we have made meaningful strides in addressing many of the nonconformances we identified. We have work remaining to do, and we continue to hold detailed productive discussions with the FAA every step of the way.\nLooking to our financials. Despite some of the near-term challenges, we generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and believe free cash flow will continue to materially improve this year and into 2023.\nWith this backdrop, we think of 2022 in 3 parts. First, we'll focus on reaching key milestones so that we can resume 737 deliveries to Chinese customers and restart 787 deliveries. Then once we achieve these important milestones, we expect to see improvement in our performance metrics, including deliveries, revenue, margin and cash flow. And we intend to come back to you with detailed plans for the rest of the year and beyond.\nFinally, as we move through the second half of the year, our financial performance should start to accelerate. And we think there is a significant opportunity ahead for our company return to sustainable growth. Net debt, we're well positioned at the start of the year and encouraged by the hope of a return to normalcy in 2022.\nBefore I get into the detailed financial results, I want to make a few points on the current environment on Slide 4. Let's start with the demand side. In the commercial market, we continue to see an overall broadening of the recovery starting with domestic traffic, which rebounded to around 90% of prepandemic levels in countries such as the U.S. and Brazil.\nIn the U.S., domestic traffic nearly fully recovered at 94% of pre-COVID levels in November. December data suggests resilient traffic despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, but early 2022 bookings data indicate a more visible negative impact likely extending through February. Beyond that, we expect the recovery for the spring and summer seasons.\nOutside of the U.S., the recovery continues broadening in Europe and South America. However, further lockdowns have stagnated recovery in China, where we have seen traffic decrease considerably. Despite some near-term volatility, we're encouraged by airlines' plans for the spring and summer travel seasons.\nOn the international front, traffic has improved throughout the year from more than 85% below 2019 levels to 60% as the year ended with a meaningful benefit from reopening of borders and lifting of travel restrictions. In particular, the transatlantic corridor showed improvement due to coordinated travel policies between the EU and the U.S.\nThe commercial freighter market continues to be robust with 2021 cargo traffic 7% above prepandemic levels. We saw record freighter demand last year driven by both e-commerce growth and demand for faster, more reliable transport that airfreight can provide. And we're seeing the same steady recovery broadly in our commercial services business as well.\nGiven this demand recovery, our customers are increasingly focused on their medium-term flight planning and continue to prioritize fleet modernization as an enabler to reduce carbon emissions and increase operating efficiency. New airplanes we deliver will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions compared to the airplanes they replace. And as oil prices remain high, our customers are keenly aware of these benefits.\nOverall, our projections for the 3-phase commercial market recovery remain unchanged, and we still assume pass-through traffic will return to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. We continue to see domestic traffic lead the recovery followed by intra-regional and then long-haul international routes. Long-term fundamentals that support demand for air traffic remain intact as we continue to project average traffic growth of mid-single digits over the long term.\nIn the defense and space markets, we're seeing stable demand. We continue to monitor the federal budget process in the U.S. and see strong bipartisan support for national security, including Boeing products and services.\nWhile governments around the world remain focused on COVID-19, security spending remains a priority given global threats. On the supply side, with our production at relatively low rates and higher-than-normal inventory levels, the supply chain is currently not a constraint. However, as we look forward to the industry recovering and future production rate increases, our supply chain remains a key watch item due to raw material and labor availability as well as logistical challenges.\nWe regularly monitor supplier health and have risk mitigation plans in place for critical components. As we prepare for future rate production increases, we will continue to prioritize operational stability across the value stream. Long term, the markets we serve are robust, and we remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and the growth of the industry.\nWith that, let's turn to the financials on Page 5 -- Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue of $14.8 billion declined 3%. And the core operating loss in the quarter was $4.5 billion, resulting in a $7.69 loss per share. We generated positive operating cash flow of over $700 million in the fourth quarter driven by 737 deliveries and favorable receipt timing in BDS.\nLet's now look to Commercial Airplanes on Slide 6. Commercial order activity picked up significantly in 2021 as airlines are positioning for the recovery, particularly in the narrow-body and freighter markets.\nIn total for the year, we booked 909 gross Commercial Airplane orders, including 749 orders for the 737 MAX. We also booked a record number of orders on our freighter airplanes, and we ended the year with 11 straight months of positive net orders. We appreciate every order from our broad customer base, including United, Southwest, Alaska, UPS and FedEx. We are also honored that Akasa, Allegiant and 777 partners recently selected Boeing to support their future fleets. We had over 4,200 airplanes in backlog at the end of 2021 valued at $297 billion.\nFourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, essentially flat, primarily driven by higher 737 deliveries partially offset by lower wide-bodied deliveries and less favorable mix. Operating losses of $4.5 billion were primarily driven by charges on the 787 program, resulting in a negative margin rate.\n787 deliveries remain paused, and we had 110 airplanes in inventory at the end of the quarter. As you know, last year, we set out on a comprehensive program to ensure every 787 airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specifications. We resolved many of the nonconformances and, we're finalizing our work on the remaining items.\nWe also continue to focus on fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the FAA. And we'll follow their lead on the timing of resuming deliveries. While this effort has inevitably impacted our deliveries to customers and our near-term financial performance, we are fully confident is the right thing to do for our future.\nIn the fourth quarter, we determined that the activities required to resume deliveries and the rework that will be needed on each airplane and inventory will take longer than previously expected, resulting in further delays in customer delivery dates. We regret the impact these delays have had on our customers and are working closely with each of them to support their fleet planning needs. Consequently, we're producing at very low rates, and we'll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 airplanes per month over time.\nFrom a financial impact standpoint, we now anticipate 787 abnormal costs will be approximately $2 billion, with most being incurred by the end of 2023. This estimate increased by approximately $1 billion from last quarter due to the additional rework requirements and lower production rates continuing longer than previously expected. We recorded $285 million of these abnormal costs in the fourth quarter.\nAdditionally, we recorded a $3.5 billion noncash charge in the quarter to write down unamortized deferred production costs primarily due to estimated customer compensation for the longer delivery delays. It is important to keep in mind that from an economic standpoint, cash margins on the 787 remain positive. While the additional costs and customer considerations will put some downward pressure on cash margins in the near term, cash margins are expected to remain positive and significantly improve over time.\nWe remain very confident in the future success of the 787, and it remains one of our most compelling programs. Importantly, none of the issues we're addressing have raised immediate safety of flight concerns or impacted the capabilities of the in-service fleet. We received gross orders for 21 airplanes last year, and we see a long runway ahead. We are working diligently to ensure that we are well positioned as demand recovers and accelerates in the future.\nMoving on to the 737 MAX program. The MAX is now approved to fly in over 185 countries. As mentioned, we continue to prepare airplanes for deliveries as early as the first quarter, subject to customer and regulatory approvals in China.\nWe also delivered 245 737 MAX airplanes last year, and we've steadily ramped up production. And we are now producing at 27 airplanes per month on our way to 31 per month early this year.\nAs you look to ramp both our production rate and delivery gains this year, we will continue to monitor the impact of Omicron on resource availability. We currently have 335 737 MAX airplanes in inventory and still anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023.\nTiming and pace of deliveries to Chinese customers are also critical assumptions to our delivery outlook. 737 abnormal costs and the liability for 737 MAX customer considerations are largely behind us. We expect the majority of the remaining $2.9 billion liability to be liquidated this year with less than 10% of the total estimate left to be negotiated.\nOn the 777X, we continue to progress through our rigorous and comprehensive test program. We have flown over 1,800 flight hours through the end of 2021. We also completed engine and airplane performance testing, and the airplane continues to perform in line with our customer commitments. Our customers recognize the compelling economics and sustainability benefits this airplane offers.\nWe remain engaged with the FAA and other global regulators throughout this process. We're working towards reaching type inspection authorization or TIA, which is a pacing item for us to begin FAA certification flight testing. We are still anticipating delivery of the first airplane in late 2023.\nAlso, we are currently offering the freighter version of our 777X airplane to customers. And we'll keep you updated as we progress on sales campaigns and conclude our launch timing evaluation. As a result of increasing freighter demand we plan to increase the combined 777, 777X production rate from 2 to 3 per month this year and expect 2022 deliveries to be relatively in line with last year.\nLet's now move to Defense, Space & Security on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was $5.9 billion, down 14%, and operating margin was negative 4.4%. These results were primarily driven by lower volume and less favorable performance across the portfolio, including a $402 million pretax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. The charge is primarily driven by evolving customer requirements for a remote vision system as well as factory and supply chain disruptions, including the impact of COVID.\nOn the commercial crew program, as previously shared, we and NASA anticipate the second uncrewed orbital flight test to occur in May. We received $7 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for modernization of Airborne Warning and Control System to Royal Saudi Air Force.\nThe BDS backlog increased to $60 billion. During the quarter, BDS also delivered on critical customer milestones. Overall, we remain optimistic about our defense business.\nNow let's turn to Global Services results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter Global Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 15%, and operating margin was 9.3%. Results were driven by higher commercial services volume and favorable mix.\nEarnings were impacted by a $220 million inventory impairment in the fourth quarter. We received $6 billion in orders during the quarter, taking the BGS backlog to $20 billion. We also delivered the 50th 767-300 converted freighter and announced plans to add 10 new converted freighter lines. Our services business has shown great resilience in part due to the balance of both defense and commercial offerings.\nLet's move to Slide 9 and cover the full year financials. Full year revenue of $62.3 billion improved 7% versus prior year. The core operating loss was negative $4.1 billion, an improvement of $10.1 billion. The resulting core loss per share was $9.44 primarily driven by the charge on the 787.\nOperating cash flow was negative $3.4 billion, an improvement of $15 billion. The end-year cash usage was driven by 787 inventory build, 737 customer considerations and interest payments, partially offset by commercial deliveries, order activity, favorable timing of cash receipts at BDS and tax refunds related to the CARES Act.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10 to cover cash and debt. We ended the fourth quarter with strong liquidity, comprised of $16.2 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet and access to $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn.\nOur debt balance decreased by $4.3 billion from the end of the third quarter to $58.1 billion driven by the early pay down of the delayed draw term loan. We remain committed to reducing debt levels, and our investment-grade credit rating is a priority.\nPlease turn to the next slide for a look at 2022 and key drivers of the business. As you look ahead, 2022 performance will be driven by the commercial market recovery, return to delivery for the 787 and 737 MAX in China, production system and delivery stability and U.S.-China trade relations.\nOur efforts to stabilize our production system, including the supply chain and improve our delivery predictability, remain top priorities. These activities will be paramount to our success. Looking broadly across our enterprise, we're maintaining, in some cases, expanding key investments in our people, technology, manufacturing capabilities and strategic partnerships.\nWe're advancing our development of the MAX 7, MAX 10 and 777X programs, all while continuing to invest in digital capabilities to support our next commercial airplane program. In BDS, we're progressing on the MQ-25, T-7A, Commercial Crew and several other key development programs. As we invest, we continue to be laser-focused on our business transformation efforts to drive quality, productivity and cash flow.\nNow let's take a look at the key drivers of 2022 revenue and cash. We anticipate revenue increase primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 737 and 787 programs. That said, revenue will be impacted by 787 customer considerations and delivering 737 airplanes that were previously remarketed. We are forecasting stable revenue in our defense business and solid growth in our services business as the commercial market continues to improve.\nMoving to cash. We still expect to generate positive free cash flow in the year. The key driver remains higher 737 and 787 delivery volume. Keep in mind the working capital benefit from delivering airplanes from inventory will be partially offset by a lower advances in progress payments balance. We still anticipate a significant burn down of our advances balance this year, which we expect to be more front-end loaded in line with customer discussions.\nAdditionally, cash flow will remain impacted by timing of receipts and expenditures. As you may recall, we booked orders last year that filled near-term skyline positions, and those unique receipts may not continue at the same levels this year.\nFrom a phasing standpoint, we anticipate the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year for deliveries, revenue, earnings and cash flow. First quarter cash flow could look similar to the usage we saw in 1Q '21 driven by unfavorable receipt timing, excess advance payment burn down, resource availability due to the Omicron variant and normal seasonality. We remain confident that our free cash flow will improve in the second quarter and will meaningfully accelerate in the back half of the year as we achieve the key delivery milestones that I previously outlined.\nAs you look to the future, we expect 2023 cash flow will be materially higher than 2022. We look forward to sharing more details on our plan as soon as we can.\nIn closing, the business environment remains dynamic, but we've made important progress. We are confident that we're on the right path, we're taking the right steps to drive stability and making the right investments to ensure the business is well positioned for future growth.\nWith that, closing comments?\n\nDavid L. Calhoun\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Boeing Company\n\nYes, no further comments. I'd like to turn it over to questions and give all our time to that. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; our Chief Risk Officer, Brad Bender; as well as other members of Truist senior management team.\nDuring this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for the remainder of 2025. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements, and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our third quarter results, let's begin, as we always do at Truist with purpose on Slide 4. At Truist, our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities, guides every decision. It's the foundation of our strategy and the reason our fantastic teammate show up every day with conviction and care.\nWe believe purpose drives performance, which is why during the third quarter, we announced a strategic investment designed to accelerate our performance by building better lives, deepening relationships with existing clients and attracting new clients in some of the strongest markets in the country. We're investing in our communities by building 100 new insight-driven branches in high-growth markets, renovating more than 300 locations, enhancing digital capabilities, elevating marketing and hiring Premier advisers to serve clients with more complex financial needs.\nThese new branches are designed for smarter client engagement with advanced AI-driven technology and dedicated premier adviser spaces all aimed at helping clients achieve financial success and further strengthening our presence in these dynamic communities. These investments are part of our overall strategy to improve our profitability, accelerate growth by deepening relationships and delivering a more personalized technology-enabled experience to new and existing clients, which I'll discuss throughout today's call.\nSo now let's turn to our results on Slide 5. For the third quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $1.04 a share which included $0.02 a share of restructuring charges primarily related to severance. At a high level, our strong performance in the third quarter reflects the diversity of our business model and the execution of many of our strategic growth and profitability initiatives that we've been discussing for the last several quarters. These initiatives include accelerating growth and the addition of new clients and deepening existing relationships in areas like payments, wealth and premier banking. We're executing our plan while maintaining our expense and credit discipline and returning capital to shareholders.\nDuring the third quarter, average loan balances increased 2.5% as we saw broad-based growth across our wholesale and consumer segments, driven by increased loan production and new client acquisition. Average deposit balances did decline linked quarter due to 2 large M&A-related client deposits that were withdrawn in mid-July that we've discussed previously. Excluding the impact of these deposits, average client deposits increased during the quarter.\nAdjusted noninterest income increased 9.9% linked quarter to more than $1.5 billion due to strong investment banking and trading income and strong wealth management income. The third quarter represented our best noninterest income quarter since the divestiture of TIH. Adjusted expenses remained well controlled and were up just 1% linked quarter, which, along with the strong revenue performance helped drive 270 basis points of linked quarter positive operating leverage. We also maintained strong asset quality metrics as net charge-offs declined both on a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis.\nFinally, we remain in a strong capital position, which allowed us to support our balance sheet growth and return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through our common stock dividend and the repurchase of 500 million shares -- $500 million of our common stock. We plan to target approximately $750 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter.\nIn summary, our third quarter results were strong as the combination of improved revenue, disciplined expense and credit management, a robust capital return drove 130 basis points sequential improvement and our ROTCE to 13.6%. We do still have a lot of work to do. But our recent performance and the momentum I see across the company every day gives me confidence in our ability to reach a 15% ROTCE in 2027. I'll share more on how we plan to get there later in the call.\nBefore I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our quarterly results, I want to spend some time discussing the progress we're making on our strategic priorities and the positive momentum we're seeing within our business segments and with our digital strategy on Slide 6.\nLet me first start with Consumer and Small Business Banking. I'm encouraged by another solid quarter of consumer loan and deposit growth, net new checking account growth and progress with our premier banking clients as we deepened relationships and acquire key new clients and households through digital and traditional channels. Net new checking account growth remained positive in the third quarter with over 20,000 new consumer and small business accounts added, a key metric that reflects both the strength of our brand and the long-term growth potential of our company.\nWe're attracting younger clients with greater median incomes, higher average balances, which aligns directly with our strategy to build enduring profitable relationships early in the client life cycle. Average consumer and small business deposit balances increased modestly linked quarter and 1.9% versus the third quarter of 2024. Average loan balances increased 2% linked quarter and 7% versus the third quarter of 2024, driven by a significant increase in production.\nPremier Banking continues to be a strategic growth engine. We saw significant increases in loan and deposit production per banker, reflecting deeper client engagement and improved productivity. Our digital strategy is also delivering results. We continue to accelerate our performance with enhancements, increased production and accelerated client engagement positioning us to scale efficiently and meet evolving client expectations as seen with the success of our AI-enabled chat function Truist Assist.\nDigital transactions rose 7% year-over-year and digital channels accounted for 40% of new to bank clients. Notably, Gen Z and Millennials represented 63% of this growth, a strong signal that our digital-first approach is resonating with the next generation of Truist clients.\nIn wholesale, I'm encouraged by this quarter's loan growth, improvement in investment banking and trading revenue and progress in key focus areas like payments and wealth. Average wholesale loans increased 2.8% linked quarter and 4.8% year-over-year, driven by growth from new and existing clients and increased production. C&I growth was broad-based across industry banking verticals as this strategy continues to gain traction.\nWe've seen consistent quarterly growth in balances fueled by new client acquisition across diverse sectors supported by strategic talent investments. Year-to-date, we've onboarded twice as many new corporate and commercial clients compared to the same period last year, we're seeing higher revenue per client, a clear sign of deepening relationships. In wealth, net asset flows remain positive and year-to-date AUM from wholesale and premier clients is up 27% versus the prior year, reflecting strong adviser productivity and overall client trust.\nOur payments business continues to scale, launching new solutions that deliver speed, simplicity and security to our clients. These enhancements, along with targeted talent investments drove an 11% year-over-year increase in treasury management revenue.\nNow let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Mike?\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with our performance highlights on Slide 7. We reported third quarter 2025 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $1.3 billion or $1.04 per share. Included in our results are $0.02 per share of restructuring charges, which are primarily related to severance.\nNow moving to third quarter results. Adjusted revenue increased 3.7% linked quarter due to 9.9% growth in noninterest income and 1.2% growth in net interest income. Adjusted expenses increased 1% linked quarter, primarily due to higher personnel expenses related to incentives and strategic hiring efforts. Our asset quality metrics remain solid as net charge-offs declined on a linked quarter basis and on a year-over-year basis. Our CET1 capital ratio remained stable at 11% and our CET1 ratio, including AOCI, improved by 10 basis points to 9.4%.\nI'll now cover loans and leases on Slide 8. Average loans held for investment increased by 2.5% on a linked quarter basis to $320 billion due to growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Average commercial loans increased by $4.8 billion or 2.6% due to $3.7 billion of growth in C&I loans and $1.5 billion of growth in CRE loans, partially offset by lower commercial construction loan balances.\nIn our consumer portfolio, average loans increased $3 billion or 2.5% linked quarter due to growth in other consumer, residential mortgage and indirect auto. The average loan yield remained relatively stable on a linked quarter basis.\nMoving now to deposit trends on Slide 9. Average deposits decreased $3.9 billion sequentially or 1% due to the mid-July withdrawal of $10.9 billion of short-term M&A-related client deposits that we've discussed previously. These deposits impacted the second quarter average balance by $10.9 billion and the third quarter average balance by $1.7 billion.\nAs Bill mentioned, many of our top business and growth initiatives are aimed at driving core client deposit growth. As a result, we're seeing accelerating momentum with clients and consumer and wholesale that will drive improved client deposit growth in the fourth quarter and in 2026. As shown in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta improved from 37% to 38% on a linked-quarter basis. Based on our outlook for stronger client deposit growth in the fourth quarter and our expectation for 2 additional 25 basis point reductions in the Fed funds rate in October and December, we remain on track and confident in our ability to drive our interest-bearing deposit beta to the mid-40% area in the fourth quarter.\nMoving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 10. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 1.2% linked quarter or $45 million, primarily due to one additional day in the third quarter, loan growth and fixed rate asset repricing. Our net interest margin declined 1 basis point linked quarter to 3.01%. We expect net interest income to grow approximately 2% on a linked-quarter basis in the fourth quarter due to continued loan growth, growth in client deposits and a reduction in deposit costs following the September reduction in the Fed funds rate and our expectation for the additional 2 cuts during the fourth quarter.\nThese positive factors should result in net interest margin expansion in the fourth quarter as well. As you can see on the top right-hand side of the slide, we updated our outlook for the fixed rate asset repricing. We expect to reprice approximately $11 billion of fixed rate loans and approximately $3 billion of investment securities during the fourth quarter. Based on our view of interest rates for the remainder of 2025, we anticipate that new fixed rate loans will have a run-on rate of around 7% compared with a runoff rate of closer to 6.4%. We may allocate a portion of the cash flows from the investment portfolio to support loan growth in the fourth quarter versus securities.\nWe also updated our swap portfolio disclosure on the bottom right-hand side of the slide. As of September 30, we had $105 billion of notional received fixed swaps and $28 billion of notional pay-fixed swaps compared with $90 billion and $29 billion, respectively, at June 30. During the quarter, we increased our notional received fixed swap position by adding additional forward starting received fixed swaps as part of our overall strategy to maintain a relatively neutral position to changes in rates relative to our baseline view.\nTurning now to noninterest income on Slide 11. Adjusted noninterest income increased $140 million or 9.9% versus the second quarter of 2025 due to strong growth in investment banking and trading income and wealth management income, partially offset by lower other income. Investment banking and trading income increased $118 million or 58% linked quarter to $323 million. We saw improved performance across our platform with strength in debt capital markets and trading revenue. Based on our current pipeline and overall strong market activity, we remain optimistic about investment banking and trading income in the fourth quarter as well.\nWealth management income also experienced a strong quarter with fees up 7.5% linked quarter due to higher market values, positive net asset flows and new client acquisitions. On a like-quarter basis, adjusted noninterest income increased $75 million or 5.1% compared to the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher wealth management income and higher service charges on deposits due to greater treasury management revenue.\nNext, I'll cover noninterest expense on Slide 12. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of restructuring charges, increased 1% linked quarter due primarily to higher personnel expenses related to higher incentives and strategic hiring efforts. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted expenses remained well controlled and were up 2.4% due primarily to higher personnel expense.\nMoving now to asset quality on Slide 13. Our asset quality metrics remain strong on both the linked and like-quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and the proactive approach we've taken to quickly resolve problem loans. Net charge-offs decreased 3 basis points linked quarter to 48 basis points and were down 7 basis points versus the third quarter of 2024 as we benefit from lower CRE losses on both a linked and like-quarter basis. Our loan loss provision exceeded net charge-offs by $51 million, and our ALLL ratio held steady at 1.54% of total loans.\nNonperforming loans held for investment increased 9 basis points linked quarter to 48 basis points of total loans. Second quarter nonperforming loans of 39 basis points benefited from the resolution of several problem loans resulting in NPLs declining to multi-quarter lows. As you can see on the slide, the third quarter of 2025 level remained stable compared to the third quarter of 2024, which reflects a return to a more recent level. The linked quarter increase was driven by higher nonperforming C&I and construction loans, partially offset by a decline in CRE nonperforming loans.\nOver the last week, there have been a number of questions about exposures to certain borrowers, including Tricolor and [indiscernible] brands. Just to address it, Truist does not have any exposure to tricolor However, we do have exposure to [indiscernible] brands, but this exposure is fully reflected in our loan loss reserve and our updated and improved 2025 net charge-off guidance.\nNow I'll provide additional color on our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025 for the full year on Slide 14. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to increase by approximately 1% to 2% relative to third quarter revenue of $5.2 billion. We expect net interest income to increase approximately 2% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by loan growth and lower deposit costs. We expect noninterest income to remain relatively stable linked quarter. Adjusted expenses of $3 billion in the third quarter are expected to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis.\nAs it relates to buybacks, as Bill mentioned, we plan to target $750 million for the fourth quarter. For full year 2025, our outlook for revenue and expense growth is unchanged. Based on our current outlook for net interest income and noninterest income in the fourth quarter, we would expect annual revenue to come in around the midpoint of our 1.5% to 2.5% range.\nIn terms of our outlook for adjusted expenses, we continue to expect full year '25 adjusted expenses to increase by approximately 1% in '25 versus '24. On asset quality, we expect net charge-offs of 55 basis points in 2025 compared with our previous guide of 55 to 60 basis points. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17.5% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis in 2025.\nI'll now hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. As I mentioned earlier in the call, our recent performance, coupled with the strong momentum I see every day inside our company reinforces my confidence in our ability to accelerate growth and profitability over the near term. As you can see on Slide 15, we expect to grow revenue in 2026 at a higher rate than we will grow revenue in 2025. Although it's a little too early to provide specifics on the 2026 outlook, I'll say at this point, we expect the rate of revenue growth in 2026 to more than double versus our growth rate this year. We also expect to generate more operating leverage in 2026 that we'll generate this year. In addition, we plan to increase our share repurchase program in 2026 to $3 billion or $4 billion which is above the 2025 level as will now target a 10% CET1 ratio by the end of 2027.\nFinally, these drivers and others should also accelerate our EPS growth rate beyond what we'll achieve in 2025. As I've discussed today, we're seeing solid progress in many of our key strategic focus areas, all of which I expect to accelerate over the near term and help us achieve our previously stated goal of a mid-teens ROTCE which I'll discuss in more detail on Slide 16.\nAs shown on Slide 16, we're targeting a 15% ROTCE in 2027. We a goal that reflects our confidence in Truist's long-term earnings power and strategic direction. We see multiple paths to stronger revenue and profitability, with focused execution, we believe these initiatives will deliver meaningful improvement over the next 2 years. The key drivers outlined on the right side of the slide, include continuing to execute against our top business growth and profitability initiatives that I discussed on Slide 6, continuing to drive positive operating leverage realizing the ongoing benefit from fixed asset repricing and accelerating share buybacks.\nMuch of our profitability improvement and growth potential is rooted in deepening relationships with existing clients particularly in wealth payments, premier banking, investment banking and trading and corporate and commercial Banking where we're already experiencing strong momentum.\nIn summary, I'm as optimistic as ever about Truist's future. I'm encouraged by the momentum we're seeing across the businesses and remain focused on executing with discipline, delivering for our clients and creating value for our shareholders. I want to pause and thank all of our teammates for their incredible focus, their productivity and their purpose-driven commitment to move Truist forward. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and support and we look forward to updating you on progress in the quarters ahead.\nWith that, Brad, let me hand it back over to you for Q&A."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire, and Chief Risk Officer, Brad Bender, as well as other members of Truist's senior management team.\nDuring this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an outlook for 2025. The company's presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call this morning. Before we discuss the second quarter results, let's begin like we always do at Truist with purpose on Slide 4.\nAt Truist, our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. It's more than a statement. It's the foundation of our strategy. It's the lens through which we make decisions and the reasons teammates show up every day with conviction and care. In the second quarter, we continue to bring this purpose to life in meaningful ways. We welcomed the dynamic slate of new leaders across our company, reinforcing our commitment to attracting top talent to our already highly experienced and very capable teams.\nThese leaders were attracted to our purpose-driven culture and are already making meaningful impact, strengthening our presence in key growth markets and expanding our capabilities across high-potential verticals. From sector-specific coverage to commercial and middle market banking to small business, wealth, premier banking and payments.\nOur teams are deepening client relationships, driving new business and positioning Truist for the long-term sustainable growth all of which were evident in the second quarter results.\nSo on Slide 5, for the second quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 a share which included $0.02 of restructuring charges related to severance and $0.01 of losses from the sale of certain investment securities. At a high level, our solid performance in the second quarter reflects the diversity of our business model and the execution of many of our strategic growth initiatives that we've been discussing now for several quarters.\nThese initiatives include accelerating growth through the addition of new clients and deepening existing client relationships in areas like payments, wealth and premier banking. We're executing our plan while maintaining our expense and credit discipline and returning capital to shareholders.\nDuring the second quarter, average loan balances increased 2% and end of period loans increased 3.3% linked quarter. Growth was broad-based across our consumer and wholesale segments and driven by increased loan production and new client acquisition. Our lending pipelines remained strong and overall loan production is up significantly year-over-year. Growth should also benefit from our expansion efforts in markets where we have smaller but growing share and for many of the new teammates that have joined our company.\nThis quarter's loan growth helped offset the equity and debt market volatility that occurred early in the quarter. This volatility impacted trading capital markets and M&A activity for the industry, resulting in lower revenue for our investment banking and trading businesses. As you've heard me discuss previously, I'm confident that our advice-driven business model is well suited to help our clients navigate current market conditions and continue to grow our share, given the ongoing investments we're making in talent, products and industry verticals.\nWe believe that our investment banking and trading business is well positioned for a second half recovery as we saw steady improvement in overall investment banking revenue in each month during the quarter. Adjusted expenses did come at the high end of the expected range, but we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 1% expense growth target and positive operating leverage in this year. That includes the impact of ongoing investments in talent and technology. We also maintained strong asset quality metrics as both nonperforming loans and net charge-offs were down 9 basis points linked quarter.\nIn addition, we also received favorable results from the Federal Reserve's annual stress test. We expect that our stress capital buffer will decline and be Florida 2.5% effective October 1.\nFinally, we remain in a strong capital position, which allows us to support our balance sheet growth and return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders through our common stock dividend and the repurchase of $750 million of our common stock.\nOur share repurchase activity in the second quarter included $250 million of repurchases above our recent $500 million quarterly target as we opportunistically took advantage of market volatility and weakness in our share price early in the quarter. We do plan to target approximately $500 million of share repurchases during the third quarter.\nBefore I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the quarterly results, I'm going to spend some time discussing the progress we're already making on our strategic priorities and the positive momentum we're seeing within our business segments and with our digital initiatives on Slides 6 and 7.\nIn Consumer and Small Business banking, I'm encouraged by another solid quarter of consumer loan and deposit growth, net new checking account growth and progress with our premier banking clients as we deepened relationships and acquired key new clients and households through digital and traditional channels. Net new checking account growth, which is a key measure for the growth potential and health of our company was once again positive in the second quarter as we added nearly 37,000 new customers -- new consumer and small business accounts.\nImportantly, we're attracting younger clients with higher average balances and greater median income which aligns with our strategy to engage clients early in building during relationships over time. Average consumer and small business loan balances increased 2.8% linked quarter and end of period balances increased 3.8% due to growth in residential mortgage, indirect auto and other consumer with production up significantly year-over-year.\nOver the last year, we've added significant numbers of new partners and dealers to our Service Finance and Sheffield platforms, which is helping drive the growth in other consumer loan balances. We also saw a significant increase in loan and deposit production per banker in our Premier Banking segment, which is a key area of strategic focus. We're growing while also maintaining our credit and pricing discipline.\nConsumer net charge-offs of 71 basis points reached their lowest level since the third quarter of 2023 and new production spreads remained accretive to the overall portfolio. In wholesale, I'm encouraged by this quarter's loan growth, improved production and progress in key focus areas like payments and wealth.\nDuring the quarter, we saw 1.5% growth in average wholesale loans and 2.9% growth in end-of-period loans driven by growth from new and existing clients and increased production. Average C&I growth was driven by all of our industry banking groups with particular strength in FIG and energy, middle market lending and structured credit. As I've mentioned previously, we have a specific focus on capturing more of the middle market. We've seen these balances increase in each quarter this year driven by new clients in a wide variety of industries in a targeted select geographies where we continue to expand.\nYear-to-date, we've attracted twice as many new corporate and commercial clients to our platform compared with the same period a year ago while we're also seeing a 40% increase in revenue per client. In wealth, net asset flows were positive despite volatile equity in fixed income markets. Digital innovation, Truist became the first financial institution to prove request for payment over the RTP network via an alias such as a cell phone or an e-mail address. This innovation is designed to unlock meaningful value for both commercial and consumer clients accelerating cash flow, improving reconciliation and delivering real-time confirmations.\nThese enhancements, along with continued investments and our team have driven a meaningful increase in treasury management penetration rates with our existing clients and help drive a 14% increase in treasury management revenue versus the second quarter of last year. Enhancing the client experience and growing our digital capabilities are also important parts of our strategy, let me discuss that in detail on Slide 7.\nWe continue to see strong momentum in our digital strategy with meaningful progress platform integration, engagement and production. In the second quarter, digital account production rose 17% year-over-year with 43% of new-to-bank clients joining us through digital channels a 900 basis point increase versus the second quarter of last year. This momentum reflects investments we've made in our digital platform and improvements we've made to the digital onboarding experience. A key milestone this quarter was fully integrating Lightstream lending products into our digital platform under the new LightStream by Truist brand.\nThis integration expands access to lending solutions for all Truist clients and further strengthens our digital offering. We're also seeing deeper engagement across our digital platform. More than 1.8 million clients are now using our digital financial management tools, and that's a 40% increase from last year. Together, these results highlight the strength of our digital foundation and our continued focus on delivering value, operating efficiently and deepening client relationships. We expect to continue growing our digital presence with clients as we further leverage our modern and scalable technology platform.\nNow let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mike?\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our financial performance highlights on Slide 8. We reported second quarter 2025 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 per share. As Bill mentioned, included in our results are $0.02 per share of restructuring charges, which are primarily related to severance.\nIn addition, our results included an $18 million pretax loss or 0.01 per share after tax related to to the sale of $398 million of lower-yielding investment securities. We invested the proceeds from the sale into higher-yielding investment securities and anticipate an earn back of approximately 2 years.\nMoving now to 2Q '25 results. Adjusted revenue increased 2.1% linked quarter due to 2.3% growth in net interest income and 1.8% growth in noninterest income. Adjusted expenses increased 2.1% linked quarter primarily due to higher personnel expenses related to annual merit increases and strategic hiring efforts.\nAs Bill mentioned, our asset quality metrics showed improvement as both nonperforming loans and net charge-offs declined on a linked quarter basis and year-over-year basis. Next, I'll cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans held for investment increased 2% on a linked-quarter basis due to growth in both average commercial and average consumer loans. End-of-period loans increased $10.2 billion or 3.3% split evenly between commercial and consumer loans.\nAverage commercial loans increased $3 billion or 1.6% due to $3.3 billion of growth in C&I loans partially offset by modest declines in CRE and commercial construction loan balances. In our consumer portfolio, average loans increased $3.2 billion or 2.7% linked quarter due to growth in residential mortgage, indirect auto and other consumer. Other consumer loans, which primarily includes Sheffield and Service Finance, are typically seasonally strongest in the second and third quarters of the year, but are also benefiting from new partners and dealers added to the platforms throughout the course of the year.\nMoving to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits increased $8.3 billion sequentially or 2.1%, driven by growth in interest checking, time deposits and noninterest-bearing demand. Average deposit balances were impacted by $10.9 billion of short-term client deposits that we discussed on last quarter's earnings call. These deposits remained on our balance sheet for the entire quarter, but have since been withdrawn.\nExcluding the impact of these deposits, average deposit balances would have been down slightly on a linked quarter basis. As shown in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of Slide 10, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta declined from 43% to 37% on a linked quarter basis. If you were to exclude the impact of the 2 larger short-term deposits, the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits and our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta would have been relatively stable.\nMoving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased 2.3% linked quarter or $80 million, primarily due to the impact of loan growth, fixed asset -- fixed rate asset repricing and 1 additional day in the second quarter. Our net interest income or margin increased 1 basis point on a linked-quarter basis to 3.02%. As you can see on the top right-hand side of the slide, we updated our outlook for fixed rate asset repricing.\nWe expect to reprice approximately $27 billion of fixed rate loans and investment securities over the remainder of 2025. Depending on the level of loan and deposit growth in the second half of 2025, we may opt to use cash flow from the investment portfolio to fund a portion of our loan growth for the remainder of the year. Based on our current view of interest rates for the remainder of 2025, we anticipate that new fixed rate loans will have a run-on rate of around 7% compared with a runoff rate of approximately 6.4%. We also updated our swap portfolio disclosure in the bottom right-hand corner of the slide. This reflects a small increase in our received fixed swap program from the prior quarter.\nTurning to noninterest income on Slide 12. Adjusted noninterest income increased $25 million or 1.8% versus the first quarter of 2025 as growth in our other income was partially offset by lower investment banking and trading revenue. The linked quarter increase in noninterest income was primarily attributable to an $83 million increase in other income related to higher [ NCDCP ] income, which is offset by personnel expense and income from certain equity investments and other investments that were lower in the first quarter of 2025.\nInvestment banking and trading income declined $68 million or 25% linked quarter, reflecting weaker trading results, lower capital markets activity and lower M&A volumes during the first half of the second quarter. Early in the quarter, our trading business, which primarily supports our investment banking franchise, incurred losses driven by market volatility. The month of May was much improved, and June was more consistent with the performance we have historically experienced in this business and would expect to perform for the remainder of the year.\nAs Bill mentioned, we also saw improvement in investment banking in the second half of the quarter and we remain optimistic about investment banking and trading revenue improving in the second half of 2025 based on our current pipeline and an improvement in overall activity.\nOn a like-quarter basis, adjusted noninterest income declined $20 million or 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower investment banking and trading income and lower wealth management income due to the sale of Sterling Capital Management in July 2024.\nNext, I'll cover noninterest expense on Slide 13. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of restructuring charges, increased 3.1% linked quarter due primarily to higher personnel expenses related to annual merit increases and strategic hiring efforts.\nOn a year-over-year basis, expenses remained well controlled and were up 2.1% due primarily to higher professional fees and outside processing expense related to ongoing investments in technology and in our risk infrastructure.\nMoving now to asset quality on Slide 14. Our asset quality metrics remain strong on both a like and linked quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. Net charge-offs decreased 9 basis points to 51 basis points linked quarter and were down 7 basis points versus the second quarter of 2024 as we benefited from lower consumer and CRE losses on both a linked and like quarter basis. Our loan loss provision exceeded net charge-offs by $92 million, but improved outlook for loss rates in certain portfolios like CRE Office and multifamily contributed to a 4 basis point decrease and our ALLL ratio to 1.54% of total loans.\nOur CRE office portfolio, which represents just above 1% of total loans, declined almost $500 million linked quarter on an end-of-period basis. Nonperforming loans held for investment as a percentage of total loans decreased 9 basis points linked quarter and 7 basis points on a like-quarter basis to 39 basis points of total loans. We saw linked quarter improvement in several categories, including CRE and C&I nonperforming loans, which helped drive our nonperforming loan level to multi-quarter look.\nTurning to capital on Slide 15. On a linked quarter basis, our CET1 ratio declined 30 basis points to 11% as balance sheet growth, $750 million of share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend more than offset our period earnings.\nOur CET1 capital ratio, including the impact of AOCI, declined 30 basis points linked quarter to 9.3%, reflecting the aforementioned factors. During the quarter, we also received favorable CCAR results, resulting in a 50 basis point decrease in our total loss rate and a 90 basis point decrease in our CET1 erosion rate.\nAs a result, we anticipate our stress capital buffer to decline 30 basis points and to be floored at 2.5% effective October 1. At June 30, our CET1 ratio was 400 basis points higher than our new regulatory minimum of 7% leaving us well positioned to both grow our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.\nNext, I'll provide additional color on our guidance for the third quarter of 2025 and for the full year. That's on Slide 16. For full year 2025, our outlook for revenue and expense growth is unchanged. We continue to expect revenue to increase 1.5% to 2.5% relative to 2024 adjusted revenue of $20.1 billion. Net interest income remains on track to increase 3% in '25 versus 2024. Our net interest income outlook assumes low single-digit average loan growth; and two, 25 basis point reduction in the Fed funds rate in September and December compared with 3 previously in June, September and December.\nWe expect noninterest income to remain relatively flat '25 versus 2024. In terms of our outlook for adjusted expenses, we continue to expect full year '25 adjusted expenses to increase by approximately 1% in 2025 versus 2024, which is also unchanged from our previous guidance and continues to imply a positive operating leverage of approximately 50 to 150 basis points.\nIn terms of asset quality, we expect net charge-offs of 55 to 60 basis points in 2025 compared with 60 basis points previously. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17.5% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis in 2025 compared with 17% and 20% previously due to a lower contribution from nontaxable income and certain tax law changes in states in which we operate.\nLooking into the third quarter of 2025 we expect revenue to increase approximately 2.5% to 3.5% relative to second quarter revenue of $5.1 billion. We expect net interest income to increase approximately 2% in the third quarter primarily driven by loan growth, the benefit from fixed asset repricing and an additional day in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. We expect noninterest income to increase by about 5% driven primarily by higher investment banking and trading income, partially offset by lower other income.\nAdjusted expenses of $3 billion in the second quarter are expected to increase about 1% linked quarter. As it relates to buybacks, as Bill mentioned, we plan to target up to $500 million for the third quarter.\nSo with that, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. At the beginning of the year, we outlined several strategic priorities that would be key to driving our performance this year and beyond. These top priorities included a keen focus on executing our strategic growth initiatives driving positive operating leverage, continuing to invest in talent and technology, maintaining our credit and risk discipline and returning capital to shareholders.\nAlthough there's still a significant amount of opportunity that lies in front of us, I'm pleased with both the performance and the momentum at the midpoint of this year. We're seeing solid progress in our key strategic focus areas, including premier banking, wealth, payments and middle market as production, deepening with our existing client base and banker productivity have increased in all areas of our business.\nWe also remain on track to deliver our goal of positive operating leverage in 2025 despite what's turned out to be a more challenging first 6 months in our investment banking and trading business. We continue to invest in important areas like talent, technology and our risk infrastructure to improve the client experience.\nOur credit and risk discipline has remained strong as evidenced by favorable CCAR results and the improvement in asset quality metrics which currently sit at multi-quarter lows. Finally, our strong capital position continues to afford us the ability to grow our balance sheet while also returning more than $2.6 billion worth of capital to our shareholders through the first half of the year.\nWe will remain focused on these key strategic initiatives as we strive to generate better returns and greater shareholder value over time. I am optimistic as ever about our future especially in light of the momentum that I see every day inside our company. I want to pause and thank all of our incredible teammates for their purposeful focus and productivity in moving our company forward.\nSo thank you all for your interest in Truist. And with that, let me turn it over to Brad for Q&A."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike McGuire; our Chief Risk Officer, Brad Minder, as well as other members of Truist's senior management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's first quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2025.\nThe accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. So before we discuss our first quarter results, let's begin, as we always do, with purpose on Slide 4. Truist is a purpose-driven company, dedicated and inspired in building better lives and communities, which is the foundation to guide for everything we do. In times like this, with a little more uncertainty, our purposeful approach delivered with care resonates more than ever. We're committed to being a steady, reliable and supportive partner helping our clients with financial planning and personalized experiences from dedicated industry specialists that focus on understanding their needs.\nWe're here to support our clients and communities with our strong balance sheet, expert industry advice, digital capabilities and a comprehensive suite of products. Our capital position, our liquidity, our strong market share and our talented purposeful teammates delivering against a clear strategy have us well positioned for any environment. We're going to provide some more examples of how our purposeful approach is driving our results throughout the call today.\nSo now turning to our results on Slide 5. Market volatility and economic uncertainty have certainly increased, which has resulted in a change in our view of the operating environment. Investment banking and capital markets activity has slowed materially and the shape of the yield curve has shifted. As a result of these conditions, we're reducing our revenue outlook, which now assumes a flat year-over-year investment banking and trading revenue and slightly lower net interest income due to lower medium-term interest rates. Given this outlook, we've also reduced our expenses for the year and are opportunistically buying back additional shares in the second quarter. p\nBut what's not changing is our focus on our 5 key strategic priorities aimed at driving better growth, improving profitability towards our medium-term targets and achieving positive operating leverage. First, we're executing against our strategic growth initiatives, which include deepening and expanding existing client relationships in areas like Premier Banking, middle market banking, payments and wealth all of which represents significant opportunities to capture additional share within our existing client base.\nSecond, we're fully committed to maintaining our expense discipline, which was once again evident in the first quarter. We continue to expect to achieve positive operating leverage in 2025. I believe that we can offset a portion of our lower revenue outlook by finding additional efficiencies in our company. Third, although the absolute rate of expense growth will be lower, we are continuing our investments in talent and our technology platform, which is improving the client experience, driving new account production and delivering efficiencies.\nOne example of these investments is a new patented artificial intelligence tool called Truist Client Pulse that will give our teammates insights into friction points with clients. We'll be able to leverage real-time actionable data to effectively listen to our clients' needs and enhance their Truist experience. Fourth, we'll never take for granted our strong track record of asset quality as we will continue to focus on maintaining strong risk discipline and controls. We have strengthened and derisked our balance sheet over the last several years, and our credit and risk teams are fully engaged with our clients to better understand the impact of the changing economic landscape.\nFinally, our relative capital advantage allows us to accomplish our strategic growth goals and return capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years. As you can see, we continue to feel good about our strong foundation and our positive momentum across our banking franchise, which was evident in our first quarter results. For the first quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.87 a share. At a high level, a solid performance in the first quarter was defined by several key themes.\nThe positive loan and deposit growth momentum we experienced in the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter as both average loans and deposits increased linked quarter. Adjusted PPNR remained stable linked quarter as we were able to offset a linked quarter decline in revenue with lower adjusted noninterest expenses, reflecting our commitment to maintaining that discipline. From a credit and capital perspective, our metrics remained strong. Consistent with the fourth quarter of 2024, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through our common dividend and repurchase of $500 million of our common stock during the first quarter of 2025.\nWe've already completed $500 million of share repurchases in the second quarter of 2025. And given our strong capital position and current trading levels, we plan to target up to an additional $250 million of stock this quarter. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the quarterly results, I want to spend some time discussing the progress we're making on our strategic priorities and the positive momentum we're seeing within our business segments and with our digital initiatives on Slide 6 and 7.\nIn Consumer and Small Business banking, I'm encouraged by another solid quarter of consumer loan growth net new checking account growth and progress with our premier banking clients as we deepen relationships and acquired key new clients and households through digital and traditional channels. Average consumer and small business loan balances increased 1.3% linked quarter due to growth in residential mortgage, indirect auto and service finance with production up 47% year-over-year and pipelines continue to increase.\nImportantly, we're not sacrificing our credit standards or pricing discipline to drive growth. Consumer credit metrics remain stable and new consumer loan production spreads are accretive to the overall portfolio. Debit card spend for our consumer clients increased 4% on a year-over-year basis with growth coming across all income bands, and driven by spending areas in areas like travel and entertainment. Net new checking account growth was once again positive in the first quarter as we added more than 39,000 new consumer and business accounts, which reflects a 40% increase over the first quarter of last year.\nImportantly, we are seeing growth within our Premier Banking segment, which was one of our key focus areas, as we've highlighted previously. During the fourth quarter, we generated nearly $1.8 billion of new deposit production in our premier managed segment, which represents a 23% year-over-year increase over the first quarter of 2024 driven by significant improvement in banker productivity and new hires. As an example, we increased the number of financial plans delivered per banker by 15%, which helped drive $1.6 billion of new investment production during the quarter as those are highly correlated.\nIn wholesale, I'm encouraged by this quarter's loan growth, improved production and progress in key focus areas like payments and wealth. During the quarter, we saw 1% growth in average wholesale loans driven by growth from new and existing clients and increased production. As I've mentioned previously, we have a specific focus on capturing more of the middle market. I'm very pleased with the momentum we're already experiencing in production and results. Changing market conditions have made our outlook for investment banking and trading more challenging than we originally estimated to start this year.\nWe did have our second best quarter ever in debt capital markets, but lower overall M&A and equity capital markets activity resulted in growth coming in less than expected as many clients postponed planned transactions. However, I am confident that our advice-driven business model is well suited to help our clients navigate current market conditions and continue to grow our share, given the investments we continue to make in talent, products and industry verticals.\nIn Wealth, we launched a new digital client interface that significantly improved the client experience, increased new client and adviser acquisition and help drive higher net asset flows despite volatile equity and fixed income markets. Our payments team continues to launch new services that meet our clients' needs for solutions that provide them with speed, simplicity and safety. During the first quarter, we enhanced our real-time payments capabilities, including launching Zelle disbursements which enables wholesale clients to more efficiently pay consumers. These enhancements, along with continued investments in talent have driven a meaningful increase in overall satisfaction scores as well as ongoing increases in our payments penetration rate with existing clients.\nEnhancing the client experience and growing our digital capabilities are important parts of our overall strategy, let me discuss that in a little more detail on Slide 7. Truist continues to demonstrate strong performance in digital with year-over-year growth across all core digital metrics. In the first quarter of 2025, we opened 195,000 new digital accounts which reflects a 13% increase over the first quarter of last year and includes 77,000 new to bank clients. Over 60% of our new digital clients are millennials and Gen Z aligning with our strategy to engage clients early and build enduring relationships over time.\nTruist Assist is our AI tool that supports client conversations and provides a seamless transition to a Truist teammate when an inquiry warrants further assistance. Truist Assist supported over 1 million conversations in the first quarter of 2025 with more than 80% requiring no further teammate interaction, which helps drive further efficiencies in our consumer business as client behavior shift to more self-service. We expect to continue to grow our digital presence with clients as we further leverage our modern and scalable technology platform.\nNow let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Mike?\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our performance highlights on Slide 8. We reported first quarter 2025 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.87 per share. Included in our results are $0.02 per share of restructuring charges primarily related to facilities optimization initiatives and severance. Total revenue decreased 3.2% linked quarter as both net interest income and noninterest income declined. .\nAdjusted expenses decreased 5.4% linked quarter, which helped hold PPNR stable and drive a 130 basis point improvement in our efficiency ratio on a linked-quarter basis. Next, I'll cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans held for investment increased by 1.1% on a linked quarter basis due to growth in both average commercial and average consumer loans. Average commercial loans increased $1.8 billion or 1% and primarily due to $2 billion of growth in C&I loans, partially offset by a decline in CRE loan balances.\nIn our consumer portfolio, average loans increased $1.6 billion or 1.3% linked quarter due to growth in residential mortgage and indirect auto. End-of-period loans increased $2.3 billion or 0.7%. Based on our current loan pipeline and a solid start to the year, we continue to believe that we can generate low single-digit end-of-period loan growth in 2025.\nMoving now to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits increased $2.2 billion sequentially or $0.6 million, driven by growth in time deposits and interest checking, which was partially offset by declines in noninterest-bearing and money market and savings balances. End-of-period deposits increased $13.2 billion or 3.4%, which was impacted by 2 larger, but short-term client deposits that drove period-end deposit balances higher on a linked quarter basis. Excluding the impact of these 2 deposits, average deposit balances would have been relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to actively manage rate paid, which resulted in a decrease in our deposit costs. Specifically, total deposit costs decreased by 10 basis points sequentially to 1.79%, which implies a 30% cumulative total deposit beta. Interest-bearing deposit costs decreased by 16 basis points sequentially to 2.46%. That represents a 43% cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta. Overall, we expect average deposit balances to remain relatively stable in the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 2025.\nNext, I'll move to net interest income. The net interest margin on Slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 2.4% linked quarter or $86 million, primarily due to the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter. Our net interest margin decreased 6 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.01%. For full year 2025, we expect net interest income to increase by approximately 3% versus 2024, driven primarily by low single-digit loan growth, three 25 basis point reductions in the Fed funds rate and the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing.\nAs you can see on the top right-hand side of this slide, we updated our outlook for fixed rate asset repricing. We expect to reprice approximately $42 billion of fixed rate loans and securities over the remainder of 2025. We now expect that the benefit from repricing these assets will be approximately 40 to 50 basis points lower than we previously expected in January due to lower medium-term interest rates. We also updated our swap portfolio disclosure in the bottom right-hand corner of the slide, which is relatively unchanged from the prior quarter.\nTurning to noninterest income now on Slide 12. Noninterest income decreased $78 million or 5.3% versus the fourth quarter. The linked quarter decrease was primarily attributable to a $69 million decline in other income related to certain equity investments and other gains that were higher in the fourth quarter of 2024. On a like quarter basis, noninterest income declined $54 million or 3.7% compared to the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower investment banking and trading income and lower wealth management income.\nLower M&A fees were the primary driver of the year-over-year decline in investment banking and trading income while wealth management income would have been slightly higher on a year-over-year basis were it not for the impact of the sale of Sterling Capital Management in July 2024.\nNext, I will cover noninterest expense on Slide 13. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of restructuring charges, decreased 5.4% linked quarter due to lower other expense, professional fees and outside processing and equipment expense. Personnel expense remained relatively stable linked quarter as the normal seasonality associated with the first quarter personnel expenses were offset by a reduction in incentives. Adjusted expenses increased 1.5% versus 1Q '24 due to higher professional fees and outside processing expense, partially offset by lower personnel expense.\nMoving to asset quality on Slide 14. Our asset quality metrics remained stable on both a like and linked quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. Net charge-offs increased 1 basis point to 60 basis points linked quarter, but were down 4 basis points versus the first quarter of 2024. Our loan loss provision exceeded net charge-offs, but growth in certain loan portfolios contributed to a 1 basis point decrease in our ALLL ratio to 1.58%.\nNonperforming loans held for investment as a percentage of total loans increased 1 basis point linked quarter and 3 basis points on a like-quarter basis to 48 basis points. NPLs have remained in a narrow band of 45 to 48 basis points over the last 5 quarters. We've been actively analyzing our exposure to consumer and wholesale clients that we believe will be most impacted by tariffs, potential reductions in government spending and more severe economic scenarios. Although this analysis is ongoing and dynamic, we have a strong understanding of our exposure, and we believe that we're adequately reserved at this time.\nAs a reminder, Truist had the second lowest C&I loan loss rate versus our peer group in the most recent CCAR stress tests. Turning to capital on Slide 15. On a linked-quarter basis, our CET1 ratio declined 20 basis points to 11.3% as the payment of our common dividend, our $500 million share buyback, growth in our balance sheet and the final CECL phase-in more than offset current period earnings. Our CET1 capital ratio, including the impact of AOCI, declined 10 basis points linked quarter to 9.6%, reflecting the aforementioned factors, partially offset by a $500 million decrease in AOCI due to the increase in longer-term interest rates experienced during the quarter.\nWe continue to believe that our strong capital position gives us unique ability to utilize our future earnings and the accretion of AOCI to fund balance sheet growth and to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Next, I'll provide additional color on our guidance for the second quarter of 2025 as well as for the full year on Slide 16. For full year 2025, we now expect revenue to increase 1.5% to 2.5% relative to 2024, adjusted revenue of $20.1 billion. This compares with growth of 3% to 3.5% previously.\nOur new guidance reflects our updated outlook for lower investment banking activity, increased volatility impacting our sales and trading results, lower wealth management income, which in part relies on market values and the shape of the yield curve. The majority of the reduction in our revenue outlook is due to our expectation for lower investment banking and trading activity, which we now expect to remain relatively flat on a year-over-year basis versus our previous expectation for low double-digit growth.\nIn addition, lower market valuations will slightly pressure our wealth management income. The remainder of the change to our outlook is related to our latest forecast for the shape of the yield curve, which delays our ability to lower deposit costs and reduces the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing. Our net interest income outlook continues to assume a low single-digit end-of-period loan growth and now assumes three 25 basis point reductions in the Fed funds rate, one in June, September and December compared with our previous view of reductions in just March and September.\nBased on these assumptions, we expect net interest income to increase 3% in 2025 versus 2024. In terms of our outlook for adjusted expenses, we now expect full year 2025 adjusted expenses to increase by approximately 1% in 2025 versus 2024. This compares with growth of 1.5% previously. Our improved expense outlook reflects a reduction in incentives due to lower expected revenue in 2025 and other ongoing cost savings initiatives.\nIn terms of asset quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 60 basis points in 2025, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis in 2025. Looking into the second quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to increase approximately 1.5% relative to first quarter revenue of $4.9 million. We expect net interest income to increase by approximately 1.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by an additional day in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, some loan growth and the benefit from fixed asset repricing.\nWe expect noninterest income to increase 1% to 3%, driven primarily by higher other income. Adjusted expenses of $2.9 billion in the first quarter are expected to increase 2% to 3% linked quarter due to higher personnel expenses related to annual merit increases. As it relates to buybacks, as Bill mentioned, we plan to target up to $750 million during the second quarter.\nI'll now hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So in conclusion, we're seeing solid progress in many of our key strategic focus areas, including premier banking, wealth, payments and middle market banking. Despite the market volatility, our growth mindset and strategic focus remains steadfast. We're paying close attention to the changes in our markets, the economy and client behavior as our credit risk teams are fully engaged in working with our clients to understand the impact of these changes.\nWe'll continue to adhere to the credit and risk discipline that has served our company and shareholders well over multiple economic cycles. The good news is that our advice-driven business model is well positioned to succeed in a wide variety of economic scenarios given our robust capital advantage, strong liquidity profile and demographically attractive markets where we have strong share.\nMore importantly, our balance sheet remains open and ready to help our clients navigate the current environment. We're actively looking for opportunities to serve new and existing clients and capitalize on current and future market disruption. Truist is retaining, expanding and adding new talent motivated by our platform, markets and the opportunity. I'm as optimistic as ever about Truist future, especially in light of the momentum I see every day inside this company.\nI'd like to thank all of our teammates for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity in moving our company forward. So again, thank you for your interest and your investment in Truist. Brad, let me turn it back over to you.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike Maguire; and Chief Risk Officer, Brad Bender, as well as other members of Truist senior management team.\nDuring this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions, and provide an updated outlook for 2025. The company presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. So before we get started, I want to take a moment to introduce Brad Bender. Brad recently became our Chief Risk Officer. He brings extensive experience across a number of Truist areas, including risk, operations, technology and consumer lending to this role. Brad is off to a great start. He'll continue to carry forward Truist's strong credit culture and risk discipline.\nClarke Starnes, I'm really happy is working closely with Brad on the transition. I'm incredibly grateful for Clarke's impactful 40-plus year career at Truist, most recently serving as our Chief Risk Officer. Also want to thank Bob Cummins for his significant contributions to our company following his announced departure this week. Since 2005, Boe has purposely served as an instrumental leader at Truist, most recently as Vice Chair and Chief Operating Officer.\nBoth he and Clarke played crucial informative roles in the merger of equals to create Truist and setting the course for our future. I just can't tell you how much I appreciate their leadership during this time at Truist. They were fantastic partners. And I just wish them all the best in their new chapters in their lives. All right. So let's -- before turning to fourth quarter results, let's again, as we always do at Truist with purpose.\nWe are a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities, which is the foundation and guide for how we conduct our business. So one example in the fourth quarter was our response to Hurricane Helene. The impact of the hurricane on Western North Carolina was truly unprecedented. Truist has deep roots in the region, and our team was quick to respond but they were also compelled to play a pivotal role in the area's long-term recovery. I'm with our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities, we announced a 3-year $725 million commitment to address critical needs including a focus on small business, housing and infrastructure projects.\nBy listening to the needs of the community and leveraging our expertise, our capital partnerships, we believe we can be a catalyst for recovery and growth. So now turning to our results on Slide 5. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 a share. For the year, we reported GAAP net income of $4.5 billion or $3.36 a share and adjusted net income of $5 billion or $3.69 per share. Mike is going to provide some more details on quarterly and annual results later in the call.\n2024 was an important year for Truist and I'm proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included executing on several important strategic initiatives, delivering solid underlying earnings, maintaining sound asset quality metrics and positioning us with strong momentum as we enter 2025. Our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, 2024 ended on a strong note with annual adjusted revenue finishing at the high end of our expectations and annual expenses declining 40 basis points. Our adjusted efficiency ratio of 56.3% remain relatively stable on an annual basis, reflecting an ongoing expense discipline and focus on managing cost.\nIn addition, on a linked-quarter basis, average deposit balances increased 1.5% and average loan balances were stable. End-of-period loans experienced a little over 1% growth as we saw an increase in loan demand due to results of our focused initiatives in the latter half of the quarter. These factors, along with our continued discipline around rate paid on deposits resulted in net interest income exceeding our expectations for the quarter. Investment banking and trading revenue increased 46% for the year versus the 2023 as we continue to add talent and expertise to an already strong platform that continues to gain market share.\nCredit metrics remained solid as nonperforming loans held for investment declined $38 million linked quarter, while net charge-offs increased 4 basis points in the fourth quarter, resulting in losses for the year coming in line with our expectations. Our CET1 capital ratio finished the year at 11.5%, which is up 140 basis points versus 2023 due to the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and 2024 earnings partially offset by the strategic balance sheet repositioning completed in May and $3.8 billion of capital we returned to shareholders through a common dividend and the repurchase of $1 billion per common stock.\nThe execution of these important strategic initiatives and resulting relative capital advantage leaves us well positioned to grow our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders through our common dividend and our share repurchase program. In 2025, we're focused on 5 key areas, all aimed at driving better growth, positive operating leverage and improved profitability. First, last year was a testament to the attractiveness of our platform. attracting, developing and retaining top talent will continue to be a priority.\nSecond, we see a material opportunity to deepen existing client relationships within our attractive footprint especially in areas like premier banking, wealth and payments, all of which represent significant opportunities to capture additional share within our existing client base. Third, we also see growth potential beyond the markets where we have strong share, especially in states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Texas, where we have smaller but faster growing market share. These are not new markets, but areas where we have invested significantly and have great momentum deploying our full Truist capabilities.\nWe're also optimistic about further expanding into certain verticals in the middle market where we can bring the expertise we provide to larger companies in our investment bank to midsized companies all across the country. Fourth, we'll continue to invest in our technology platform, which is improving the client experience, driving new account production and delivering efficiencies.\nFinally, we plan to accomplish all of this while maintaining our expense discipline, driving positive operating leverage and investing in important areas like our risk infrastructure and cybersecurity. Maintaining our momentum and executing against these strategic priorities will be the key to driving positive operating leverage this year and showing progress towards our mid-teens medium-term ROATCE target. Before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our quarterly results, I want to spend a little bit of time discussing the progress we're already making on our strategic priorities and the positive momentum we're seeing within our business segments and with our digital initiatives on Slide 6 and 7.\nIn Consumer and Small Business banking, I'm encouraged by our momentum as we experienced an increase in loan production in key focus areas within our lending portfolio and we continue to acquire key new clients and households, both through our digital and traditional channels. Average consumer loan balances increased 1.2% linked quarter due to the growth in residential mortgage, indirect auto and important platforms like Sheffield and Service Finance, as we experienced a 5% linked quarter increase in consumer loan production during the quarter.\nImportantly, we're not sacrificing our credit standards or pricing discipline to drive growth. Credit metrics remained relatively stable and new consumer loan production spreads are accretive to the overall portfolio. Net new checking account growth was once again positive for the year as we added 104,000 new consumer and business accounts. Not only are we adding new households, but primacy rates and client retention also continued to increase due to improvements to the client experience and ongoing enhancements to our digital offerings during the year.\nIn wholesale, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of improved production, increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent that we're attracting to our company. During the quarter, we saw a 3% growth in average wholesale deposits, including growth in noninterest-bearing demand. Although average wholesale loans declined to linked quarter, end-of-period balances increased 50 basis points. We saw increased production and higher commitments in certain key focus areas as clients are in a more offensive posture.\nAs I previously noted, 2004 represented the strongest capital market share we've reported since 2021. We experienced record performance in investment-grade issuance, equity capital markets, asset securitization and project finance, while also gaining share in verticals like financial institutions, consumer retail and health care. Our leaders made key new hires through 2024 in commercial banking, corporate banking, investment banking, wealth, payments and a leader of our new middle market initiative. These new experienced teammates are attracted to our purposeful and results-oriented culture and complement our great teams.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have a specific focus on building out our middle market commercial segment. I'm very pleased with our focus and momentum we're already experiencing in production and results. We also continue to enhance our wholesale digital capabilities by improving the client experience. During the quarter, we launched electronic bill presentment, which is a next-generation product that gives clients greater control over their billing and payments operations. Enhancing the client experience and growing our digital capabilities are important parts of our strategy, which I'll discuss in more detail on Slide 7.\nThroughout the year, we've invested in our digital platforms to attract new clients to Truist with a focus on shifting existing client behaviors to self-service, which drives operational efficiency. As a result of these efforts, we showed strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as we experienced year-over-year growth in all core metrics while also achieving favorable client experience satisfaction scores. We opened over 730,000 new digital loan and deposits accounts during the year including nearly 275,000 new-to-bank clients through our digital channels, which represents a [indiscernible] increase over the previous year.\nWe surpassed over 7.1 million active digital users on our platform. Plant Mobile app users grew 7% and digital transactions increased 13% year-over-year. In addition to an increase in account openings and higher digital adoption rates, we're also seeing an improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up significantly over 2023, including growth in balances for millennial and Gen Z clients. Investing in the digital client experience continues to be a priority for our company in 2025 and beyond. We expect to continue growing our digital presence with clients as we further leverage our modern and scalable technology platform.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mike?\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. So I'm going to start with our performance highlights. We reported fourth quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share. Total revenue decreased 0.5% linked quarter as both net interest income and fees decreased modestly. Adjusted expenses increased 4% linked quarter and as we discussed last quarter, this increase was driven by higher professional fees and outside processing expenses related to a number of projects that were initiated later in the year. .\nAs Bill mentioned earlier, noninterest expenses declined 0.4% in 2024 versus 2023. Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio declined 10 basis points linked quarter to 11.5% as our larger balance sheet, the payment of our common dividend and share repurchases completed during the quarter offset our current period earnings. From a credit perspective, net charge-offs increased 4 basis points on a linked-quarter basis, and our nonperforming loans declined 1 basis point on a linked-quarter basis.\nSo moving to Slide 9. I'll cover loans and leases. Average loans remained relatively stable on a linked quarter basis as the decline in average commercial loans was offset by growth in average consumer loans. Average commercial loans decreased $1.5 billion or 0.8%, primarily due to a decline in CRE and C&I balances driven by lower production in CRE. Commercial line utilization remained relatively stable on a linked quarter basis.\nIn our consumer portfolio, average loans increased $1.4 billion or 1.2% linked quarter due to growth in indirect auto, residential mortgage and other consumer. On an end-of-period basis, loans held for investment increased by $3.3 billion or 1.1%, primarily due to higher residential mortgages, C&I and indirect auto. As Bill mentioned, we're encouraged by the increase in end-of-period loan balances and improved loan production in certain key focus areas during the quarter. This should lead to positive growth in end-of-period loan balances in 2025.\nMoving to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits increased 1.5% sequentially or $5.7 billion, driven by growth in all deposit categories except for time deposits, which were down linked quarter. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased 1.8% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we continued to actively manage rate paid, which resulted in a decrease to our deposit costs. Specifically, total deposit costs decreased 19 basis points sequentially to 1.89%, which implies a 29% cumulative total deposit beta.\nInterest-bearing deposit costs decreased by 26 basis points sequentially to 2.62%, representing a 40% cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta. Overall, we expect average deposit balances to decrease by about 1% in the first quarter, due in part to the outflow of seasonally higher municipal deposits. Moving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 0.4% linked quarter or $16 million, primarily due to the lag in deposit repricing versus earning asset repricing and which was partially offset by higher earning assets and some benefit from fixed rate asset repricing.\nOur net interest margin decreased by 5 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.07% due primarily to the previously mentioned beta lag and a larger investment securities portfolio. Based on our current outlook, we believe that the net interest income will decline by 2% linked quarter due primarily to the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, and then we would expect it to trend higher in the second quarter of 2025 and throughout the course of the year.\nAs you can see in the charts on the right, we expect net interest income to grow in 2025 driven primarily by low single-digit end-of-period loan growth and the continued benefit from fixed asset repricing of our securities portfolio as well as our fixed rate loan portfolios. During the fourth quarter, our average investment securities portfolio totaled $125 billion and carried a weighted average yield of 2.88%, that excludes the impact of pay fix swaps. We expect to receive approximately $13 billion of cash flows from the investment portfolio throughout the course of 2025 that we anticipate reinvesting at higher yields.\nThese securities roll off at a weighted average yield of 3.08%, excluding the impact of pay fix swaps and based on the current forward curve. In addition, our fixed average -- our average fixed rate loan portfolio totaled $135 billion and carried a weighted average yield of 5.38% during the fourth quarter. We anticipate having the opportunity to reprice approximately $42 billion of loans at higher yields during 2025 based on current maturity schedules. These maturities -- maturing loans have a weighted average yield of approximately 6.36%.\nBefore moving on, I also wanted to note that this quarter, we added additional disclosure on our swap portfolio, and that's on the bottom right-hand corner of the slide. At December 31, we had approximately $84 billion of notional received fixed swaps with a weighted average yield of 3.45%. These swaps are designated against our commercial loan portfolio and long-term debt and designed to protect net interest income from lower short-end rates. Approximately $45 billion of these swaps were effective at the end of the quarter. The remaining $39 billion of received fixed swaps are forward starting and will become effective over time.\nBased on our current portfolio at December 31, the effective received fixed swap position peaks around $63 billion during the fourth quarter of 2025. At December 31, we also had approximately $30 billion of notional pay-fixed swaps with a weighted average pay fixed rate at 3.39%. These swaps are designed to protect the economic value of the balance sheet as well as to manage future capital volatility through AOCI as these swaps are designated against our AFS securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, the entire $30 billion pay fixed swap portfolio was effective with approximately half the portfolio carrying a maturity of less than 3 years. Okay. Turning to noninterest income on Slide 12. Noninterest income decreased $12 million or 0.9% versus the third quarter. The linked quarter decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and trading income, which declined $70 million linked quarter due to lower debt and equity capital markets activity and M&A fees. The decline in investment banking and trading was partially offset by growth in other income, service charge on deposits and mortgage banking income.\nAlthough fourth quarter investment banking trading income declined on a linked quarter basis, 2024 investment banking and trading revenues increased 46% versus 2023 and represented the highest level since 2021 due to higher transaction activity levels and continued market share gains, which helped drive a 6.2% increase in adjusted noninterest income for the full year 2024.\nWe remain optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share and grow not only in investment banking and trading, but also in wealth and payments, where we believe there is significant opportunity to grow within our existing client base. Next, I'll cover noninterest expense on Slide 13. Adjusted noninterest expense, which excludes the impact of restructuring charges and core deposit intangible amortization expense increased 4% linked quarter due to higher professional fees and equipment expense, partially offset by lower personnel expense in the quarter. On an annual basis, adjusted noninterest expense declined by 0.4%, and our adjusted efficiency ratio remained relatively stable.\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2025, we will begin including core deposit intangible amortization expense with adjusted expense to make our reporting align and be more comparable with peers. Moving to asset quality on Slide 14. Asset quality remained relatively stable on both a like and linked quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio increased 4 basis points to 59 basis points due primarily to seasonally higher consumer losses. Net charge-offs of 59 basis points for the year were in line with our expectation of 60 basis points.\nOur loan loss provision exceeded net charge-offs but growth in certain loan portfolios contributed to a 1 basis point decrease in our ALLL ratio to 1.59%. Nonperforming loans held for investment as a percentage of total loans decreased 1 basis point linked quarter, but increased 3 basis points on a like-quarter basis to 47 basis points. NPLs have remained in a fairly narrow band of 44 to 48 basis points over the course of the past 5 quarters. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is down $235 million linked quarter and represented 1.5% of total loans. Our office reserve increased from 10.4% to 11.1%.\nApproximately 5.3% of our office portfolio is currently classified as nonperforming compared with 5.1% at September 30. Notably, approximately 18% of our office portfolio is housed within our Commercial Community Banking and wealth segments where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent and overall losses lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well reserved, but our position is to remain very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio.\nSo turning now to capital on Slide 15. On a linked quarter basis, our CET1 ratio declined 10 basis points to 11.5% due to the payout of 98% of our earnings via our common dividend and $500 million of share repurchases as well as balance sheet growth. Our CET1 capital ratio, including the impact of AOCI, decreased from 9.9% to 9.6%, reflecting the aforementioned factors and an increase in AOCI due to the increase in longer-term interest rates experienced during the quarter.\nDuring 2024, our CET1 ratio increased by 140 basis points, which was driven by the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and retained earnings, partially offset by our strategic balance sheet repositioning, our common dividend and $1 billion of share repurchases. We continue to believe that our strong capital position gives us the unique ability to utilize our future earnings and AOCI accretion to fund balance sheet growth and to return significant amount of capital to our shareholders.\nNow I will move to Slide 16 and review our guidance for 2025. Looking into the first quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to decrease 2% relative to fourth quarter revenue of $5.1 billion. We expect net interest income to decrease 2% in the first quarter primarily driven by 2 fewer days in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and seasonally lower average deposit balances. This will be partially offset by slightly higher average loan balances. Excluding the impact of day count, we would expect net interest income to remain relatively stable linked quarter.\nWe expect noninterest income to decrease 2.5% driven primarily by higher investment banking and trading revenue partially offset by lower other income and service charges on deposits. Adjusted expenses of $3 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes CDI amortization expense are expected to decline by 3% linked quarter as seasonally higher personnel expenses will be offset with lower other expenses and professional fees. As it relates to the buyback, similar to the fourth quarter, we're targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2025.\nFor full year 2025, we expect revenue to increase by 3% to 3.5% relative to 2024 adjusted revenue of $20.1 billion, driven by growth in net interest income and noninterest income. Our net interest income outlook assumes a low single-digit end-of-period loan growth and 2 reductions in the Fed funds rate, including a cut in March and another in September. We expect noninterest income to increase at a low single-digit rate. This expected growth rate reflects the fact that certain fee revenues that were recognized in '24 will not reoccur in 2025. These fees are related to the shared services agreement that was in place following the sale of TIH back in May and 6 months of revenue associated with Sterling Capital Management, which was also sold around midyear last year.\nWe expect full year 2025 adjusted expenses, which include CDI amortization expense to increase approximately 1.5% in 2025 versus 2024. Our '25 revenue and expense outlook implies positive operating leverage of 150 to 200 basis points. In terms of asset quality, we expect net charge-offs of about 60 basis points in '25, which is stable compared with net charge-offs of 59 basis points in 2024.\nFinally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis in 2025. I'll now hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. So to conclude, I'm really pleased with the progress we made as a company last year, and I'm confident that we have strong momentum with clients and with teammates in this year as our value proposition has just never been stronger. First, we have an incredible franchise with leading share in high-growth markets. We've got motivated and energized teammates and a fulsome set of specialized wholesale and consumer capabilities that our loyal clients value. .\nSecond, our relative capital position remains a differentiating factor that gives us the ability to grow our core business by serving existing and new clients, invest in our infrastructure and returned considerable amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years, all of which we plan to continue doing in 2025. Third, as we execute our strategic growth and capital management priorities, we see a significant opportunity to improve our profitability over the medium term, and we would expect to show progress in 2025.\nOur path to profitability improvement is multifaceted and a function of client and business growth while maintaining our cost discipline. As I discussed earlier, much of the profitability improvement potential we plan is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships in verticals and product lines like wealth, payments, premier and investment banking that already exist at Truist. We see opportunities to grow in markets where we have less dominant share like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and particularly Texas, while also further penetrating the middle market lending segment.\nThe good news is we see multiple paths and initiatives that with proper execution will result in improved performance, which we expect to show you in 2025. Fourth, we plan to accomplish all of this while maintaining our expense discipline, generating positive operating leverage in 2025 and beyond, while also continue to invest in talent, technology and our infrastructure.\nFinally, we never take for granted our strong track record on asset quality, as we'll continue to focus on maintaining strong risk discipline and controls. I'm as optimistic as ever about Truist future, especially in light of the momentum I see every day inside of this company. I'd like to thank all of our teammates and leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity in moving our company forward. I'm so proud to be their teammate. So again, thank you for your interest and investment in Truist. And Brad, we'll turn it into Q&A.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we may accommodate as many of you as today as possible."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Betsy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike McGuire; our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Clarke Starnes, as well as other members of Truist senior management team. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2024.\nThe accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I will now turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our second quarter results, let's begin with purpose on Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company, dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Purpose is the foundation for things that we do, and we believe purpose and performance are inextricably linked. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought our purpose to life last quarter. During the quarter, Truist Securities advised and served as an active joint bookrunner for Oglethorpe Power's inaugural $350 million green bond, which will be used to support their investment in Plant Vogtle, the largest producer of clean energy in the United States. .\nThe company is committed to reducing GHG emissions while delivering cost-effective and reliable clean energy with a diverse energy portfolio. This transaction represents only the second green-labeled bond in the U.S. where the use of proceeds are allocated to nuclear energy. We also launched a new financial education program tailored specifically for high school and college students called Truist Life, money and choices. This initiative is aimed at empowering younger generations with financial lessons and essential skills to navigate their financial futures. This is just a couple of examples of how we brought our purpose to life during the quarter. I'm very proud of the meaningful work we're doing across our businesses to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities, and of course, our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose.\nSo let's turn to our key takeaways on Slide 6. On an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share, which excludes the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings, the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities, a charitable donation to the Truist Foundation and a few smaller items that Mike will discuss in further detail in the call.\nIn addition, pretax restructuring charges of $96 million, which were primarily related to the sale of TIH and severance and also negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.05 per share. So looking through a few discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we grew adjusted revenue 3% on a linked quarter basis, which was driven by a 4.5% growth in net interest income due primarily to the balance sheet reposition we completed during the quarter. Second, our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing costs. As a result of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by 2.6% linked quarter and decreased by 3% on a year-over-year basis. We are fully committed to delivering our objective of keeping expenses flat in 2024 versus last year.\nWe're also pleased that nonperforming loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter and then net charge-offs were within our expectations. During the quarter, we also completed the sale of our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings which significantly strengthened our relative capital position and create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In recognition of the incredibly long-term positive impact of our insurance business, we utilized a portion of the gain to make $150 million charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation to further our purpose-driven work across our banking footprint for years to come.\nSimultaneously, with the closing of TIH, we repositioned a portion of our available-for-sale investment portfolio, which, along with the proceeds received from the sale of TIH is expected to provide an offset to TIH earnings contribution. Mike will provide more details on these transactions later in the call. In late June, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock through the end of 2026. We plan to begin repurchasing our shares during the third quarter, and we'll initially target share repurchases of approximately $500 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.\nFinally, we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer and wholesale banking businesses. Although overall loan demand remained slow during the quarter, I'm encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent we're attracting to our company, which I'm going to discuss a little later in the call. So before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss the financial performance in more detail, let me provide a quick update on the progress we're making in improving experiences for our clients on Slide 7. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew 7%, and the digital transactions increased 13% compared to the second quarter of last year.\nTransactions continue to shift towards self-service capabilities, primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions, which are up 39% year-over-year. In addition, we added over 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new-to-bank clients through our digital channels which represents a 17% increase over the second quarter of 2023. Importantly, digital checking account production among Gen Z and millennial clients is higher by 42% on a year-over-year basis. A new more modernized small business digital onboarding experience has also resulted in new high and application completion rates, where we're also seeing increased digital engagement with our small business clients.\nWe've also made enhancements to enterprise platforms that have empowered teammates to deliver knowledge and care through 1.8 million caring conversations resulting in 1.4 million accepted recommendations for great Truist products and services. These enhanced offerings, coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher consumer digital client satisfaction scores as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our T3 strategy. Overall, I'm really proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital engagement. So with that, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in more detail. Mike?\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin discussing our second quarter results, I'd like to spend a few moments recapping the strategic actions that significantly impacted our second quarter results. First, on May 6, we completed the divestiture of our remaining ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings at an implied value of $15.5 billion. At closing, we received after cash or after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $10.1 billion and recorded an after-tax gain of $4.8 billion. The sale of TIH created $9.5 billion of capital, which generated 230 basis points of CET1 under current capital rules and 254 basis points of capital under proposed fully phased in Basel III rules. Our tangible book value per share also increased by 33%. On the same day, we executed a strategic balance sheet repositioning of a portion of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.\nWe sold approximately $27.7 billion of market value, lower yielding investment securities, which resulted in an after-tax loss of $5.1 billion. The investment securities that we sold had a book value of $34.4 billion and a weighted average book yield of 2.80% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges and based on the federal funds curve at that time. Including the tax benefit, the sale of investment securities generated $29.3 billion of proceeds available for reinvestment. When coupled with the proceeds from the sale of TIH, there were $39.4 billion of proceeds available for reinvestment. Of that, we invested approximately $18.7 billion in investment securities yielding 5.27% with the remaining $20.7 billion held in cash. At the time we invested the proceeds the blended reinvestment rate on the new investment securities purchased and the cash was 5.22% for the remainder of 2024, including the impact of hedges.\nAs Bill mentioned, the reinvestment of the proceeds from the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter are expected to replace TIH's earnings contributions. These actions completed during the second quarter significantly accelerate our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry and importantly, create capacity for Truist to grow its core banking franchise and to return capital to shareholders via our strong dividend and share repurchases.\nNow turning to our second quarter key performance highlights on Slide 9. We reported second quarter 2024 GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $826 million or $0.62 per share. This included a net loss of $4 billion from continuing operations or $2.98 per share and net income from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share. The net loss available to common shareholders from continuing operations of $4 billion or $2.98 per share was impacted by the following items: a $6.7 billion pretax or $3.80 per share after-tax loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities, $150 million pretax or $0.09 per share charitable contribution to the Truist Foundation, a $13 million pretax or $0.01 per share after-tax expense related to FDIC special assessment adjustment.\nNet income available to common shareholders from discontinued operations of $4.8 billion or $3.60 per share was impacted by the following items. A $6.9 billion pretax or $3.60 per share after-tax gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings, a $10 million pretax or $0.01 per share after tax expense due to the accelerated recognition of TIH equity-based compensation, so on an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.91 per share. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pretax restructuring charges totaling $96 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.05 per share. Approximately $33 million of these pretax charges or $0.02 per share after tax negatively impacted net income from continuing operations and were primarily related to severance and real estate rationalization. The remaining restructuring charges were recorded in discontinued operations and were related to legal and other expenses associated with closing the divestiture of TIH.\nTotal revenue, adjusted for the losses on the available for sale investment securities increased 3% linked quarter due to a 4.5% increase in net interest income and relatively stable noninterest income. Adjusted expenses increased 2.6% linked quarter, but were down approximately 3% on a like-quarter basis. Our CET1 ratio increased by 150 basis points linked quarter to 11.6%, primarily reflecting the sale of TIH and the balance sheet repositioning I discussed earlier. In addition, net charge-offs declined 6 basis points on a linked-quarter basis, and our nonperforming loans remained relatively stable, both on a like and linked quarter basis.\nMoving to Slide 10. Average loans decreased 0.7% on a sequential basis, reflecting overall weaker client demand. Average commercial loans decreased $1.3 billion or 0.7% primarily due to a 0.8% decline in C&I balances driven at least in part by capital markets activity. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased $1 billion or 0.9% due to runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio and the decline in indirect auto. Other consumer balances, which include our specialty lending units, experienced modest growth and benefited from seasonal strength at Sheffield and increased demand at Service Finance.\nOverall, we expect client loan demand to remain relatively muted in the third quarter. Moving to deposit trends on Slide 11. Average deposits decreased 0.3% sequentially as growth in money market and savings was offset by declines in noninterest-bearing time and broker balances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 1.2% and represented 28% of total deposits, which is unchanged compared to 28% during the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we experienced an increase in deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 6 basis points sequentially, 2.09%, which resulted in a 1% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 39%. Interest-bearing deposit cost increased 7 basis points sequentially to 2.89%, which also resulted in a 1% increase to our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta cost up 54%.\nMoving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income increased 4.5% linked quarter or $155 million, primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter. Excluding the impact of this repositioning, our net interest income would have been relatively stable on a linked quarter basis due primarily to our focus on average client deposits, which declined less than we expected. Reported net interest margin increased 14 basis points on a linked-quarter basis to 3.03%. This was due primarily to the impact of the balance sheet repositioning. The partial quarter impacted the balance sheet repositioning helped drive a 31 basis point improvement in the average yield on our investment securities portfolio to 2.77%. We estimate that our balance sheet remains positioned as relatively neutral from an interest rate perspective comparable to Q1.\nTurning to noninterest income on Slide 13. Adjusted noninterest income, which excludes the losses associated with the balance sheet repositioning, decreased $8 million or 0.6% relative to the first quarter. The linked quarter decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and trading income, which declined $37 million from our strong first quarter performance due to lower M&A fees, equity originations and trading income, partially offset by higher loan syndication fees. This decline was partially offset by higher mortgage banking and other income. Adjusted noninterest income increased 4.2% on a like-quarter basis as higher investment banking and trading and wealth management income were partially offset by lower service charge on deposit and other income.\nOn a year-to-date basis, investment banking and trading income is up nearly 30% over the same period in 2023. Now I'll cover noninterest expense on Slide 14. GAAP expenses of $3.1 billion increased $141 million linked quarter, primarily due to higher other expense related to $150 million charitable donation. Higher personnel costs, reflecting merit increases and higher professional fees. These increases were offset by lower restructuring charges and a reduction in FDIC expense due to a larger special assessment recorded in the first quarter. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted noninterest expense increased 2.6% sequentially due to higher personnel expense and professional fees.\nOn a like quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined to $86 million or 3%, reflecting lower head count in our continued expense discipline. Moving to asset quality on Slide 15. Asset quality remained stable on both a like and linked quarter basis, reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans. During the quarter, our net charge-off ratio decreased 6 basis points to 58 basis points. The decrease in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects lower consumer losses due to normal second quarter seasonal declines and certain derisking initiatives put in place in the second half of 2022. Our loan loss provision declined $49 million linked quarter reflecting our stable credit performance, but it still exceeded net charge-offs for the quarter, resulting in a slight build to our overall loan loss allowance.\nOur ALLL ratio increased to 1.57%, up 1 basis point sequentially and 14 basis points year-over-year, which reflects ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector. Despite the normalization, nonperforming loans remained relatively stable for the fifth consecutive quarter, while total delinquencies increased just 2 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Wholesale criticized loans declined $1 billion linked quarter to $10.8 billion. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.6% of total loans. However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 9.3% to 9.7% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in the sector. Approximately 6.3% of our office portfolio is currently classified as nonperforming compared with 5.5% at March 31.\nApproximately 90% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan. Notably, approximately 22% of our office portfolio is housed within our Community Banking and wealth segments where loan sizes tend to be more granular, guarantor support more prevalent and overall loss is lower. We expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well reserved, but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio.\nTurning now to capital on Slide 16. Truist CET1 ratio increased from 10.1% at March 31 to 11.6% at June 30. The increase was driven by the gain on the sale of Truist Insurance Holdings and organic capital generation which was partially offset by the loss on the sale of certain available-for-sale investment securities during the quarter, which I addressed earlier. Importantly, the sale of TIH creates capacity for Truist to pursue growth opportunities in our consumer and wholesale banking businesses and to return significant capital to shareholders as evidenced by our share buyback program. Truist is well positioned to weather a wide variety of economic scenarios, which was evident in our most recent CCAR stress test results released in late June.\nSpecifically, Truist had the second lowest C&I loan loss rate and the third lowest CET1 erosion rate versus our peers. Our stress capital buffer will improve by 10 basis points to 2.8% effective October 1. At June 30, our CET1 ratio was 430 basis points higher than our new regulatory minimum of 7.3%, leaving us well positioned to both grow our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. Our increased level of capital accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry as our estimated CET1 capital ratio under proposed Basel III end game rules improved 20 basis points to 9.1% at June 30, which is 180 basis points above our new regulatory minimum. And now I will review updated guidance or updated guidance on Slide 17.\nLooking into the third quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to increase 1% to 2% from second quarter 2024 adjusted revenue of $5 billion. We expect net interest income to increase 2% to 3% in the third quarter, primarily driven by a full quarter impact of the balance sheet repositioning completed on May 6. We expect noninterest income to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis. Adjusted expenses of $2.8 billion in the second quarter are expected to increase by 3% in the third quarter due to higher professional fees, software costs and higher marketing costs. For the full year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 0.5% to 1.5%. We now expect total revenues to decline by approximately 0.5% to 1% in 2024. Our updated outlook is based on slightly better client deposit balance performance, partially offset by lower client loan demand and our updated view of interest rates, which now assumes just one reduction in the federal funds rate in November of this year.\nConsistent with our previous expense outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over '23 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of asset quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024. As Bill previously mentioned, we are targeting approximately $500 million of share repurchases per quarter for the remainder of the year as part of our share repurchase authorization announced in late June. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged. They include growing and deepening relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, returning capital to our shareholders via share buybacks and our common strong dividend. And enhancing our digital experience through T3, all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We made demonstrable progress on these priorities during the quarter, and I'm really proud of the results our teammates delivered, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum and sound asset quality. All this was accomplished while also completing the divestiture of Truist Insurance Holdings and repositioning our balance sheet during the quarter. .\nThese actions created significant capital capacity to grow our consumer and wholesale businesses and return capital to shareholders via our strong common dividend, and our recently announced repurchase authorization of up to $5 billion of our common stock. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet is well positioned to weather an even wider range of economic and interest rate environments. Although the balance sheet repositioning completed during the quarter is expected to replace TIH's earnings in the near term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. As I've said previously, our starting point for our ROATCE is exactly that. It's a starting point.\nWe're going to move with pace to deploy our capital, improve our returns. We're not going to be in a rush to leverage capital to meet short-term expectations that do not have long-term positive impact on our company, clients and shareholders. We have a clear understanding of not only where we want to win, but where we want to win profitably. We'll look to share more of our plan with you as we progress through the remainder of this year. I can say that I'm encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential we are working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships and verticals and product lines that already exist at Truist. We have great confidence in our ability to further penetrate our existing client base, grow our core banking business and help new and existing clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer payments, investment banking and wealth platform given the ongoing investments through our existing footprint and specialty areas.\nIn wholesale, we've invested in our investment banking and trading platform over the last several years. We've also hired experienced bankers in key industry verticals and products. These investments have resulted in greater mind share with our clients across many industry verticals and an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines. Most recently, we've invested heavily in our payments business and have made key leadership additions as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time, not only with new clients, but also within our existing client base. We have a clear focus, high expectations and a compelling teammate value proposition. Many of our teammates have risen to this new challenge. And we have very successfully hired additional strong talent in wholesale, primarily from larger institutions who have experience and are thriving in our purpose-driven high-performance culture.\nWe plan to continue adding talent in wholesale with a specific focus on further building out our middle market commercial lending segment, which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional business. We will primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise. We're making these investments while also adhering to our expense discipline, which is helping fund investments in technology to improve the client experience and also to improve risk management. In consumer, I'm really encouraged with our momentum. Our internal client satisfaction scores continue to improve as evidenced by increased net new checking account production, increased primacy and lower attrition rates. Net new checking account production was once again positive in the second quarter as we added 38,000 new consumer and business accounts.\nImportantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates and increase primacy and usage within new account openings. As I previously mentioned, we added 180,000 new accounts during the quarter, including nearly 70,000 new-to-bank clients through our digital channels, which represented a 17% increase. In addition to an increase in account openings, we're also seeing improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up 60% over the second quarter of last year. In Consumer and small business lending, we've been consistently adding new small business lenders across our footprint. In the second quarter, small business applications increased 15% linked quarter, resulting in a 10% increase in our pipeline giving us confidence that average consumer balance is excluding runoff in residential mortgages, will stabilize in the third quarter.\nIn conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we've made as a company at the midpoint of this year, but we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future. We have tremendous momentum within our company. We have momentum with our clients, and we've got great momentum with our teammates. We have an incredible franchise, energized, purposeful teammates and specialized capabilities that our clients value. We think the ability to grow our core banking business, our profitability and return significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years is a unique differentiating factor for Truist. I am optimistic about our future. I look forward to operating our company from our increased position of financial strength.\nAnd finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank all of our incredible teammates and our great leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity and moving our company forward. So Brad, with that, let me hand it over back over to you for Q&A.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Bill. Betsy, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's event is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; our CFO, Mike McGuire; and our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Clarke Starnes; as well as other members of Truist senior management team.\nDuring this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's first quarter results, share their perspective on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2024. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. So before we discuss our first quarter results, let's begin as always with purpose, and we see that on Slide 4. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. And I'd like to share some of the ways we brought purpose to life last quarter.\nOur focus on small business, Heroes is a great example of purpose driving performance. This strategy helps community heroes achieve their financial dreams and elevates their ability to support our neighbors and build strong communities. We're seeing great success with small business, evidenced by the addition of nearly 8,600 small business accounts during the quarter and $700 million worth of deposits.\nOur Truist Community Capital team committed more than $252 million to support over 1,600 units of affordable housing, over 3,000 new jobs and projects that will help empower almost 400,000 people in underserved communities over the next 3 years. Additionally, we announced the initial recipients of grants from the Truist community analyst initiative, which is a 3-year Community Reinvestment Act program aimed at 4 key focus areas: affordable housing, small business access to capital, workforce development and essential community services.\nThere's 17 community organizations receiving grants that will be used to support efforts in 54 communities across 13 states and allow local nonprofit organizations to better respond to critical community needs within their states. Lastly, we published our 2023 corporate responsibility and sustainability report this month, which I encourage you to read and learn more about our progress in building better lives and communities. In all of these examples, our core belief is evident. We're leaders in banking and we're unwavering in care.\nAll right. So let's turn to some of our key takeaways on Slide 6. First, I need to state and remind everyone that our first quarter and for the previous periods have been restated to reflect the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This change has no impact on our net income available to common shareholders. The restatement does remove TIH's revenue and expense from our financial statements as net income from TIH is now being reported as net income from discontinued operation. Mike is going to provide a lot more details around that later in the call.\nOn an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 a share, which excludes a $0.04 per share impact from the industry-wide FDIC special assessment and a $0.05 per share impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale.\nPretax restructuring charges of $70 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.04 per share. So despite a few discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we saw a significant increase in investment banking and in trading revenue driven by strong performance across much of our capital markets platform with particular strength in M&A and equity capital markets.\nLoan demand continues to remain relatively muted, but we did see some improvement in our commercial lending pipelines during the quarter. On the consumer side, we recalibrated several of the capital conserving strategies we deployed last year prior to announcing the sale of TIH. This resulted in an increase in loan applications. And in March, we saw the first increase in balances since October of 2022.\nSecond, our results show our expense discipline and continued focus on managing costs. As a result of these efforts, adjusted expenses increased by less than 1% linked quarter and decreased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. Although the linked quarter rate of expense growth will increase in the second quarter relative to the first, we are fully committed to delivering our expense objectives in 2024, which excluding TIH, should now result in adjusted expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024 versus 2023.\nThird, asset quality continues to normalize off historically low levels but we're pleased that nonperforming loans remained relatively stable and the net charge-offs were within our expectations. During the quarter, we also announced that we will sell our remaining stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which is on track to close in the second quarter. Sale of TIH will significantly strengthen our relative capital position, which will create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses. In addition, as we discussed in February, our stronger capital position affords us an opportunity to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities post closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning designed to at least replace TIH earnings.\nSale of TIH also positions us to resume share repurchases. The timing and size of repurchase activity will depend on our ongoing capital planning, market conditions, clarity around final capital rules and other factors. But our goal is to resume a program that's both meaningful and durable.\nBefore I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, I want to provide a quick update on the progress we're making and improving experiences for our clients, which we see on Slide 7. We continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, mobile app users grew 8% and digital transactions increased 13% compared to the first quarter of last year. So activating teammates -- through activating teammates to educate clients on our capabilities, transactions continue to shift towards self-service capabilities with 77% of deposits occurring through these channels primarily driven by strong growth in Zelle transactions.\nRecently, we rolled out Zelle QR code widget, where users can quickly access their QR codes from their home screens to seamlessly assist with bank transfers. At Truist, we aim to make banking simple and easy for our clients through thoughtful enhancements to their experience. Enhanced offerings, coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher retail digital client satisfaction scores.\nThese scores surpassed premerger highs as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our T3 strategy. Overall, I'm proud of the continued momentum Truist is making in digital and optimistic about the opportunity to expand our digital user base and drive self-service transaction volume. So Mike -- with that, Mike, let me turn it over to you to discuss our financial results in a little more detail.\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill mentioned, our financial statements for the first quarter and for previous periods have been restated due to the pending sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. This restatement has no impact on our net income or earnings per share for historical or current reporting periods. However, as you can see in our financial tables, revenue and expense associated with TIH is no longer shown on our financial statements.\nTIH's contribution to Truist net income and earnings per share is now captured in net income from discontinued operations. My comments today will focus on revenue and expense from continuing operations, although I will also provide some detail on revenue and expense for the quarter inclusive of TIH for comparative purposes.\nWe reported net income available from continuing operations of $1 billion or $0.76 per share, which includes a $75 million pretax or $0.04 per share after-tax expense related to the industry-wide FDIC special assessment. We reported net income available from discontinued operations, which represents earnings from TIH of $64 million or $0.05 per share, which includes an $89 million pretax or $0.05 per share negative impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at TIH due to the pending sale.\nSo on an adjusted basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 billion or $0.90 per share, which includes adjusted net income from continuing operations of $0.80 and adjusted net income from discontinued operations of $0.10. In addition to the items I just noted, we also had pretax restructuring charges totaling $70 million in the quarter, which negatively impacted adjusted EPS to common shareholders by $0.04 per share.\nThe bulk of these charges were related to severance and real estate rationalization. Total revenue, which excludes revenue associated with TIH, decreased by 1.4% linked quarter due to a decline in net interest income, partially offset by stronger noninterest income, led by investment banking and trading. Revenue before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 0.2% on a linked-quarter basis.\nAdjusted expenses, which excludes adjusted expense associated with TIH increased by 0.7%. Adjusted expenses before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked quarter basis.\nNext, I'll cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans decreased 1.3% sequentially, reflecting overall weaker client demand and our decision to deemphasize certain lending activities during 2023, which impacted growth during the first quarter. Average commercial loans decreased 0.9%, primarily due to a 1.2% decrease in C&I balances due mostly to lower client demand.\nIn our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 2%, primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage. During the quarter, we did increase our appetite for high-quality indirect auto loans, which, as Bill mentioned, resulted in consumer loan balances showing positive growth for the month of March. Overall, we expect average loan balances to decline modestly in the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter.\nMoving to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1.6% sequentially as growth in client time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in noninterest-bearing brokered and money market balances. Approximately $1.9 billion of the $6.3 billion linked quarter decline in average deposits was due to lower broker deposits. Adjusting for broker deposits, our average deposits declined approximately 1%.\nNoninterest-bearing deposits decreased 4.9% and represented 28% of total deposits compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the quarter, consumers continued to see higher rate alternatives, which drove an increase in deposit costs. Specifically, total deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.03%, which resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to 38%.\nSimilarly, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially to 2.82%, which also resulted in a 2% increase in our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta of 53%.\nShifting to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 4.2% linked quarter, primarily due to higher rate paid on deposits, lower day count in the quarter and lower average earning assets. Reported net interest margin declined 7 basis points on a linked quarter basis due primarily to higher rate paid on deposits.\nTurning to noninterest income on Slide 12. Noninterest income increased $83 million or 6.1% relative to the fourth quarter. The linked quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher investment banking and trading income, which is up $158 million linked quarter due to strong results across much of our entire capital markets platform with specific strength in M&A and equity capital markets.\nLending-related fees decreased $57 million linked quarter due to lower leasing-related gains. Noninterest income increased 1.8% on a like-quarter basis as higher investment banking and trading, wealth and other income were partially offset by lower service charges on deposits and mortgage banking income.\nNext, I'll cover noninterest expense on Slide 13. GAAP expenses of $3 billion decreased $6.6 billion linked quarter as fourth quarter 2023 expenses were negatively impacted by a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, a $507 million FDIC special assessment and $155 million of restructuring charges primarily related to our cost savings initiatives.\nExcluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted noninterest expense increased 0.7% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expense was driven by higher personnel expense of $156 million due to normal seasonal factors and higher variable incentive compensation. Partially offsetting the increase in personnel expense were lower other expenses which declined $82 million, reflecting lower operating charge-offs and lower pension expense.\nAdjusted noninterest expenses before the impact of discontinued operations, accounting -- discontinued operations accounting increased 1% on a linked quarter basis. On a like-quarter basis, adjusted expenses declined $120 million or 4.2%, reflecting lower headcount and continued expense discipline.\nMoving to asset quality on Slide 14. Asset quality metrics continued to normalize in the first quarter, but overall remain manageable. Nonperforming loans remained relatively stable linked quarter, while total delinquencies were down 6 basis points sequentially, driven by a 7 basis point decline in loans 30 to 89 days past due.\nIncluded on our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which is virtually unchanged at 1.7% of total loans. However, we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from 8.5% to 9.3% during the quarter to reflect continued stress in the sector. We expect stress to remain in the office sector, but believe that the size of our office portfolio is manageable and well reserved. Approximately 5.5% of our office portfolio is currently classified as nonperforming but 89% of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan.\nDuring the quarter, our net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 64 basis points. The increase in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects increases in our CRE and consumer portfolios, offset by lower C&I and CRE construction losses. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.56%, up 2 basis points sequentially and 19 basis points on a year-over-year basis due to ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector.\nConsistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas that we maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality, long-term clients.\nTurning now to capital on Slide 15. Truist CET1 ratio remained relatively stable on a linked-quarter basis at 10.1% as organic capital generation and the impact of lower risk-weighted assets were mostly offset by the impact of the CECL phase-in that occurred during the quarter. We still anticipate the sale of TIH will generate approximately 230 basis points of CET1 under current rules and 255 basis points of CET1 capital under proposed Basel III end game rules. It will also increase our tangible book value per share by 33% through a combination of a $4.8 billion after-tax gain and the deconsolidation of $4.7 billion of goodwill and intangibles from our balance sheet.\nThe divestiture of TIH has a 255 basis point positive impact under fully proposed phase-in Basel III end game rules, which is 25 basis points higher than under current rules. The larger impact on our CET1 ratio under the proposed rules is due to the reduction in certain threshold deductions due to the overall higher level of capital from selling TIH.\nThe sale of TIH accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry. And importantly, creates capacity for Truist to evaluate a wide variety of capital deployment alternatives, including growing our core banking franchise during a time when much of the industry is conserving capital, repositioning our balance sheet and resuming share repurchases.\nAs it relates to a possible repositioning, recognizing securities losses under proposed Basel III rules would have no impact on our fully phased-in CET1 ratio since current proposed rules include AOCI in the calculation. Moreover, any decision to sell market value securities has no impact on our tangible book value per share.\nI will now review our updated guidance on Slide 16. First, all of my comments today related to second quarter and full year 2024 guidance exclude any benefit from interest income that Truist will earn on the $10.1 billion of after-tax cash proceeds that we expect to receive from the pending sale of TIH. Our guidance also excludes any impact from a potential balance sheet repositioning that we plan to evaluate post closing. In addition, revenue and expense guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024 is based on revenue and expense from continuing operations and does not include any contribution from TIH in previous or in future periods.\nLooking into the second quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to decline about 2% from 1Q '24 GAAP revenue of $4.9 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 2% to 3% in the second quarter due to continued pressure on rate paid and a smaller balance sheet. We expect noninterest income to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis.\nAdjusted expenses of $2.7 billion in the first quarter are expected to increase 4% in Q2 due to higher professional fees, some timing of projects delayed from Q1, higher marketing costs, and annual merit increases. For the full year 2024, we previously expected revenues to be down 1% to 3%, which would have included revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings.\nIf we had excluded revenue from Truist Insurance Holdings from our outlook, our expectation would have been closer to down 3% to down 5% in 2024. Today, we are tightening our previous revenue guidance adjusted for TIH of down approximately 3% to down 5% to now down approximately 4% to 5% to reflect the latest interest rate outlook and continued pressure on deposit mix, partially offset by our improved outlook for noninterest income.\nOur outlook assumes 3 reductions in the Fed funds rate with the first reduction coming in June 2024. Previously, we assumed 5 reductions in the Fed funds rate with the first reduction occurring in May 2024. We still assume that net interest income will trough in the second quarter of 2024 and modestly improve in the second half of the year.\nFewer than 3 rate reductions would add pressure to our NII outlook and result in our annual revenue coming in at the lower end of our range for revenue to be down 4% to 5%. As a reminder, our second quarter and full year revenue outlook excludes any benefit from interest income earned on the cash proceeds from the sale of TIH or the benefit of potential balance sheet repositioning.\nAs Bill mentioned, we still expect the sale of TIH to be completed during the second quarter. We previously expected our expenses to remain flat or to increase by 1% in 2024, which included expenses associated with Truist Insurance Holdings. If we had excluded expected expenses from tourist insurance holdings from our outlook, our expectation would equate to expenses remaining approximately flat in 2024. Consistent with our previous expense outlook adjusted for TIH, we expect full year '24 adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over 2023 adjusted expenses of $11.4 billion. In terms of asset quality, we continue to expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points in 2024.\nFinally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 16% or 19% on a taxable equivalent basis. Our estimated tax rate excludes any impact from the gain on the sale of TIH or a potential balance sheet repositioning that we might consider following the sale. So now I'll turn it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. I am proud of the results our teammates delivered during the first quarter, which included solid underlying earnings, improved momentum and the announced sale of Truist Insurance Holdings. As Mike mentioned, TIH will enter its partnership with its new investors with strong momentum, as evidenced by its first quarter results. Providing risk advice to our clients is core to our purpose, and we look forward to maintaining a strong partnership with that team into the future.\nWe have great confidence in our capability to grow our core banking business and help our clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial, consumer payments, investment banking and wealth platform throughout our existing footprint and specialty areas. Our top priorities for 2024 are unchanged and include growing and deepening relationships with core clients, maintaining our expense discipline, evaluating various capital deployment options following the sale of TIH and enhancing Truist digital experience through T3, all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics.\nOur expense discipline is showing up in our results, which gives us confidence that we'll meet our expense objectives this year. I'm also encouraged by the improvement in our Wholesale Banking business, which includes investment banking and trading as it was a key driver of our quarterly results. In Investment Banking, we've increased our market share across several capital market products due to significant investment in talent and industry verticals.\nThese investments have resulted in a significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products, including equity capital markets, leveraged finance, asset securitization and M&A. In addition, our mind share with clients and our key industry verticals has never been stronger, and we continue to expand into new verticals that are prime for growth as capital markets activities recover.\nWe're seeing solid year-over-year growth in referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Our commercial teammates have responded to new expectations, and we continue to add great talent to our comprehensive platform.\nFinally, we made new key leadership hires within our payments business during the quarter as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time. In consumer, I'm encouraged that our internal consumer satisfaction scores have returned to premerger levels. In addition, net new checking account production was positive in the first quarter as we added 30,000 new consumer and business accounts. Importantly, we're also seeing year-over-year improvement in account attrition rates.\nAlso during the first quarter, our digital channel, we acquired 172,000 accounts, including 63,000 new to Truist while also seeing a 14% increase in deposit balances over the fourth quarter of 2023. While the branch network represents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we continue to see improvements in productivity due to teammate execution and investments in technology. We're encouraged by this increased productivity. We'll look to make investments in branches on select key growth markets in 2025.\nOverall, loan demand does remain muted, but I'm encouraged by the improvement in our commercial loan pipelines and the growth we witnessed in consumer balances late in the first quarter. By selling TIH, we'll have capital capacity to play more offense in our consumer and wholesale businesses, which includes seeking ways to accelerate loan growth in our core franchise. In addition, our significantly stronger balance sheet will be positioned to weather an even wider range of economic environments while also giving us the unique ability to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities post closing, including a potential balance sheet repositioning and resuming meaningful share repurchases later in the year.\nAlthough we have a plan to replace TIH earnings in the near term, we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in near-term dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio. Our starting point for ROATCE following the sale of TIH will be exactly that, a starting point. The strength of our markets, our core banking franchise, our capital deployment options we can consider after the sale will result in improved returns over time.\nWe'll move with pace, but will not be in a rush to deploy capital to meet short-term expectations that don't have a long-term positive impact on our company, our clients, our shareholders, especially since Basel III capital rules have not been firmly established for the industry. In conclusion, we're off to a solid start in 2024, but we acknowledge, as always, there's more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future.\nWe view our first quarter performance as another step forward in that direction. I'm optimistic about our future. I look forward to operating our company from this increased position of financial strength in some of the best markets in the country. And finally, I'd like to thank all of our teammates and our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity, particularly over the last few months during this important time for both TIH and for Truist. So with that, Brad, let me hand it back over to you for Q&A.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Bill. Jamie, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]"

[Operator Instructions] A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike McGuire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2024. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Bo Cummins, our Vice Chair and Chief Operating Officer; Dontá Wilson, Chief Consumer and Small Business Banking Officer; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings' Chairman and CEO, are also in attendance and available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call.\nThe accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist investor relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review these disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our fourth quarter results, let's begin with our purpose on Slide 4. As you know, Truist is a purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. I'd like to take just a few moments to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose during 2023.\nThrough Truist Community Capital, we committed nearly $2.1 billion to support more than 15,000 units of affordable housing. This helped create more than 15,000 jobs and serve more than 130,000 people in low and moderate-income communities this year. Also, our teammates impacted 5,300 organizations and causes through their charitable giving and more than 62,000 hours of volunteer service. In addition, we started a small business community heroes initiative, which empowers our branch teammates alongside our virtual small business specialists, leveraging our digital solutions to proactively connect via caring conversations with small business owners who tirelessly work to serve our neighbors, create jobs, build our communities and help drive our economy.\nSo those are just a few examples of the meaningful work we're doing as a company to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients, our teammates, our communities, and our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose.\nAll right. So let's turn to some of the key takeaways on Slide 6 Truist reported solid fourth quarter results [indiscernible] adjusted earnings after excluding several discrete items that impacted our results. The largest of these items, of course, is a $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge. Mike is going to provide more details later in our call, but this was the result of our annual impairment test, which we conduct each year as of October 1. So importantly, this charge is noncash. It has no impact on our liquidity, regulatory capital ratios, the payment of our common dividend or our ability to do business and serve our clients.\nOn an adjusted basis, we reported net income of $1.1 billion or $0.81 a share, which excludes the impact of the impairment charge, the industry-wide FDIC special assessment and a discrete tax benefit. In addition, pretax merger-related and restructuring charges of $183 million negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.10 per share. Most of these charges were related to our cost saving plan.\nDespite these discrete items in the quarter, we're pleased with our underlying results. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several key themes. First, we made strong progress on our organization simplification plan during this quarter. Since these initiatives were announced in mid-September, we've reduced headcount, realigned significant elements of our organizational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities in 2024 and beyond. As a result of these efforts and others through 2023, the fourth quarter marked the second consecutive quarter we've seen our expenses decline.\nAlthough the first quarter will experience typical seasonal expense headwinds, we're on track and fully committed to delivering on the cost initiatives that we outlined in September, which will limit adjusted expense growth to flat to up to 1% in 2024 while also continuing to invest in initiatives for our core clients, technology and risk management. Although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels, we're encouraged that nonperforming loans declined during the quarter while we continue to build our loan loss reserve considering the uncertain economic environment.\nConsistent with our capital planning strategy, our CET1 ratio increased 20 basis points sequentially to 10.1. Although we're committed to building capital, our balance sheet also remains open to core clients as our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing clients and the payment of our common dividend.\nSo before I hand the call over to Mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail, let me provide a quick update on our progress we're making on improving the experience for our clients. We'll do that on Slide 7. Truist continues to see improved digital engagement trends with strong transaction growth over the last year. Mobile app users grew 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, which is contributing to increased transaction volumes, which now account for 62% of total bank transactions.\nAs shown on the chart on the left, growth in digital transactions is primarily reflected by increased Zelle usage as clients continue to value efficient payment and money movement capabilities. And while this is certainly positive, Truist still has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital, specifically by leveraging our T3 strategy, which is the concept that touch and technology work together to create trust that further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency.\nOur goal is to create seamless experiences for our clients by offering more self-service capabilities to enhance the overall client experience. Truist Assist is a perfect example of this concept. Since launching in 2022, we've seen increased client adoption with 1/3 of the total interactions represented in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone. Additionally, 85% of the conversations were completed using the automated assistant this quarter. As we look into 2024, we expect accelerated adoption of Truist Assist, which should lead to additional operational efficiencies for Truist.\nSo overall, I'm pleased with the digital progress we've made in 2023 and excited about the opportunity to further leverage Q3 and 2024 and beyond that. So let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail. Mike?\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, we reported a GAAP net loss of $5.2 billion or $3.85 per share. As Bill noted, reported earnings per share were impacted by several items detailed at the top of Slide 8. Those include a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $6.1 billion, a special FDIC assessment of $507 million and a discrete tax benefit of $204 million. Excluding these 3 items, adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $0.81 per share. In addition, merger-related and restructuring charges, primarily related to severance and branch consolidation associated with our cost saves initiatives, negatively impacted EPS by another $0.10.\nBefore providing further details on this quarter's underlying financial performance, I do want to provide some additional background on the goodwill impairment charge that occurred during the quarter. We test our goodwill for impairment annually on October 1. This year's test resulted in an impairment of $6.1 billion. The impairment was primarily driven by the continued impact of higher interest rates and higher discount rates and a sustained decline in banking industry share prices, including Trust share price. Importantly, as Bill noted in his opening remarks, this is a noncash charge and has no impact on our liquidity, no impact on our regulatory capital ratios, our ability to pay our common stock dividend or to serve the needs of our clients.\nMoving on to the results for the quarter. Total revenue increased 50 basis points sequentially due to a more modest decline in net interest income than expected. Adjusted expenses declined 4.5% or 5.2%, if excluding the impact of TIH independence readiness costs. Our net interest margin improved 3 basis points to 2.98% during the quarter. We added 20 basis points of CET1 capital in the quarter and increased our ALLL ratio by 5 basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. Finally, our tangible book value per share increased 13% on a linked-quarter basis due primarily to the impact of lower interest rates on the value of our available-for-sale investment portfolio.\nNext, we'll turn to Page 9 to cover loans and leases. Average loans decreased 1.7% sequentially, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts and overall weaker client demand. Average commercial loans decreased 1.8% primarily due to a 2.3% decrease in C&I balances primarily due to lower client demand. In our consumer portfolio, average loans decreased 1.8% primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and [ mortgage ]. Overall, we expect average commercial and consumer balances declined modestly in the first quarter driven by our ongoing mix shift toward deeper client relationships, deemphasizing lower return portfolios and the effects of continued economic uncertainty.\nMoving now to deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits decreased 1.4% sequentially as growth in time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in noninterest-bearing and money market balances. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 3.7% and represented 29% of total deposits compared to 30% in the third quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. During the quarter, consumers continued to seek higher rate alternatives, which drove an increase in deposit costs, albeit at a slower pace relative to recent periods.\nTypically, total deposit costs increased 9 basis points sequentially to 1.90%, down from a 30 basis point increase in the prior quarter, which resulted in just a 100 basis point increase to our cumulative total deposit beta to 36%. Similarly, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 10 basis points sequentially to 2.67%, down from a 38 basis point increase in the prior quarter, which also resulted in a 100 basis point increase to our cumulative total interest-bearing deposit beta to 50%. Going forward, we will continue to maintain a balanced approach, focusing on core relationships, staying attentive to client needs and striving to maximize the value we can add to relationships outside of rate paid.\nMoving to net interest income and net interest margin on Slide 11. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by 0.6% linked quarter due to lower average earning assets and higher rate paid on deposits partially offset by favorable hedge income. Reported net interest margin improved 3 basis points on a linked basis quarter. While net interest margin expanded in each of the last 2 quarters, we expect it to contract in the first quarter due to an increase in rate paid on deposits, partially offset by continued improvement in spreads on new and renewed loans.\nTurning to noninterest income on Slide 12. Fee income increased $47 million or 2.2% relative to the third quarter. The linked-quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher service charges on deposits, which were up $76 million in the fourth quarter, due primarily to the third quarter being impacted by $87 million of client refunds. Lending-related fees increased $51 million linked-quarter due to higher leasing related gains, and other fees declined $66 million due to lower equity income. Fee income was down 3.2% on a like-quarter basis as lower investment banking and trading, deposit service charges, mortgage banking and other income were partially offset with higher insurance income and higher lending-related fees.\nNext, I'll cover noninterest expense on Slide 13. GAAP expenses of $10.3 billion increased $6.5 billion linked-quarter due primarily to the previously mentioned $6.1 billion goodwill impairment charge, the $507 million FDIC special assessment and a $108 million increase in merger-related and restructuring expense, partially offset by a $183 million decline in personnel costs. Excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization, adjusted noninterest expense declined 4.5% sequentially or 5.2% excluding the impact of $33 million of TIH independence readiness costs.\nThe decrease in adjusted expense was driven by lower personnel expense due to the execution of our cost savings program, resulting in headcount reductions as well as lower incentive compensation to reflect our performance in 2023. These improvements were partially offset with higher professional and outside processing expenses. Adjusted noninterest expenses were essentially flat on a like-quarter basis.\nAs Bill mentioned, we are pleased with the progress that we've made on the cost savings initiative that we announced in September. Our original goal was to eliminate or avoid expenses of approximately $750 million over a 12- to 18-month period, which would help us manage our expense growth in 2024 to flat to up 1%. The largest category of savings targeted in our plan was a reduction in force, driven by a company-wide assessment of spans and layers of management, the elimination of redundant functions and the restructuring of certain business lines. We've made significant progress here. FTEs are down 4% from June 30 to December 31, with the final set of reductions underway in the first quarter.\nThe second category we highlighted included cost savings opportunities that will be driven by organizational simplification. Examples include reimagining our go-to-market strategy in CRE, simplifying our benefits programs and rightsizing our branch network and related staffing. As part of these efforts, we anticipate reducing the size of our branch footprint by nearly 4% during the first half of 2024.\nIn addition to lowering headcount and simplifying our organization, we also reexamined our technology investment spend. Through this process, we have rationalized, rescoped or delayed at the start of a number of projects primarily in noncore areas. We estimated restructuring costs related to this initiative to be approximately $225 million or 30% of our initial $750 million goal. So far, we have incurred around $200 million of charges related to the program, mostly driven by reductions in force in the facilities-related decisions. We would expect to recognize the bulk of the remaining costs in the first quarter.\nIt's clear to state here that the work is never done, and we continue to assertively manage costs. But we feel confident that we will achieve our flat to up 1% expense target for 2024.\nOkay. Moving on to asset quality on Slide 14. Asset quality metrics continued to normalize in the fourth quarter but overall remain manageable. Nonperforming loans declined 6% linked-quarter, while early-stage delinquencies increased 11 basis points sequentially due to an increase in 30- to 89-day past due consumer and C&I loans. Included in our appendix is an updated data on our office portfolio, which represents 1.7% of total loans. We are pleased that nonperforming and criticized and classified office loans decreased modestly linked-quarter, while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from 8.3% at September 30 to 8.5% at year-end.\nDuring the quarter, our net charge-off ratio increased 6 basis points to 57 basis points. The increase in net charge-offs for the quarter reflects increases in our other consumer, indirect auto and C&I lending portfolios, partially offset by lower CRE losses. We continue to build reserves as provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $119 million. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.54%, up 5 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year, due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty.\nConsistent with our commentary last quarter, we've tightened our risk appetite in select areas, though we remain -- maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality, long-term clients.\nTurning now to capital on Slide 15. Truist added 20 basis points of CET1 capital in the fourth quarter through a combination of organic capital generation, disciplined RWA management and this quarter's tax benefit, partially offset by the FDIC special assessment. With a CET1 ratio of 10.1%, Truist remains well capitalized relative to our minimum regulatory requirement of 7.4% that became effective on October 1. We remain committed to building capital and do not have plans to repurchase shares over the near term. We continue to be disciplined with our RWA management strategy as we allocate less capital to certain businesses, though we have been clear that our balance sheet remains open to core clients. Our\nprimary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing core clients as well as the payment of our $0.52 per share quarterly dividend. In addition, we continue to believe that Truist's capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings is a distinctive advantage. We estimate that our residual 80% ownership stake provides greater than 200 basis points of additional capital flexibility, and we continue to evaluate our strategic options with respect to TIH.\nThe table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our AOCI at year-end. During the fourth quarter, the component of AOCI attributable to securities declined from $13.5 billion to $11.1 billion or by $2.4 billion due to the decline in long-term interest rates during the quarter and finished 2023 essentially flat when compared to year-end 2022. AOCI related to our pension plan improved from $1.5 billion to $1.1 billion, which is a level that will remain static throughout 2024. Based on estimated cash flows in today's forward curve, we would expect the component of AOCI attributable to securities to decline from $11.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter to $8 billion by the end of 2026 or by approximately 28%.\nWe continue to feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements and build capital under the proposed phase-in periods based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules. We have refined our estimate for the impact to risk-weighted assets under Basel III and now expect a mid-single-digit increase in risk-weighted assets compared to our previous estimate of a high single-digit increase.\nFinally, as it relates to the proposed rules for a long-term debt requirement, we estimate that Truist's binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately $12 billion. We remain confident that we will be able to meet the proposed requirement at both the bank and the holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phase-in period. As part of our regular way funding plan, we issued $1.75 billion of long-term debt during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAll right. I'll now turn to Page 16 to review our updated guidance. Looking into the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenues to remain flat or decline by 1% from 4Q 2023 GAAP revenue of $5.8 billion. Net interest income is likely to be down 3% to 4% in the first quarter, which is more than we experienced in the fourth quarter due primarily to 1 less day, a smaller balance sheet and some pressure on our net interest margin driven by rate paid. We expect linked-quarter improvement in noninterest income due to higher insurance and investment banking and trading income, partially offset by lower other and lending-related fee income. Adjusted expenses of $3.4 billion are expected to increase by 4% due to normal seasonal increases related to payroll taxes and higher incentive accruals.\nFor the full year 2024, we expect revenues to decrease by 1% to 3%. Our balance sheet and interest rate sensitivity continues to be positioned as relatively neutral, which is in line with our long-term goal. Our forecast assumes that net interest income troughs in the first half of 2024 and then remains relatively stable, assuming 5 reductions in the Fed funds rate with the first reduction coming in May 2024. In addition, we assume that insurance continues to grow at high single-digit rate, while investment banking and trading should benefit from a recovery in capital markets.\nAlthough we anticipate adjusted expenses rising 4% in the first quarter due to seasonal factors, full year 2024 adjusted expenses are still expected to remain flat or to increase 1% over 2023 adjusted expenses of $14 billion, which includes TIH independence readiness costs. Our 2024 expense guidance of flat to up 1% also includes $85 million of TIH independence readiness costs. In terms of asset quality, we expect net charge-offs of about 65 basis points, reflecting a continued normalization of loss rates across our consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, a lower denominator from declining loan balances and our strategy to be proactive in resolving higher risk portfolios. Finally, we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 17% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis.\nI'll now turn it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. So looking back at 2023, I'm really proud of the work our teammates accomplished, which helped accelerate our transformation into a simpler, more profitable company. As I discussed in September, our transformation is centered on improving efficiency and realigning certain aspects of our leadership and operating model within our 3 current operating segments: wholesale, consumer and insurance, to increase our efficiency and drive revenue opportunities.\nIn the third quarter, we've realigned and consolidated several lines of business within consumer and wholesale, including creating a single enterprise-wide payments group, consolidating 3 commercial real estate units into one and consolidating 4 consumer lending platforms to leverage technology and capital resources. During the fourth quarter, we announced significant leadership appointments within consumer and wholesale and we formed a new operating council composed of key business leaders from across the organization. These leaders will help improve accountability, efficiency and ultimately drive better growth across our platform, while controlling risk, all of which are primary benefits of the simplification plan.\nThese strategic organizational changes designed to improve long-term revenue growth are complete, and we're beginning to see the impacts from our cost savings initiative. To that end, and as Mike discussed, our cost-saving efforts are going well and reflect the planning and execution that was ongoing throughout 2023. These cost-saving efforts are funding important investments in our risk management infrastructure and core businesses while also helping to offset natural expense growth in other parts of our organization. We accomplished all of this while growing net new deposit accounts, strengthened our balance sheet through organic capital growth and strategically allocating our capital to core businesses.\nLooking beyond the fourth quarter, our top priorities for 2024 include growing and deepening relationships with our core clients, leveraging our more efficient platform to gain market share, achieving our expense target and enhancing Truist's digital experience with T3, all while building capital and maintaining strong risk controls and asset quality metrics. We believe there is a significant potential to help our clients achieve their financial success by delivering our commercial consumer payments, consumer payments, investment banking, wealth and insurance capabilities throughout our existing footprint.\nIn investment banking, we've increased our market share across virtually all of our capital markets products. We've seen a significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products including investment-grade, equity capital markets, leveraged finance and asset securitization. In addition, our mind share with clients in our key industry verticals has never been stronger as we continue to expand into new verticals that are prime for growth as capital market activity recovers.\nAcross our wholesale businesses, recent changes in client coverage strategies should allow us to focus more intently on opportunities in the middle market, where we can bring unique perspective given the breadth and depth of our platform, especially in areas like investment banking and payments. We're seeing solid year-over-year growth in CIB referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver value-added advice and capabilities to our clients. Truist Wealth which, beginning in 2024, will be part of our wholesale business segment, has seen positive asset flows in 10 of the last 11 quarters. By bringing the wealth business over to wholesale, we'll go to market as one team to deliver business transition advisory solutions to commercial and corporate clients.\nIn consumer, I'm encouraged that customer satisfaction scores have returned to premerger levels. In addition, net new checking account production was positive in 2023 as we added 59,000 new consumer and 53,000 new business accounts. And during the fourth quarter, we acquired more than 114,000 accounts through our digital channel, including 33,000 new to Truist. While the branch network presents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets, we're seeing improvements in productivity due to excellent teammate execution and investments in technology as evidenced by the increase in net new deposit accounts. We're encouraged by this increased productivity, and we'll look to make investments in branches in select key growth markets in 2025 and beyond.\nSo in conclusion, the fourth quarter was solid. But we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future. We view our fourth quarter performance as another step forward in that direction. We're making strong progress on areas in our control, including managing our expenses, building capital and realigning our business so that it is well positioned to serve new and existing clients as markets recover. We're firmly committed to achieving our expense target in 2024, while we will continue to build and allocate capital towards core clients in our home markets we view as a distinctive competitive advantage. This heightened focus will lead to increased franchise and shareholder value over time.\nLet me close by just thanking our teammates for their incredible purposeful leadership in 2023. Teammates, your focus and commitment fuels our confidence in 2024 and beyond. Thank you. So with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nRocco, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session.

[Operator Instructions] A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Bo Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings' Chairman and CEO, are also in attendance and available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call.\nThe accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website. ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Now before we get into the third quarter results, let's begin as always with our purpose on Slide 4. As we all know, Truist is a purpose-driven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities. I'd like to take a few minutes just to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose last quarter.\nTruist is driving positive change by supporting organizations that promote the growth and vibrancy of our communities. In August, we invested $17 million to support affordable housing in Charlotte and career development and economic mobility programs across the state of North Carolina. And just last week, we announced our allocation of $65 million in new market tax credits from the U.S. Treasury's Community Development Financial Institution Fund. This is the 12th time Truist has received an award, which has allowed us to invest $750 million in underserved communities by providing loans with reduced rates of interest and/or nontraditional terms. Over the years, these loans have helped spark economic development and job growth and communities across the regions we serve. I'm really proud of the meaningful work we're doing as a company to have a positive effect on the lives of our clients, our teammates and our communities and, of course, our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose.\nNow let's turn to some of the key takeaways on Slide 6. Truist reported solid third quarter earnings that met our guidance despite certain discrete noninterest income and expense items that negatively impacted our results. Mike is going to cover those later in the call. As you can see on the slide, our solid performance was defined by several underlying key themes. On July earnings call, we discussed our intent to significantly reduce the rate of expense growth at our company, which was followed up with the introduction of our simplification efforts and $750 million program in September. We're fully committed to delivering on this work. And the reduction in third quarter expenses is evidence of the hard work that's been ongoing throughout the year.\nWe're also managing our balance sheet more efficiently. During the past few earnings calls, I've described how we're focusing on core clients, reducing lower-yielding portfolios and paying down higher cost borrowings, all of which occurred during the third quarter and helped drive our NIM higher by 4 basis points during the quarter. Moreover, these efforts have increased our CET1 ratio to nearly 10%, which is a level that we believe we can maintain throughout the proposed phase-in period under pending Basel III rules based on our current rate of organic capital growth. Although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels, we are encouraged that our metrics remained relatively stable during the quarter while we continue to build our loan loss reserve considering the uncertain economic environment.\nLastly, we're making strong progress on our cost saves program and organizational simplification, which we'll discuss in more detail later in the call.\nI'm pleased with our direction, the intensity and focus and I'm confident in our ability to emerge as a stronger company. While the quarter was solid, we acknowledge there's more work to do as we strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future. We view this third quarter performance as a step forward in that direction.\nSo let's do some more specific work on Slide 7. Net income available to common shareholders was $1.1 billion or $0.80 per share. Merger-related and restructuring charges primarily related to severance associated with our cost saves program per EPS by $0.04. Total revenue decreased as expected and was essentially in line with our guidance despite an $87 million discrete impact to service charges on deposits revenue. We're also encouraged that our net interest margin improved 4 basis points, driven by our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, including a reduction in FHLB borrowings, a decline in lower-yielding loan balances and improving new and renewed loan spreads.\nAdjusted expenses were down 50 basis points and within our guidance range and would have decreased 250 basis points excluding $70 million of higher-than-normal other expense. Average loans decreased 2.5%, primarily due to the sale of the student loan portfolio in the second quarter and our continued repositioning towards higher-return core assets. Average deposits increased modestly as we continue to experience a remixing towards higher-yielding alternatives. We added 29 basis points of CET1 capital in the quarter and increased our ALLL ratio by 6 basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty. Lastly, we maintained our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 per share paid on September 1.\nSo let's move to our digital update on Slide 8. Digital engagement trends at Truist remain positive, as you can see on the left side of the slide. Mobile app users have grown steadily over the past year, and we're currently focused on driving additional growth through our mobile-first engagement initiative. From an activity standpoint, digital transactions increased 9% relative to the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by Zelle transactions, which were up 32% over the same period.\nDue to the rapid growth we've experienced, digital has quickly become a preferred channel for interacting with Truist. In fact, digital transactions now account for more than 60% of total bank transactions. And while that's certainly positive, Truist has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital, specifically by leveraging what we call T3, which is this concept that touch and technology work together to create trust, and that further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency.\nAs a proof point, recent enhancements to the digital onboarding have helped drive a 19% increase in Truist One funding rates year-to-date, which may in turn lead to additional balances and transaction activity with those new clients. In sum, Truist has solid momentum in digital and I'm highly optimistic about the potential we have to leverage T3 to further expand our digital user base and drive transaction volume.\nNext, I'm going to cover loans and leases on Slide 9. Average loans decreased 2.5% sequentially, reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts, including the sale of our student loan portfolio last quarter and further reductions in lower-return portfolios. Excluding the student loan sale, average loans were down 1.1%. Average commercial loans decreased 1.1%, primarily due to a 1.5% decrease in C&I balances driven by lower revolver utilization and production. Lower C&I production in our Corporate and Commercial Banking segment reflected a combination of moderately lower demand due to economic uncertainty and greater pricing discipline, which contributed to wider spreads on new production and commercial community bank.\nIn our consumer and credit card portfolios, average loans decreased 4.6% and primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and further reductions in indirect auto production. Consumer and card balances were down 1%, excluding the student loan sale. Residential mortgage was essentially flat relative to the prior quarter. We do continue to experience growth in higher-yielding portfolios, especially Sheffield and Service Finance. Loan production increased 21% year-over-year at Sheffield and 17% at Service Finance. Overall, we expect average commercial and consumer balances to decline modestly in the fourth quarter, driven by our ongoing mix shift towards deeper client penetrations, deeper relationships, deemphasis of lower-return portfolios and the effects of continued economic uncertainty.\nSo let's move to the deposit trends on Slide 10. Average deposits were flat sequentially, although we continue to experience remixing within the portfolio as clients sought higher rate alternatives. Noninterest buried deposits decreased 3.9% and currently represent 30% of total deposits compared to 31% in the second quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of last year. Within our segments, average deposits were down 1% in corporate and commercial banking and relatively flat in consumer banking and wealth due to the effects of quantitative and tightening and availability of higher-rate alternatives.\nWe continue to deepen our relationships with consumer banking and wealth clients, especially in payments. Net new checking account production has been positive for 3 quarters in a row. We're also seeing solid adoption of our flagship Truist One checking product. In addition, small business deposits were up sequentially, and August was the strongest month for net new small business checking account production in the last 3 years.\nDeposit costs continued to rise during the third quarter, though at a slower pace. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 38 basis points sequentially, down from a 55 basis point increase in the prior quarter. Our interest-bearing cumulative deposit beta was 49%, up from 44% in the second quarter due to the presence of higher rate alternatives and ongoing mix shift from noninterest-bearing accounts into higher-yielding products. Going forward, we'll continue to maintain our balanced approach, being attentive to our client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value for them outside of rate paid.\nNow let me turn it over to Mike to discuss the financial results in a little more detail. Mike?\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with net interest income on Slide 11. For the quarter, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased 1.6% linked quarter primarily due to lower average earning assets and higher deposit costs. Although net interest income was down linked quarter, we are encouraged that the decline was slower than the 6.1% decrease observed in the second quarter as deposit betas increased at a more moderate pace.\nReported net interest margin increased 4 basis points after declining for 2 consecutive quarters. NIM stabilization reflected our ongoing balance sheet optimization initiatives, including: focusing on our core clients, improving spreads on new and renewed loans, reducing lower-yielding loan portfolios and paying down higher cost wholesale borrowings, including FHLB advances, which were down about $20 billion on average compared to the second quarter.\nTurning to noninterest income on Slide 12. Fee income decreased $185 million or 8.1% relative to the second quarter. The decline was primarily attributable to lower insurance income, which decreased $142 million sequentially due to seasonality. Insurance production is typically lowest in the third quarter and highest in the second. Insurance fundamentals remain strong driven by new business growth, improved retention and favorable pricing, all of which contributed to 6.3% organic revenue growth on a like-quarter basis.\nService charges on deposits were down $88 million in the third quarter due primarily to $87 million of client refund accruals that were driven by changes we made to our deposit fee protocols. Investment banking and trading income was lower by $26 million, while other income increased $38 million primarily due to higher income from other investments. Fee income was flat on a like-quarter basis as higher insurance income and higher other income were offset by lower service charges and lower investment banking and trading income.\nNext, I'll cover noninterest expense on Slide 13. Reported noninterest expense was flat sequentially as lower adjusted expense was offset by a $21 million increase in merger-related and restructuring expense, driven mostly by severance and facilities rationalization. Adjusted noninterest expense decreased 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our July guidance range of flat to down 1%. The decrease in adjusted expenses was driven by lower personnel expense and reduced professional fees and outside processing expense, partially offset by higher other expense.\nThe increase in other expense included $70 million of costs arising from the previously mentioned client deposit service charge refund accruals as well as the settlement of certain litigation matters, including a settlement and patent licensing agreement, which resolved the USAA patent infringement lawsuit. If you excluded these items, adjusted expenses declined by 2.5% linked quarter. The work associated with our gross cost saves program is well underway as we will discuss on Slide 14.\nIn September, we announced a $750 million gross cost saves plan that will be achieved over the next 12 to 18 months. The cost saves will include $300 million from reductions in force, $250 million from organizational realignment and simplification and $200 million from technology expense reductions. Since these initiatives were announced in mid-September, we have already realigned significant elements of our organizational and operational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities. The work we're doing includes optimizing spans and layers to improve organizational design health, consolidating redundant functions, restructuring select businesses and geographic simplification, all of which will result in reductions in force over the next couple of quarters.\nIn addition, we are aggressively managing third-party spend, reducing our corporate real estate footprint and rationalizing technology spend. Based on the latest information available, we still expect onetime costs associated with the cost saves program to range from 25% to 30% of gross cost saves. We also continue to project the cost saves program will help us manage adjusted expense growth to 0 to 1% in 2024, which is net of natural expense growth driven by inflation and other factors.\nMoving to asset quality on Slide 15. Asset quality metrics continued to normalize in the third quarter but overall remain manageable. Nonperforming assets were unchanged linked quarter, while early-stage delinquencies increased 4 basis points sequentially as increases in our consumer portfolios were partially offset by declines in commercial. Included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio, which represents 1.7% of total loans. We're pleased that nonperforming and criticized and classified office loans increased only modestly linked quarter, while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from 6.2% at June 30 up to 8.3% at September 30.\nOur net charge-off ratio decreased 3 basis points to 51 basis points, reflecting the prior quarter impact of the student loan sale, partially offset by increases in our CRE and lending portfolios. [indiscernible] reserves as provision expense exceeded net charge-offs by $92 million. Our ALLL ratio increased to 1.49%, up 6 basis points sequentially and 15 basis points year-over-year due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have tightened our risk appetite in select areas, though we maintain our through-the-cycle supportive approach for high-quality, long-term clients.\nTurning to capital now on Slide 16. Based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules, we feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements under the proposed phase-in periods. Truist added 29 basis points of CET1 capital in the third quarter through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined RWA management. With a CET1 ratio of 9.9%, Truist remains well capitalized relative to our new minimum regulatory requirement of 7.4%, which took place on October 1.\nAs a company, we are strongly committed to building capital and achieving a CET1 ratio of approximately 10% by the end of the year. The projected trajectory for our CET1 ratio does incorporate headwinds from the pending FDIC assessment, which is now expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter.\nOur primary capital priorities are supporting the organic growth needs of new and existing core clients and the payment of our $0.52 per share common dividend. We have no plans to repurchase shares over the near term and we will continue to allow previous acquisitions to mature. RWA management continues to be disciplined as we allocate less capital to certain businesses, though we have been very clear that our balance sheet is open to core clients.\nIn addition, we continue to believe that Truist's capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings is a distinctive advantage. We estimate that our residual 80% ownership stake provides greater than 200 basis points of additional capital flexibility. The table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our AOCI. Based on estimated cash flows in today's forward curve, we would expect the component of AOCI attributable to securities to decline from $13.5 billion at the end of the third quarter to $9.7 billion by the end of 2026 or a decline of 28%.\nFinally, as it relates to the proposed rules for a long-term debt requirement, we estimate that Truist's binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately $13 billion. We are confident that we will meet the proposed requirements at both the bank and holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phase-in period.\nNow I will review our updated guidance on Slide 17. Looking into the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be flat or to decline 1% from 3Q '23 GAAP revenue of $5.7 billion. We expect linked-quarter improvement in noninterest income due to higher insurance, service charges on deposit income and investment banking and trading income, partially offset by lower mortgage and other income. Net interest income is likely to remain under some pressure due to our smaller balance sheet and modest NIM compression.\nAdjusted expenses of $3.5 billion are expected to decline 3.5% due to lower personnel and other expenses. In April, we stated that our 2023 expense guidance excluded expenses associated with TIH independence readiness. Previously, we've not called out these costs because they totaled only $20 million through the first 9 months of 2023, including $9 million in the second quarter and $11 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect these expenses to approximate $35 million, which are excluded from our 4Q '23 expense guidance.\nFor the full year 2023, we expect revenues to increase by approximately 1.5%, which is at the midpoint of our previous revenue guidance of up 1% to 2%. Our guidance includes the $87 million client refund accrual that negatively impacted fees in the third quarter. Full year 2023 adjusted expenses are still on track to increase 7%. This includes $70 million related to the legal settlements and client deposit service charge refunds but excludes the $55 million of TIH Independence readiness costs for 2023.\nIn terms of asset quality, we have tightened our guidance from a range of 40 to 50 basis points to approximately 50 basis points for the full year, which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect our tax rate -- effective tax rate to approximate 18% or 20% on a taxable equivalent basis compared to 19% and 21% previously.\nNow I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. And I'll conclude on Slide 18.\nSo looking beyond the third quarter, our transformation into a simpler, more profitable company is underway. We're driving swift and meaningful actions to simplify our organization, which include key organizational changes. So for example, in the recent weeks we've streamlined our commercial and community banking regions from 21 to 14, realigned several overlapping units into a unified commercial real estate business.\nWe merged our consumer payments and wholesale payments businesses into a single enterprise payments organization, which will help us to accelerate payments activity more effectively across Truist. There have been a number of team consolidations within our consumer and small business banking lines of businesses. We've also realigned 9 teams under our enterprise operational services to drive efficiencies across our support team serving the whole organization. All of these changes are part of our $750 million cost saves program, which is well underway and designed to drive better service for our clients and limit adjusted expense growth to flat to up 1% in 2024.\nAlthough we're focused on reducing the rate of expense growth, we will continue to invest in our risk management organization and ability to maintain strong asset quality metrics. While there are many changes happening inside Truist, we've not lost focus on our core consumer and commercial businesses, which is an area that will continue to see significant investment. Net new checking account production has been positive for the first 3 quarters of this year, and we're on track to continue positive net news for the whole year.\nDuring the quarter, we acquired more than 39,000 households through our digital channel. We're also maintaining momentum in wealth, where net organic asset flows have been positive in 9 of the past 10 quarters. Client satisfaction scores were stable or increased across most RSPB channels during the third quarter. In the corporate and commercial, new left lead transactions were up 45% year-over-year. Lastly, our wholesale payments pipeline is up 10% year-over-year. We're also seeing strong improvement in client sentiment amongst commercial clients, reflecting product and digital investments that we've already made.\nAs a company, we're also operating our balance sheet more efficiently, thanks to our focus on core clients, deemphasizing lower-return portfolios and paying down higher-cost debt. We're building capital, and we feel confident in our ability to satisfy the requirements proposed in the Basel III end game rules with the proposed phase-in periods, while preserving our strategic flexibility with TIH.\nIn conclusion, we're making progress and we're doing what's necessary to improve our financial performance to meet your high expectations and, of course, ours. I am truly optimistic about Truist, and I know we're well positioned for the future. Our teammates are really performing at a high level, and they are committed to serving our clients, caring for each other and capitalizing on our great growth markets, I am really proud of our teammates.\nBefore we move to Q&A, I also want to publicly thank the 8 members of our Board of Directors who plan to retire at the end of this year. I'm deeply grateful for their years of service and meaningful contributions to our company. Truist literally iterally exists due to their leadership and confidence. Following these retirements, our Board will consist of 13 members, including 12 independent directors, who are well positioned to oversee and advance our strategic plans during this period of rapid industry transformation.\nSo with that, Brad, let me turn it back over to you, and we look forward to the Q&A.\n\nBradley Jason Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Bill. Anthony, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? As you do that, [Operator Instructions]"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Milsaps, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation.\n\nBrad Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and provide an updated outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings' Chairman and CEO, are also in attendance and available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call.\nThe accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and welcome to the team. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. I don't think it's a surprise to anybody on this call that the increasing levels of uncertainty in our economy, the impact of interest [ rates ] on funding cost and [ sort of post March ] operating environment for our industry are impacting our results and plans, Truist though was specifically built to increase our flexibility to respond to any condition to fulfill our purpose and commitment to all stakeholders.\nCapital and liquidity have taken on an increase focused and although Truist is currently well positioned, we're also intentionally building future flexibility. This environment also challenges us to move faster with greater intensity to tighten our strategic focus and rightsize our expense chassis to reflect the new realities. We also have flexibility in strengthening our balance sheet to support our focus on our unique core client base and market opportunity. These decisions are less incremental and more time bound than the ones previously made during our shift from integrating to operating. Mike will highlight some of these decisions in his comments, and I'll close with some of the underlying momentum. While these changes will be manifested over time, this is not business as usual and reflects an important and significant pivot for Truist and for our leadership team. We'll provide more details about these topics and our second quarter results throughout the presentation.\nBefore we do that, let me start what I always do on Slide 4 on purpose, mission and values. Truist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives in the communities. I'd like to share some of the ways we brought that purpose to life last quarter. In May, we announced the launch of Truist Long Game, our mobile app that leverages behavioral economics to reward clients for building financial wellness. At a high level, user set goals, save money and earn rewards that are deposited into a Truist account as they make progress towards their savings goals.\nBased on early data, users tend to play 4 to 5x a week with strong retention, and we've seen positive trends towards new client acquisition. This is also the first product from our Truist [ Foundry ], our very own start-up tasked with creating digital solutions to help meet clients where they are.\nTruist is also highlighting small business owners through our small business community heroes initiative, which is all about focusing on the small business owners who worked tirelessly to serve our neighbors, create jobs and build our communities and help drive our economy. Our branch teammates are visiting and connecting with tens of thousands of small business clients to say thank you and have a caring conversation to assist with their unique needs. The response so far has really been excellent, and our outreach efforts has helped drive a 31% increase in net new small business checking accounts during the second quarter alone.\nLastly, I want to thank our teammates who dedicated more than [ 16,000 hours ] during the second quarter to volunteer in their communities. Really proud of the good work our company and our teammates are doing to live on our purpose and to make a difference in the lives of their clients, teammates and communities.\nSo let's turn to the second quarter performance highlights on Slide 6. Second quarter results were mixed overall. Net income available to common in the second quarter was $1.2 billion or $0.92 a share. EPS decreased 16% relative to the year ago quarter, primarily due to a higher loan loss provision and noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income. EPS decreased 12% sequentially as higher funding costs pressured net interest income. Total revenue decreased 2.9% sequentially, consistent with our revised guidance and a 6.1% decrease in net interest income was partially offset by a 2.6% increase in fee income, led by record results at Truist Insurance Holdings.\nAdjusted expenses were within our existing guidance range, although we're actively working to manage costs even more intensely. Loan balances were relatively stable, and we're pleased with the initial progress we've made to reposition the balance sheet to higher-return core assets, especially in consumer, though there's always additional work to do. Average deposits were down 2%, largely due to client activity in March though overall deposit trends have stabilized significantly since that time frame and our conversations with our clients and our pipelines have improved.\nWe're also prudently increasing our provision and allowance due to increased economic uncertainty. At the same time, our CET1 capital ratio increased 50 basis points, driven by organic capital generation and the sale of a 20% stake in our Insurance business. These same factors drove a 5% increase in tangible book value per share from March 31. Our stress capital buffer increased from 250 basis points to 290 basis points higher than we think our steady-state business model warrants, but still a good performance as Truist had the fourth lowest loan loss rate among traditional banks that participate in the stress test reflecting, again, our conservative credit culture and diverse loan portfolio.\nWe also announced plans to maintain our strong quarterly common stock dividend at $0.52 a share, subject to Board approval. Strategically, we continue to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on our core clients and businesses, which is why we made the strategic decision to sell a $5 billion noncore student loan portfolio at net carrying value, which has no upfront P&L impact. We're also making solid progress towards shifting our loan mix towards higher-return core assets. As we adapt to the current environment, we're highly focused on doubling down on our core franchise, simplifying where it makes sense, rationalizing our expenses and building capital, all of which we'll address later in the presentation.\nSo moving to the digital and technology update on Slide 7. Digital engagement trends remain positive, reinforcing the importance of continued investment in digital due to its close association with relationship primacy, client experience and account growth. As a proof point, we recently enhanced our digital onboarding experience through a series of platform enhancements, resulting in higher conversion rates for new applications, faster funding and higher average digital account balances.\nOur growing mobile app user base is also driving increased transaction volumes. Digital transactions grew 5% sequentially and now account for 61% of total bank transactions. Zelle transactions increased 12% compared to the first quarter and now account for 1/3 of all digital transactions at Truist, which underscores the importance our clients place on our payments and money movement capabilities. Retail digital client satisfaction scores have also returned to their premerger highs. We're proud of our third place ranking in the Javelin 2023 Mobile Banking scorecard.\nFrom an overall client experience and technology perspective, we continue to enhance our capability set. That includes recent improvements to our cloud-based self-service digital assistant Truist Assist. Since implementing these enhancements several months ago, Truist Assist has hosted over 500,000 conversations with more than 380,000 clients and has connected clients to live agents to support more than 100,000 complex needs via live chat. Over time, increased utilization of Truist Assist should lead to lower volumes in our call centers.\nWe're also delivering on our commitment to T3 through the launch of our Truist Insights to our small business heroes earlier this month. Truist Insights empower small businesses by providing actionable insights about financial activities, including cash flows, income and expense and proactive balance monitoring. We first piloted Truist Insights in 2021, and this year alone have generated over 200 million financial insights for more than 4.5 million clients, and we're now delivering this valuable tool to small business. This is just one more way we're bringing touch and technology together to build trust and to help our small business clients bank with confidence where and how they want. Overall, I'm highly optimistic that our investments in innovation in digital and technology will enhance performance and further improve the client experience.\nLet me turn to loans and leases on Slide 8. Loan growth continues to be correlated with the solid progress we've made to shift our loan mix towards more profitable portfolios and core clients while intentionally pulling back from lower yielding in certain single product relationships. Average loan balances were stable sequentially as growth in our Commercial portfolio was largely offset by lower consumer balances. Commercial loan growth was driven by seasonality in mortgage warehouse lending and continued growth in traditional C&I, which is a core area for us. The decline in average consumer balances was primarily due to indirect auto where we've intentionally reduced production, home equity, residential mortgage and student loan balances also declined, and I'll provide more details about the sale of the student loan portfolio in a few moments.\nAt the same time, we're seeing strong results from our Service Finance and Sheffield businesses, where second quarter production grew 34% and 21%, respectively, from the year ago quarter. Service Finance continues to perform very well and take market share and consistent with our balance sheet optimization, we'll increase our loan sale opportunities to help support its growth.\nAs I mentioned, we made the strategic decision to sell our $5 billion noncore student loan portfolio, which had been running off at a pace of approximately $400 million per quarter. We sold a student loan book in late June and net carrying value with no upfront P&L impact. Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce other wholesale funding. The transaction will modestly hurt NII but boost NIM and balance sheet efficiency, exactly what we should be doing in an environment where cost of capital and funding has increased meaningfully. Going forward, we'll continue to better focus our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our exposure to single product and indirect clients as well as evaluate ways to increase the velocity overall of our balance sheet.\nNow let me provide some perspective on overall deposit trends on Slide 9. Average deposits decreased $8.7 billion or 2.1%, primarily due to seasonal tax payments and outflows that occurred late in the first quarter and were consistent with industry impacts of quantitative [ tight ]. We continue to experience remixing within our deposit portfolio as noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 31% of total deposits from 32% in the first quarter and 34% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 55 basis points sequentially, and our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was 44%, up from 36% in the first quarter due to the continued presence of higher rate alternatives and the ongoing shift from noninterest-bearing accounts to higher-yielding products. We continue to make a balanced approach in the current environment, being attentive to client needs and relationships while also striving to maximize value outside of rate paid. Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in [ Treasury and Payments are ] the bull's-eye of our sharpened strategic focus and will remain critical as we look to acquire new relationships, deepen existing ones and maximize high-quality deposit growth.\nNow let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail.\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin with net interest income on Slide 10. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 6.1% sequentially as higher funding costs more than offset the benefits of higher rates on earning assets. Reported net interest margin decreased 26 basis points to 2.91% due primarily to an acceleration of interest-bearing deposit betas and mix shift out of DDA into other high-cost alternatives. The lower net interest margin also reflected our liquidity build late in the first quarter. While liquidity remained elevated throughout April and May, it has normalized by June and will provide some modest boost in NIM going forward.\nOn a year-over-year basis, net interest income is still up 7.1% and core net interest margin is up 13 basis points. This reflects the cumulative benefit we've seen from the rising rates during the cycle, particularly throughout 2022, though now we are losing some of that benefit in 2023.\nMoving to fee income on Slide 11. Fee income rebounded 2.6% relative to the first quarter. Insurance income increased $122 million sequentially to a record $935 million demonstrating the strength of Truist Insurance Holdings. Year-over-year, organic revenue grew by 9.1%, the highest in 4 quarters, driven by strong new business growth, improved retention and a favorable pricing backdrop. Other income increased $65 million primarily due to higher income from our nonqualified plan and higher other investment income. In contrast, investment banking and trading income decreased $50 million, reflecting lower bond originations, loan syndications and asset securitizations as well as lower core trading income from derivatives and credit trading. Finally, mortgage banking income increased -- pardon me, decreased $43 million with most of the decrease related to prior quarter gain on sale of a servicing portfolio.\nTurning to noninterest expense on Slide 12. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $67 million or 1.9% sequentially. The increase in adjusted expenses reflected a $75 million increase in personnel costs due to higher variable compensation and nonqualified plan expense and a $38 million increase in professional fees associated with enterprise technology and other investments. These increases were partially offset by a $41 million reduction in other expenses due to lower operational losses during the quarter.\nAs a company, we have substantial opportunities to operate more efficiently and are committed to generating expense reductions. On the April earnings call, we discussed a strategic realignment within our Fixed Income Sales & Trading business, in which we discontinued certain market-making activities and services provided by middle market fixed income platforms that had an unattractive ROE. We also identified various expense reduction activities that had already been underway, including realigning our LightStream platform to our broader consumer business and ongoing capacity adjustments to market-sensitive businesses such as mortgage. We're actively working to identify and accelerate additional actions that could be implemented over the course of the next 12 to 18 months to generate cost reductions to reflect efficiency opportunities and changing conditions.\nThese actions include taking a much more aggressive approach towards FTE management, realigning and consolidating businesses to advance our long-term strategy, rationalizing our tech spend to drive more efficient and effective delivery and optimizing our operations in contact centers, which will help us transform Truist into a more effective and efficient company. Taken together, we believe these actions will increase our focus, double down on our core, simplify our business then the expense curve and enhance returns for our shareholders.\nMoving to Slide 13. Asset quality metrics reflected continued normalization during the second quarter. Nonperforming loans rose 11 basis points, primarily due to increases in our CRE and C&I portfolios, though they remain manageable at 47 basis points. While the increase in CRE nonperforming loans include some office, these loans are generally paying as agreed. Our net charge-off ratio was 54 basis points, inclusive of a 12 basis point impact from the [ sale ] of the student loan portfolio. Excluding the student loan sale, net charge-offs were 42 basis points, up 5 basis points sequentially. We would also note that the student loan sale had no impact on our provision expense this quarter as the charge-off taken in conjunction with the sale was essentially equal to the allowance on the portfolio. During the quarter, we also increased our ALLL ratio 6 basis points to 1.43% due to greater economic uncertainty. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, we have tightened credit and reduced our risk appetite in select areas, though we maintain our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality, long-term clients.\nNext, I'll provide more details on our CRE portfolio, which takes us to Slide 14. On June 30, CRE, including commercial construction, represented 8.9% of loans held for investment, while the Office segment comprised only 1.6%. We maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through multiple cycles. Our larger exposures tend to be associated with sponsors that have strong institutional ownership, and we have actively managed less strategic exposures out of the portfolio since the close of the merger.\nLooking at Office, in particular, the chart at the lower right provides a breakdown of our Office portfolio by tenant and class. Our office exposure tends to be weighted towards multi-tenant Class A properties that are situated within our footprint, all factors that we believe will drive outperformance. In addition, we have a strong CRE team that is highly proactive in working with clients to get ahead of the problems. During the second quarter, we completed a thorough review of the majority of our CRE office exposure. We considered current conditions and client support in our risk rating approach. As a result, a handful of loans were moved to nonaccrual, though the preponderance of the clients and exposure are paying as agreed. We believe our actions are prudent in light of current market dynamics and demonstrate our commitment to proactive and early identification and resolution of credit risk. While problem loans have increased in recent months, we believe overall issues will be manageable in light of our laddered maturity profile, conservative LTVs and reserves, which for office totaled 6.2% of loans held for investment.\nTurning to capital on Slide 15. As you can see from the capital waterfall, Truist is well capitalized and has significant flexibility to respond to potential changes in the risk and regulatory environment. Beginning on the left, CET1 capital increased 50 basis points to 9.6% at June 30. This was driven by organic capital generation and the completion of the sale of the 20% stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. I would also point out that at 9.6%, we're well above our new regulatory minimum of 7.4%, which takes effect on October 1. We expect to achieve an approximate 10% CET1 ratio by year-end through a combination of organic capital generation and disciplined management of RWA growth. This view does contemplate the headwind from the pending FDIC assessment.\nOn top of this, Truist has more than 200 basis points of additional flexibility given the residual 80% ownership stake in Truist Insurance Holdings. As we look beyond '23, we do expect regulatory and capital requirements become more stringent and potentially require us to deduct AOCI from our CET1 ratio. While the final form of any regulatory changes remains to be seen, Truist is well positioned to respond due to our strong organic capital generation and the likely phasing periods of any potential new requirement. Specifically, and as shown on the right-hand side of the slide, based on estimated cash flows and assuming today's forward curve, we would expect Truist AOCI to decline by 36% by the end of 2026. Assuming our current rate of organic capital generation remains constant, Truist should generate sufficient capital to offset the estimated remaining impact of AOCI on CET1 over this time period while maintaining the strategic capital flexibility with Truist Insurance Holdings.\nAnd now I will review our updated guidance on Slide 16. Looking into the third quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be down 4% due to seasonally lower insurance revenue and slightly lower loan balances, which will lead to continued pressure on net interest income, albeit at a slower pace relative to the decline we experienced in the second quarter. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to decline 0% to 1% and as seasonally lower insurance commissions and our efforts to bend the expense curve will offset several seasonal headwinds like marketing and employee benefits that should change the tailwinds in the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 1% to 2% compared to 2022. The decline from our previous outlook for 3% growth is primarily driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit betas, slower loan growth and lower investment banking revenue. Adjusted expenses are expected to increase 7%, which is at the upper end of our previously guided range due to continued investments in enterprise technology and other areas. This excludes the anticipated FDIC surcharge. This is a number that is higher than where we've been targeting, but as we've discussed, we are pursuing a number of actions to reduce costs. In terms of asset quality, our expectation is for the net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points, which includes the impact of the student loan sale. Finally, we expect an effective tax rate of 19% or 21% on a taxable equivalent basis.\nNow Bill, I'll hand it back to you for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So let's conclude on Slide 17. We're on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to provide strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers. Our strategic pivot from integrating to operating is well underway. And while the financial benefits of our pivot have been masked by the rapid increase in funding costs and related revenue pressure, we've made significant strategic progress over the past year and showing up in a number of operating metrics across our business.\nIn our Consumer Banking and Wealth segments, Retail and Small Business Banking net new checking production has been positive [ during past 5 quarters ], reflecting the success of Truist One and improved retention associated with our increasing client service metrics. Truist One also has many features that a field that millennials and Gen Z represent 70% of the new client applications. Our Wealth Trust and Brokerage business continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes have been [ positive 8 of the last 9 quarters ]. We've also steadily improved client satisfaction through the distinctive service provided by our branches and care agents as well as improvements to our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client [ journey rooms ]. As a result, our client satisfaction scores were stable to improving across most of our channels during the second quarter, but have been consistently rising over the past year since the integration.\nIn Corporate and Commercial, we continue to focus on left lead loan transactions and the synergies between our CIB and CCB businesses. During the first half of the year, 25% of the [ left lead ] transactions closed by Truist were with our CCB clients. We're also making inroads with new CCB clients as 65% of the CCB left leads I just mentioned were new relationships. In equity capital markets, transaction economics have improved approximately 300 basis points on average since the merger. And in wholesale payments, our pipeline is the highest it's been since the merger. Each of these data points reflect our increasing strategic relevance with our clients.\nIn addition, our IRM program, integrated relationship management is off to a great start this year as we've already delivered nearly 50% more IRM solutions year-to-date than during the same period a year ago. Our strong progress demonstrates what is possible post-integration when our teammates can focus their undivided attention on caring for their clients and deepening those relationships. However, just as we're shifting our focus from integrate to operate, the economic landscape shifted from favorable to more challenging. As a result, we too much shift and make tough decisions to fit the realities of today's economic environment and tomorrow's regulatory requirements. This means being more disciplined about where we choose to compete and deploy our capital, whether businesses, clients or products and looking deeper and more -- a more structural cost opportunities that exist at Truist. These opportunities exist, but not the primary focus during the integration period where the focus was on creating the best transition possible for clients and teammates.\nMike highlighted many of the specifics earlier while the details are critically important, what will ultimately matter to stakeholders as our absolute expense base and growth, and our teams are aligned internally on changing that trajectory. I'm really truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our unwavering foundation of purpose, our talented teammates, leadership in growth markets and diverse business model will continue to drive our momentum and fulfill our potential.\nSo Brad, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.\n\nBrad Milsaps\n\nAnalyst, Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP\n\nThank you, Bill. [indiscernible] , at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? [Operator Instructions]."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Ally, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's first quarter results, share their perspectives on current business conditions and recent events and provide an outlook -- updated outlook for 2023.\nClarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; John Howard, Truist Insurance Holdings' Chairman and CEO are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. I know you have a busy day ahead of you. The first quarter of 2023 was certainly an unusual and maybe even possibly a historic one for our banking industry. I am really extremely proud of our more than 50,000 teammates who leaned into our purpose and continue to care for our clients and stakeholders, reassuring them of Truist's position of strength and commitment to serve them.\nThroughout the quarter, we continue to experience the benefits of our shift from integrating to operating as evidenced by improved organic production and increasing client satisfaction scores, which in our branches ascended to new highs in the weeks after March 9. Faced with a volatile and uncertain environment, we successfully demonstrated the strength and resiliency of Truist's diverse business mix, scale and market share, granular and relationship-oriented deposit base and strong capital and liquidity. But as we will also discuss, some of that positive momentum was offset by some higher funding costs and somewhat elevated expenses.\nStrategically, we continue to take actions to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and at the same time, simplify, consolidate or exit certain activities to improve profitable growth. Mike will share some of those details later in the call. We'll provide more details on the quarter's results and other topical items throughout the presentation.\nBut first, let's begin with our purpose on Slides 4 and 5. And in uncertain times, it can be easy to focus on the short term at the expense of the long term, which is why it's important that we always lead with purpose at Truist. These slides are a powerful reminder that the most effective way to grow over the long term is to deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. But today, my comments will be on this topic a little briefer to gauge investor interest and other topics.\nOur purpose statement intentionally begins with the words Inspire. And that's exactly what I witnessed while working closely with our teammates in March. As I mentioned, I was inspired by how our teammates leaned into purpose and care as they held numerous discussions with clients and stakeholders to answer their questions about the banking system to emphasize Truist's financial position and strength and help them move forward with their financial needs.\nIn addition to client care we provided last month, there were many other ways we actualized our purpose throughout the quarter, which we highlight on Slide 5. You can read more about these items and many of our other efforts to build better lives and communities in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which we published last week.\nNow I'll walk through our first quarter performance highlights on Slide 7. Quarter performance slide focused mostly on GAAP or unadjusted results given that MOE-related spend exited our run rate last year. Going forward, we intend to focus primarily on GAAP results with the exceptions of adjusted tangible efficiency and adjusted PPNR since intangible amortization expense remained significant due to the scale of the MOE and has no impact on capital generation.\nTruist reported first quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $1.05 a share, up 6% like quarter due to strong growth and adjusted PPNR, lower merger cost, partially offset by a more normal provision level compared to a year ago. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, EPS decreased 13%, primarily due to lower net interest income and seasonality. Adjusted PPNR decreased 7% sequentially, consistent with our prior guidance as better-than-expected fee income due to higher capital markets activity was more than offset by lower net interest income and somewhat higher-than-expected expenses.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2022, adjusted PPNR grew 19%, and we delivered 310 basis points of positive adjusted operating leverage, reflecting a good start to the year. Asset quality remains strong and net charge-offs continue to normalize consistent with our expectations. We prudently built our ALLL ratio 3 basis points to reflect a more uncertain economic environment. Balance sheet trends, despite all the noise in mid-March, were fairly expected and more business as usual, and we'll cover more about loans, deposits, capital and liquidity later in the presentation.\nSo moving to our digital and technology update on Slide 8. Continued investments and progress in digital will be even more critical due to the close relationship between digital engagement, primacy of relationships and deposits. The good news is Truist prioritized digital early in the merger, building the truest digital experience organically and in the cloud, which allows us to fully own the digital experience for our clients end to end.\nOur first quarter results reflect our continued investments, agility and momentum. In the first quarter, we opened 146,000 deposit accounts digitally, exceeding our internal expectations. We saw a strong growth in digital transactions and Zelle, in particular, underscoring the importance of payments and money movement capabilities to our clients.\nMore broadly, we had an incredibly productive technology quarter as we advance our strategy to reimagine our capability set. In the deposit space, we launched a new data-driven deposit pricing engine, which provides personalized relationship-based rates for clients during account opening and will allow us to be even more targeted with respect to rate paid. We also enhanced our digital lending capabilities with the launch of our commercial loan dashboard, an industry-leading solution that allows wholesale lending clients to track the status of their loans, upload documents and eventually electronically signed documents.\nOur goal is to eventually incorporate this dashboard into 1 view, our desired end-state integrated digital experience across payments, lending and capital markets creating a seamless experience for commercial and corporate clients' entire relationship with Truist.\nSo turning to loans and leases on Slide 9. Loan growth was solid in portfolios targeted for growth and lower portfolios where we've intentionally pulled back. Average loan balances grew 1.7% sequentially, while end-of-period balances increased a more modest 50 basis points. The slower growth on an end-of-period basis was intentional and expected and reflects our strategic decision in the second half of last year to reduce production in certain lower-return portfolios, including indirect auto and correspondent mortgage, while also increasing rates and spreads from ongoing production.\nC&I balances increased 3.6% on an average basis and 1.8% on an end-of-period basis due to continued growth across CIB and CCB, reflecting the benefits of our capabilities and our markets. Consumer loan balances decreased 60 basis points on average and were down 1% from December 31, reflecting ongoing runoff in student and partnership lending as well as lower indirect auto production.\nStrategically, we're focusing our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships, while limiting our balance sheet usage with more single product and indirect clients. We're also evaluating ways to increase the velocity of our balance sheet, increasing greater utilization of loan sales and securitization. This allows us to be more impactful and increase returns in businesses such as Service Finance.\nNext, I'll provide some perspective on overall deposit trends starting on Slide 10. Despite the unique events of mid-March, average deposit trends during the first quarter were generally consistent with our expectations. Average deposit balance decreased 1.2%, driven by quantitative tightening inflation and movements to higher-rate alternatives. Within the month of March, more deposit flows were concentrated in the period from March 11 to March 18 and have largely been business as usual since, including through yesterday. Positive outflows during mid-March were primarily related to CIG and CCB clients, who chose to diversify in the money market mutual funds and in some cases, across multiple banks. These outflows tended to be a higher cost of nonoperational deposits.\nWe also experienced deposit inflows as we're both attracting new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients. Retail production continues to improve due to our shift from integrating to operating and leading with the value proposition of Truist One. In the first quarter, Truist saw record new deposit production, including 18% year-over-year uplift in branch account openings with improved client retention driving strong net new account performance. Commercial Community Banking had record new account growth in March, and we've seen good momentum in the first couple of weeks of April as clients are beginning to move money to fund those accounts.\nMore noteworthy than overall deposit flows was the pace of the mix shift from DDA as noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to 32% of deposits from 34% previously. This happened a little sooner than we previously anticipated. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points sequentially, contributing to a cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 36% so far in the cycle. Deposit betas accelerated relative to the fourth quarter due to the presence of higher rate alternatives and the previously mentioned shift from noninterest-bearing DDA into interest-bearing products.\nWe'll continue to be attentive to client needs and relationships, while maximizing the value outside of rate paid. Given higher investor interest and additional deposit details, we provided a closer look at our deposit base on Slide 11. Truist has one of the most robust deposit franchises in the banking industry, thanks to 3 key factors.\nFirst, Truist has strong market shares in many of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S. Truist is currently ranked first, second or third in deposit share in 17 of the top 20 markets. Those include cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, D.C., Miami, Tampa, Raleigh-Durham, among others, making us the dominant player in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.\nSecond, Truist has a granular retail leading deposit base that is 63% insured and/or collateralized, which is the second highest in our peer group and an important source of stability. In addition, our commercial deposits are diversified across 21 industry groups with no one sector representing more than 10% of corporate and commercial banking deposits.\nThird, we're highly relationship oriented, as you can see from the table at the bottom of the slide. The average deposit account at Truist has been open for 17 years, during which time these relationships have broadened to include multiple products and services.\nIn retail and small business banking, we have over 12 million deposit accounts with an average account balance of 17,000. [ RSPB ] deposits are highly granular, and 86% of balances are insured. In addition, Truist is the primary bank for the preponderance of those clients.\nIn our Wealth business, 90% of the depositors have investments with Truist Wealth and in our Commercial Community Bank, 81% depositors have a payments, lending or advisory relationship with Truist, with the majority of that related to operating treasury management products. Together, these factors are a source of strength for Truist and for our clients.\nSo now let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail.\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with net interest income on Slide 12. For the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 2.8% sequentially as higher funding costs and 2 fewer days in the quarter more than offset the effects of solid loan growth. Reported net interest margin decreased 8 basis points, while core net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. When you break down the decrease in the core net interest margin, approximately 5 basis points was driven by a shift in the funding mix from DDA and other low-cost deposit products into interest-bearing deposits and about 2 basis points was due to our decision to conservatively carry more liquidity during the last few weeks of March.\nMoving to fee income on Slide 13. Fee income was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter and modestly exceeded our expectations in light of typical seasonal headwinds. Insurance income increased $47 million, largely due to seasonality. Year-over-year organic revenue growth was 4.7%. Mortgage banking income rose $25 million, primarily due to a gain on sale of a servicing portfolio, which was partially offset by MSR valuation adjustments. Income from core mortgage activity was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter.\nWealth management income improved $15 million, benefiting from an increase in brokerage commissions, asset flows and higher fees due to rising asset prices during the quarter. Wealth continues to build momentum as net organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes, were approximately $1 billion for the quarter and have been positive for 7 of the last 8 quarters. In addition, we were pleased by the modest increase in investment banking and trading income, led by strength in investment grade and high-yield bond originations, fixed income derivatives and loan syndications.\nCIB's performance continues to be aided by 2 idiosyncratic factors, strategic hiring over the past 2 years as well as increased integrated relationship management activity. With respect to IRM, capital markets fees from non-CIB clients increased 12% sequentially and were 20% up from first quarter 2022. Other income decreased $56 million, primarily due to lower income from our nonqualified plan. While fee income remains below its potential, our investments in key areas, such as insurance, investment banking and wealth, will continue to be a source of momentum as markets normalize and as our IRM execution continues to mature.\nTurning now to Slide 14. Reported noninterest expense declined $31 million driven by a $107 million reduction in merger costs due to the completion of integration activities and a $27 million decrease in amortization expense. The expense reductions I just described were largely offset by $103 million or a 3% increase in adjusted noninterest expense. Expense drivers included a $39 million increase in pension expense and a $23 million increase in regulatory charges due to higher FDIC premiums. We also experienced a $33 million increase in operating losses, which are reflected in other expense due to industry check fraud issues and then operating loss within Truist Insurance recognized prior to completing our transaction with Stone Point.\nAs a company, we are committed to generating expense reductions and have undertaken a number of actions that help bend the expense arc at Truist. Last week, we announced a strategic realignment within our fixed income sales and trading business in which we discontinued certain market-making activities and services provided by our middle markets fixed income platform. This platform was largely focused on MBS-related sales and trading for depositories and had produced an unattractive ROE. This realignment will result in an approximate $50 million run rate expense save with little PPNR impact and enable us to focus more on our core strategy of being a fulsome and premier investment bank for corporates, sponsors and municipal issuers.\nWe're also in the process of realigning our LightStream platforms with our broader consumer business with the goal of bringing the innovation, digital capabilities, efficiencies and cloud-based infrastructure of LightStream to Truist's broader client base. This will reduce the cost of supporting a separate brand and strategy, enhance the experience and primacy with our existing and prospective clients. In addition, we continue to adjust our capacity and focus in mortgage to reflect current challenging market conditions and our own strategic focus on client primacy.\nThese actions, among others, are what drove the $63 million of restructuring charges during the quarter. Furthermore, we've also aligned executive compensation to Truist to shareholder expectations, which I shared with many of you about a month ago. Taken together, we believe these as well as other actions we're taking will increase our focus, bend our expense curve and improve returns for Truist.\nMoving to Slide 15. Asset quality remained strong in the first quarter, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio. Leading indicators remain favorable. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 15 basis points sequentially and were down 17 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Our NPL ratio was steady at a relatively benign 36 basis points. Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I and continued normalization in the consumer and are consistent with pre-pandemic levels.\nWe became even more cautious in our outlook regarding CRE fundamentals. And in light of increased economic uncertainty, we prudently increased our allowance by $102 million and increased our ALLL ratio by 3 basis points to 1.37%. In anticipation of an increasing risk environment, we are also tightening credit and reducing our risk appetite in selected areas, while maintaining our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality, long-term clients.\nNext, given high investor interest, I will dive deeper into CRE on Slide 16. As we began the integration process to become Truist, we were very intentional about retaining the diversification benefits of the merger. To achieve this outcome, we carefully evaluated our various portfolios, including CRE, to ensure we fully understood their combined risk profile and to establish how we would manage them going forward. While we did not wholly pause CRE production during this process, we did deemphasize it until we aligned on a single go-to-market strategy.\nAs a result of this decision, Truist CRE portfolio actually decreased by 2.2% from the end of 2019 to the end of 2022, whereas our median peer grew CRE 21%. Our disciplined focus on diversification has also resulted in less CRE concentration and risk relative to our peer group. At year-end, CRE represented 11% of our loan mix compared to 12% at our median peer and the office segment comprised 1.6% of our loan book versus 1.9% at our median peer.\nWe maintain a high-quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through the cycle. Our exposure tends to be large CRE with strong institutional sponsorship, and we have reduced our exposure to smaller CRE. The quality of our CRE portfolio is also reflected in the Federal Reserve's annual stress test results.\nOur disciplined approach to CRE is reflected in our asset quality metrics, which remain solid. In the lower right, you can see a snapshot of our office portfolio, which had approximately $5 billion in outstanding balances as of March 31 and another area where Truist has been risk averse and highly selective over the past 2 years. Our office portfolio tends to be weighted towards Class A properties within our footprint, which we believe will perform better than large urban markets.\nWe have a great CRE team that is very proactive in working with clients to get ahead of any problems. Criticized trends have increased over the past few months, but we believe overall problems will be manageable given our conservative LTVs, our reserves and the laddered maturity profile of the portfolio.\nTurning to capital and liquidity on Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.1% as approximately 20 basis points of organic capital generation was partially offset by 12 basis points of CECL phase-in. While not included in our CET1 ratio, AOCI improved by $1 billion from December 31 to March 31. Of our $12.6 billion of after-tax OCI, as of March 31, $8.5 billion is related to our AFS portfolio, $2.5 billion is related to the frozen portion of the HTM portfolio and $1.5 billion is related to our pension plan. We would expect the securities portfolio related OCI to decrease by $2 billion to $2.5 billion by the end of 2024 or by approximately 20%, and that's in a static rate environment.\nIn addition, this accretion will be a powerful driver of higher tangible book value per share over time, a small glimpse of which we saw this past quarter with tangible book value increasing 8%. On April 3, we also closed on the sale of a 20% minority stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which added approximately 30 basis points to our capital ratios and provides flexibility in the future. Additionally, we declared a strong common dividend of $0.52 per share, which was paid on March 1.\nFinally, Truist continues to have significant access to liquidity and a very robust liquidity managed process that includes internal and external stress testing as well as real-time monitoring of our liquidity position. Our average consolidated LCR improved 113% during the first quarter and remains well above the regulatory minimum of 100%. We have access to approximately $166 billion of liquidity, including cash, FHLB borrowing capacity, unpledged securities and discount window capacity. As a reminder, government and agency obligations represent 97% of our securities portfolio, which produces about $2.5 billion to $3 billion of cash flow per quarter.\nDuring the quarter, we conservatively increased our cash position from $16 billion as of December 31 to $33 billion at the end of March, funded largely by callable FHLB advances and would expect that to somewhat normalize going forward given that activity has stabilized. More broadly, we do expect regulatory requirements around capital and liquidity to heighten, but believe we're in a strong position to respond given the already high expectations for an institution of our size, the strategic and financial flexibility we have as a company in the orderly phase-in period that would likely accompany potential changes.\nNow I will review our updated guidance on Slide 18. Looking into the second quarter of 2023, we expect revenues to be relatively stable compared to the first quarter as a modest decline in NII is offset by seasonally stronger insurance revenue. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% linked quarter primarily as a result of higher incentive-based compensation from insurance revenue growth.\nFor the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The decline from our previous outlook is driven almost entirely by a lower net interest income outlook given higher deposit and funding costs. Adjusted expenses are still expected to increase between 5% and 7%. As I indicated earlier, we remain focused on taking actions throughout the year to reduce costs.\nExcluded from our adjusted expense outlook are 2 items. First, we are not including the impact of any potential incremental FDIC surcharge or assessment. After we receive clarity, we'll provide an update on estimated impact. Secondly, there will be some onetime costs occurring in 2023 and 2024 tied to preparing Truist Insurance Holdings to transition its operating model to be more independent, which is consistent with its new capital structure. These expenses directly correlate to realizing significant value in the business over time.\nWe will not adjust for these expenses in our results, but we will provide transparency. Our goal is still to produce positive operating leverage and positive adjusted PPNR growth for the full year, excluding these 2 items. The degree of difficulty has increased relative to January given higher funding costs. Our expectations for the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 basis points for the full year is unchanged.\nLastly, excluding discrete items, we now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20%, which translates to approximately 22% on a taxable equivalent basis due to our adoption of recent accounting guidance regarding the amortization of new market tax credits. This change simply shifts contra revenue and other income to the tax expense line and has no impact on the bottom line.\nNow I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, SunTrust Banks, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. So to conclude on Slide 19, Truist is on the right path. And I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to produce strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers.\nAs we began to shift from integrating to operating several quarters ago, we also made a strategic decision to focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and are most synergistic with our core strengths. Since that time, we focus on product solutions and distinctive experiences that are most relevant to our primary consumer and deposit households into our commercial, corporate and high net worth clients, while reducing our investment in businesses and clients that are less strategically relevant with respect to returns and relationship opportunities.\nWe believe these changes are consistent with where the banking industry is likely to go from here. We're already realizing the early benefits of this shift. For instance, first quarter net new consumer checking account production was among the best we've seen since becoming Truist. Driven by our continued focus on core deposit clients, the attractiveness of new products, including Truist One and improve retention as well as [ right to ] quality. Branch checking account production has increased 13% since the launch of Trust One and, as I said earlier, has accelerated up to 18% compared to a year ago in the first quarter.\nThe steady improvement we've seen in client satisfaction has been driven by the distinct service our branch and care agents provide as well as improvements in our digital processes and procedures that originated in our client [ journey rooms ]. As I indicated earlier, I'm really proud to care of our teammates -- care our teammates provided to our clients in March, and this is reflected in higher Voice of the Client scores during the last few weeks of the quarter.\nLastly, we continue to advance our integrated relationship management program by establishing long-term growth targets for our most strategic IRM partnerships, details of which I shared in December. Relative to the first quarter of last year, these strategic partnerships have grown revenues by 35%. At the same time, we acknowledge that the environment is tougher and strong balance sheet and expense management will remain critical for our stakeholders.\nIn closing, while uncertainty has increased, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix, dynamic markets, [ conservative culture ], balanced approach to interest rate risk management, strong profitability profile and our strong risk-adjusted capital position. I am truly optimistic about the future of Truist as our more than 50,000 talented teammates build on our momentum to create distinctive client experiences and deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities.\nSo with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this event is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire.\nDuring this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results and share their perspectives on our continued activation of Truist's purpose, current business conditions and our outlook for 2023. Clarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of our call.\nThe accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com. Our presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP. In addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.\nWith that, let me now turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nExecutive Chairman, CEO & President, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Ankur. And good morning, everybody, and Happy New Year. Thank you for joining our call today. Truist delivered a strong finish to a pivotal and purposeful year. We completed our final integration and decommissioning activities and incurred the final set of merger-related costs. Adjusted PPNR grew a strong 12% sequentially, ahead of our guidance and helped us deliver on our commitment for positive operating leverage for the full year. We'll cover the details on the quarter's results throughout the presentation, and we'll start with our purpose, the foundation of our company on Slide 4.\nTruist is a purpose-driven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Our purpose is the foundation for our success as a company that drives performance and defines how we do business every day.\nSlide 5 highlights many examples of how we activated our purpose in 2022. For our clients, our measurement is to provide distinctive, secure and successful experiences through touch and technology. We achieved a major milestone along that journey with the launch of Truist One Banking, our differentiated product suite that reimagines everyday banking and includes 2 new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities, and we're very encouraged by the positive reception they've received from new and existing clients alike.\nBased on August through December data, which reflects Truist One, branch checking production increased 10% from a year-ago period, and we achieved this result despite having around 400 fewer branches. The Truist One suite now also includes our new cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750, which launched in mid-December and expands our commitment to our clients and communities. Our ability to innovate at the intersection of touch and technology was greatly enhanced by the opening of our new Innovation and Technology center, which brings our cross-functional teams together with clients and large tech companies to reimagine banking experiences for everyone.\nWe've already realized the benefits of the ITC as Truist One Banking and the new digital and hybrid investment capabilities launched throughout the year were all co-created client -- with clients in our client journey rooms.\nWe also continued to deliver on our mission for our teammates. In October, we took a bold step to improve the lives of our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 an hour. In the 3 months since this took effect, we've experienced improved teammate recruitment, retention, lower turnover expenses, better execution and an all-around better client experience. We also enhanced our total rewards program to include an employee stock purchase program to further align our teammates' interest with those of our shareholders.\nAs a company that champions diversity, equity and inclusion, we achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles a year early with aspirations for further progress.\nFinally, Truist has made a significant impact on the communities we serve by meeting and, in some categories, exceeding our $60 billion community benefits plan, our first inspirational commitment as Truist and one that has served as a framework for similar plans across the industry. The execution of this plan was a testament to our purpose of building better lives and communities by elevating low and moderate income and minority communities through material support for affordable housing, nonprofit, small business and community development lending.\nIn summary, we're delivering on our purpose and the significance of what our teammates have accomplished is just outstanding. We'll continue to raise the bar, and I look forward to the year ahead as we actualize our purpose, advance integrated relationship management, positively impact clients and communities through continued investment in touch and technology and make Truist an even better place to work.\nNow turning to Slide 7. Selected items for the quarter totaled $170 million pretax and included our final charges related to the MOE. Now that our integration activities are complete, MOE costs will accent our run rate going forward. This is a positive development for shareholders that underscores our pivot to execution and will simplify our narrative, enhance earnings quality and improve capital generation.\nTurning to our fourth quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. Truist delivered strong fourth quarter earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.20 per share on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.30 per share, up 5% sequentially as strong PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision expense. Adjusted ROTCE was 30% and even excluding AOCI, was 20%. Both data points are very strong.\nNet interest income grew 7% to $4 billion, a new high for Truist, supported by strong loan growth and significant margin expansion resulted from higher short-term rates and well-controlled deposit costs. Fee income rebounded 6%, primarily due to insurance seasonality of full quarter of BenefitMall results and investment banking. Adjusted expenses increased sequentially, mostly as expected as the impacts of higher minimum wage, acquisitions and targeted investments were partially offset by the final leg of some of our cost-saving efforts. Together, these factors drove a 12% increase in adjusted PPNR exceeding our guidance.\nThis performance also resulted in 370 basis points of adjusted operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, our strongest operating leverage results for the year. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 54.2%, our best quarterly performance at Truist thus far. Asset quality remains strong, and the sequential increase in provision expense primarily reflects moderately slower economic assumptions. We also deployed 10 basis points of capital as a result of strong organic loan growth in the BankDirect acquisition. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile, and we remain confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios.\nTurning to our full year highlights on Slide 9. GAAP EPS was relatively stable year-over-year as significantly lower merger-related costs were offset by higher and more normal provision levels. Adjusted EPS declined 10% year-over-year, a solid 4.4% adjusted PPNR growth, was more than offset by the $1.6 billion increase in the loan loss provision expense. Importantly, however, we delivered 60 basis points of adjusted and 680 basis points of GAAP operating leverage for the full year, which was a primary metric to which we hold ourselves accountable to in 2022. This was our first year of operating leverage as Truist and it establishes a firm foundation, which -- from which we can accelerate as we head into 2023.\nTurning to Slide 10. Digital engagement rose steadily through 2022 as a result of changing client preferences and our improved agility as Truist. We experienced strong growth in digital transactions and Zelle, in particular, as transaction volume increased 42% since the beginning of the year. Zelle continues to represent an increasing percentage of our overall transaction mix and highlights the importance of continuing to invest in money movement capabilities.\nOur agility and responsiveness have improved tremendously since we've migrated to one digital platform built in the cloud, resulting in better client experiences. We delivered 3x as many production releases across retail business and wealth in 2022 as we did in 2021. And as a result, our mobile app was rated at an average of 4.7 stars on Android and iOS at year-end, up materially from a year ago.\nWe introduced many new digital capabilities and solutions to clients in 2022 from Truist One Banking, Truist Assist and expanded digital investment capabilities, some of which are highlighted on the right side of the slide. In 2023, our goal is to more fully activate those capabilities with our clients to improve acquisition, retention and reduce cost.\nIn addition to enhance digital capabilities for our clients, our digital and technology team successfully completed the largest bank merger in 15 years, decommissioned 3 data centers, successfully piloted a new deposit product on a next-gen real-time cloud-based core, enhanced credit decisioning and underwriting across certain consumer lending platforms and upgraded our contact center technology stack and completed a 5G network and branch WiFi pilot program. We have a great digital and technology team and they've been battle tested and have demonstrated incredible agility in responding to client needs during the integration period while also keeping their eyes on the future.\nTurning to loans and leases on Slide 11. Average loan balances increased a strong $11.3 billion or 3.6% sequentially, approximately 20% of which came from the BankDirect acquisition. The improved loan growth we've experienced in recent quarters reflects our shift to execution and Truist's greater competitiveness for clients due to our size and capabilities as well as broader industry trends.\nC&I grew $7.2 billion or 4.7% overall and increased 3.2%, excluding BankDirect, as balances increased across most CIB industry verticals and product groups and CCB. As in recent quarters, growth continues to be strong within our Asset Finance Group as we continue to build that business with more talent, product capabilities and a larger balance sheet. Macro trends such as supply chain management, infrastructure spending, inflation and choppy capital markets are also supporting growth here.\nCIB delivered growth across most industry verticals due to a combination of new client acquisition, up tiering our position with existing clients, acquisition activity and business-as-usual liquidity management.\nCommercial Community Bank C&I balances grew 3.7%, reflecting the strength of our markets and our team's focus on execution. Residential mortgage balances increased $3 billion or 5% sequentially due to previous correspondent channel production and lower prepayments. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased on an end-of-period basis, primarily reflecting continued runoff in our student loan portfolio as well as our decision to pivot away from lower-return portfolios such as prime auto. At the same time, we continue to invest in higher return consumer finance businesses, such as Service Finance, LightStream and Sheffield. Service Finance continues to grow and ended the year with over $3 billion worth of loans, ahead of the high expectations at the time of the acquisition.\nGoing forward, loan growth will moderate from the robust levels in 2022 as clients respond to the impact of higher rates, high inflation and a slowing economy. In addition, we also expect growth in residential mortgage and prime auto to continue to slow as we focus our capital on higher return opportunities. Truist remains well positioned to advise clients across a range of economic scenarios given our broad capability, talented teammates and increased capacity post integration.\nNow turning to deposits on Slide 12. Average deposit balances decreased 1.6% sequentially as effects of tighter monetary policy, inflation and higher rate alternatives continue to weigh on balances. Deposit costs remained well controlled, reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise and our strategy to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. During the fourth quarter, interest-bearing deposit costs increased 52 basis points, contributing to a cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta of 27%, thus far.\nAs the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to maintaining and managing deposit growth and rate paid given our broad access to alternative forms of funding. Our continued rollout of Truist One and ongoing investments in treasury and payments will be key areas of focus going forward as we look to acquire new and deepen existing relationships and maximize high-quality deposit growth.\nNow with that, let me turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin on Slide 13. For the fourth -- for the quarter, taxable equivalent net interest income rose a very strong 7% to $4 billion, primarily due to ongoing margin expansion and strong loan growth. Deposit costs were well controlled and reflect the strength of our deposit franchise.\nPurchase accounting accretion decreased $19 million and is expected to continue to gradually diminish. Reported net interest margin increased 13 basis points and core net interest margin improved 15 basis points as a result of higher short-term interest rates alongside well-controlled deposit costs. Overall, we maintain a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, maintaining modest upside to higher short-term interest rates while having some downside protection when and if interest rates begin to decline.\nMoving to Slide 14. Fee income rebounded during the quarter, increasing $125 million or 6% sequentially. The improvement was largely attributable to seasonality and insurance and the BenefitMall acquisition as well as higher investment banking and lending-related fee income. Insurance income increased $41 million, largely due to seasonality and a full quarter of BenefitMall results. Organic revenue for the full year grew 7% driven by a firm pricing environment, new business and strong retention.\nInvestment banking and trading income increased $35 million as higher investment banking fees and strong core trading results in the quarter were partially offset by negative impacts from CVA/DVA. For the full year, investment banking income declined 37%, which we believe compares favorably to overall industry fee performance as the partnership between CIB and other lines of business continues to grow and IRM momentum builds. Strategic hiring within CIB over the past 2 years has also led to improved lead table standards.\nFee income declined 4% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by declines in market-sensitive businesses such as investment banking, wealth and mortgage and partially offset by organic and inorganic growth in insurance. Overdraft fees also declined from approximately $150 million in 4Q '21 to approximately $120 million in 4Q '22 as a result of the actions we took last year to eliminate a host of overdraft-related fees and the continued introduction of Truist One Banking to new existing clients. We expect overdraft fees to decline another 40% as we move from year-end 2022 to year-end 2024. While fee income remains below its potential, we're optimistic that our investments in key areas such as insurance, investment banking and wealth will pay off as markets normalize and our IRM execution continues to progress.\nTurning to Slide 15. Reported noninterest expense increased $109 million or 3% sequentially. Merger and restructuring costs rose $18 million linked quarter and exceeded our October guide by $70 million due to higher-than-expected restructuring charges related to planned facility and branch reductions that will occur in 2023. These were business-as-usual decisions unrelated to the MOE and have solid financial returns.\nAs Bill indicated, we will have no more restructuring charges or incremental operating expenses related to the MOE going forward. We would anticipate restructuring costs related to prior acquisition activity and other BAU expense normal rationalization efforts. It is difficult to forecast these with accuracy but we would anticipate approximately $100 million to $125 million for 2023.\nAdjusted noninterest expense increased $68 million or 2% primarily due to the effects of our nonqualified plan. Excluding changes associated with the nonqualified plan, adjusted expense rose 0.6% sequentially, fairly consistent with our outlook from October.\nPersonnel expense increased $84 million, half of which was from changes in the nonqualified plan and half of which was from the recent increase in our minimum wage. These increases were partially offset by a $35 million decrease in marketing expense and a $28 million reduction in other expense. The decline in other expense was driven by lower operational losses, which have decreased for 2 consecutive quarters, as recent investments in talent, technology and process have begun to mitigate our fraud-related costs.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2021, adjusted noninterest expense grew by 8% as a result of the increase in minimum wage, investments in revenue-generating businesses, technology and acquisitions, higher call center staffing to support our clients post-merger and a normalizing T&E spend.\nFor the full year, adjusted expenses were $13.1 billion, up modestly from the $12.8 billion baseline in 2019. This performance is strong, reflecting the achievement of the $1.6 billion net cost save target. Overall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage. Below the line, our fourth quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 16.7%, down from 18.2% in the third quarter, primarily due to annual true-ups for state income tax returns.\nMoving to Slide 16. Asset quality is strong, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio. Net charge-offs increased 7 basis points to 34 basis points largely due to seasonality in indirect auto and lower recoveries. The allowance increased $172 million, reflecting strong loan growth and the ALLL ratio was stable at 1.34% as the effects of a moderately slower economic outlook were offset by high quality organic loan growth and the BankDirect acquisition. Excluding the BankDirect portfolio, which has extremely low losses through cycles, the ALLL ratio would have increased approximately 2 basis points.\nContinuing to Slide 17. Our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.1% to 9.0% as we deployed capital to support strong organic loan growth and closed the BankDirect acquisition. We also continue to pay a strong dividend at $0.52 per share. Overall, our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile. We expect organic capital generation to improve in 2023 due to the elimination of MOE-related costs and more focused loan growth, all of which will provide additional flexibility and opportunities for Truist.\nFinally, our liquidity position remains strong with an average LCR of 112% and access to multiple funding sources. Our securities portfolio remains high quality at 97% government guaranteed and continues to produce approximately $3 billion of cash flow per quarter, which has supported our loan growth.\nTurning to Slide 18 where I'll provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2023. Looking into 1Q '23, we expect revenues to decline 2% to 3% relative to 4Q 2022, primarily driven by 2 fewer days impacting net interest income in addition to typical seasonal patterns in investment banking, card and payments and service charges, amongst other factors. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% as higher pension expense and FDIC premiums, along with seasonally higher personnel expenses are partially offset by ongoing cost discipline.\nFor the full year 2023, we expect revenues to increase 7% to 9%, driven largely by strong net interest income growth and modestly improving fees. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 5% to 7% as a result of higher pension expense, higher FDIC premiums, the full annual impact of our minimum wage increase and acquisitions that closed throughout 2022. These 4 factors drive about 4% of our year-over-year increase.\nGiven these factors, we are targeting adjusted operating leverage to be 200 basis points or greater, which would be more than 3x our pace in 2022. We also expect the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 and 50 basis points in 2023, given our expectations for continued normalization across the loan portfolio. Lastly, excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 19%, which translates to approximately 21% if you model it on a taxable equivalent basis.\nNow I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nExecutive Chairman, CEO & President, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Mike. Continuing on Slide 19. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a year that was strategic and financial turning point for Truist. The pivot from integrating to operating is real, it's palpable and it can be evidenced across a number of dimensions. Loan production in the fourth quarter was near the highest it's been at Truist. This is despite some intentional reductions in certain consumer categories. Commercial Community Bank loan and deposit production in both the fourth quarter and full year was the strongest we've had at Truist. Importantly, left lead relationships within CCB were up 36% in 2022, reflecting our increased strategic relevance and advisory capabilities with clients.\nBranch deposit and checking unit production in the fourth quarter increased 24% and 8%, respectively, compared to the year-ago quarter as teammates became more confident with processes and systems, but also improved solutions and capabilities. Our wealth line of business has had 3 consecutive quarters of adding net new advisers, and organic asset flows continue to be positive. Integrated relationship management activity across the company gained momentum throughout the year as a result of more focus, increased alignment and improved reporting as we ended the year with a 16% increase in qualified referral activity, excluding mortgage relative to 2021.\nAverage client satisfaction scores for retail and small business banking are ascending and in the fourth quarter reached their highest levels for the year in key areas that include our branches, call centers, retail digital experiences and small business. Our digital app ratings ended the year as one of the leaders in our peer group after starting near the bottom. The financial benefits of this momentum can be seen with the fourth quarter operating leverage being the strongest of the year and adjusted PPNR building each quarter.\nSo to conclude on Slide 20, our fourth quarter results reaffirm that Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential to summarize on our investment thesis. Our goal financially is to produce strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers.\n2023 will be our first full year as Truist with zero integration activity, and our priorities are very clear. Core execution to actualize Truist and our purpose, harvesting IRM opportunities, continuing to digitize and automate our processes and operations and maintaining a strong profitability profile. We'll also raise the bar on ourselves, focusing on the KPIs that drive total shareholder return and ensuring executive compensation targets reflects our potential, not just our business mix.\nWhile economic uncertainty remains high, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix, conservative credit culture, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, strong profitability profile and our strong risk-adjusted capital position and most notably, our significant performance momentum as we continue to shift from integration to executional excellence and purposeful growth.\nAnkur, let me turn it back over to you and begin the Q&A.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Bill. Jess, at this time, if you would explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. As you do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today."

Please go ahead.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Jake, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Mike Maguire. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's third quarter results and share their perspectives on our efforts to transition from an integration focus to an operating focus, current business conditions and our continued activation of Truist's purpose.\nClarke Starnes, our Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call.\nThe accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nIn addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nExecutive Chairman, CEO & President, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter reflected strong progress in many areas overall. However, financial performance was mixed, reflecting continued challenging market conditions. Strong spread income resulted from significant margin expansion that exceeded our guidance and strong broad-based loan growth. Credit quality remains excellent. At the same time, capital markets revenue did not rebound as anticipated, and in fact, declined linked quarter.\nStrategically, we continue to realize the benefits of shifting from integrating to operating, which I'll share more on later. I acknowledge that operating losses continue to be too high. However, other expense growth reflects targeted investments in talented technology in key areas of long-term sustainable growth. Merger calls diminished again, and our remaining decommissioning activities are mostly complete and will be finalized by year-end. We'll share details on each of these themes throughout the call.\nAnd turning to our purpose on Slide 4. Truist is a purpose-driven company that's dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities. This commitment to purpose and our value of care could not have been more apparent in how our teammates responded to each other and their clients in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. I experienced this firsthand when I visited with our teams in Southwest Florida soon after the storm subsided. Clients expressed their significant appreciation that we opened our branches to care for them during this time of loss. The many truckloads of food, water, supplies and other critical items that we sent to the region made a real difference. And the $1.25 million donation from the Truist Foundation will continue to provide support to affected areas in Florida and South Carolina.\nThe rebuilding process has only begun, and Truist is committed to supporting these communities in the short term, but also helping them be more resilient in the long term. And this is one of the many ways we're living our purpose, as you can see on Slide 5. In order to inspire, it's often necessary to be bold and to be first, and that's exactly what we did on October 1. We made a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 per hour. The new minimum wage benefits approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom are in client-facing roles. We strongly believe this action will drive purposeful growth and offset the estimated $200 million increase in annual personnel expense through improved teammate recruitment and retention, lower turnover expense, better execution and an all-around better client experience. In fact, we're already starting to see the benefits of the higher minimum wage. Teller turnover in August and September was down about 25% compared to the first 7 months of the year, and our branch vacancy rate has been cut in half since July.\nWe also advanced our commitment to inspire with the launch of Truist One Banking in July. Truist One is our differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking, including 2 new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has $0 overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative balance buffer. We also introduced the Truist Confidence Account, which provides consumers access to mainstream banking services and no overdraft fees. These accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and have been embraced by new and existing clients. Since their launch, overall branch deposit production has increased 13% in August and September compared to the prior year despite having 16% fewer branches.\nWe're also in the process of rolling out our cash reserve deposit base credit line up to $750. We began a pilot earlier this month and expect the cash reserve feature to be available across our footprint later this quarter.\nNow turning to Slide 7. Merger costs totaled $152 million, down 30% sequentially and 58% year-over-year as our integration activities wind down. The final merger costs expected in the fourth quarter are primarily related to our decommissioning efforts, which, as I mentioned, will conclude by year-end. The completion of merger activities is a monumental move forward that will reflect a seamless client experience, simplify our narrative, enhance our earnings quality, improve capital and help us realize industry-leading returns.\nTurning to our third quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.15 per share on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.7 billion or $1.24 per share, up 3% sequentially as 5% adjusted PPNR growth was partially offset by higher provision as a result of our higher consumer net charge-offs.\nNet interest income grew 10% to a post-merger high, benefiting from higher short-term rates and well-controlled deposit costs, all of which drove significant margin expansion as well as strong broad-based loan growth. Despite solid forward progress, the pace of PPNR growth was weaker than we had anticipated, primarily due to ongoing pressure in investment banking as well as unfavorable valuation marks taken at quarter end.\nAdjusted expenses increased 2.6% linked quarter mostly as expected, however, operational losses remain elevated. While we made a purposeful decision to proactively refund our clients for fraud losses, our overall goal is to reduce them significantly to improve our results and the client experience. This is an industry-wide phenomenon. Part of our technology spend is directly related to this effort. These investments include efforts to enhance identity authentication and fraud detection, among others.\nAdjusted operating leverage was a strong 260 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting strong net interest income growth, combined with modest expense growth. This momentum has helped us close the gap towards our goal of positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality remains excellent, notwithstanding normalizing trends and a seasonal uptick and net charge-offs within our consumer portfolios.\nWe deployed 10 basis points of capital to support strong loan growth and complete the BenefitMall acquisition, which expands our capabilities and fills a strategic gap in our wholesale insurance business. Our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile, and we're confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios.\nNow turning to Slide 9. Digital activity continues to increase from the first quarter levels, reflecting strong momentum post integration. This progress reflects our significantly improved agility and responsiveness from being on one digital platform. Year-to-date, we've delivered 3x more production releases across business, retail and wealth than in all of 2021. Client satisfaction with their digital experience has also improved rapidly each quarter.\nConsistent with our pivot from integrating to operating, our technology and digital teams are allocating more of their time, energy and resources to transformation and innovation. To that end, we recently launched Truist Assist to our retail and wealth clients through our mobile and online banking platforms. Truist Assist is our AI-enhanced virtual assistant that leverages natural language processing and natural language understanding to interact and respond to client questions. Through September 30, Truist Assist had been deployed to our personal banking clients and had been utilized by 114,000 unique clients to handle 147,000 interactions that otherwise might have occurred in a branch or contact center.\nWe're also expanding LightStream, both by enhancing the sophistication of its underwriting models through artificial intelligence and by piloting a new savings product to broaden its capability set. In addition, the recent acquisition of the Arena platform from software start-up Zaloni, will help accelerate our data journey through the development of a stronger integrated data infrastructure solution deployed in a hybrid cloud environment. As a result, our data quality, analytics and speed to market will all significantly improve. Overall, I'm highly optimistic about the potential of our increased investments and capabilities to enhance performance and client experience.\nNow turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Loan growth was strong and broad-based for the second consecutive quarter. Average balances grew $13 billion or 4.3% sequentially in part due to our shift from integrating to operating. C&I remains strong as average balances grew $7 billion or 4.5%. C&I loans grew across most CIB industry verticals and product groups, reflecting higher revolver utilization, the current shift to banks from the bond market and our increased competitiveness for new and existing clients. Revolver utilization increased just over 100 basis points to approximately 31%, the highest level since the second quarter of 2020.\nIn our Commercial Community Bank, C&I balances, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan increased 1.3%, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. We achieved growth across almost all of our CCB regions.\nResidential mortgage balances increased $4 billion or 8.2%, reflecting previous correspondent mortgage production and slower prepayment speeds. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased 3.1%. A strong growth in prime auto, service finance, LightStream, recreational lending and Sheffield, more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios.\nProduction in our consumer finance business is up 20% year-over-year, reflecting good business development momentum with Service Finance, abating inventory shortages within Sheffield and RAC and improved automated decisioning capabilities across the board, which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency and creates better client experiences. Near term, our loan growth outlook remains healthy as our pipelines are relatively strong and teammates continue to shift their capacity from integrating to operating and take advantage of new tools in their tool kit.\nOver the medium term, loan growth may moderate as clients absorb and digest the impact of higher rates, higher inflation and slowing growth. We also expect growth in residential mortgage and prime auto to slow going forward as we shift our capital towards higher-return opportunities.\nTruist continues to remain well-positioned to advise clients across a broad range of economic scenarios, given our capabilities, talented teammates and increased capacity post integration.\nNow turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposits decreased $3.7 billion or just under 1% in the third quarter, driven by tightening monetary policy, reduced savings in response to higher inflation and seasonal patterns. Deposit costs were very well-controlled, reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial franchise and our enviable market share position. In addition, our lines of business and corporate treasury teams continued to deliver excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing cumulative deposit betas have been 21% thus far, well below our modeled assumptions.\nAs the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid, particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding.\nBefore I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to acknowledge and thank Daryl Bible. He has built a best-in-class finance function. He played a key essential role in the success of our merger, and he's really been incredibly supportive in helping Mike transition into the CFO role. Many of you in the investment community know Daryl well, and appreciate his knowledge and transparency, which will continue to be hallmarks of Truist going forward.\nI'm also excited to introduce Mike Maguire as our new CFO. Most recently, Mike led Truist Consumer Finance and Payments businesses including LightStream, Service Finance, Sheffield and auto finance. He was also responsible for our enterprise payment strategy group and wholesale payments businesses, including treasury solutions, merchant services and commercial card. Mike is a strategic thinker, a purpose-driven leader with an exceptional depth of experience across our enterprise and a deep understanding of how technology is shaping our operating environment. He's truly an industry thought leader in the fintech space. We'll certainly draw on this experience as Mike assumes his new role during this time of exciting transformation.\nSo Mike, with that, I'm going to turn it over to you.\n\nMichael Baron Maguire\n\nSenior EVP, CFO and Chief Consumer Finance & Payments Officer, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would also like to thank Daryl for his guidance and his support throughout my transition into the CFO role. I'm excited about the opportunity, and I'm confident that the transition will be seamless for all of our stakeholders. I also want to thank my teammates in the finance organization for welcoming me and for their support. We have a really talented team, and I look forward to working with all of them.\nFor our analysts and investors, I'll be on the road soon, and hope to meet as many of you as possible. This is really a great opportunity, and I'm excited about helping take Truist to new heights.\nSo moving to Slide 12. For the quarter, net interest income increased 10% sequentially to $3.8 billion as higher short-term interest rates and strong loan growth more than offset lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest income was up a strong 14%. Deposit costs remain well-controlled, reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise. Lower purchase accounting accretion was the result of elevated accretion in previous periods due to conversion activity and slowing prepays in the current period.\nReported net interest margin increased 23 basis points, while core net interest margin increased 30 basis points, driven by similar trends as net interest income.\nMoving to Slide 13. Fee income decreased $146 million or 6.5% sequentially. Insurance income decreased $100 million primarily due to seasonally lower property and casualty commissions. Investment banking and trading income decreased $33 million as lower fees from structured real estate, investment-grade and high-yield bonds and syndicated and leveraged finance were partially offset by increased M&A fees. Wider credit spreads, tightening liquidity and general macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty are all contributing to slower activity levels.\nDespite these current headwinds, we continue to make strong strategic progress within corporate and investment banking. Capital markets revenue from noncorporate and investment banking clients is up 25% year-over-year as our Commercial Community Bank, commercial real estate and wealth teammates continue to learn how to successfully partner with CIB to deliver strategic advice to our clients. Our lead table position has improved across most products, including equity capital markets, high yield, investment grade and syndicated and leveraged finance.\nGiven the strategic progress, we intend to continue to take advantage of the challenging environment to invest in Truist Securities by selectively adding talent to drive long-term share gains as we've successfully done during previous market disruptions.\nOther income, excluding impacts from our nonqualified plan, decreased $17 million linked quarter, primarily due to valuation-related marks. Compared to a year ago, other income decreased $81 million as a result of lower investment income and valuation marks on SBIC-related and other strategic investments.\nTurning to Slide 14. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $83 million or 2.6% sequentially, reflecting forward-focused investments in talent and technology as well as elevated operational losses. Professional fees and outside processing expense increased $34 million on an adjusted basis as we advanced critical projects, including investments in cybersecurity, contact center modernization, fraud detection and the build-out of our in-house payments capabilities. Other expense increased $28 million, primarily due to higher operational losses.\nPersonnel expense increased $23 million on an adjusted basis, reflecting strategic and purposeful additions in technology, Commercial Community Banking, CIB, consumer finance and wealth as well as the BenefitMall acquisition.\nCompared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense only increased 2%. This modest increase was driven by higher operational losses and investment spend, which were partially offset by merger-related cost savings in software and net occupancy expense.\nOverall, we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longer-term investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage. As an example, we believe recent technology investments to enhance identity authentication, fraud detection, among other factors, will mitigate operational losses. Also, with the conversion behind us, we have additional flexibility to rationalize certain businesses such as mortgage, where capacity exceeds demand. Lastly, we have our final leg of data center-related technology savings that is expected to materialize throughout the fourth quarter.\nBelow the line, our third quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of 18.2% down from 19.5% in the second quarter primarily due to discrete tax benefits arising from final true-ups to our 2021 tax return. We continue to expect a normal effective tax rate to be 20%, which translates to 21% on a fully taxable equivalent basis.\nMoving to Slide 15. Asset quality continues to be excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio. Leading credit indicators remain strong. Nonperforming loans decreased 1 basis point and loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 7 basis points. Net charge-offs remained benign at 27 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily due to normalizing trends and seasonality in certain consumer portfolios.\nOur total allowance increased $18 million to support our loan growth, and the ALLL ratio decreased 4 basis points due to strong portfolio performance and growth in higher-quality loans, partially offset by a moderately slower economic outlook.\nMoving on to Slide 16. Our CET1 ratio decreased from 9.2% to 9.1% as we deployed capital to support strong loan growth and to complete the BenefitMall acquisition. We also increased the dividend 8% to $0.52 per share beginning in the third quarter, reflecting our confidence in our improving earnings trajectory. Overall, our capital position remains strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, and we maintain a strong liquidity position with access to multiple sources of funding for incremental loan growth.\nTurning now to Slide 17. I'll next outline the strategic rationale and financial impact of 2 recently announced insurance acquisitions. First, BenefitMall closed on September 1, providing a scaled entry into wholesale employee benefits and filling one of the remaining strategic gaps in our capability set. BenefitMall is expected to add $160 million of annual revenue at an initial EBITDA margin in the mid-20% that will build to the mid-30% over time as synergies are realized.\nThe transaction also has potential earned benefits within Truist Insurance by supporting our brokers at McGriff, our retail insurance business and also outside Truist Insurance with our corporate and commercial clients.\nWe also recently announced the acquisition of BankDirect Capital Finance. Strategically, BankDirect effectively doubles our premium finance business, broadens our capabilities to include life insurance and expands our West Coast presence. Pro forma, we estimate Truist Insurance Holdings will be the #2 premium finance player in the market after this deal closes later this quarter. BankDirect brings with it a $3.2 billion loan portfolio with strong projected growth, attractive profitability, limited credit risk and short duration. While both acquisitions are expected to be dilutive initially, we believe they are strategic and financially attractive over the long run.\nSo I'll now provide new guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a mid double-digit basis point increase in both our core and reported net interest margin due to benefits from the recent rate hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in November. Fees will rebound sequentially, driven by insurance income improving due to seasonality, solid organic growth and the full impact of the BenefitMall acquisition. The extent to which investment banking fees improve will be dictated by levels of capital markets activity.\nAdjusted expenses are anticipated to increase approximately 1% as the increase to minimum wage, investments and revenue-producing businesses and technology and acquisitions are partially offset by the impacts of cost savings.\nPutting these pieces all together, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow approximately 10% with some upside based on the realization of investment banking pipelines. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter expectations, we are on track to achieve positive operating leverage for the full year.\nWe remain consistent with our expectations that the net charge-off ratio will be between 25 and 35 basis points for the full year due to our performance year-to-date and normalizing trends across our loan portfolio.\nWith that, I will turn it back to Bill to conclude.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nExecutive Chairman, CEO & President, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nGreat. Thank you, Mike. Continuing to our strategic shift on Slide 18. Earlier this year, I expressed my view that the first quarter was a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our third quarter results build upon the second quarter progress even as market conditions diminished overall PPNR trajectory, progress is real and it's palpable. We've made significant progress in our digital and technology areas as evidenced by improving mobile app ratings and enhanced client experience within treasury and payments and many other new features and capabilities that strengthen the financial confidence of our clients.\nSpeed to answer in our care centers is now well below our initial service level agreements and more investment will improve the efficiency as well. Loan production in the third quarter was the highest it's been at Truist, up 8% compared to the second quarter. Branch loan and deposit production are up a solid 14% and 20% like quarter, respectively, as teammates become more confident with processes and systems, but also improve solutions and capabilities.\nIRM referrals to our wealth businesses increased 17% sequentially and the amount of income generated from IRM referrals by our Commercial Community Bank was the second highest ever, both highlighting the power of our advice-driven and client-centric model. Our brand awareness was up almost 400 basis points in the third quarter while our peers were flat to down. And our brand consideration which measures whether consumers are giving Truist a serious thought was 210 basis points and ranks us fifth highest in our markets, having only been alive for that brand for 3 years. Almost all of our client satisfaction scores are ascending and, in many cases, at their highest levels since we become Truist. The financial benefits of this momentum are being realized and will be increasingly visible as market conditions normalize and merger-related expense noise abates.\nTo conclude, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant post-integration potential, which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis on Slide 19. Strategically, we have shifted from execution to execution, transformation and growth. We're investing in digital and technology as we reduce cost, including operational losses. We're simplifying our processes and operations, and we're acting on our purpose each and every day with a singular goal of improving our client experience. We're also intensely focused on capturing the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as it's squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts in activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital, just execution and focus, both of which lie within our sphere of control.\nExternally, while we believe the economy is generally healthy, persistent high inflation and a rapid tightening of monetary policy, combined with geopolitical tensions, have reduced visibility and increased uncertainty as we move into 2023.\nTruist is nevertheless well-positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice-oriented model for clients, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix and our strong capital position relative to our risk profile and our significant performance momentum as we continue the shift from integration to execution and growth.\nAnkur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Bill. Jake, at this time, if you don't mind, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? (Operator Instructions)"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this event is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's second quarter results and share their perspectives on our efforts to transition from an integration focus to an operating focus, current business conditions and our continued activation of Truist's purpose.\nClarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call.\nThe accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist Investor Relations website, ir.truist.com.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures.

The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nExecutive Chairman, CEO & President, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning.\nTruist delivered a good second quarter, reflecting our improving momentum after the integration and the resiliency of our diverse business mix in a volatile market environment. Our financial results modestly exceeded the guidance we provided in April with several puts and takes.\nLoan growth was strong and broad-based. Net interest margin expanded significantly due to higher interest rates in our strong deposit franchise. Credit quality remains excellent and we are pleased by our relative and absolute performance in the recent stress test. In light of these results, our Board will consider a resolution to increase the common dividend by 8% at its July meeting.\nThis quarter's performance, combined with improving client experience trends and dramatically lower merger costs, reflects the initial benefits of our shift from integrating to operating. While there's still work to do, such as stemming elevated operational losses, closing out residual integration issues and completing our decommissioning process, I am very confident in Truist's trajectory and reaffirm our commitment to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year of 2022. I'm going to share some more details on those topics in a moment.\nThen going to Slide 4. As you all know, Truist is fundamentally a deep, purpose-led company dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities. We know that our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose drives performance and defines how we do business every day. It very intentionally begins with the word inspire, and to be inspirational, it's often necessary to be bold and to be first. I'll highlight 4 examples that I think reflect that purpose on the next slide.\nFirst and foremost, we recently announced that we're making a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to $22 an hour effective October 1. This increase will benefit approximately 14,000 teammates, about 80% of whom will have client-facing roles in the retail and small business banking business. Purposeful growth is dependent on attracting and retaining the best talent. In addition to our industry-leading benefits, we designed a compensation program that also helps teammates who need it most to block the impact of inflation in their daily lives.\nSecond, we had a historic launch of Truist One Banking yesterday. This is our new differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking, including 2 new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit. The flagship Truist One checking account has 0 overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple $100 negative balance buffer.\nWe also introduced the Truist Confidence Account, which provides consumers with access to main street banking services and no overdraft fees.\nWe're mindful of the impact that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on some of our clients, and Truist One is one of many examples of how we're advancing financial inclusion across our communities.\nThird, Truist committed $120 million to strengthen and support diverse and small businesses. This commitment exemplifies our purpose by supporting small businesses, which are so vital to the health and vibrancy of our communities.\nAnd fourth, we released our 2021 ESG and CSR report in early June. At Truist, we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our company and to put our purpose into action, and that includes climate change.\nAs we look to externalize our own net 0 aspirations and further the transition to a lower carbon economy, we recently created new advisory practices within our CIB and commercial community bank to help our clients make their own transition. We're pleased with how our clients have welcomed and embraced our advice and expertise around ESG as it underscores the possibilities in viewing ESG as an opportunity for growth.\nNow turning to Slide 7. Consistent with our previous guidance, merger-related costs totaled $238 million, roughly half of what they were in the first quarter. We expect merger costs to decrease significantly in the back half of 2022 before going away entirely in 2023. This trajectory should be welcomed news to shareholders as diminishing merger costs correspond to a less complex narrative, improving earnings quality, more capital and, ultimately, industry-leading returns.\nLastly, we incurred a $39 million pretax gain related to the early extinguishment of $800 million in FHLB debt.\nTurning to our second quarter performance highlights on the next slide. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.09 a share on a reported basis. Excluding the selected items on Slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.20 a share, down 23% compared to a year 8:07 AM ago, primarily due to a sizable reserve release in the prior quarter.\nRelative to the first quarter, adjusted EPS decreased 2% as higher loan loss provision offset a 10% increase in adjusted PPNR.\nAdjusted revenue benefited from higher short-term rates alongside well-controlled deposit costs, strong loan growth, consumer seasonality and strong insurance results, partially offset by continued softness in market-sensitive fee businesses such as investment banking, wealth and mortgage.\nAdjusted ROTCE was 25%, up from 23% in the prior 3 quarters. Even when normalizing things like AOCI to 0 and assuming a flat ALLL ratio, adjusted ROTC was a strong 17%.\nAdjusted expenses increased 3.8%, reflecting higher insurance-related incentive compensation and intentional investments in talent and technology to support our shift from integrating to operating.\nOther expenses also increased due to normalization of teammate travel and elevated operational losses.\nWe have planned products, processes and technology enhancements underway to reduce these losses and enhance the overall client experience, including the launch of innovative authentication approaches later this quarter.\nWhile operating leverage was a negative 200 basis points year-to-date, this primarily reflects the $435 million year-to-date headwind we have from PPP and PAA revenue. Despite these headwinds, we're still targeting positive operating leverage on both a GAAP and adjusted basis for the full year.\nAsset quality remains excellent and net charge-offs decreased relative to the first quarter. Capital deployment was healthy in the second quarter as we funded strong loan growth and completed $150 million worth of share repurchases. Capital levels remain strong in light of our risk and profitability profile, demonstrated by our continued strong performance in the 2022 CCAR process. Overall, the second quarter begins to reflect the power of Truist post integration.\nNow turning to Slide 9. Digital activity increased in the second quarter, attributable to seasonality and nearly 200 enhancements we implemented across the platform, representing a significantly higher pace of value delivery for our clients. Our ability to rapidly incorporate client feedback reflects the capabilities of a more modern and agile digital platform and has resulted in improved client satisfaction scores, which have risen consistently since our initial introduction of Truist Digital in waves in 2021.\nIn June, we announced the grand opening of our state-of-the-art Innovation and Technology Center. Located within our headquarters, the ITC provides an environment conducive to reimagining the client experience such as by facilitating new ways of working with Agile teams to better collaborate with clients to cocreate dynamic and marketable cross-channel services. The new space features client journey rooms; a maker space for building, testing and refining new products and services; a reality lab, where we can utilize virtual and augmented reality technology; and a contact center incubator where we can collect and respond to real-time feedback directly from our clients. I'm personally excited about our improved ability to aid our teammates as they reimagine how we serve clients.\nWe also acquired 8San Francisco-based Long Game, the award-winning gamification app that utilizes behavioral economics, prize-linked savings and mobile gaming to motivate positive financial behaviors and drive new account growth and client retention. By leveraging Long Game's innovative technology, Truist can empower our clients to build long-term financial wellness.\nI'm also pleased to report that our merger integration activities are now complete. Our final merger release was rolled out in May and we recently held our last Merger Oversight Committee meeting. As we shift to BAU, our digital and technology teams are looking forward to accelerating our pace of innovation and client experience improvements.\nYesterday, as I mentioned, we introduced Truist One. And as I referenced earlier -- as I referenced earlier, we'll soon expand LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time, cloud-based core; enhance the sophistication of our underwriting models through a partnership with [Zest]; roll out Truist Assist, our virtual assistant to millions of clients, just to name a few examples. Overall, we're increasingly optimistic about the performance and the potential of our increased investments and focus on digital and technology.\nNow turning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Average loan balances increased a very robust $8.1 billion or 2.8% sequentially with growth across most businesses. The pace of growth accelerated during the quarter with end-of-period loans up 4.7%. Growth was primarily driven by C&I, where average balances increased $6.7 billion or 4.8% overall. We delivered broad-based loan growth across most CIB industry verticals, notably energy, consumer and retail, financial institutions, TMT. Due to M&A activity, the current shift to banks from the bond market increased relevance with new and existing clients and a higher revolver usage for CapEx, inventories and inflation. As in recent quarters, growth continues to be strong within our Asset Finance group as we continue to build out that business with more talent, product capabilities and a larger balance sheet.\nCommercial Community Bank C&I balances increased 2%, excluding PPP and dealer floor plan, reflecting growth across all our geographic regions and was the second strongest end-of-period growth since 2019. Revolver utilization increased 300 basis points to just over 30%, the highest level since mid-2020.\nCRE remains a headwind, reflecting both the highly competitive market and our disciplined approach. At the same time though, I continue to be optimistic about the future of our CRE business as we create a more strategic -- as we create more strategic clarity internally and nonbank competition rationalizes somewhat with rising rates.\nWealth lending was up $600 million sequentially as our advisers and clients continue to benefit from the combined capabilities of both heritage firms.\nResidential mortgage increased 2.6%, reflecting ongoing correspondent purchases and slower prepayments fees. Excluding mortgage, consumer and card balances increased $1 billion or 1.3% as strong growth in Service Finance, prime auto, Sheffield and LightStream more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios.\nService Finance is performing in line with our high expectations and experiencing good business-developed momentum given the alignment with Truist. Second quarter production by Service Finance was about double the volume loss and double the profitability from our terminated partnerships.\nOur prime auto business is also back on its front foot after regaining some momentum it lost following its own fourth quarter conversion.\nIn addition, our consumer finance businesses continue to advance their automated decision capabilities, which ultimately improves consistency, efficiency and creates better client experiences.\nOverall, clients are generally positive on current economic conditions and demand in their businesses. At the same time, concerns about labor shortages and margin pressure, given the rising rates and higher input costs, are growing, creating the potential for more defensive postures. Truist is well positioned to advise clients across a range of scenarios given our broad capabilities and talented teammates.\nGiven all of this, we remain generally positive about our prospects for continued loan growth, particularly taking into account our post-integration momentum. At the same time, we have to acknowledge the increased uncertainty associated with the softening economic environment, which may cause loan growth to deviate from this outlook.\nTurning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposit balances increased $8.5 billion or 2% during the second quarter largely attributable to an increase in brokered deposits in mid-March. Excluding brokered deposits, average deposits decreased $2.9 billion or 0.7%.\nDeposit costs were very well controlled, reflecting Truist's strong retail and commercial-oriented franchise and our enviable market share position. In addition, our lines of business and corporate treasury teams delivered excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid. As a result, interest-bearing client deposit betas were 8%, well below our modeled assumptions. As the interest rate environment evolves, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid, particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding.\nAnd now let me turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income increased 7% sequentially, driven by higher short-term interest rates alongside limited deposit betas in addition to strong loan growth. We also saw a positive asset mix shift with the investment portfolio shrinking and funding strong loan growth. As Bill indicated, the strong quality of our deposit franchise also limited deposit rate repricing.\nReported net interest margin increased 13 basis points and core net interest margin increased 15 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income increased for similar reasons and exceeded the high end of our April guidance, primarily due to our teammates delivering lower-than-modeled deposit betas. Overall, we continue to take a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk.\nWe continue to be asset-sensitive and that will decrease over time with the diminishing benefit associated with future rate increases and the disintermediation of funding sources.\nWe forecasted an approximate 25% cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta through the second and third quarters. To protect against any potential downside in rates, we also added $16 billion of swaps, which are primarily forward starting. These swaps begin in 2023 and 2024 and will have laddered maturities that range from 3 to 5 years to minimize earnings volatility.\nMoving to Slide 13. Fee income increased $106 million or 4.9% sequentially. Insurance income increased $98 million due to the seasonality, strong organic growth and the full quarter of Kensington Vanguard acquisition.\nCard and payment-related fees increased $34 million, reflecting the prior quarter acquisition of merchant relationships and the increased activity.\nResidential mortgage income decreased $15 million or 17% as higher interest rates pressured volumes and gain on sale margins.\nServicing income was essentially flat from the prior quarter as lower prepays were offset by increasing hedging costs.\nWhile this is a very challenging environment for mortgage, our mortgage team is playing some offense by leveraging Truist's strong purpose and balance sheet to hire select, well-regarded loan officers as well as acquire certain servicing portfolios.\nInvestment banking and trading income was relatively flat sequentially and declined 37% year-over-year as market volatility continues to negatively impact most products. Investment banking pipelines remain full across all products, but the realization of these pipelines will continue to remain subject to more stable market conditions.\nService charges on deposits were relatively flat sequentially as favorable seasonal trends were offset by the elimination of certain overdraft fees in April, resulting in client savings of approximately $20 million during the quarter.\nWe included a table at the bottom of Slide 13 to make other income trends more clear. Other income, excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and last quarter's merchant gain, decreased $25 million, primarily due to a loss on a certain sale of SBIC funds to diversify our private equity investment portfolio.\nTurning to Slide 14. Reported expenses decreased $94 million sequentially to $3.6 billion. The lower expenses were driven by $180 million or 43% reduction in merger costs due to diminishing integration activity.\nAdjusted expenses increased $119 million. Personnel expenses increased $64 million due to seasonally higher insurance-related incentive compensation, the full impact of normal first quarter compensation increases and ongoing investments in talent across our lines of business and technology teams. In addition, other expense increased $19 million due to higher operational losses and ongoing normalization of teammate travel. Professional fees and outside processing costs increased $16 million, primarily due to the increase in call center staffing.\nAs Bill mentioned, our minimum wage will increase to $22 per hour effective October 1. This represents a significant investment in our teammates and is expected to increase our personnel expense by $200 million annually, offset by lower turnover expense and improved execution and client experience.\nMoving to Slide 15. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and solid economic conditions. Leading credit indicators remain benign.\nCriticized and classified commercial loans decreased 6% sequentially and are 37% lower to a year ago. Our NPL ratio was flat at 36 basis points. And loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased 3 basis points to 69 basis points. Our net charge-off ratio also decreased 3 basis points to 22 basis points.\nWe experienced a slight build in the allowance due to loan growth, although the allowance coverage ratio decreased 6 basis points to 138 basis points, given our strong portfolio performance, tempered somewhat by our moderately slower economic outlook. While the weighting of our pessimistic baseline and optimistic scenarios were unchanged from the first quarter, each scenario is moderately worse, a trend that may continue.\nMoving on Slide 16. Our CET1 ratio declined 20 basis points to 9.2%, coming out of the strong loan growth and a $250 million share repurchase during the second quarter. As previously announced, our Board will consider an 8% increase in the quarterly common dividend at its July meeting. If approved, the increase will take effect in the third quarter and will continue to position Truist as one of the dividend leaders in our peer group.\nWe were also pleased with the performance during the 2022 stress test. Truist had the second lowest CET1 erosion and a low loss reserve rate in the peer group under severely adverse scenario. Our preliminary stress test capital buffer remained flat at 250 basis points. We believe these results demonstrate our strong capital relative to the risk and profitability profile, the latter of which should improve over time. We are now more comfortable operating below our previously announced CET1 ratio target of 9.75% given our continued strong stress test results and significantly reduced integration risk. Overall, the economic outlook will influence how much we operate below the prior target.\nFrom a funding perspective, end-of-period loan growth exceeded deposit growth. Truist has multiple sources available to fund incremental loan growth, as seen this quarter with the use of brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances and our securities portfolio.\nI will now provide guidance for full year 2022 and new guidance for the third quarter. In 2022, we now expect adjusted revenue to grow 3.5% to 4.5% from 2021. The mixture of revenue continues to tilt more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower fees, primarily in market-sensitive businesses such as investment banking, mortgage and wealth.\nWe now expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase 2% to 3% from 2021. This increase in expense outlook largely reflects higher operating losses and intentional investments to support our shift from integrating to operating, including increasing our minimum wage, hiring teammates to support client experience and growth and ongoing investments in technology. Net-net, this is slightly higher PPNR outlook versus our previously full year guide.\nIn light of our performance during the first half of the year and the benign credit environment, we expect net charge-off ratio to be in the 25 to 35 basis points for the full year. Looking into the third quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high single digits in the second-quarter level, primarily as a result of higher net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.\nWe expect mid-20-basis point increase in our core net interest margin due to the benefits from recent rate hikes and a projected 75 basis point hike in July. We also expect low 20-basis point increase in GAAP net interest margin as a result of core net interest margin expansion, offset by continued declines in purchase accounting accretion.\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nExecutive Chairman, CEO & President, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Daryl. And moving to Slide 17. On our previous earnings call in April, I expressed my belief that the first quarter marked a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Our second quarter results are bearing out this thesis and we're beginning to deliver on the potential of Truist.\nFor businesses that finished conversions in 2021, the increased momentum is palpable. Wealth continues to build momentum in hiring advisers who are attracted to Truist's purpose and broad set of capabilities, both within wealth and across the company through IRM. Wealth net adviser count grew in the second quarter for the first time in 10 quarters. With our recent entry into the Chicago market, Truist Wealth now serves 9 of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. In addition, net organic asset flows have been positive for 5 straight quarters.\nIn our mortgage business, client satisfaction scores for origination have improved every month since their conversion in August of 2021. The percentage of retail client applications completed digitally is now 97%.\nFor the rest of the company where core bank conversions were completed in the first quarter of 2022, momentum's also building. Loan production in the second quarter was the highest it's been at Truist and up 41% compared to the first quarter.\nPipelines also ended the quarter at the highest we've seen. Branch loan production, which is primarily home equity, was up 24% relative to the first quarter and the highest it's been at Truist. Consumer deposit production, both in the branches and within digital was up 29% sequentially and 20% year-over-year.\nRetail Banking Net Promoter and client satisfaction scores have rebounded nicely from their March lows and still have more opportunity to improve.\nDeposit production within our commercial community bank is up 8% relative to the first quarter. PCB-related IRM revenue was up 21% sequentially with increased activity across all products with significant momentum highlighting the power of our advice-driven model.\nFinancially, net interest income and margin rebounded from the first quarter low point, as expected. While fee income did not improve to the extent we had hoped, our second quarter results underscore the importance of our diverse business mix and we believe fees will improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on our significant IRM and revenue synergy opportunities.\nIn addition, merger costs are declining rapidly, and we're making good progress towards realizing our remaining cost saves as we decommission data centers and systems in the back half of the year, all of which will help drive positive operating leverage for the full year 2022.\nSo to conclude on Slide 18, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our potential, all of which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis. Strategically, our focus has clearly shifted to executional excellence, transformation and growth. We're shifting millions of hours of integration-related activity to improving our client experience through investments in digital and technology, simplification of our processes and operations and, of course, by continuing to activate our purpose each and every day. We're also focused on capturing the significant IRM and revenue synergy potential we have as this is squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients. These shifts and activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital and only requires execution and focus.\nAt the same time, while we believe the economy is currently healthy, the effects of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with still too high inflation and an aggressive forecast for tightening the monetary policy, have somewhat diminished the economic outlook as we move further into this year and into next. Truist is nevertheless well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice-oriented model for clients, strong absolute and relative markets, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix, a strong capital position relative to our risk profile and, most importantly, our power shift from a focus on integration to executional excellence and growth.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Bill. Jennifer, at this time, will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session? (Operator Instructions)"

(Operator Instructions)\nA brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this event is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations, Truist Financial Corporation.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Katie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are our Chairman and CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Daryl Bible.\nDuring this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's forwarder results and share their perspectives on how we continue to activate Truist's purpose, our progress on the merger and current business conditions. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; Beau Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the Truist IR website, ir.truist.com.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slide 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nIn addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and achieved webcasts are located on our website.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nExecutive Chairman, CEO & President, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Ankur, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid first quarter results, representing the diversity and flexibility of Truist in a more volatile market and business environment.\nNet interest income declined sequentially due to lower day count, lower PPP revenue and purchase accounting. Net interest margin slightly exceeded our expectations, and more importantly, both NII and NIM appear to have bottomed and have good upside from here. Fee income was below expectations, primarily due to investment banking and mortgage both of which were negatively impacted by the market environment. These effects were partially offset by higher insurance income, which underscores the advantages of our diverse business mix. Expenses were lower than expected, reflecting strong expense discipline and lower incentive compensation associated with softer fee income. We experienced continued solid loan growth, albeit with headwinds in certain areas. Credit quality remains excellent, contributing to another provision benefit.\nWe also completed our largest conversion event in February. There is a palpable level of excitement from our teammates to go to market as One Truist with an expanded toolkit to better fulfill our purpose. We'll share more details on these topics during the presentation.\nFirst and foremost, we are guided by our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We're convinced that our purpose reinstates the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day, and it provides a framework for how we make decisions.\nOn Slide 5, we highlight some of the ways we're bringing purpose to life. A key area of focus for Truist is financial inclusion. We're wholly committed to removing barriers and improving access to the financial system for all communities, which is why I'm pleased that the Truist foundation is supporting nonprofits that serve women and minority-owned small businesses and advancing digital equity among historically underserved communities.\nWe know people want to work for companies that stand for something meaningful and the combination of our purpose-driven culture with our industry-leading compensation and benefits, training, development and flexible approach to work is highly effective at attracting and retaining top talent. We plan to further strengthen our benefits programs by launching an employee stock purchase program later this year, subject to shareholder approval.\nWe also implemented our Truist work model with a focus on intentional flexibility as our teammates return to on-site work throughout March.\nPersonally, it was just incredibly energizing to have so much in-person engagement over the last 2 months whether with teammates, clients, community members or shareholders. Hybrid and more flexible works here to stay, but I'm pleased at how our team mates have embraced this new model.\nWe're also doing our part to convert climate change. And in late January, announced our plans to achieve net 0 greenhouse commissions by 2050. We're externalizing our own net 0 aspirations and furthering the transition to a low-carbon economy by adding new teammates in our CIB and Commercial Community Bank to help our clients make their own transition.\nLastly, we completed our largest core bank conversion event in February. This was an enormous undertaking with that involved transitioning nearly 7 million clients to the Truist ecosystem and unveiling roughly 6,000 Truist signs across our footprint, which will further build our brand. The integration was successful overall, especially when you consider the scale and complexity involved. This was the largest bank technology integration in over 15 years. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and preparation as well as the many personal sacrifices they've made to ensure the integration was successful because of you, we now have millions of Truist clients who are absolutely pleased with their experience.\nAt the same time, it's also impossible to execute an integration of this magnitude perfectly. We acknowledge there were some opportunities to improve along the way. Our teams did an incredible job in resolving client challenges with urgency and a view towards long-term client and teammate experience improvements. My commitment, though, is that we will not rest until every client is satisfied.\nComing to Slide 7. Our adjusted results exclude $166 million of after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges and $155 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses-related merger.\nWe also generated a $57 million after-tax gain on redemption of a noncontrolling equity interest related to the acquisition of certain merchant service relationships, which will provide Truist a larger share of the economics and more control over the end-to-end client experience.\nFinally, we incurred a $53 million after-tax loss to reposition approximately $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points.\nThe total EPS impact of these items was $0.24 per share. Daryl will provide more details on these items later in the presentation.\nTurning to our first quarter performance highlights on Slide 8. We earned $1.3 billion or $0.99 a share on a reported basis. Excluding the selected items on Slide 7, adjusted earnings totaled $1.6 billion or $1.23 per share, up 4.2% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by lower loan loss provision.\nCompared to the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS declined 11% driven primarily by a 4% decrease in adjusted revenue attributed to more challenging market conditions and fee businesses such as investment banking and residential mortgage in addition to some normal seasonal patterns.\nAdjusted ROTCE was a strong 22.6%, unchanged from the prior 2 quarters. Even excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still strong at 19.9%.\nAdjusted expenses decreased slightly as seasonal headwinds were offset by lower incentive compensation due to softer fee income in addition to our ongoing merger-related cost save efforts.\nWhile operating leverage was a negative 240 basis points year-over-year, we are still targeting positive operating leverage for the full year 2022. Asset quality continues to be excellent, and net charge-offs remain low, contributing to a provision benefit during the quarter.\nCapital deployment remained healthy in the first quarter as we completed the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard and certain merchant services relationships and funded solid organic loan growth. I'll provide more details about loan growth shortly.\nOverall, we're off to a slower start in 2022 than we would like, but I believe our performance can improve throughout the year.\nIn addition to the core bank conversion, we completed the migration of our retail business and wealth clients to the new Truist digital experience and now have sunset all heritage digital experiences.\nAs you'll recall, early in the merger, we made the decision to build a completely new digital experience rather than relying on existing systems and parties given the increasing importance of digital channels to our clients, we've built this new platform based directly on clients' feedback, and we've introduced it in waves, learning from each release and continually improving.\nWith a more modern and agile platform and approach, we're able to introduce a number of new features to both sets of heritage clients in advance of the core bank conversion and our speed of client experience improvements will only accelerate in the coming months and quarters as our digital and technology teams shift their efforts from integration. A great example of this will be Truist Assist, which will be our new cloud-based self-service digital assistant that we'll introduce in the second quarter and will be accessible to all our clients 24/7 via various digital channels. Truist assist will help clients execute basic tasks, schedules and provide insights and recommendations so they can have more control and confidence in their financial well-being.\nIn addition, we're executing and investing in a number of other areas over the coming quarters to improve our clients and teammates digital experience, including, but not limited to, digital payments, digital onboarding, enhanced authentication technology and expanding LightStream to include a new deposit product on a real-time cloud-based core.\nTurning to loans and leases on Slide 10. Average loan balances grew 0.8% sequentially and rose 1.2%, excluding PPP loans. Sequential loan growth was driven primarily by C&I, which increased 5.1%, excluding PPP and mortgage warehouse lending, where balances have declined rapidly due to declines in refinance volumes. Loans grew across all CIB industry practice groups and growth was particularly strong within our Asset Finance group. Commercial Community Bank C&I loans grew 2.4%, excluding PPP, fairly broad-based across many of our regions. Revolver utilization and revolver exposure both grew in the quarter. CRE continues to be a headwind, given a very competitive market, but we're optimistic that we're approaching stabilization.\nExcluding mortgage, consumer and card balances decreased 2%, driven primarily by a 3% decline in auto that was attributable to ongoing supply chain issues in a highly competitive environment.\nWe also experienced continued declines in our home equity and student loan portfolios. These pressures were partly offset by service finance, which is performing well and off to a great start.\nThis quarter, we were also excited to announce a new alliance with State Farm, whereby their agents will be able to offer consumer lending products through LightStream. We'll pass program later in the year and loan volumes will build over time. This alliance reflects Truist's increasing size, scale and relevance in addition to the superior digital capabilities and client experience that LightStream provides.\nIn summary, we continue to be positive about the prospects for further loan growth in light of the current economic conditions in our pipelines. Our increased capacity as a company to focus on clients post integration and our differentiated set of consumer businesses.\nAt the same time, though, we've got to acknowledge the increased uncertainty presented by a range of geopolitical and economic risk, which could cause loan growth to deviate from our outlook.\nNow turning to deposits on Slide 11. Average deposit balances increased 1% during the first quarter, reflecting some moderation from the 2% pace observed in the fourth quarter. Total deposit costs were stable at 3 basis points.\nAs interest rate environment involves, we'll take a balanced approach to managing deposits, being attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid.\nGuided by our purpose and our desire to be responsive to the needs of our clients, as previously announced, we'll discontinue a host of overdraft-related fees at the end of this month.\nWe also remain on track to launch our new Truist One checking account experienced this summer, which will have 0 overdraft fees, the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need to -- via a simple $100 negative balance buffer and a deposit-based credit line limit up to $750.\nWe're mindful of the impacts that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on certain segments of our clients particularly the least advantaged and Truist One of the many examples of where we're advancing financial inclusion.\nDespite the financial impacts we've discussed previously, this is a long-term win for our stakeholders as we endeavor to improve retention, increase acquisition and enhance the overall client experience.\nAnd with that, let me now turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nSenior EVP & CFO, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income decreased 2% sequentially as the impact of 2 fewer days and lower purchase accounting accretion offset the benefits of solid loan growth and higher securities yields. Reported net interest margin was flat and core net interest margin increased 2 basis points both exceeding our guidance by 2 basis points. The improvement in core net interest margin was primarily driven by lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio.\nMoving to Slide 13. Truist has intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, being well positioned to benefit from higher rates in the near term while maintaining some level of downside protection if and when interest rates decline, continue to be asset sensitive and estimate a 100 basis point ramp rate increase would increase NII by 4.3%, a 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 7.3%. Approximately 80% of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve. While early, deposit betas thus far are tracking below modeled expectations.\nMoving to Slide 14. Adjusted revenue declined 4.4% linked quarter, which is below our guidance range of down 1% to 2% and driven almost entirely by weaker-than-expected fee income. Fees declined 8% sequentially and reflecting challenging market conditions and seasonality. Investment banking and trading income declined $116 million or 31% as more volatile market conditions impacted M&A, high yield, leverage finance and equity. Investment Banking pipelines look healthy, but market conditions will determine both how much and when the pipeline is realized.\nResidential mortgage income declined $70 million or 44% as higher interest rates reduced refinance activity and pressured gain on sale margins on the production side.\nServicing was not as large of an offset as expected since the benefits of slowing DK were eroded by higher hedging costs due to the flatter yield curve. Part and payment fees and service charges on deposits declined $33 million collectively primarily driven by seasonal but also due to client-friendly fee waivers we instituted in and around the time of our February conversion. These items were partially offset by insurance income, which increased 9% primarily due to strong organic growth and the first month of Kensington Vanguard acquisition. We included a table at the bottom of Slide 14 to make other income trends more clear.\nOther income, excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and other gains was up $31 million sequentially given negative valuation adjustment for Visa-related derivative last quarter and up $56 million year-over-year primarily as a result of higher SBIC income.\nTurning to Slide 15. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion, including $216 million of merger-related costs and $202 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The merger costs in the quarter were primarily connected to new Truist signs, branch closings and impairments and data center decommissioning efforts. Adjusted expenses decreased sequentially, exceeding our guidance of up 1% to 2% and reflecting our disciplined expense management. or drivers of the decline include decreased personnel costs, reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and changes to the nonqualified plan, partially offset by seasonally higher FICA and 401(k) expenses. The decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by increased marketing costs as we continue building our brand.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2021, adjusted expenses were stable as cost saves from FTE reductions and lower occupancy costs were offset by continued investments in software and marketing, along with higher operational losses. The operational losses have steadily increased in recent quarters as banks are experiencing higher levels of fraud activity, in addition to our own decisions to enhance client experience. We remain highly focused on reducing our operational losses and improving our client experience at the same time.\nOverall, we have incurred significant costs in conjunction with the integration events, both in the merger categories as well as run rate fees and expenses.\nWe were excited that our last major conversion event is behind us, and we can start to reduce the financial costs associated with these integrations.\nMoving to Slide 16. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio and favorable economic conditions. Our net charge-off ratio for the first quarter was unchanged at 25 basis points.\nThe ALLL ratio decreased to 1.44%, resulting in a provision benefit of $95 million first quarter. Our reserve levels reflect current credit conditions but also take into account uncertainty associated with inflation, rising rates and geopolitical events. Truist has no direct credit exposure to Russia or Ukraine and minimal indirect exposure. Including RAC, our exposure to subprime at the origination is 1% or less in the other consumer portfolios.\nContinuing on Slide 17. Capital and liquidity levels remain strong. Our CET1 ratio declined approximately 20 basis points as a result of capital deployments related to the acquisitions of Kensington Vanguard and certain merchant service relationships. Growth in risk-weighted assets and the CECL phase-in.\nIn order to mitigate AOCI risk and volatility, we transferred approximately 40% of the securities portfolio to held to maturity during the first quarter. Because we are a Category 3 institution, AOCI does not impact regulatory capital, it simply impacts tangible common equity. We submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early April and look forward to sharing more details later this summer.\nMoving to Slide 18. This slide provides additional details about 3 transactions we completed in the first quarter to enhance our future earnings and profitability. First, Kensington Vanguard acquisition significantly expands our presence in title insurance, augments our capabilities in larger and more complex commercial transactions and will also provide additional IRM opportunities given our significant presence in CRE. We anticipate Kensington Vanguard will add $115 million in revenue annually and be accretive to insurance EBITDA margin by year 2.\nSecond, we terminated merchant revenue share alliance in which Truist had a noncontrolling interest. The transaction resulted in a $74 million gain from marking our stake to fair value.\nIn addition, we acquired significant portion of relationships from this alliance. This will position us to control more of the end client experience when serving those clients.\nWe also believe that the acquisition will generate approximately $25 million of additional cash, PPNR annually.\nLast, we repositioned $3 billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately 100 basis points resulting in a 2-year payback.\nMoving to Slide 20. As Bill mentioned, -- we successfully completed our large core bank conversion in February. We are now One Truist, not just culturally, but also in terms of branding, digital and technology, which allows us to serve our clients more effectively and make our company simpler to operate.\nAs we shift our focus from integration to executional excellence, we will maintain our focus on realizing remaining cost savings. Much of that will happen in the second half of '22 as we decommission over 900 business applications and 3 of our 6 data centers.\nOur decommissioning efforts are complex and significant, and we are on track. With our final integration largely complete, our technology teams will shift towards more further enhancing client and teammate experience.\nTurning to Slide 21. We have made excellent progress across the 5 cost-save buckets and are closing in on our commitment to achieve $1.6 billion in net cost saves. Third-party spend is down 11.9% from baseline levels exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%. This quarter, we closed over 400 branches exceeding our commitment to close over 800 total branches by the end of the first quarter of 2022. We now have finished the merger-related branch reduction efforts and will shift to more normal course branch network optimization. We have also achieved our targeted reduction in non-branch facility space, strategically reducing our occupancy costs through consolidation and closures. However, we still have more opportunities in which we are working. Excluding acquisitions average FTEs are down 1% linked quarter and 14% since the merger. Our voluntary separation and retirement program will conclude in the next 2 quarters, further supporting our ongoing cost saving efforts. I will now provide guidance for the full year '22 and new guidance for the second quarter.\nIn 2022, we now expect adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4% from 2021. Relative to our outlook from January, the mix of revenue growth is now tilted more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher short-term interest rates partially offset by weaker fees, primarily in residential mortgage and investment banking. This represents 6% to 7% core revenue growth when you exclude significant decline in PPP and purchase accounting.\nAs you will recall, we expect a mid-single-digit decline in service charges in 2022 given our elimination of certain overdraft-related fees and introduction of Truist One Banking. NII and net interest margin bottomed in the first quarter and should increase throughout the year based on the forward curve. We continue to expect point-to-point loan growth ex-PPP in the mid-single digits. But as Bill said, we acknowledge higher levels of economic uncertainty. We will be at the high end of our 1% to 2% increase of adjusted noninterest expense largely due to the impact of Kenzie Vanguard acquisition.\nThe first one was the peak for our merger-related costs, and now we are projecting less than $400 million for the rest of this year and none in 2023.\nWe are still targeting positive operating leverage on a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022, though this is somewhat dependent on interest rates and market conditions. We still expect net charge-off ratio to be in the 30 to 40 basis points given our assumptions for normalization throughout the year.\nLooking into the second quarter, we expect adjusted PPNR to grow high single digit with possible upside from the first quarter level.\nAs a result, higher net interest income and much longer fee income given seasonality in insurance and the potential rebound of investment banking. This outlook assumes the forward curve in interest rates and controlled deposit betas. We expect core net interest margin to increase approximately 7 to 10 basis points due to the benefits from the March hike and from a projected 50 basis point hike in May. GAAP net interest margin is expected to increase only 3 to 4 basis points as purchase accounting accretion is slowing, given lower prepayment environment as a result of higher rates.\nNow I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nExecutive Chairman, CEO & President, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Daryl. Moving to Slide 20. The first quarter of 2022 was historic for Truist as we're now serving our clients as a true unified Truist across all dimensions.\nIn addition, the first quarter is a strategic and financial turning point for Truist. Strategically, the completion of our core bank conversion positions us to fully shift our focused executional excellence, transformation and growth. Our businesses that went through earlier conversions in 2021 such as wealth and mortgage are beginning to see the benefits of this shift whether in the form of new adviser hiring in wealth or significantly improve client satisfaction scores and mortgage.\nFinancially, the first quarter should be at the bottom for net interest income and net interest margin and fee performance should improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as a company.\nIn addition, the completion of the integration means merger costs will decrease dramatically through the remainder of 2022 and we'll realize our remaining cost saves as data centers and systems are decommissioned in the back half of the year, all of which helped drive positive operating leverage.\nTo conclude, I remain highly optimistic about the potential and opportunity for Truist, all of which are clearly summarized on Slide 23, our investment thesis.\nOur opportunity and priorities are clear: shift from an integration focus to execution focus, deliver better client experiences, capture the significant IRM and revenue synergy potential we have to shift the millions of hours of development training and effort from the integration to building better lives for our clients. This shift does not require any incremental risk appetite or capital, it only requires execution and focus.\nAt the same time, while we believe the economy is on sound footing in the near term, the headwinds of geopolitical uncertainty, coupled with the inflationary environment and aggressive forecast for the tightening of monetary policy create a wide range of economic outlook as we move further into this year and next.\nTruist is well positioned across all of these environments, given our advice-oriented model for our clients, balanced approach to interest rate risk management, conservative credit culture, diverse business mix and strong and improving earnings profile.\nAnd with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, bill. Katie, at this time, will you explain to our participants how they can participate in the Q&A session? (Operator Instructions)"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this event is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Head of Investor Relations for Truist Financial Corporation. Please go ahead.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Jake, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Truist's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With us today are our CEO, Bill Rogers; and our CFO, Daryl Bible. During this morning's call, they will discuss Truist's fourth quarter results and also share perspective how we continue to activate Truist's purpose, our progress on the merger and current business conditions. Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer; Bo Cummins, our Vice Chair; and John Howard, our Chief Insurance Officer, are also in attendance and are available to participate in the Q&A portion of the call. The accompanying presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental financial information are available on the truest IR site, ir.truist.com.\nOur presentation today will include forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please review the disclosures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation regarding these statements and measures as well as the appendix for the appropriate reconciliations to GAAP.\nIn addition, Truist is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nCEO & Director, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We hope that your new year is off to a good start and that you and your families are doing well.\nI'm very pleased with Truist's strong fourth quarter results. Fee income was solid, reflecting our diverse business mix and favorable conditions in investment banking and insurance. Net interest income is starting to improve, exceeding expectations. Credit quality was outstanding, resulting in another provision benefit. We delivered on our expense goals as adjusted noninterest expense decreased almost 4% and drove 3% sequential positive operating leverage. Loan growth, excluding PPP, is strengthening, and we have momentum going into this year. I'll share more details on these topics during the presentation.\nNow turning to Slide 4. As always, I'm going to begin with purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company. Our purpose defines how we do business every day, and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions. Our purpose-driven culture is also the foundation for how we attract and retain top talent. People simply want to work for and do business with companies that stand for something meaningful. This culture, combined with our comprehensive compensation and benefit packages, significant and ongoing training, development and career mobility and our more flexible approach to work, will be our formula for attracting and retaining the best talent at Truist and competing and winning in the ongoing war for talent.\nSlide 5 highlights some of the ways we're putting our purpose into action. This slide is organized around the same major themes contained in our CSR and our ESG report since they are topics that are most relevant to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. I could not be more proud of both the quantity and, most importantly, the quality of the work being done across all these dimensions and the tremendous impact we're having in our communities.\nWhile I can't cover every point on the slide, let me highlight a few. On the technology front, we were excited to welcome our teammates to the recently completed Innovation and Technology Center in Charlotte and look forward to our external grand opening in the first half of the year. As you know, Truist has an unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and I'm very pleased to report that we recently achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles to at least 15%. This was a year earlier than our original commitment. While we're proud to achieve this milestone, we acknowledged that this is actually the beginning and not the end.\nWe've also intentionally implemented a flexible work strategy for our teammates, which includes on-site remote and hybrid options. Hybrid and more flexible work is here to stay. And I've learned the meaning and the power of intentional flexibility, the concept of people coming together as a team, whether in the office or not, and intentionally deciding what works best for them, their team, our clients and the company while remaining highly engaged and, most importantly, purposeful.\nFinally, we released our inaugural TCFD report in mid-December, which adds further context and disclosures to our previous CSR and ESG reports. At Truist, we view all the elements of ESG as an opportunity to improve our company and operationalize our purpose, including climate change. For instance, we're adding new teammates within CIB and our Commercial Community Bank who are going to help our clients transition to a lower carbon economy.\nNow turning to Slide 7. This quarter, we had $163 million of after-tax merger-related and restructuring charges and $165 million of after-tax incremental operating expenses related to the merger. The total EPS impact of merger-related costs was $0.25 a share. While our decision to create a best-of-both model of integration has resulted in increased upfront cost, I firmly believe it creates the best platform for future investment and growth. The good news is that total merger costs will be cut approximately in half in 2022 compared to last year and then fall out of our expense base entirely after this year.\nNow turning to our fourth quarter performance on Slide 8. As I indicated, the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year as most areas were generally in line or somewhat ahead of our expectations. We earned $1.5 billion or $1.13 earnings per share for the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding the merger impacts on the prior slide, we earned $1.9 billion or $1.38 per share. Primary driver of changes in EPS relative to both the prior quarter and a year ago was a loan loss provision given a rapidly evolving economic environment over the past 2 years. We generated strong returns, including a 22.6% adjusted ROTCE, which was unchanged from last quarter. Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE was still a very strong 19.6%.\nAsset quality continues to be an excellent story, and net charge-offs were in line with our guidance. Capital deployment was robust during the fourth quarter as we funded strong organic loan growth, closed the Service Finance acquisition in early December and repurchased $500 million worth of common stock. We'll provide more details about loan growth momentarily.\nOn the merger integration front, we completed the first part of the core bank conversion in mid-October by migrating our heritage BB&T clients to the Truist ecosystem. As part of the conversion, we launched the newest -- the new truist.com as well as our digital commerce account opening platform. Since then, our integration teams have completed 2 successful dress rehearsals for our final conversion, 1 in mid-December and 1 just this past weekend. I want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and dedication to this effort. Because of them, we're on track for the final core conversion in February, during which our heritage SunTrust clients will be migrated to the Truist ecosystem.\nLooking at full year 2021, Trust had a productive year across multiple dimensions. From a financial perspective, we generated significant adjusted net income of $7.5 billion or $5.53 per share and had an adjusted ROTCE of 22%. While our earnings undoubtedly benefited from a $3 billion lower loan loss provision due to the improving economy, we also demonstrated the strength of our diverse business mix. Fee income, excluding security gains, increased a very strong 10% as we are firing on multiple cylinders. This performance helped offset a 45% decline in mortgage fee income and a 6% decrease in net interest income.\nWe also continue to deliver on our cost save programs evidenced by adjusted expenses increasing only 1% during the year, which saw much larger increases in fee income. We also experienced a reduction in our risk profile due to the improving economy and merger integration progress, which enabled us to reduce the CET1 target by 25 basis points to 9.75 and deploy significantly more capital. Overall, we were able to make great progress on multiple fronts despite continued headwinds from the pandemic while delivering improved financial performance for our shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our new Truist digital experience reflects 2 of our core digital and technology principles: co-creation with our clients and moving fast in order to learn fast. Our more modern and agile platform allows us to incorporate this feedback quickly, the results of which can be seen in the significant improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores as well as in our Apple App Store and Google Play store ratings in just a few short months. We've now migrated approximately 9 million retail, wealth and small business clients to the Truist digital experience through December. More than 85% of active clients have begun to use the new digital platform in lieu of their heritage app.\nOn Slide 11, you'll see a visual of our new corporate and commercial digital platform, which we'll call Truist One View. This platform will provide our clients with a comprehensive view of their existing treasury management and lending solutions via streamlined and client-specific experience designed to reduce the time required to perform routine financial task.\nIncluding the launch of Truist One View to our commercial clients, Truist has introduced new web and mobile platforms for each of our client segments across retail, wealth, business and corporate. More than 2,000 features were released across these platforms in 2021, and we've done this at a pace that neither heritage company could have achieved on their own. More broadly, as you can see from the charts on the left, we continue to position ourselves to serve the robust demand for digital services. Digital lending, mobile check deposits and Zelle transactions all exhibited double-digit growth during the year. We feel good about our current digital performance, and we believe that our progress will accelerate after the final core bank conversion in part due to the advantages and efficiencies associated with having one website, one search engine optimization process, one brand, one system and one digital application but also in part due to the new capabilities that we'll be able to introduce this year, including our new AI-driven insights tool, our new Truist Assist virtual assistant and the Truist developer center, which will position us to innovate and collaborate with the developer community. Having our teams focus on the new Truist experience versus managing 3 separate experiences will provide a significant productivity lift as we move forward.\nLastly, we have plans to make strong digital progress in other areas this year from our new partnership and integration with AutoFi enhancing our insurtech capabilities via integrating insurance directly into our mortgage process and launching a new deposit product with LightStream on a real-time cloud-based core.\nNow turning to loans and leases on Slide 12. Average loans stabilized after decreasing for 5 consecutive quarters, and peeling back the onion reveals positive and improving underlying trends. Excluding PPP, average loans increased approximately 1% sequentially and end-of-period loans grew to approximately 2%, reflecting momentum late in the quarter.\nThe most notable improvement was in C&I, where end-of-period balances, excluding PPP, grew $6.3 billion or 5%, reflecting broad-based growth across corporate and commercial lines of business. This was the strongest point-to-point C&I loan growth since the first quarter of 2020.\nMost CIB industry and product groups demonstrated growth, most notably within our Asset Finance Group. Broad-based growth was also evident within our commercial Community Bank, where 12 of the 21 regions grew C&I loans, excluding PPP during the quarter, and we continue to see the most growth in markets that are relatively more open. Every single one of our industry specialty groups within CCB Group, a strong reflection of how our clients value industry expertise and advice.\nRevolver utilization also ticked up after 6 straight quarters of declines. And equally important, total revolver exposure continues to grow, evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion. Residential mortgage continues to grow, reflecting slower prepayment speeds, our decision to balance sheet certain correspondent production and increased capacity post conversions and COVID. Excluding mortgage, consumer balances decreased slightly, primarily due to seasonality in our Sheffield business and continued declines in our government-guaranteed student loan portfolio.\nService Finance closed on December 6, and we feel great about their trajectory heading into 2022. In addition, some of the areas that have been headwinds like dealer floor plan and CRE are beginning to stabilize. Overall, corporate and commercial clients remain optimistic despite ongoing labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. We're encouraged by the momentum we observed in the fourth quarter but also in our pipelines, which are the highest they've been in some time. We continue to believe there is meaningful upside to the C&I growth story as the economy continues to improve, although the timing remains imprecise. We also continue to feel confident in our consumer trajectory as we're well positioned with respect to faster-growing segments through our digital and point-of-sale businesses, which will offset headwinds in other areas.\nNow turning to deposits on Slide 13. Average deposits increased $8.2 billion or 2% compared to the third quarter largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus and seasonality related to public funds. We're also able to help our clients along their financial journey through our industry-leading child tax credit awareness initiative. Through this initiative, which promotes savings and financial confidence, clients and communities most in need were able to grow their savings and IRA balances by 9% and 15%, respectively, from May through December. I think this is a great example of what we call purposeful growth.\nBut we know we can do more, and as guided by our purpose, we have been reinventing a new checking account experience that aligns with our clients' needs, which we believe will provide the more flexibility, lower cost and more financial confidence. Truist One Banking will be our new flagship differentiated and disruptive suite of checking solutions that redefine everyday banking and accelerate our journey towards purposeful growth. Trust One will have 0 overdraft fees, the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need via a simple $100 negative balance buffer as well as a deposit-based credit line limit of up to $750. These features will help clients manage their liquidity needs far more cost effectively than alternative products. You're going to learn more about these details right after this call. These solutions will be available to all clients this summer given our need to first finish the conversion.\nIn addition, Truist will discontinue overdraft protection, negative account balance and return item fees in the coming months for all existing accounts. Long term, this is a win-win for all of our stakeholders as we'll increase client acquisition, particularly next-gen clients, enhanced deposit growth and simply improve the overall client experience. In the near term, however, there will be a financial cost, both as the result of the introduction of Truist One and the reduction of other fees. We expect these changes collectively to result in an approximately $300 million or almost 60% reduction in overdraft related revenue by 2024. The impact will begin in a few months and build over time as more clients benefit from the Truist One experience.\nI'm now going to turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in more detail.\n\nDaryl N. Bible\n\nCFO, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 14. Net interest income was up slightly versus the prior quarter and ahead of our guidance of down 1%. The increase was primarily driven by a larger securities portfolio as a result of ongoing deposit growth, which offset the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion. Net interest margin and core net interest margin performed in line with our guidance. Reported net interest margin declined 5 basis points, 2 basis points due to purchase accounting accretion and 3 basis points from core. The main drivers of the 3 basis point decline in core net interest margin were the impacts of lower PPP revenue and higher levels of liquidity. The PPP continues to wind down, and we expect to earn an additional $60 million of PPP revenue over the coming 2 quarters.\nMoving to Slide 15. Overall, Truist intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk, enhancing current earnings while being in a position to take advantage of higher rates, both at the short and long ends of the curve. We estimate a 100 basis point ramp. Increase in rates would increase NII by 5%. A 100 basis point shock would increase NII by 10%. Approximately 75% of this reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve. As a rule of thumb, 125 basis point Fed hike with a 25% beta would increase net interest income by $25 million per month and increase net interest margin 6 basis points, all else being equal.\nMoving to Slide 16. The Reported fees were down 2% from last quarter largely due to changes in our nonqualified plan. Absent the impacts of the nonqualified plan, fees performed well and were consistent with our guidance of relatively stable. The driving factors of a stable performance quarter-over-quarter were investment banking and trading increased $61 million versus the prior quarter due to higher syndication fees, structured real estate and record M&A results. Insurance income increased $21 million, primarily due to organic growth and seasonal improvement from the third to fourth quarter. These quarterly increases were offset by a decline in other income of $107 million or $70 million, excluding changes in the nonqualified plan largely driven by the valuation adjustment for the Visa-related derivative and lower revenue from our SBIC funds.\nFor the full year 2021, excluding security gains, fees were up 10% versus the prior year or more than $800 million. Propelled by our diverse business model, favorable market conditions and Truist increasing size, scale and relevance across multiple businesses, we are also making good progress early in our IRM initiative, particularly between the connectivity between CCB, Wealth and CIB.\nInsurance income increased 20% year-over-year primarily driven by a very strong organic growth of 11% and acquisitions. This was our 99th year of insurance business, our best one yet, and we believe that 2022, our 100th year, can be even better. Investment banking and trading was also up over $400 million, largely due to record performances of syndicated finance, M&A, equity, structured real estate and asset securitization. M&A revenue doubled relative to 2020, and the lead syndication roles and syndicated finance were up 26% year-over-year both reflecting our strategic relevance to our clients. On the flip side, residential mortgage income was down year-over-year $445 million or 45% primarily due to the sharp decline on gain on sale margins and lower refinance activity.\nTurning to Slide 17. Reported expenses were $3.7 billion for the quarter, including $212 million of merger-related costs and $215 million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger. Adjusted expenses decreased 3.9% sequentially at the end of our guidance of down 3% to 4%. Drivers for the decline include decreased personnel costs, which were a result of lower salary expenses, lower incentive costs, lower medical claims and changes in the nonqualified plan. Average FTEs declined 3%, including Service Finance from the prior quarter.\nAdjusted expenses also declined due to elevated equipment and marketing expenses in the third quarter. Full year adjusted expenses were up only 1% despite the adjusted fee income growing 10% year-over-year. This limited increase demonstrates the cost saving success we have achieved throughout the year and our overall discipline on expense management.\nMoving to Slide 18. Asset quality remains excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture, diverse portfolio, favorable economic conditions and the effects of stimulus. Our net charge-off ratio increased to 25 basis points from 19 basis points in the third quarter due to seasonality in the consumer losses and lesser commercial recoveries. Our ALLL coverage ratio decreased to 1.53%, which is just below our CECL day 1 levels, resulting in a provision benefit of $103 million in the fourth quarter as the economic scenarios continue to improve.\nContinuing on Slide 19. Capital and liquidity levels remain very strong. Our CET1 ratio declined from 10.1% to 9.6% driven by organic loan growth, share repurchases and the Service Finance acquisition. Our established near-term target for CET1 of 9.75% has not changed, although the ratio declined to 9.6% in the fourth quarter. We anticipate being somewhat below our 9.75% CET1 target in the near term given the improving loan growth outlook and the CET and the CECL phase-in for the first quarter. We also do not anticipate repurchasing any shares for the first half of 2022.\nMoving to Slide 21. We achieved a major milestone in October with the successful migration of our BB&T retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem. We have 3 significant integration milestones remaining, completing the Truist digital first migration, finalizing the remaining branch consolidations in the first quarter and the migration of our SunTrust retail and commercial clients to the Truist ecosystem, which will occur in February. The visual combination of this process will be 6,000 more Truist signs across our markets at branches, ATMs, retail and corporate offices finally allowing us to serve as one brand for our clients. Once the integration is complete and all the systems have been converted, Truist will be a much simpler company to operate, allowing us to provide even better service to our clients.\nTurning to Slide 22. We continue to be committed to achieving our $1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress in each of the 5 categories. Third-party spend is down 11.5% from baseline levels exceeding our targeted reduction of 10%. Our sourcing team continues to make great strides in achieving savings despite the impacts of inflation. And the good news is there were fewer contracts to renegotiate in 2022 due to the higher volume of contracts renegotiated during Truist's first 2 years. We are on track to deliver over 800 total branch closures by the first quarter of 2022. And we're about 90% of the way towards our non-branch facility reduction target. Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger, excluding acquisitions. Additionally, technology savings were materialized after redundant systems are decommissioned the second half of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 23. Core noninterest expense was $2.94 billion in the fourth quarter, meeting our target for the quarter. As a reminder, core noninterest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time the merger closed. Going forward, we will focus primarily on adjusted expenses and not core as adjusted expenses represent what we believe will be the run rate going forward.\nI will now provide guidance for the full year 2022 and for the first quarter. In 2022, we expect total revenue to grow 2% to 4% from 2021 as a result of higher net interest income combined with solid growth in fees. The lower end of the range reflects 2 Fed hikes with one in June and the second in December, where the upper end reflects 3 to 4 rate hikes throughout the year. This guidance includes the initial financial impact from the new Truist One account and related fee reductions in 2022. Adjusted noninterest expense is expected to only increase 1% to 2% in 2022 as a result of inflation, increased investments and expenses from acquisitions in 2021, partially offset by the ongoing cost savings, including achieving our final cost save target in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nMerger-related and restructuring costs and incremental operating expenses related to the merger are anticipated to be approximately $800 million in 2022 with these expenses going away in 2023. Given these factors, we anticipate positive operating leverage on both a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2022. This is the primary metric we will hold ourselves accountable to this year. We also expect net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points in 2022 given favorable economic conditions and the assumptions for normalization throughout the year with some quarter-to-quarter variability. Excluding discrete items, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and 21% if you model us on a taxable equivalent basis. Looking into the first quarter, we expect total revenues to decline approximately 1% to 2% from fourth quarter levels given 2 fewer days, lower purchase accounting accretion and PPP revenue, continued pressures on mortgage and the typical seasonal patterns in certain fee categories like famous payments and service charges. This will be partially offset by seasonality in insurance.\nReported net interest margin should be down a couple of basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion, although we expect core to be relatively flat. We expect adjusted expenses to increase 1% to 2% next quarter from the fourth quarter levels partially due to the seasonality and personnel expense given FICA and 401(k) and partially due to the higher marketing expense as we continue to roll out the Truist brand post conversions. Now I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.\n\nWilliam Henry Rogers\n\nCEO & Director, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThank you, Daryl. Slide 24 is our investment thesis, which is built on 4 pillars or themes that we believe truly differentiate Truist and allow us to inspire and build better lives and communities as well as deliver purposeful growth for all of our stakeholders. I also think it's the same reason I've got the best job in banking. I shared color on this refreshed investment thesis with many of you in December.\nSo on Slide 25, and in summary and conclusion, Truist had a very good 2021 highlighted by improved financial performance, strong fee income from our diverse business model, significant capital deployment and strong risk management as evidenced by our excellent asset quality metrics. We also made substantial integration progress taking many significant steps towards becoming One Truist.\nAs we look into 2022, our formula is going to be simple. First, we'll complete the merger in the first quarter, eliminate merger-related costs by year-end and achieve our cost saves, all of which will help us produce positive operating leverage. Second, we'll begin to pivot from an integration focus to an operating focus on executional excellence and growth. The momentum we have going into 2022, combined with being one Trust across all dimensions, technology, digital, brand, products process, gives me great confidence in our performance and potential as we make and complete this pivot.\nLastly, we'll have the capacity to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders as integration risks subside and the economy stays on sound footing. So with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur for Q&A.\n\nAnkur Vyas\n\nHead of IR, Truist Financial Corporation\n\nThanks, Bill. Jake, at this time, if you'll explain how our listeners can participate in the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions)"

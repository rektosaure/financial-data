[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Chase Mulvehill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Baker Hughes Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Ahmed Mohgal. The earnings release we issued yesterday evening can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com. We will also be using a presentation with our prepared remarks during this webcast which can be found on our investor website.\nAs a reminder, we will provide forward-looking statements during this conference call. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and certain GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Chase. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. First, I'd like to provide a quick outline for today's call. I will begin by discussing our strong third quarter results. Next, I will highlight key awards announced during the quarter and provide some thoughts on the broader macro environment. Following this, I will share an update on the current progress in the LNG sector. I will then hand it over to Ahmed, who will present an overview of our financial results, followed by an update on our continued focus on portfolio management, including the Chart Industries acquisition. To conclude, I will summarize the main points before we open the line for questions.\nLet us now turn to the key highlights on Slide 4. We continue to execute at a high level, delivering another quarter of strong results. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $1.24 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range. This performance reflects continued momentum from our business system deployment, positive trends in gas technology and strong outperformance in U.S. land, where our leverage to production is a clear advantage.\nOilfield Services and Equipment margins softened in response to the broader macro environment while Industrial and Energy Technology reported improved results, contributing to a 20 basis point year-over-year increase and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to 17.7%. This margin progression highlights the resilience of our portfolio and the foundation we have built through disciplined execution.\nGiven the strong operational performance year-to-date, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA for the total company to exceed $4.7 billion.\nSpanning to orders. IT continues to build strong momentum, achieving $4.1 billion during the quarter, driven by LNG equipment, record Cordant solutions orders and ongoing strength in gas infrastructure and power generation. As a result, IT backlog grew 3% sequentially, reaching a new record of $32.1 billion, further reinforcing the durability and visibility of our growth outlook.\nThrough the first three quarters, IT orders totaled nearly $11 billion, including $1.6 billion from new energy already reaching the high end of the $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion guidance range. With good visibility into fourth quarter awards, we now expect full year IT orders to exceed our prior midpoint.\nLooking ahead, we are targeting at least $40 billion of IT orders over the next three years. This outlook is supported by the breadth and versatility of our technology portfolio which continues to generate a robust pipeline across an expanding range of end markets. We expect growth to be led by gas infrastructure, power generation and new energy markets while LNG equipment orders are expected to remain consistent with our solid performance over the past 2 years.\nIn OFSE, Subsea surface and Pressure Systems delivered a record quarter with $1.2 billion in orders driven by major contract wins in Turkey and Brazil.\nTurning to Slide 5. As I highlighted, we made strong progress on IT orders year-to-date, reflecting continued momentum across LNG, power generation and new energy markets. With strong visibility into our current pipeline, we expect this strength to carry into 2026.\nIn LNG, we secured over $800 million in equipment orders this quarter, including Trains 3 and 4 of Sempra's Port Arthur Phase 2 and Train 4 of next decades, Rio Grande LNG. At Rio Grande, our Cordant asset health digital solution is being deployed on the first three trains. These awards reflect continued investment in large-scale LNG infrastructure and demonstrate our ability to deliver value by integrating equipment and digital capabilities to reduce downtime and boost availability and production.\nIn power generation, we continue to experience strengthening demand for distributed power, cogeneration and geothermal solutions throughout the oil and gas industrial, data center and geothermal markets. Notably, we secured a significant award from Dynamis for mobile power generation for oil and gas operations in North America, supplying more than 1 gigawatt of aeroderivative gas turbines to meet rising energy needs across upstream and downstream markets.\nWe also made meaningful progress in geothermal power, securing a contract to design and deliver equipment for five organic rank and cycle power plants for Fervo's Cape Station project in Utah. This site will generate 300 megawatts of clean, reliable power enough to supply approximately 180,000 homes. This builds on our earlier collaboration with Fervo where OFSE provided subsurface drilling and production technologies. Together, these wins demonstrate the growing relevance of our integrated portfolio for scalable, low-carbon energy solutions.\nWe also signed a collaboration agreement with controlled thermal resources for the 500-megawatt health kitchen geothermal project in California. As part of this broader trend, we are seeing continued momentum in data center power demand. Year-to-date, we have now booked more than $700 million in power generation equipment orders for data center applications, led by our NovaLT technology. We remain confident in achieving $1.5 billion of data center orders ahead of our original 3-year time line, underscoring the increasing relevance of our power solutions in this fast-growing market.\nOn aftermarket services, we secured a long-term service contract with BP for its Tangguh LNG facility in Indonesia and extended our agreement with Pembina pipeline to support upgrades for the Alliance pipeline system in North America. These awards reinforce the convertibility of our installed base into aftermarket and service opportunities, reflecting the resilience of our life cycle model.\nIn offshore, a market we continue to see as a compelling long-term growth opportunity IET secured an award to supply power generation and compression equipment for an FPSO in South America. This award further demonstrates our ability to deliver integrated solutions for critical energy infrastructure. SSPS delivered a record order quarter driven by a significant award for subsea trees in Turkey. We will supply Turkish Petroleum with integrated subsea production and intelligent completion system for the third phase of the Sakarya gas field.\nIn Offshore Brazil, we also announced the frame agreement with Petrobras for up to 50 subsea trees, marking our return to the subsea tree market following an extended absence.\nIn flexible pipe systems, we booked an additional 66 kilometers of risers and flow lines for hydrocarbon production, CO2 injection and gas lift, again, highlighting our technical leadership in complex offshore developments. We will also provide an all-electric integrated completion systems for the Buzios field in Brazil, enabling more precise subsurface control, increased operational efficiency and enhanced reliability. Petrobras also extended contracts for our Blue Marlin and Blue Orca stimulation vessels.\nIn Saudi Arabia, we won a major multiyear award from Aramco to expand coiled tubing drilling operations. including six new units and extensions for four existing ones, supporting both reentry and greenfield projects across the Kingdom.\nFor Production Solutions, we signed a 5-year extension to provide hydrocarbon and water treatment products and services across Valero's North America and U.K. refineries. We also continued to see strong demand in Mexico for our downstream chemical solutions as we help PEMEX manage crude quality challenges. These awards highlight our ability to serve downstream markets as well as upstream and midstream.\nIn ammonia, we booked a major order from Technip Energies for the Blue Point #1 project in Louisiana. This facility is set to become the world's largest low-carbon ammonia plant with a capacity of 1.4 MTPA. We will supply critical compression equipment for ammonia production and CO2 transportation along with steam turbines and generators for power solutions. Overall, we continue to see strong momentum across an increasingly diverse opportunity set, supported by the breadth and depth of our technology portfolio.\nNow turning to the macro on Slide 6. The macro environment has remained relatively resilient throughout 2025, and despite geopolitical and policy-related headwinds. A key factor contributing to this resilience is the powerful new growth dynamic related to the rapid deployment of generative AI. This wave of investment is unlocking new growth vectors across a wide range of industries and serving as a broad stimulus for the global economy with recent estimates indicating that AI-driven investments account for approximately 30% to 40% of U.S. GDP growth this year.\nGlobally, McKinsey projects over $1.5 trillion in data center infrastructure investments over the next three years, a major opportunity for Baker Hughes. We are seeing a clear acceleration in project activity and commitments from leading AI companies with our Power Solutions portfolio well positioned to meet this demand for resilient energy-efficient infrastructure.\nNow turning to oil. The market continues to navigate a range of cross currents. On one hand, there are concerns around softer demand and rising OPEC+ reduction. On the other, persistent geopolitical risks in the Middle East and Russia continue to support commodity prices. Despite the accelerated return of OPEC+ supply, Oil prices in the third quarter remained somewhat resilient. While it is possible some OPEC+ nations do not have the capacity to fully meet their production quotas, the near-term potential for oversupply continues to weigh on sentiment, keeping operators cautious amid the risk of short-term pricing pressure.\nAs we shared last quarter, we continue to expect oil-related upstream investment to remain subdued until the market fully absorbs this incremental OPEC+ supply. Against this backdrop, our outlook for 2025 is unchanged, maintaining expectations for a high single-digit decline in global upstream spending.\nLooking ahead to 2026, early indicators point to another year of subdued activity, possibly leading to another year of global upstream spending decline. Longer term, the outlook is more positive, especially internationally and offshore, where substantial investment will be required to sustain production growth in response to rising demand. We also expect continued growth in OpEx-driven upstream investment as operators focus on enhancing recovery rates and extending the life of existing fields.\nOn natural gas, we continue to see growing divergence between oil and natural gas fundamentals. It's abundance, low-cost reliability and lower emissions set natural gas apart from other fossil fuels. That structural advantage is increasingly reflected in both policy and capital allocation. By 2040, we expect natural gas demand to grow by over 20% with global LNG increasing by at least 75%. This growth outlook creates a favorable environment for Baker Hughes.\nLNG demand continues to demonstrate solid growth increasing by 6% this year, largely driven by a strong storage injection season in Europe, although this was partially offset by softer demand in China. This demand is driving record LNG contracting activity, which is essential for future project FIDs. According to Wood Mackenzie, 84 MTPA of long-term LNG offtake contracts were signed in the first nine months of the year, surpassing last year's total of 81 MTPA. Over the past two years, nearly 75 MTPA of LNG projects have taken FID with an additional 25 MTPA needed to reach our 3-year target of 100 MTPA. This would increase the global installed base to our long-held target of 800 MTPA by 2030. Beyond this, we see continued growth in the installed base, which I'll address shortly.\nIn summary, we are seeing strong momentum in our key end markets, especially natural gas and AI-driven power despite persistent headwinds in global trade policy and oil. Our diverse portfolio positions us to manage volatility and we remain confident in our ability to continue executing against our long-term strategy.\nTurning to Slide 7. Let me take a few minutes to share our updated perspective on global LNG capacity expansion beyond our long-held target of 800 MTPA by 2030. That milestone is now largely supported by projects that have already reached FID, but are not yet commissioned. Looking beyond 2030, we now expect global LNG installed capacity to increase to approximately 950 MTPA by 2035. To achieve this level of capacity, an additional 175 MTPA of projects would need to reach FID by 2031.\nOur positive long-term outlook is anchored in a simple reality. The world needs more energy. This requirement is being amplified by the exponential growth in AI-driven power demand. Natural gas is well suited to meet this demand, offering abundance, affordability and lower emissions than coal without the intermittency issues associated with renewable sources.\nIn many emerging markets, natural gas accounts for less than 5% of the power mix compared to over 40% in the U.S. This disparity presents substantial potential for natural gas to displace coal and support the transition to a lower carbon economy, especially in regions with high energy requirements that demands reliable and affordable power solutions. Nonetheless, periods of market volatility may occur due to the nonlinear nature of supply growth. Historically, declines in spot prices have encouraged new buyers to enter the market, thereby spurring the next wave of demand and supporting LNG's sustained long-term growth trajectory.\nTurning to our technology portfolio. This remains a core differentiator for Baker Hughes. Our best-in-class liquefaction solutions pair advanced compression technology with the industry's broadest selection of drivers including heavy-duty and aeroderivative gas turbines and electric motors. We consistently raised the bar for efficiency, throughput and uptime, helping customers achieve superior LNG project economics. The LM9000 aeroderivative gas turbine exemplifies this, delivering 44% simple cycle efficiency and setting new benchmarks in performance and reliability for large-scale energy infrastructure projects. We expect that the integration of Chart will further enhance the value we bring to customers, enabling greater optimization across the LNG value chain. This allows for more efficient project design, improve and better life cycle economics which we expect will result in superior outcomes for our customers.\nImportantly, an increasing installed base supports structural growth over the next decade in our Gastech services business, a key driver of long-term growth and earnings durability for Baker Hughes going forward. The service agreements are critical to ensuring the performance, reliability and emissions performance of LNG facilities over their full life cycle. Overall, we see sustained LNG growth well beyond 2030, driven by rising global energy demand, the push for decarbonization and infrastructure expansion in emerging markets. Baker Hughes is well positioned to capitalize on this trend, leveraging deep market expertise, innovative technology and reliable execution to support our customers with solutions that improve performance reduce emissions and enhance project economics.\nNow let me summarize the key points before handing it over to Ahmed. The first quarter was marked by strong execution and meaningful strategic progress. Operationally, we continue to form at a high level. IET delivered another quarter of strong order momentum, further demonstrating the breadth and versatility of our portfolio. At the same time, our business system continues to drive consistent performance across the company. The announced acquisition of Chart represents a significant milestone in our journey to become a leading energy and industrial technology company. We see substantial opportunity in combining our portfolios, and we expect that the acquisition will enrich our differentiated technology offerings and enhance the value we deliver to customers across critical, high-growth markets.\nAs we announced earlier this month, we are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of our capital allocation focus, business, cost structure and operations in connection with the pending acquisition of Chart. This evaluation reflects the disciplined actions we have consistently taken over the years to establish a proven track record of driving strong performance and represents a natural progression in our ongoing value creation strategy. We have made substantial progress in driving operational improvements, advancing our portfolio and delivering leading shareholder returns and we are confident that we have the right strategy to build on this momentum and continue creating long-term value for shareholders.\nLastly, I want to take this opportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to Ganesh Ramaswamy as he embarks on his next chapter as a CEO. During the past three years, Ganesh has been an exceptional leader at Baker Hughes, successfully implementing our business system and leading the organization with purpose. To maintain continuity and sustained progress within IET, Maria Claudia Borras, a seasoned and highly respected executive at Baker Hughes will step in as Interim EVP of IET.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ahmed.\n\nAhmed Moghal\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. Starting on Slide 9. As Lorenzo highlighted, we delivered another quarter of strong orders with total company bookings of $8.2 billion, including $4.1 billion from IET. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 2% year-over-year to $1.024 billion based on revenue growth of 1% as margins increased by 20 basis points to 17.7%. This performance continues to reflect the benefits of structural cost improvements and continued deployment of our business system, driving greater productivity, stronger operating leverage and more durable earnings. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.61. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $0.68.\nWe generated free cash flow of $699 million. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversion of 45% to 50%, with a typical strong performance expected in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 10. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with cash of $2.7 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.7x and liquidity of $5.7 billion. During the quarter, we returned $227 million to shareholders through dividends. Our near-term priority is to maintain the strength of our balance sheet in preparation for the closing of the Chart acquisition.\nOn portfolio management actions, I'm pleased to report that we closed the acquisition of Continental Disc Corporation on August 7, the sale of precision sensors and instrumentation and the creation of the surface pressure control JV with Cactus are progressing as expected with closing anticipated early next year. When these two divestitures close, they will reduce annual EBITDA by approximately $150 million and generate around $1.4 billion in gross cash proceeds.\nTurning to the Chart acquisition. We were pleased to receive shareholder approval on October 6. We're currently working in a number of countries to achieve the customary approvals and continue to expect the deal to close in mid-2026. As stated in the Chart acquisition announcement, our objective is to achieve a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1 to 1.5x within 24 months following the close of the deal. This reduction will be accomplished through a combination of existing cash balances, ongoing free cash flow generation and proceeds from continued portfolio management initiatives, which are anticipated to yield $1 billion of incremental proceeds.\nWe have formed an integration management office and commenced integration planning with the team at Chart. In the near term, the focus is on harmonizing systems and processes, supply chain, commercial and operations structured across 14 dedicated work streams. This disciplined and targeted approach is designed to enable a seamless integration and position us to realize the full $325 million in anticipated cost synergies.\nOur early collaborations have demonstrated that both organizations possess aligned cultural values, prioritizing the customer at the core of all activities. The integration planning team is directed by the principle of making decisions that support the future enterprise and prioritize value creation while also acknowledging the strengths and capabilities of the legacy businesses.\nIn addition to the significant cost synergies, we're excited about the commercial opportunities enabled by the combined product and technology portfolios. The combination expands Baker Hughes capabilities in key growth markets such as LNG, data centers, gas infrastructure, hydrogen and CCUS while also enhancing our ability to deliver differentiated value-added solutions to customers.\nLet's now move to our segment results, starting with IET on Slide 11. During the quarter, we secured IET orders totaling $4.1 billion, including more than $800 million of LNG equipment and a second consecutive record for Cordant Solutions. With a book-to-bill of 1.2x for the quarter, IET achieved another record RPO of $32.1 billion. This RPO level and a structurally expanding installed base provides strong revenue visibility for 2026 and beyond. IET revenue increased by 15% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, led by double-digit growth in Gas Technology Services, Gas Technology Equipment and Industrial Solutions. Segment EBITDA increased 20% year-over-year to $635 million as margins expanded by 90 basis points to 18.8%. This strong performance was led by record GTE margins and the highest Cordant Solution margins in the past four years.\nTurning to OFSE on Slide 12. OFSE revenue this quarter was $3.6 billion, up 1% sequentially. Well construction led growth with a 4% increase driven by drilling services. OFSE delivered EBITDA of $671 million, slightly above the guidance midpoint. EBITDA margins declined by 30 basis points sequentially to 18.5% as cost inflation and business mix were largely offset by cost-out initiatives and overall productivity improvements.\nIn International, revenue declined 1% sequentially, where declines in Saudi Arabia, Argentina and the North Sea were largely offset by growth in Asia Pacific and Middle East, excluding Saudi Arabia. In the Kingdom, we see the potential for measured rig additions during 2026. In North America, revenue was up 6% sequentially. Onshore revenues increased slightly compared to the second quarter significantly outperforming the 6% decline in North America land rig activity due to our strong weighting towards production-related businesses.\nIn SSPS, we continue to see positive momentum offshore, where we booked record orders led by significant subsea tree awards in Turkey and Brazil.\nMoving to Slide 13. I want to provide an update on our outlook as well as the ongoing impacts of the trade policy changes. Starting with trade policy, the net tariff impact to EBITDA remained near prior quarter levels. We now project this net impact will be at the low end of our $100 million to $200 million range. We continue to execute several mitigation actions to minimize the financial impact and these measures will continue to play a critical role in managing ongoing exposure. Note that this assumes no further trade policy escalation, including retaliatory tariffs and continued success of our mitigation actions across both segments. We are also monitoring the evolution of U.S.-China trade policies, particularly with the 90-day pause potentially ending on November 10.\nNext, I would like to update you on our outlook. The ranges for revenue, EBITDA and depreciation and amortization are shown on this slide, and I'll focus on the midpoint of our guidance ranges. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate total company adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.255 billion, primarily driven by sustained growth and margin expansion within IET. Specifically, IET's fourth quarter performance is expected to reflect ongoing momentum supported by strong revenue conversion from the segment's record backlog and continuous productivity improvements through our business system. As a result, we project IET EBITDA of $680 million, implying more than 100 basis points of the year-over-year margin increase.\nFor OFSE, we anticipate fourth quarter EBITDA of $650 million. This projection reflects the potential for tempered year-end product sales across offshore and international markets as well as anticipated E&P budget constraints affecting U.S. land.\nNow turning to our full year guidance. We have updated the ranges to include actual year-to-date results and the fourth quarter guidance. Accordingly, we are raising the midpoint of total company adjusted EBITDA to $4.74 billion. For IET, we are raising the guidance range for both revenue and EBITDA, increasing the midpoint for revenue to $13.05 billion from $12.9 billion and EBITDA to $2.4 billion from $2.35 billion.\nAdditionally, we're increasing the midpoint of the IET orders guidance range by $500 million to $14 billion, reflecting robust year-to-date results and anticipated incremental LNG and power generation orders in the fourth quarter. The major factors driving our guidance ranges for IET will be the pace of backlog conversion in GTE, the impact of any aeroderivative supply chain tightness in gas technology, foreign exchange rates and trade policy.\nFor OFSE, we're increasing the midpoint of revenue by $150 million to $14.35 billion and holding the EBITDA midpoint relatively unchanged at $2.62 billion. Factors driving our guidance ranges for OFSE include execution of our SSPS backlog, the impact on near-term activity levels in North America and international markets, trade policy, foreign exchange rates and pricing across more transactional markets.\nLooking ahead to 2026, we remain focused on delivering profitable growth alongside continued margin expansion. In IET, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth even with the PSI divestiture taken into account. This positive outlook is supported by a record backlog and another year of strong margin improvement. We remain firmly committed to achieving 20% IET margins next year.\nIn OFSE, we expect operator activity to remain subdued throughout much of 2026, suggesting a modest reduction in global upstream spending due to softening oil fundamentals. Taking into consideration the deconsolidation of SPC's results, we anticipate positive SSPS momentum into 2026 driven by strong backlog levels. Against this backdrop, we will continue to prioritize margin resilience and closing the gap with peers.\nBefore turning the call back to Lorenzo, I also wanted to briefly highlight the key financial commitments of our Horizon Two strategy, which we laid out in September at the Barclays conference. We are targeting total company margins of 20% by 2028, representing a substantial increase from our 2025 implied margin guidance. Over the next three years, we also aim to secure at least $40 billion in IET orders which highlights our strong market visibility and robust technology portfolio. Lastly, we remain committed to achieving at least 50% free cash flow conversion by 2028. These targets do not factor in the expected accretive benefits from churn.\nIn closing, we are proud of our strong third quarter operational results, which further demonstrate our commitment to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving sustainable improvements in both financial performance and operational efficiency, ensuring that our actions consistently translate into attractive returns and ongoing value creation for our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Ahmed. Our strong third quarter performance represents clear evidence of the consistent execution and operational discipline embedded across the organization. We have fundamentally changed the way we operate. And today, Baker Hughes is in its strongest position since the merger nearly a decade ago. Through Horizon One, we have delivered substantial operational improvement, expanding adjusted EBITDA margins by 320 basis points, while achieving tremendous commercial success.\nLooking ahead to Horizon Two, our focus remains on continued margin expansion, targeting a 20% margin for total company adjusted EBITDA by 2028. As we pursue our Horizon Two targets, it is important to recognize the broader context in which we operate.\nBaker Hughes sits at the convergence of the energy and industrial ecosystems at a time when their interdependence has never been more critical. The rise of AI is a transformative force driving both productivity and energy consumption. Combined with the rising energy demand in emerging economies, this reinforces our conviction that natural gas will play a central role in the global energy mix going forward. This is the age of gas, and Baker Hughes is well positioned to benefit. The Chart acquisition further expands this runway and is expected to enhance both our revenue growth profile and long-term margin expansion opportunity. We have outlined the significant commercial opportunities ahead as well as the levers to continue driving margin expansion and ultimately delivering stronger shareholder returns and meaningful sustained value for our customers and shareholders.\nAs we look to the future, we are encouraged by the breadth of the opportunity in front of us with our disciplined strategy, expanding technology portfolio and teams fully aligned we believe Baker Hughes is well positioned to deliver long-term value at the intersection of energy and industrial markets.\nTo conclude, I want to thank the entire Baker Hughes team for once again delivering outstanding results. Your passion, discipline and pursuit of excellence continue to push the company forward.\nWith that, I'll hand it back to Chase.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nOperator, we can now open for questions.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Chase Mulvehill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Baker Hughes second quarter earnings conference call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Ahmed Moghal.\nThe earnings release we issued yesterday evening can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com. We will also be using a presentation with our prepared remarks during this webcast, which can be found on our investor website.\nAs a reminder, we will provide forward-looking statements during this conference call. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and certain GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Chase. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. First, I'd like to provide a quick outline for today's call. I will begin by discussing our strong second quarter results and recently announced transactions. I will then highlight key awards and technology developments announced during the quarter and provide some thoughts on the macro backdrop. After this, I will share an update on the exciting progress we are making in the distributed power space. We have a particular focus on data centers. Ahmed will then cover our financial performance, followed by an overview of our portfolio optimization strategy and our outlook. Finally, I'll provide a quick recap before opening the line for questions.\nLet's now turn to the key highlights on Slide 4. We delivered another strong set of results, maintaining the trend of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance for the tenth consecutive quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $1.21 billion reflecting a 170 basis point year-over-year improvement in margins. This was driven by the impact of structural cost actions and stronger operational execution. We continue to make clear progress in scaling our business system, a standardized platform that enables consistent strategy execution and delivers differentiated outcomes. These efforts are driving structural margin improvement, strengthening the resilience of our earnings and laying the foundation for long-term value creation.\nThis performance reflects strong execution across both segments amid ongoing macro and industry-related headwinds. Oilfield Services and Equipment delivered 90 basis points of sequential margin improvement driven by stronger international and Subsea and Surface Pressure Systems revenue as well as meaningful progress on cost-out initiatives. In Industrial and Energy Technology margins expanded by 190 basis points year-over-year, supported by the continued deployment of our business system, which is enhancing operational discipline and execution.\nIT orders continued to demonstrate strong momentum, totaling $3.5 billion in the quarter. Notably, this was achieved with no material LNG equipment orders, once again highlighting the strength and versatility of our technology portfolio as we further expand across energy and industrial end markets.\nThis diversification is reflected in the growing demand for our data center solutions. During the quarter, we booked more than $550 million in power generation equipment orders for data centers. In addition, we experienced another strong quarter for gas tech services, upgrades and transactional bookings as customers focus on improving performance and extending the life of equipment. IT backlog grew 3% sequentially, reaching a new record of $31.3 billion, reinforcing the durability of our growth outlook.\nFollowing a strong first half and a positive outlook for the second half awards, we are confident in achieving IT's full year order guidance range of $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion. Looking beyond this year, we see continued momentum for Power Solutions, sustained growth in new energy and a robust pipeline of LNG and gas infrastructure opportunities, all of which support a constructive outlook for orders.\nDuring the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $239 million and returned a total of $423 million to shareholders, including $196 million in share repurchases.\nTurning to Slide 5. We also announced 3 strategic transactions in the quarter, to advance our portfolio optimization strategy, reinforcing efforts to enhance the durability of earnings and cash flow while creating long-term value for shareholders.\nFirst, regarding divestitures. We entered into an agreement to establish a joint venture with Cactus, contributing surface pressure control in exchange for approximately $345 million, while maintaining a minority ownership stake. Additionally, we announced the sale of precision sensors and instrumentation to Crane Company for approximately $1.15 billion. These proceeds will provide the company with increased flexibility to reinvest in higher growth, higher return opportunities, supporting further margin expansion and enhancing overall returns.\nNext, from a strategic acquisition perspective, we signed an agreement to purchase Continental Disc Corporation, a leading provider of pressure management solutions for approximately $540 million. CDC represents a high-quality bolt-on acquisition within IT, adding a highly complementary offering to our existing valves portfolio that expands our presence in the pressure and flow control market and brings margin-accretive life cycle-based revenue.\nAs we advance our portfolio optimization initiatives, we remain focused on executing a strategic and disciplined capital allocation approach to maximize long-term shareholder value. Overall, we made strong progress on multiple fronts during the quarter, and each of these actions support our commitment to profitable growth, continuous margin expansion and improving quality of earnings.\nTurning to Slide 6. We continue to build strong commercial momentum across new and existing markets with growing synergy opportunities across our portfolio that enhance how we deliver value to customers while expanding our market presence. During the quarter, IT secured 2 significant data center awards. First, we received our largest data center award to date for 30 NovaLT gas turbines. These units will deliver almost 500 megawatts of power to data centers in the United States and operate on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen, supporting both reliability and lower carbon operations.\nSecond, we received an order for 16 NovaLT gas turbine representing up to 270 megawatts of power for deployment of Frontier's data centers in Wyoming and Texas. This award is the first phase of the previously announced enterprise-wide agreement with Frontier to advance power solutions and large-scale carbon capture and storage. These awards reflect the accelerating long-term demand for distributed, lower carbon power in support of digital infrastructure. This trend is also unlocking greater commercial synergies across our power and decarbonization portfolios, reinforcing the potential for sustained data center and new energy growth.\nIn total, ID booked 69 NovaLT units this quarter with more than 70% allocated to data center projects. Year-to-date, we have secured almost 1.2 gigawatts of NovaLT capacity for data center applications, highlighting our expanding role in enabling the growth of digital infrastructure through flexible, lower carbon power solutions.\nWe are also expanding our pipeline of future digital infrastructure opportunities. At the recent Saudi U.S. Investment Forum, we signed an MOU with Data Vault for data center projects globally, which includes plans to power data centers in the Kingdom with our NovaLT turbines using hydrogen from Neon.\nBeyond data centers, we continue to see strong demand in gas infrastructure. In Saudi Arabia, we secured an award for 4 NovaLT turbines to support Aramco's Master gas system free pipeline. Also, in Climate Technology Solutions, we signed a framework agreement with Inger to supply 16 reciprocating compressor packages, supporting an increase in biogas production while driving emissions reduction for gas infrastructure in Denmark.\nIn GTS, we secured more than $350 million in contractual service agreements during the quarter, strengthening our backlog of recurring revenue. Key awards included a new maintenance agreement with Petrobel to improve uptime and reliability of critical turbomachinery equipment and a renewal of a multiyear service contract with Oman LNG, featuring remote monitoring and diagnostic services delivered through our iCenter.\nIn New Energy, we continue to build momentum internationally, where we have historically seen the greatest concentration of orders. During the quarter, CTS secured one of the largest CCS orders to date, providing compression technology for a large CCS hub in the Middle East.\nIn geothermal, we successfully drilled Lower Saxony first productive deep exploration well in Germany. This project highlights the strength of our integrated well construction and production solutions capabilities supported by advanced digital solutions that optimize performance.\nIn OFSE, we maintained strong momentum in production and mature asset solutions, booking several meaningful awards. Notably, we signed a significant master services agreement with Aramco for installation and maintenance of electric submersible pumps across the Kingdom. We also received 2 large multiyear contracts to help optimize production, throughput and reliability for 2 major operators in offshore Angola and the U.S. Gulf Coast, leveraging our chemicals, artificial lift and digital solutions.\nIn Norway, Equinor awarded us a contract to industrialize offshore plug and abandonment operations in the Oseberg East field, which followed the announcement of a new multiyear framework agreement for integrated wealth services. OFSE also secured a multiyear contract to provide drag-reducing chemicals to be deployed on 2 major offshore pipeline systems operated by Genesis Energy. To support this agreement, we will expand our chemicals manufacturing footprint and deploy Lucepa, our digitally automated fuel production solution. Also for Lacepa, we received an award from Repsol for next-generation AI capabilities and entered into a new agreement with ENI to deploy Lucipa for ESP optimization and AI-driven predictive analytics in the Middle East.\nContinuing on digital. Cordant Solutions secured a notable contract with a large NOC to deploy asset performance management for several compressor stations in the Middle East. Cordant Solutions was also awarded a contract with Nova Chemicals to optimize maintenance and maximize production across multiple petrochemical facilities, leveraging APM's asset strategy and asset health digital offerings.\nOverall, it was another strong quarter, both from a commercial and technology engagement perspective. We are building strong order and technology pipelines that extend beyond our traditional oil and gas markets, creating additional life cycle growth opportunities that further enhance our earnings and cash flow durability.\nTurning to the macro on Slide 7. Amid continued macro uncertainty, I want to take a moment to reaffirm the strong long-term fundamentals underpinning our business. Global energy demand continues to grow, supported by durable secular macro trends that are shaping the future of the energy landscape. Population growth, particularly in emerging markets, is driving baseline demand for energy across residential, mobility and infrastructure. At the same time, continued economic development and industrialization are expanding energy needs across critical sectors such as manufacturing, transportation and technology.\nUrbanization and the global push for electrification are accelerating the build-out of modern energy systems. This includes both expanding access to reliable electricity and supporting new demand drivers like data centers and industrial decarbonization. Amid this backdrop, there is a global push for lower carbon solutions as countries advance their emission reduction goals. In response, we are seeing increased investment in clean power CCUS, emissions abatement, geothermal and hydrogen. These markets require scalable, flexible and efficient energy solutions. Capabilities that are core to make use and essential to enabling a lower carbon economy.\nConsistent with this trend, we booked $1 billion in new energy orders during the quarter, bringing year-to-date bookings to $1.25 billion, already matching our total for last year. As a result, we now anticipate exceeding the high end of our $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion order range for this year. This performance reflects increasing global demand for lower carbon solutions and reinforces our confidence in achieving our $6 billion to $7 billion order target by 2030.\nCollectively, these macro trends support a strong long-term outlook for the global energy and industrial landscape as customers increasingly prioritize efficiency, reliability and sustainability. It is an environment aligned with our strengths and one that positions us to capitalize on the significant opportunities ahead.\nNow turning to natural gas. We continue to see growing divergence between oil and natural gas fundamentals. It's abundance, low-cost reliability and lower emissions set natural gas apart from other fossil fuels. This year is increasingly being validated across policy and market dynamics. While we expect significant growth from renewables, scaling these technologies at pace required to meet growing energy needs remains a challenge, particularly in light of supply chain constraints, permitting delays, cost inflation and less favorable policy support. These challenges further reinforce the positive long-term outlook for natural gas.\nBy 2040, we expect natural gas demand to grow by over 20% with global LNG increasing by at least 75%. This growth outlook creates a favorable environment for Baker Hughes. We are already seeing strong momentum, booking $2.9 billion in gas infrastructure equipment orders over the past 6 quarters, a trend we expect to continue as countries turn to natural gas to support power generation and industrial development.\nIn LNG, approximately 60 MTPA of additional FIDs are needed over the next 18 months to reach our 3-year target of 100 MTPA, which would bring the global installed base to our long-held target of 800 MTPA by 2030. Beyond this, we see continued growth in the installed base as energy demand and emission reduction efforts convert.\nThis year, LNG demand continues to grow rapidly, up 5% year-over-year as softness in China is more than offset by strength in Europe. This increase in demand is driving sustained momentum in LNG contracting activity. For example, with Mackenzie reports 49 MTPA of long-term LNG offtake contracts have been signed in the first half of the year, positioning 2025 to exceed the record 81 MTPA signed last year.\nNow turning to our markets. This year has been marked by heightened volatility, with Brent prices ranging from a lower $60 per barrel in early May to a high of $77 per barrel in June, with continued volatility into July. The market continues to navigate cross currents, balancing weakening demand and rising OPEC+ production against persistent geopolitical risk in both the Middle East and Russia. As we look into the second half of the year, we expect continued volatility as OPEC+ accelerates the return of its 2.2 million barrels per day of idled production into what we anticipate will be a soft market. Ultimately, until all excess OPEC+ barrels are absorbed by the market, we anticipate oil-related upstream spending will remain subdued.\nOn global upstream spending, we maintain our outlook for a high single-digit decline this year. In International, we now expect spending to decline toward the high end of our mid- to high single-digit range, given downward pressure in key countries such as Saudi Arabia and Mexico. In North America, we still project spending to decline in the low double digits. These forecasts assume current oil prices hold and no further trade policy escalation. Any meaningful deterioration in EVA could present incremental downside.\nLonger term, we expect oil demand to grow beyond 2030. To meet that demand, significant investments will be required. In addition, we anticipate growing customer focus on mitigating reservoir decline and optimizing production efficiency. This underscores our strategic focus on mature asset solutions in OFSE. These technologies will improve production reliability, boost field performance and expand our presence in more durable OpEx-led production market, increasing the resilience of our revenue base.\nTurning to Slide 8. I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss the opportunity we see in distributed power solutions for data center market and beyond. Distributed power represents a compelling growth vector for Baker Hughes, drawing on multiple parts of our enterprise, from industrial gas turbines and electric motors to geothermal and CCS technologies. This opportunity broadens our market exposure to digital infrastructure and reinforces the stability of our earnings and cash flow through life cycle-driven equipment and service revenue.\nAccording to IEA, the global energy consumption from data centers is expected to more than double, reaching 945 terawatt hours by 2030. In the U.S., electricity demand for data processing alone is projected to surpass the combined power needs of all energy-intensive manufacturing sectors, including aluminum, steel, cement and chemicals. To support this surge in power requirements, gas turbine manufacturers are experiencing robust order activity across both utility scale and sub utility-scale power applications.\nOur portfolio is well suited for the sub-utility scale behind the meter solutions, providing advanced technology and shorter deployment time lines with our hydrogen-ready NovaLT 12 and 16-megawatt turbines as well as brush electric generators. To meet rising demand, we continue to make targeted organic investments to enhance our NovaLT capabilities, including initiatives to increase power range and reduce start-up times. In addition, activities are underway to significantly increase our manufacturing capacity by 2027, capitalizing on strong order visibility.\nIn the utility scale space, our geothermal solutions offer customers reliable and scalable baseload power, supported by IET's organic ranking cycle, Steam Tubin Technologies, and OFE's subsurface expertise. More broadly, we are seeing expanded market opportunities to deploy advanced and enhanced geothermal technologies to deliver dispatchable, low carbon power to data centers. Additionally, we are collaborating on the development of the utility and industrial scale Net power solutions, further expanding our power range in enabling near 0 emissions power generation.\nThe growing frequency of grid disruptions is prompting industries with critical operations to seek more reliable on-site power solutions. This shift is especially evident in sectors like energy, health care, data centers, airports and other mission-critical infrastructure, where our distributed power offerings are well positioned to meet this emerging need for behind the meter power.\nBuilding on the momentum from our recent data center-related awards totaling more than $650 million year-to-date, we are making strong progress towards our 3-year target of $1.5 billion. The pace of recent awards positions us to meet or exceed this target earlier than planned. Importantly, this excludes the substantial recurring revenue opportunity tied to aftermarket services, which typically generate 1 to 2x the original equipment value over a 20-year period.\nIn summary, the surging momentum in data center development is reinforcing IT's fundamental demand drivers, while also increasing the pipeline of enterprise-wide opportunities. We are expanding into attractive high-growth markets beyond our traditional oil and gas space, creating new avenues for growth while further strengthening the durability of our earnings and cash flow.\nTo conclude, it was another strong quarter for the company with significant progress on several fronts despite the challenges presented by the external environment. Our focus remains on the areas within our control. Most notably, the continued deployment of our business system across the enterprise, which is driving productivity and accelerating our efforts to be a leaner, more efficient company.\nBaker Hughes is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and create long-term shareholder value. We are excited about the future as we advance into the next phase of our journey.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ahmed.\n\nAhmed Moghal\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results and segment performance. I will then outline our portfolio optimization strategy and conclude with a summary of our outlook before turning it back to Lorenzo for final remarks.\nStarting on Slide 10. As Lorenzo highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter of orders with total company bookings of $7 billion, including $3.5 billion from IET. This performance demonstrates continued customer confidence in our diversified portfolio and underscores the strength and breadth of our market-leading technologies and solutions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by 7% year-over-year to $1.21 billion despite lower revenue, driven by strong margin expansion across both segments. This performance reflects the benefits of structural cost improvements and continued deployment of our business system, which is driving greater productivity, stronger operating leverage and more durable earnings.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $0.63, up 11% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $239 million. For the full year, we maintained our free cash flow conversion target of 45% to 50%, with a typical stronger performance expected in the second half of the year.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 11. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with cash of $3.1 billion and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.6x and liquidity of $6.1 billion. We also returned $423 million to shareholders. This included $227 million of dividends and $196 million in share repurchases. We remain committed to returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders.\nThe portfolio optimization actions announced in the second quarter are expected to generate about $1 billion in net proceeds upon closure of these transactions, further strengthening our balance sheet and increasing flexibility for organic investments, shareholder returns and value accretive acquisitions.\nI will now highlight the results for both segments, starting with IET on Slide 12. During the quarter, we secured IET orders totaling $3.5 billion, including record bookings for both CTS and Cordant Solutions as well as a 28% year-over-year increase in GTS, driven by another strong quarter of upgrades and transactional orders. This brings our year-to-date total to $6.7 billion, which includes $1.9 billion in GTS, $1.4 billion for LNG and gas infrastructure and more than $650 million for data center power solutions.\nThese commercial achievements further underscore the versatility of our technology portfolio and our strategic positioning to benefit from multiple secular growth trends across the energy and industrial sectors. With a book-to-bill of 1.1x for the quarter, IET achieved another record RPO of $31.3 billion. This RPO level and a structurally expanding installed base provides strong revenue visibility in the years ahead. IET revenue increased by 5% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, led by a 9% increase in GTS and 22% increase in CTS, partially offset by the expected softness in Industrial Tech. Segment EBITDA growth significantly outpaced segment revenue, increasing 18% year-over-year as margins expanded by 190 basis points to 17.8% despite some tariff-related headwinds. This performance was driven by record Gastech equipment margins and strong execution in Cordant Solutions partially offset by CTS.\nThese results clearly highlight the benefit of our business system implementation. Now in its third year, this disciplined operating model is focused on performance management, strategy deployment and continuous improvement. Rooted in Lean and Kaizen principles, it is equipping teams across the enterprise with tools to simplify workflows, eliminate waste and improve execution, ultimately supporting progress towards our 20% EBITDA margin target.\nTurning to OFSE on Slide 13. OFSE revenue in the quarter was $3.6 billion, up 3% sequentially. In international markets, revenue increased 4% sequentially, led by Europe and Middle East, excluding Saudi Arabia, where activity continued to trend lower. We also saw solid growth in Latin America, driven by Mexico. While upstream activity in Mexico remains subdued, we experienced strong growth in chemicals as refiners work to address rising crude quality challenges.\nIn North America, revenue was up 1% sequentially. North America land revenues remained stable compared to the first quarter, outperforming the 3% decline in U.S. onshore rig activity due to our strong weighting towards production-related work. Driven by disciplined execution and a continued focus on cost efficiencies, OFSE delivered EBITDA of $677 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range despite a challenging market. Importantly, EBITDA margins expanded 90 basis points sequentially to 18.7%.\nTurning to Slide 14. I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight the progress we've made on portfolio optimization and how we are advancing the strategic priority as we transition from Horizon One, a period defined by significant operational improvement, into Horizon Two, which will be characterized by continued execution discipline and an increased focus on strategic growth particularly in industrial, new energy markets and mature asset solutions.\nWe have remained focused on reshaping the portfolio to drive higher profitability and position Baker Hughes for more durable long-term growth. Including the $1.5 billion of expected proceeds from the PSI and SPC transactions, we will have generated over $2.5 billion in cash from a series of strategic actions since the merger in 2017. Our divested businesses will now be with owners where they are a stronger strategic fit, while enabling Baker Hughes to further streamline its portfolio and concentrate on higher-margin recurring revenue opportunities. These transactions have unlocked significant value, strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our strategic focus and flexibility.\nWe have also been disciplined in how we've redeployed this capital. Including the acquisition of CDC, we have reinvested approximately $1.8 billion to expand our industrial presence and align with long-term growth trends. Other notable investments include brush electric motors, which expanded IET's driver and power generation offerings and Altus intervention, which strengthened our capabilities within mature asset solutions. We have also made early stage investments in decarbonization technologies that once commercialized, could drive meaningful long-term growth.\nThe combination of the PSI divestiture and CDC acquisition is a clear example of our portfolio strategy in action. We are monetizing noncore assets and unlocking significant value while reinvesting into higher-margin, recurring revenue businesses at attractive multiples that enhance returns. Collectively, these actions advance our strategy to reshape the portfolio for more resilient earnings and cash flows. They demonstrate our disciplined approach, prioritizing strategic fit, exposure to growth markets, accretive margins and returns and life cycle-based business models. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in opportunities that strengthen our industrial footprint and unlock meaningful synergies.\nOur ability to integrate acquisitions effectively is enabled by the strength of our business system. It provides the structure, discipline and repeatability to execute with speed and consistency, accelerating synergy capture and driving faster value creation. With a net leverage ratio of 0.6x EBITDA, we have ample capacity to pursue value-accretive opportunities, including high-return organic investments, disciplined M&A and continued capital return to shareholders. This financial flexibility enables us to allocate capital with precision and purpose with a clear focus on actions to accelerate revenue growth, enhance margins, improve returns and strengthen our long-term position. Our ultimate objective remains the same, to maximize long-term shareholder value and position Baker Hughes for sustainable differentiated growth.\nTurning to Slide 15. I want to provide an update on the dynamic trade policy environment and our outlook. In the second quarter, we estimate that the increase in tariff rates negatively impacted our EBITDA by approximately $15 million. We executed a series of mitigation initiatives that help limit the financial impact and these actions will continue to play a critical role in managing ongoing exposure.\nSince our trade policy update on our previous earnings call, there have been several changes, both implemented and proposed relative to the tariff rates assumed in our original analysis. At a high level, our updated analysis suggests that these developments largely offset each other. As a result, we are maintaining the previously communicated estimate of $100 million to $200 million net EBITDA impact for the year. Note that this assumes recently announced tariffs are implemented as planned, no further trade policy escalation, including retaliatory tariffs and continued success of our mitigation actions across both segments.\nWe are tracking the risk for retaliatory tariffs in key regions. While not currently reflected in our net tariff impact estimate, we remain prepared to implement additional mitigation initiatives to limit where possible, any further impact on our global operations and financial performance. Beyond the direct impact of ongoing trade policy shifts, we continue to monitor potential secondary effects such as more cautious customer behavior and signs of broader economic weakness.\nNext, I would like to update you on our outlook. The details of our third quarter and full year 2025 guidance are also found on Slide 15. The ranges for revenue, EBITDA and depreciation and amortization are shown on this slide, and I will focus on the midpoint of our guidance. While there's still volatility around trade policy developments, we have been successfully executing our mitigation plans and our underlying business continues to perform well. In light of these factors and consistent with our commitment to transparency, we are reestablishing full year guidance for both segments and the company overall.\nFor the third quarter, we expect total company EBITDA of approximately $1.185 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range, led by continued strong growth in IET and resilient margins in OFSE. For IET, we expect third quarter results to benefit from continued productivity gains supported by the enhanced implementation of our business system as well as strong revenue conversion from the segment's record backlog. Overall, we anticipate IET EBITDA of $600 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. For OFSE, we expect third quarter EBITDA of $665 million at the midpoint of our guidance range which represents flat sequential margins on a slight revenue decline.\nNow turning to our full year guidance. We see continued strength in IET fundamentals, while OFSE remains challenged by subdued market conditions. Taking this into account, we expect total company EBITDA of $4.675 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range. In IET, we maintained the midpoint of our orders guidance range of $13.5 billion given our solid first half orders performance and positive outlook for the second half, particularly in LNG. Also, we are raising the guidance range for both revenue and EBITDA, increasing the midpoint for revenue to $12.9 billion from $12.75 billion and EBITDA to $2.35 billion from $2.3 billion.\nThe major factors driving our third quarter and full year guidance ranges for IET will be the pace of backlog conversion in GTE. The impact of any aeroderivative supply chain tightness in Gas Tech, foreign exchange rates, trade policy and operational execution in Industrial Tech and CTS.\nFor OFSE, we are reestablishing full year guidance with midpoints of $14.2 billion for revenue and $2.625 billion for EBITDA, implying margin improvement despite lower revenue, driven by strong execution of our structural cost-out program and reinforcing the durability of our margins. Factors driving our third quarter and full year guidance range for OFSE include execution of our SSPS backlog, the impact on near-term activity levels in North America and international markets, trade policy and pricing across more transactional markets.\nWe remain confident in our ability to deliver solid performance in 2025 with continued growth in IET helping to offset softness in more market sensitive areas of OFSE, underscoring the strength of our portfolio and the benefits of our strategic diversification.\nIn summary, we are pleased with the company's operational performance during the second quarter. OFSE delivered strong margin performance despite softness in the upstream market, while IET margins continued to progress towards our 20% target. We remain focused on elements within our control, streamlining operations and driving efficiencies that will benefit us well beyond the cycle.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Ahmed. Our strong second quarter results clearly demonstrate the continued progress we are making in transforming our operations and streamlining the organization, even in a challenging and uncertain market environment.\nAs you can see illustrated on Slide 17, we have evolved into a much more profitable energy and industrial technology company. At the midpoint of our 2025 guidance, Baker Hughes EBITDA margin will have increased by almost 600 basis points over the past 5 years. Additionally, EBITDA has more than doubled over the same period. The magnitude of this improvement speaks to the substantial progress we've made and reinforces our confidence in the strategic vision we set out when we formed the company.\nWe are entering Horizon Two from a position of strength, with a clear path to drive further growth and enhanced margins, underscoring our commitment to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. Our business system is a critical enabler for continued success, driving operational discipline, improving productivity and accelerating the consistency of execution.\nWe are now complementing our operational efforts with additional portfolio optimization actions. These transactions announced in the second quarter serve as a clear blueprint for our strategy, unlocking value from noncore businesses and recycling that capital into higher-margin opportunities aligned with our financial and strategic frameworks.\nIn addition to our operational and portfolio progress, our complementary and versatile technology portfolio supports our strong position in key growth markets, including natural gas, new energy and mature basins. This enables us to capitalize on emerging secular trends, driving sustained order momentum into Horizon Two and beyond.\nThe opportunities emerging within these growth markets are fostering enhanced commercial integration throughout the company. By leveraging our enterprise-wide customer relationships, cross-segment sales channels and integrated offerings, we will be able to drive incremental growth and capture a greater share of our addressable market.\nTo conclude, thank you to the entire Baker Hughes team for yet again delivering outstanding results. As we continue our journey to take Baker Hughes and Energy forward, we remain committed to our customers, shareholders and employees.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Chase.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nOperator, we can now open up for questions.",

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Chase Mulvehill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Baker Hughes First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Ahmed Moghal. The earnings release we issued yesterday evening can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com. We will also be using a presentation with our prepared remarks during this webcast, which can be found on our investor website.\nAs a reminder, we will provide forward-looking statements during this conference call. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and certain GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Chase. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before getting into the results, I would like to welcome Ahmed to the earnings call as our new CFO. Ahmed brings extensive experience and a deep understanding of the Baker Hughes portfolio. He will collaborate with me and the broader executive team to advance our strategic priorities with a clear focus on profitable growth and sustained margin improvement.\nNow let me start by providing a quick outline for today's call. I will begin by providing our thoughts on the macro environment before discussing our strong first quarter results. I will then highlight key awards and technology developments announced during the quarter. After this, I will briefly speak to our outlook before handing the call over to Ahmed, who will provide more details on our financial performance, walk through the potential tariff impacts to our business and provide further detail around our outlook. Ahmed will then hand it back to me for a quick recap before we open the line for questions.\nNow let's turn to our macro outlook. Starting on Slide 4. The global economy has started cautiously this year due to ongoing geopolitical tensions, uncertainty around trade policy and tariffs, China's slower growth rate and lingering inflationary pressures. Specifically for Baker Hughes, we continue to monitor the evolving landscape closely and are taking proactive steps to mitigate the potential impact of changes in trade policy, particularly tariff rates. Broadly speaking, our strong weighting to international markets, along with a diversified, localized supply chain and established competitive position helps reduce our overall financial exposure. Later during the call, Ahmed will provide more detail on the potential implications for Baker Hughes.\nTurning to oil markets. There are several factors driving downward pressure on oil prices. As announced earlier in the first quarter, OPEC+ has now begun executing its plan to return 2.2 million barrels per day of previously idled oil production to the market. Subsequently, oil prices saw increased volatility stemming from elevated tariff uncertainty that's affecting global GDP and oil demand.\nWith the softening macro backdrop, we now expect global upstream spending to be down by high single digits in 2025, including a mid- to high single-digit decline internationally and a low double-digit decrease in North America. Excluding Mexico, international upstream spend is expected to fall in the low to mid-single-digit range. These expectations assume a stabilization of oil prices around the current levels and tariffs hold at the current 90-day pause rates. A sustained move lower in oil prices or worsening tariffs would introduce further downside risk to this outlook.\nThe prospects of an oversupplied oil market, rising tariffs, uncertainty in Mexico and activity weakness in Saudi Arabia are collectively constraining international upstream spending levels. Amid broader market softness, we see pockets of resilience in key international markets like Brazil and several countries in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. In North America, discretionary spending delays are extending into the second quarter, driven by ongoing uncertainty. Additionally, recent oil price volatility presents potential downside to second half activity, particularly in U.S. land. While second half visibility remains limited, we expect to outperform the broader North American market supported by our production weighted portfolio.\nOn natural gas, we see a more positive outlook. Long-cycle gas-levered projects in LNG, gas infrastructure and data centers continue to make progress towards FID. Rising gas-fired power demand underscores a long-term shift in market fundamentals and affected by near-term macroeconomic volatility. To this point, natural gas demonstrated the strongest increase in demand among fossil fuels in 2024, led by a significant increase in power consumption. According to the IEA, gas demand increased by 115 bcm or 2.7% compared with an average of 75 bcm annually over the past decade.\nStrong gas fundamentals remain positive for LNG contracting trends. Wood Mackenzie reports that 15.5 MTPA of long-term LNG offtake contracts were signed in the first quarter, following a record 81 MTPA last year. These statistics highlight consumer confidence in long-term global LNG and natural gas demand. In the U.S. The repeal of the LNG permitting moratorium and the administration's stated goal of increasing U.S. LNG exports has led to an improvement in orders for U.S. LNG projects. We have now booked around $1.7 billion of orders for U.S. LNG projects over the past 2 quarters. Given this positive backdrop, several key LNG customers in the Gulf Coast are indicating plans to further expand capacity beyond 2030. This offers greater clarity regarding the potential increase an installed capacity above the anticipated 800 MTPA by the end of the decade.\nI would now like to address our outlook given the current macroeconomic environment. We have a clear view of the near-term direct impact that tariffs will have on our business and are actively implementing a number of mitigation actions. However, the ongoing and dynamic trade negotiations between the U.S. and its trading partners, and the uncertainty regarding the eventual status of tariff rates and other trade policies across key markets, introduce a high degree of variability. Given this backdrop, we are providing our second quarter guidance along with a framework for our 2025 outlook, which Ahmed will cover in more detail later.\nAs we evaluate the path forward, it is important to recognize the different dynamics across our segments. OFSE is facing a wider range of potential outcomes driven by reduced upstream spending tariff-related cost inflation and exposure to more cyclical markets, limiting visibility beyond the current quarter. IET offers greater visibility and is well positioned in this environment, supported by a healthy equipment backlog, substantial recurring revenues and strong operational performance, underscoring the strength and balance of our portfolio. We remain confident in our strategy. Our focus is on the areas within our control, driving productivity, executing with discipline and accelerating our efforts to be a leaner, more efficient company.\nTurning to our first quarter operational performance on Slide 5. We delivered strong results maintaining the trend of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance for the 9th consecutive quarter. We also set new first quarter records for revenue and our adjusted measures of EPS, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.04 billion increased by 10% year-over-year led by IET, where EBITDA has increased by at least 30% for 5 consecutive quarters. Industrial & Energy Technology experienced a solid start to the year booking $3.2 billion of orders with segment backlog reaching another record level of $30.4 billion. Excluding LNG equipment, orders totaled a robust $2.7 billion. During the quarter, we generated free cash flow of $454 million and returned a total of $417 million to shareholders.\nOur strong first quarter results reflect our commitment to profitable growth and continuous margin improvement. Solid operational execution and transformation progress are driving structural margin improvement with our adjusted EBITDA margin expanding by 140 basis points to 16.1%, including gains across both segments, even as a softer upstream market weighed on OFSE.\nTurning to Slide 6. We are witnessing strong commercial momentum across new and existing markets. This was reinforced by the record attendance at our recent Annual Meeting in Florence, Italy which brought together over 2,300 customers and delegates from 85 countries. Importantly, we had representation across industrial and energy ecosystems. Including participants from mining, steel, cement, industrial power generation and data center markets. Following several customer engagements at this event, we booked multiple data center awards, marking our entrance into this market and further expanding IET's industrial reach.\nOf the 35 NovaLTs booked during the quarter, 22 will be utilized to power data centers. This amounts to more than 350 megawatts of power for this high-growth market. In March, we signed an agreement with Frontier Infrastructure to develop large-scale CCS and power solutions for data centers including the development of behind-the-meter gas-fired power generation that will utilize on NovaLT turbines. This partnership will leverage technologies and services across Baker Hughes by providing CO2 compression, industrial gas turbines, digital monitoring solutions, well construction and completion services.\nWe also secured an order from Turbine-X Energy, one of Baker Hughes network of authorized packages in North America. The scope includes NovaLT gas turbines gears and power generation technology for microgrid solutions to power data centers. In gas infrastructure, we secured an award in North America for 2 pipeline compression stations which will provide feed gas to a Gulf Coast LNG facility. This award includes a total of 10 gas turbines and 10 centrifical compressors. Generally, we see growing opportunities in North America for gas infrastructure driven by LNG capacity expansion along the Gulf Coast and AI-led demand for gas pad data centers.\nWe also received an award to supply our NovaLT gas turbine and a pipeline compressor for a gas boosting station in the U.K. This equipment order is part of National Gas Transmission's broader investment to enhance the U.K.'s gas infrastructure, ensuring energy security and reducing overall emissions.\nIn LNG, we secured an order for a liquefaction train in North America. We will provide 4 main refrigerant compressors driven by LM6000 gas turbines and four, expand the compressors. We also saw key strategic framework agreements with NextDecade in Argent LNG, growing our pipeline of potential orders. For NextDecade, the scope includes equipment for 5 additional trains totaling 30 MTPA of liquefaction capacity at the Rio Grande LNG facility. This will be complemented by contractual services agreements for these equipment packages. Argent LNG has selected Baker Hughes to provide liquefaction, power solutions and related aftermarket services for its proposed 24 MTPA LNG export facility in Louisiana.\nImportantly, the project will employ Bakers Hughes nimble modularized LNG solution driven by the LM9000 gas turbine while also utilizing our iCenter and Cordant digital solutions. including NextDecade in Argent, we now have LNG supply agreements in place for over 120 MTPA. This provides visibility for potential LNG equipment orders into the latter part of this decade.\nIn Gas Tech Services, we experienced a record quarter for upgrade orders increasing by 167% year-over-year as many operators look to drive efficiencies, reduce emissions and extend the life of their gas infrastructure projects. This was the largest order quarter for upgrades in the history of the company. In the Middle East, we received a significant upgrade award to support one of the world's largest gas processing plants. The scope includes the upgrade of 2 existing gas turbines to drive new compressors and the supply of a third compression train to support production expansion. Separately, the team is partnering with SONATRACH to deliver an upgrade solution to support the modernization of a key compressor station in Algeria.\nTurning to Oilfield Services & Equipment. We experienced sustained commercial momentum through market uncertainty during the first quarter. Petrobras continues to leverage our innovative solutions to help unlock Brazil's vast energy supply. During the quarter, Baker Hughes received a major integrated completion systems order across multiple deepwater fields in Brazil. In Mature Asset Solutions, OFSE received an award from Sakar in Azerbaijan to expand deployment of [ Lacipa ] to all wells in the [ Uber chron ] and [ Gunell ] fields including those with non-Baker Hughes electric submersible pumps. We also signed a multiyear frame agreement with [ Equinor ] to provide plugging services on the Norwegian continental shelf. As part of this agreement, Baker Hughes' Mature Asset Solutions team will lead the integrated plug and abandonment campaign, managing the planning and execution across the North Seas [ Osage ] East field.\nAcross the Baker Hughes Enterprise, we are capturing increasing commercial synergies between OFSE and IET. Through our early engagement on gas infrastructure, CCUS, geothermal and data center products. Looking out to horizon 2, our pipeline of enterprise-wide opportunities continues to grow as customers seek solutions to address their energy efficiency and decarbonization needs. In addition to the previously mentioned Frontier agreement, we booked 2 orders that highlight commercial synergies across the enterprise. OFSE was awarded a multiyear contract to provide integrated coiled tubing drilling services on the Margham Gas storage project in Dubai. This award was facilitated by IETs existing customer relationship with Dubai Supply Authority who previously ordered ICL compressors for the same project. We are also observing this commercial trend offshore.\nIn OFSE, we received a significant multiyear award from ExxonMobil Guyana to provide specialty chemicals and related services for FPSOs. And which complements our IET scope that includes power generation and compression equipment previously awarded.\nMoving to new energy. We booked $238 million of orders and maintain our 2025 order target of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. During the quarter, we booked an award to supply 3 electric motor-driven CO2 compression drains and gearboxes for a CCS project in Northwestern Europe. We also made progress on several new energy technology developments. In geothermal, we have been selected by the U.S. Air Force and the Department of Defense to explore the development of utility-scale geothermal power. During the quarter, we also announced the joint development and collaboration agreement with [ HA ] for the development of a new small-scale turbine for ammonia applications. The new ammonia turbine will be suitable across shipping, FPSO and gas infrastructure markets.\nOverall, we had a positive start to the year from a commercial and technology engagement perspective and remain confident in our IET orders guidance range this year. We are building strong order and technology pipelines that extend beyond our traditional oil and gas markets, providing additional life cycle growth opportunities that further enhance our earnings durability. Baker Hughes is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value, and we're excited of the future as we advance into the next phase of our journey.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Ahmed, who will provide more details on our quarterly results, tariff exposure and guidance.\n\nAhmed Moghal\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I'll begin on Slide 8 with an overview of our consolidated results and then speak to segment performance before providing details of our exposure to evolving trade policy and tariffs. I will also provide a quick summary of our outlook before handing it back to Lorenzo for final comments.\nAs Lorenzo mentioned, orders got off to a solid start to the year, booking $6.5 billion for the total company and included $3.2 billion in IET. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 10% year-over-year to $1.04 billion, driven by strong IET revenue growth and continued margin expansion across both segments. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.40, excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $0.51, an increase of 19% when compared to the same quarter last year. We generated free cash flow of $454 million for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to target free cash flow conversion of 45% to 50%, with the normal weighting towards the second half of the year.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 9. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position, ending the first quarter with cash of $3.3 billion, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.6x and liquidity of $6.3 billion. Our next debt maturity is not until December 2026, and S&P recently upgraded our long-term credit rating to A. We returned $417 million to shareholders in the first quarter. This included $229 million of dividends and $188 million of share repurchases. We remain committed to returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders.\nI will now highlight the results for both segments, starting with IET on Slide 10. During the quarter, we booked solid IET orders of $3.2 billion. This included $510 million for LNG equipment, $104 million for data centers and record gas tech service upgrades of $272 million. Book-to-bill was 1.1x, resulting in IET RPO of $30.4 billion that reached a new record. This RPO level and a structural growing installed base provides significant revenue visibility for IET over the coming years. IET revenue increased by 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, led by a 20% increase in gas tech equipment and 114% growth in Climate Tech Solutions, partially offset by Gas Tech Services.\nEBITDA growth significantly outpaced segment revenue, increasing 30% year-over-year as margins expanded by 240 basis points to 17.1% despite mixed headwinds. This performance was driven by a strong margin expansion in Gas Tech Equipment supported by productivity from project closeouts. IET continues to benefit from the lean strategies being adopted across operations that are driving structural margin improvement.\nTurning to OFSE on Slide 11. OFSE revenue in the quarter was $3.5 billion, down 10% sequentially as we experienced enhanced seasonal weakness across many international markets. Economic and tariff uncertainty to start the year resulted in customers delaying discretionary spending primarily impacting direct equipment sales. In international markets, revenue declined 11% sequentially, driven by a significant slowdown in activity in Mexico. Rig activity in Mexico declined sequentially by 52%, now down 72% from 2023's peak levels. Excluding Mexico and SSBS, international revenue was down 7% sequentially, more aligned with typical seasonal declines. In North America, revenue declined 5% sequentially and driven by seasonal weakness in offshore. North America land was down 3% as strength in drilling services and drill bits were offset by lower revenue across most other businesses.\nOFSE EBITDA margin rate was 17.8%, improving 80 basis points year-over-year, even with segment revenue declining by 8%. This is a testament to the team's hard work to structurally change the way we operate. Due to the previously mentioned Mexico weakness and delays in discretionary customer spending, segment EBITDA of $623 million was between the low and midpoint of our guidance range.\nTurning to Slide 12. I want to walk through our outlook and how the current environment could impact performance. I'll begin by outlining the potential tariff impacts to Baker Hughes and walk through our full year framework and conclude with detailed guidance for the second quarter.\nWhile the situation remains fluid, we have been conducting comprehensive scenario planning exercises and continue to develop and implement mitigation strategies to manage through this period of volatility.\nIn our OFSE segment, our strong international presence provides us a degree of protection against tariff impacts since approximately 80% of segment revenue is derived from markets outside the U.S. Domestically, we benefit from our broad [ bus ] manufacturing footprint and a resilient local supply chain. However, we do expect some cost headwinds tied to [ imports ] from China, Germany and the U.K. We also source some oilfield components and chemicals from Canada and Mexico, a portion of which qualify under [ USMCA ] provisions. To reduce reliance on these imports for OFSE, we have been working with U.S. supply chain partners to increase domestic sourcing. Additionally, we have engaged with customers on cost recovery initiatives which have led to encouraging outcomes to date.\nWithin IET, we have identified 3 areas of tariff exposure. First, a portion of Industrial Tech's U.S. volumes exported to China may be impacted by new trade policies. Second, we supply critical equipment to U.S. projects from our facilities in Italy, although this backlog has limited exposure due to existing contractual terms. Third, we anticipate modest impact from steel and aluminum tariffs as well as U.S.-China trade activity. Similar to OFSE, we're deploying several mitigation strategies within IET including exploring domestic procurement alternatives to reduce input costs and optimizing our global manufacturing footprint. We expect these actions, combined with continued productivity gains will largely offset the tariff-related impacts. After accounting for these offsets across both segments, we estimate a net EBITDA impact in the range of $100 million to $200 million. This assumes current tariff rates supplied during the 90-day pause period continue for the remainder of 2025.\nBeyond direct impacts, we are also monitoring secondary effects such as more cautious customer behavior and the potential for broader economic weakness. Factors that remain difficult to quantify. A further swing of customer spending could affect our more economically sensitive areas, such as direct sales and transactional services in OFSE and Industrial Tech in IET.\nTurning to our 2025 outlook. We used this tariff outline to help shape our framework for the full year. As visibility on trade policy and the broader market dynamics improve, we will provide further updates as we progress through the year. In IET, we believe our diversified portfolio, substantial IET backlog and sizable aftermarket services business provide earnings and cash flow stability during this period of uncertainty. In the current environment, IET's lean mindset and process-driven culture should continue to deliver structural margin improvement even in the face of higher input costs. As we balance our current view, we believe the IET EBITDA guidance which communicated in January remains achievable.\nIn OFSE, visibility beyond the second quarter remains limited. If oil prices and tariffs hold at current levels, we expect global upstream spending to decline in the high single-digit range for 2025. Under this scenario, we believe OFSE margins will still improve year-over-year driven by cost efficiency and continued execution of transformation initiatives. As this framework illustrates, our 2025 outlook reflects pressure from market-sensitive elements of OFSE while IET is expected to deliver strong growth compared to last year.\nTurning to second quarter. We expect total revenue of $6.3 billion to $7 billion and total EBITDA for approximately $1.04 billion to $1.2 billion. This guidance assumes we can partially offset tariff impacts through abatement opportunities, contractual pass-throughs and other mitigation strategies. It also assumes tariff levels remain consistent when compared to the current 90-day pause scenario.\nFor IET, we forecast EBITDA of $520 million to $580 million on revenue of $3.0 billion to $3.3 billion, led by growth in Gas Tech Services. The major factors driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion in GTE, the impact of any aero derivative supply chain tightness and volume levels in Industrial Tech. For OFSE, we forecast EBITDA of $600 million to $700 million on revenue of $3.3 billion to $3.7 billion, implying further margin improvement on flat sequential revenue. We expect results to reflect a less pronounced seasonal recovery in both international and U.S. markets due to ongoing macro uncertainty and recent oil price weakness. Factors driving the range include execution of our [ SSPS ] backlog, the impact of near-term activity levels in North America and international markets and the pace of activity in Mexico.\nIn summary, we are pleased with the company's operational performance during the first quarter. OFSE margins remained resilient despite upstream market softness, while IET margins continued progressing towards 20%. Although our outlook is tempered by macro and trade policy uncertainty, we remain focused on elements we can control, continuing to streamline operations and drive efficiencies that will benefit us well beyond the cycle.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Ahmed. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate the progress we've made in transforming our operations and streamlining the organization. This has created a solid foundation to further optimize margins and enhance returns even in a challenging environment.\nLooking beyond near-term macro uncertainty, we continue to believe in the structural growth of global energy demand, an outlook that underpins our strategy and anchors Baker Hughes long-term value creation. The world needs more energy with fewer emissions and we see natural gas playing a fundamental role in achieving this dual objective.\nTo conclude, thank you to the entire Baker Hughes team for yet again delivering outstanding results. As we continue our journey to take Baker Hughes and Energy forward, we remain committed to our customers, shareholders and employees.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Chase.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nOperator, we can now open up for questions.",

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Starting on Slide 4. We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, exceeding the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance for the eighth consecutive quarter and setting new quarterly and annual records for revenue, free cash flow and our adjusted measures of EPS and EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Our adjusted earnings per share remains on an impressive growth trajectory, increasing 37% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 47% for the full year. For the fourth quarter, company adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 1.8 percentage points year-on-year to a record of 17.8%. The significant margin expansion across both segments drove this exceptional performance. Industrial and energy technology orders remained at strong levels during 2024, including $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter that drove the annual total above the midpoint of our guidance range. This order performance highlights the end market diversity and versatility of our technologies, led by strength in gas infrastructure and FPSOs. Accordingly, Gas Tech Equipment's non-LNG orders more than doubled totaling $3.6 billion. We achieved another important milestone in booking new energy orders of $1.3 billion. This represents approximately 70% year-over-year growth for the New Energy awards. And the third consecutive year we have exceeded the high end of our original guidance range. We generated strong free cash flow of $894 million during the quarter, resulting in record annual free cash flow of $2.3 billion. This represents a free cash flow conversion rate of 49%, near the high end of our 45% to 50% target range. These record results clearly demonstrate that we are the leading energy and industrial technology company.\nTurning to Slide 5. We want to highlight recent awards and technology developments. As I mentioned, 2024 was another strong year for IoT orders, booking several large-scale GTE awards that span across gas infrastructure, FPSOs and LNG. This is the third consecutive year that GTE has booked more than $5 billion of orders. In the fourth quarter, we secured orders for multiple LNG projects bringing total LNG equipment bookings to almost $2.1 billion for 2024. We received an order from Venture Global to provide modularized LNG systems and a power island. Additionally, we received an award from Bechtel for the first phase of Woodside Energy's Louisiana LNG project. This phase will include 2 Baker Hughes liquefaction compression trains with a capacity of 11 MTPA. The gas infrastructure build-out in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continues to gather pace, following our Master Gas System 3 award in early 2024. During the fourth quarter, we booked an award for gas compression equipment for the third expansion phase of the Jafurah gas field. We will supply a total of 12 electric motor-driven compression trains and auxiliary treatment equipment in this unconventional gas field. In total, we have now been awarded 24 electric motor-driven compressors and an additional 14 compressors for this strategically important gas field. In Gas Technology Services, we secured over $1 billion of long-term service agreements for the second consecutive year. In the fourth quarter, we signed a long-term service frame agreement with Venture Global to support Phase 1 and 2 of their Plaquemines LNG facility in Louisiana. Additionally, GTS was awarded a 25-year services agreement to support next decade Rio Grande LNG facility in Texas. We were also awarded a contract to provide planned maintenance at a major LNG facility in Asia Pacific, which will leverage IET's iCenter. In addition to booking several meaningful long-term service awards, GTS recorded the strongest quarter of equipment upgrades since 2020. This included a key project to upgrade the Monsanto compression station for Snam, one of midstream companies. During the quarter, IET's climate technology solutions secured multiple awards targeting flare reduction. As announced at COP29 CTS will provide SOCAR with an integrated gas recovery and hydrogen sulfide removal system to significantly reduce downstream flaring at the Heydar Aliyev oil refinery. Separately, in the Middle East, CTS will supply electric-driven centrifical compressors, one of the largest gas processing and flare gas recovery projects globally. In Oilfield Services & Equipment, we continue to experience strong order momentum in Brazil, particularly for our differentiated flexible pipe technology. During the quarter, we received a significant award from Petrobras for 48 miles of flexibles to be delivered across 4 fields. This follows the third quarter award for 43 miles of flexible for the Santos Basin and takes our total year orders for flexible pipe to $1.4 billion, a record year for this business. In mature asset solutions, we received a multiyear contract from ENI to unlock bypass reserves in one of Europe's largest developments. Baker Hughes will provide its auto track exact rotary steerable drilling system which will be deployed to help ENI lower risk and execution costs. We continue to see solid order momentum in the Middle East, receiving multiple awards across the region for coiled tubing services as well as drilling and completion fluids. We also booked an award from a major operator to provide artificial lift services in Iraq, which includes advanced permanent magnet motors for improved electric submersible pump efficiency. In Abu Dhabi, we signed an agreement with AIQ, ADNOC and CORVA to launch the AI Rate of Penetration Optimization project. This innovation, which utilizes the latest AI digital technology enhances drilling efficiency in real time by providing insights and recommendations for optimizing weight on bit, rotations per minute and other critical parameters. Driving innovation and expanding our manufacturing footprint in key growth markets are critical to the long-term success of our company. During the quarter, we expanded our footprint in Namibia and Oman. We also had the grand opening of our recently relocated service to control headquarters in Abu Dhabi, ensuring that we are close to key customers in a major demand region.\nTurning to the next slide. As we enter 2025, we believe Baker Hughes is very well positioned to thrive in the back half of the decade, with a number of positive tailwinds that will continue to drive demand for our technology and solutions. On the macro front, the U.S. economy has remained resilient in the face of higher interest rate environment, while the European and Chinese economies have struggled to stimulate growth. Looking at 2025, the global economy will be navigating a number of economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which could result in another year of uneven global economic growth. Against this economic backdrop, we have seen increasingly positive trends for power consumption. Boosted by this encouraging development, we believe that natural gas and LNG demand will demonstrate accelerated growth which will drive increasing demand for our gas-levered products and solutions in both OFSE and IET. According to Wood Mackenzie, demand for U.S. natural gas is set to increase by approximately 20 Bcf per day or 18% by 2030, led by a continued increase in gas requirements for new LNG facilities and data centers. For LNG, we still expect 100 MTPA of FIDs between 2024 and 2026, a level that would increase global capacity to our long-standing forecast of 800 MTPA by 2030. Last year, there were 17 MTPA of project FIDs. Accordingly, we anticipate more than 80 MTPA of FIDs in '25 and 2026. Our strong FID outlook is supported by a record year of offtake contracting last year, which totaled 92 MTPA and exceeded the prior record of 84 MTPAs set in 2022. We also expect demand to remain robust for gas infrastructure projects. This follows a very strong 2024 when we booked MGS 3 and Jafurah in Saudi Arabia, Hassi R'Mel in Algeria and the Margham Gas storage facility in Dubai. While we may not see the same level of large-scale projects in 2025, we are in active conversations on several pipeline expansion projects across the Middle East, Africa, North America and Latin America.\nTurning to our new energy outlook. We see energy efficiency and decarbonization technologies playing an increasing role in achieving net zero goals. Looking forward, we are targeting $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of new energy orders in 2025. While some near-term policy uncertainty across several clean technology areas exist in the United States, we remain confident in achieving our 2030 orders target of $6 billion to $7 billion. Our pipeline of project opportunities, both domestically and internationally continues to grow. Further, we are very excited about the potential of new technologies under development like NET Power and our direct air capture solution, Mosaic. These technologies will help and enable a sustainable energy development plan that provides affordable, more secure, lower missive energy in the future.\nTurning to oil markets. There are several factors that could drive further volatility in oil prices. On the supply side, we see production slightly increasing in North America, adding to significant growth in offshore volumes. The demand outlook has an element of uncertainty given the potential for U.S. tariffs, which would likely dampen growth in key oil-consuming countries like China, where persistent structural imbalances still weigh on the economy. Ultimately, the oil price path will be highly dependent on the pace and magnitude of which OPEC+ production cuts are reversed in 2025. In line with this backdrop and changing activity trends by major E&P operators, we expect global upstream spending to be down slightly in 2025. In North America, we anticipate spending to decrease year-on-year in the mid-single-digit range as many operators remain focused on capital discipline and look to optimize their newly consolidated acreage. Given our production weighted portfolio mix in North America, we expect to outperform the market. In international markets, we expect spending to be flat to down year-on-year. The prospect of an oversupplied ore market, uncertainty in Mexico and Saudi Arabia and shifting focus to gas are all leading to reduced activity levels in some of the key international markets. This will be somewhat offset by bright spots of activity in Brazil, the Middle East outside of Saudi Arabia and Sub-Saharan Africa, but ultimately not enough to drive growth from 2024 levels. In offshore, we continue to see a consistent stream of development projects for the next several years, translating in a steady outlook for subsea trees and FPSOs. In 2025, we expect SSPS orders to be up materially, led by strong subsea tree order flow as several projects for key customers are anticipated to reach FID.\nTurning to Slide 7. We want to continue the discussion around our life cycle business in gas technology, a key value-creating attribute of our IET segment that is consistent with high-quality industrial businesses. Over the past 3 years, we have booked more than $19 billion of equipment orders that will drive a 20% increase in our serviceable installed base by 2030. We expect Gas Tech Services revenue to outpace this installed base growth due to pricing, mix, upgrades and digital enhancements. We see strong demand across the gas turbine market. Market forecasts suggest the pace of gas turbine installations could double to around 100 gigawatt per year out beyond the end of the decade. The major driver of this growth will be the rapid expansion of data center capacity required to meet increasing generative AI workloads. When combined with an already tight supply chain and material cost inflation, this environment provides a tailwind for pricing. We also expect our serviceable LNG installed base to increase by over 50% through 2030, outpacing the overall 20% growth rate. This mix shift towards LNG and stored units is important as these projects have the highest attachment rates across all of our aftermarket services. Another benefit of our large and growing installed base is the opportunity to provide performance enhancement through upgrades as equipment ages. In recent years, customers focused on maximizing equipment uptime as market managed through the energy crisis. However, as we move into a more stable energy environment and gas gained fever acceptance as a destination fuel we expect upgrades to demonstrate strong growth over the coming years. We have a range of upgrade technology solutions that can drive lower emissions, lower energy consumption, increased power output and produce higher throughput yield. In addition, we are excited about new upgrade technologies that we are introducing into the market, a direct result of our R&D investment and innovation pipeline. We believe new upgrade technologies that enhance aging equipment has the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars of orders at accretive margins by 2030. In addition to equipment upgrades, we are enhancing our customers' plant performance and emissions abatement through the development of advanced service solutions. We are leveraging our 24/7 iCenter monitoring capabilities more than 20 years of monitoring and diagnostic data, the latest in generative AI capabilities and our Cordant platform to create digital solutions that help our customers optimize their total cost of equipment ownership. On the back of increasing customer acceptance and enhanced digital product offerings, digital orders increased by approximately 60% this year with over 1,800 units connected at the end of 2024. Looking forward, we expect GTS digital orders to double by 2026 and continue the strong growth trajectory thereafter. In summary, we have 4 discrete and tangible revenue growth accelerators that will benefit Gas Tech Services. Alongside an increasing installed base, this gives us confidence that we can structurally grow our high-margin GTS business for the next decade and beyond.\nBefore turning the call over to Nancy, I would like to again emphasize the strength of our 2024 results. We faced some near-term market headwinds with the maximum sustainable capacity, MSC reduction in Saudi Arabia and the LNG moratorium in the United States, yet we still exceeded the midpoint for orders and the high end of our EBITDA compared to our original guidance ranges. Our company is clearly delivering results. evidenced by another record year. We expect this momentum to continue with EBITDA to demonstrate another year of strong growth in 2025. And as we embark on our continued journey we are excited about the opportunities to further expand the versatility and beat of our technology portfolio as well as drive segment margins beyond our 20% target.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Nancy.\n\nNancy K. Buese\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Newmont Goldcorp Corp.\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I will begin on Slide 9 with an overview of our consolidated results and then speak to segment details before summarizing our first quarter and full year outlook. We demonstrated another year of strong progress during 2024. For the full year, orders totaled $28.2 billion, including $13 billion of IET orders that marks the second highest order total for the segment. Technology versatility and differentiation of IET's portfolio continued to support a strong order book and near-record levels of RPO. We generated total adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 billion, increasing over 20% and setting a record for the second consecutive year. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 1.7 percentage points to 16.5%, marking the fourth consecutive year of margin expansion for the company. Adjusted diluted EPS for the year increased by 47% to $2.35. In addition to our strong operating results, EPS benefited from our effective tax rate declining by approximately 5 percentage points to 28%, adding $0.17 to EPS for the year. Free cash flow totaled $2.3 billion, which represented a free cash flow conversion of 49%, near the high end of our targeted range.\nTurning to our fourth quarter results. As Lorenzo mentioned, we delivered a very strong quarter for orders with total company orders of $7.5 billion, including $3.8 billion from IET. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 20% year-on-year to $1.31 billion, driven by continued strong IET revenue growth and exceptional margin performance across both segments. We are delivering on our commitments, and we remain focused on meeting our margin targets. GAAP operating income was $665 million. Adjusted operating income was $1.02 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.18. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $0.70, an increase of 37% when compared to the same quarter last year. Excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share was a net benefit of $0.48 related to unrealized gains on certain equity investments and the release of valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets, partially offset by restructuring and other charges. The valuation allowance release reflects our growing pattern of profitability over recent years alongside our confidence for continued profit growth into the future. Restructuring charges primarily relate to streamlining of our OFSE operating model and rightsizing our workforce to match forecasted activity levels. We generated free cash flow of $894 million for the quarter, supported by a strong quarter of collections.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 10. Our balance sheet remains strong, ending the fourth quarter with cash of $3.4 billion, net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.6x and liquidity of $6.4 billion. In 2024, we have returned $1.3 billion in dividends and share repurchases, amounting to approximately 60% of free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders.\nTurning to the next slide, I want to highlight our steadily growing dividend, strong earnings growth and improving return on invested capital. We have demonstrated robust growth in earnings per share over the past 3 years, increasing by a 37% compound annual growth rate over this period.\nMoving to our dividend. We announced a 10% increase yesterday. This marks the fourth consecutive year that we've raised our dividend, increasing by 28% since the third quarter of 2022. This consistent dividend growth demonstrates our confidence in the durability and momentum of the company's earnings and free cash flow, a quality we share with our industrial peers. Looking forward, I believe we're uniquely positioned to continue increasing the dividend consistently buy back shares and retain the financial flexibility to pursue opportunities that will enhance our growth capabilities. We are demonstrating solid progress in enhancing the company's returns profile, driven by our capital-efficient growth and significant margin expansion achieved over the last 2 years. For 2024, IET ROIC of 25% exceeded our 20% target 1 year early. In OFSE, ROIC continues to make steady progress towards our 15% target, increasing to 13% for 2024. We expect both cement returns to further increase in 2025 and beyond as our focus remains on capital efficient, profitable growth.\nNow I will highlight the results for both segments, starting with Industrial & Energy Technology on Slide 12. During the quarter, we booked strong IET orders of $3.8 billion, primarily driven by LNG awards and further gas infrastructure order momentum. For the full year, IET secured [ $13 million ] of orders with a book-to-bill of 1.1x, resulting in near-record RPO levels of $30.1 billion at year-end. Our fourth quarter results reflect a strong increase in IET EBITDA, up 38% year-over-year due to another strong quarter of revenue growth in Gas Technology for both equipment and services and significant margin expansion. For the full year, IET EBITDA approached $2.1 billion, setting a record for the second consecutive year as revenue reached a new high and margin reclaim prior peak levels. This was mostly driven by significant margin improvements in both Industrial Solutions and Gas Tech Equipment, with the latter benefiting from operational enhancements and conversion of higher price backlog.\nTurning to Oilfield Services & Equipment on Slide 13. We booked strong orders and flexibles during the quarter, which drove SSPS orders of $802 million and resulted in full year orders of $3.1 billion. OFSE EBITDA margin continues to outperform the segment's revenue performance, supporting solid fourth quarter EBITDA of $755 million. Full year EBITDA increased by 11% to approximately $2.9 billion, driven by margin that expanded 1.5 percentage points to 18.4%.\nTurning to Slide 14. I want to provide additional highlights on the significant progress we are making in driving structural margin improvement. We are executing several projects to streamline activities, remove duplication and modernize management systems. This is improving clarity, transparency and the pace of decision-making, enable our teams to work smarter and drive costs structurally lower. We continue to enhance our supply chain across the enterprise. Our best value country spend increased 15% year-on-year in 2024. Typically, we see over 20% cost savings when we move volumes from higher-cost regions to best value countries. Going forward, we're focused on sourcing a larger volume of materials from these countries. In IET, we are seeing the benefits of lean strategies being adopted across our operations. The team has initiated over 120 large problem-solving kaizen projects this year alone, involving over 1,300 employees across all functions. Our GTE team has been applying lean to its execution model, focusing on improving throughput efficiency. Through multiple kaizens, the team has driven a 40% increase in GTE volumes within our existing manufacturing footprint to support growing demand. This has enabled us to gain share in key markets due to our speed to deliver on customers' needs. In Industrial Tech, we have levered kaizens to improve lead times on Cordant's flagship product, Orbit 60 Lean adoption and manufacturing processes helped develop a new layout of the assembly line, reducing lead times by 50% and more than doubling effective capacity. In OFSE, a great example of the progress we have made is the improved performance of SSPS. EBITDA margins have increased significantly over the last 2 years with SSPS margins more than doubling into the mid-teens last year. This has been driven by refocusing our commercial model, rightsizing our capacity and improving our execution. For the overall OFSE segment, we continue to transform the business. In 2024, the focus was centralizing the business operations, leading to a significant reduction in duplication across our regions and product and service lines. The focus now is to drive consistency and operational excellence across the new business structure. These activities are centered on enhancing commercial intensity and optimizing operational efficiency. In line with this, we are matching our structure to anticipated activity levels. These actions, along with the implementation of our streamlined operating model will be key drivers to achieve our OFSE margin target. We are making significant progress on our transformation journey, yet have additional opportunities to enhance efficiency, productivity and ultimately, margins. Our strategy is clear, and we are taking further action in 2025. We have cultivated an organizational culture focused on continued margin improvement, and we see 20% margin targets as milestones on our journey towards best-in-class margins.\nNext, I would like to update you on our outlook. The details of first quarter and full year 2025 guidance can be found on Slide 15. The ranges for revenue, EBITDA and D&A are shown on this slide, and I will focus on the midpoint of our guidance. Starting with the full year, we expect total company revenue of approximately $27.75 billion and EBITDA of $4.95 billion. We are also targeting free cash flow conversion of 45% to 50% relative to our annual EBITDA. We expect an effective tax rate in the range of 25% to 30%, with a strategic plan in place to further optimize our tax rate beyond 2025. We expect IET orders to remain at robust levels this year with LNG momentum returning to the market, while gas infrastructure and energy production order strength continues. Given the strong environment, we expect IET orders of $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion. At the midpoint, this would mark the third consecutive year of at least $13 billion of IET orders. This not only provides strong backlog support for our equipment business into 2027, but will provide years, if not decades, of growth for our high-margin aftermarket service businesses. As a result of this continued momentum and strong orders performance over the last 2 years, we expect full year IET revenue of [ $12.75 ] billion and EBITDA of $2.3 billion. For OFSE, we forecast full year revenue of $15 billion, down slightly year-on-year as a result of softening oilfield service market in North America and lower SSPS revenues. Importantly, we still expect EBITDA to increase to $3 billion. We have been proactively positioning our OFSE portfolio to remain resilient in a maturing upstream spending cycle.\nNow turning to first quarter guidance. We expect revenues of $6.5 billion and total EBITDA of approximately $1.02 billion. For IET, we expect first quarter results to demonstrate strong year-over-year EBITDA growth led by GTE. Overall, we expect IET EBITDA of $460 million. The major factors driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion in GTE, the impact of any aeroderivative supply chain tightness and gas technology, operational execution in industrial technology and CTS and material changes in foreign exchange. For OFSE, we expect first quarter results to reflect a more pronounced seasonal decline for international OFS and SSPS. Accordingly, we expect EBITDA of $645 million. Factors driving the range include the SSPS backlog conversion, activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Mexico and winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the operational performance of the company during 2024. The fourth quarter marks the third consecutive quarter of record EBITDA and the second consecutive quarter of record EBITDA margin. These are clear indicators that our transformation is working. The entire organization is committed to structurally improving margins and catalyzing on market opportunities with our differentiated portfolio of solutions. Both are key drivers in our journey to further increase shareholder value. We are proud of the progress the company is making, and we are excited about the future of Baker Hughes.\nI'll turn the call back to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Nancy. As you can see from our strong 2024 results and the exceptional margin improvement illustrated on Slide 17, we have evolved into a much more profitable energy and industrial technology company. At the midpoint of our 2025 guidance, Baker Hughes' EBITDA margin will have increased by more than 6 percentage points over the past 5 years. Additionally, EBITDA has more than doubled over this same period.\nLooking at 2025 and beyond. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our strategy is clear, and we see a differentiated growth opportunity for Baker Hughes. Markets are evolving, and this aligns with our vision of the energy technology ecosystem. The need for more energy with fewer emissions is critical and the increased use of natural gas will be fundamental to achieving this objective. Our strong market positioning across natural gas, LNG and gas infrastructure, new energy and mature fields provides multiple growth vectors across our portfolio. This will be accompanied by emerging opportunities for distributed power solutions and new industrial markets. We have a unique broad technology portfolio that will drive growth through the remainder of the decade, irrespective of the pace of the energy transition. Given the balanced portfolio untapped market opportunities, significant recurring IET service revenue and our more efficient cost structure, Baker Hughes is becoming less cyclical in nature and will generate more durable earnings and free cash flow across cycles.\nTo conclude, I'd like to thank the Baker Hughes team for yet again delivering outstanding results. As we continue our journey to propel Baker Hughes forward, we remain committed to our customers, shareholders and employees.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Chase.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nOperator, we can open up for questions.",

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Chase Mulvehill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Baker Hughes Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Nancy Buese. The earnings release we issued yesterday evening can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com. We will also be using a presentation with our prepared remarks during this webcast, which can be found on our investor website. As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Chase. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.\nWe delivered outstanding second quarter results highlighted by strong operational performance across the company. Our IET performance benefited from excellent execution of its robust backlog. In OFSE, results were supported by a solid seasonal recovery in the Eastern Hemisphere, portfolio resilience in North America and added success in driving enhanced cost efficiencies across the business. We continue to improve our operational consistency as this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our quarterly EBITDA guidance.\nAs highlighted on Slide 4, we had another strong quarter for orders. This is particularly evident in IET, where we booked $3.5 billion during the quarter, including a large Sonatra award for gas boosting in Algeria's Hazarimel gas field. This marks the highest level of non-LNG equipment quarterly bookings in the company's history and again underscores the breadth and versatility of our IET portfolio.\nWe also secured 2 major offshore topside contracts to provide power generation systems for innovative, all electric FPSO units, which will be installed offshore in Latin America. These awards further build on IET's positive momentum in the offshore market. On the digital front, Baker Hughes secured a multimillion dollar global frame agreement with BP, covering all of their upstream and downstream assets. This provides an enterprise obstruction for [indiscernible] asset health, enabling BP to deliver reliable, efficient condition monitoring and supporting its digital optimization strategy. We also saw continued traction in our Gas Tech Services business, looking to backlog free multiyear service awards that totaled $500 million, this included a 25-year service agreement to support our customers' offshore operations in Latin America. Our services backlog uniquely differentiates [indiscernible] users adding recurring long-term and profitable revenue streams.\nIn the New Energy, we continue to see solid order momentum. We booked record new energy orders of $445 million during the quarter, taking year-to-date orders to $684 million and already approaching the $750 million we booked in 2023. Considering the strong first half performance, we are trending towards the high end of this year's New Energy guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion.\nThis is another reflection of our technology differentiation and the versatility of our portfolio to provide new energy customers with innovative solutions. In Asia Pacific, we secured a major Gas Tech and Climate Tech Solutions contract to supply electric-driven compression and power generation to a global energy operator. This will enhance gas operations and power CO2 capture to reduce the carbon intensity at the customer's LNG facility. We also continue to build on our strategic collaboration with Air Products. In the second quarter, CTS was awarded a contract for CO2 and hydrogen compressors as well as pumps for 1 of Air Products hydrogen projects in North America. In Germany, CTS also secured an award to provide Passoni Deutschland, with 0 emission integrated compressors providing increased compression capacity to handle the large volumes of gas entering the network from new LNG regasification terminals.\nIn July, we signed a long-term agreement to be a preferred equipment and service supplier for Wabash Valley Resources, ammonia and carbon sequestration plant in Indiana. The project will capture and sequester 1.6 mtpa of CO2, making it one of the largest carbon sequestration projects in the U.S. Importantly, the EPA issued [indiscernible] Class VI permits in January of this year.\nOnce this project is FID, we have the potential to book a wide range of orders that could span across both OFSE and IET. These include compression, pumps, valves, digital hardware and software and NovaLT turbines in IET and sequestration analysis, CO2 flexible pipe well construction and surface and subsurface monitoring in OFSE. This is one example of how we realize synergies between IET and OFSE, a theme we believe will become a common thread for New Energy projects at Baker Hughes. In OFSE, we received another significant Petrobras award for workover and plug and abandonment services in pre-salt and post-salt fields offshore Brazil. The multiyear project will leverage Baker Hughes' integrated solutions portfolio to optimize performance for Petrobras.\nTurning to our operational performance. We delivered strong second quarter results, highlighted by 46% year-over-year EPS growth and 25% increase in EBITDA. Importantly, we again exceeded our EBITDA margin guidance driven by outstanding execution and continued cost productivity improvements across the company. Our efforts to structurally change the way we operate are evident in our margin performance. Overall, EBITDA margins increased almost 150 basis points year-over-year to 15.8%. In OFSE, margins came in above our guidance, driven by strong performance in SSPS and the acceleration of our cost optimization initiatives announced earlier this year. Notably, OFSE's year-over-year incremental margins were approximately 60%, highlighting the team's persistent focus on cost productivity. In IET, margins also exceeded our guidance. Gas Tech Equipment posted another strong quarter, with margins significantly increasing from the same period last year as we convert higher-margin backlog. In addition, Industrial Products and Solutions benefited from higher volumes and improved supply chain efficiency with both contributing to IET's better margin performance.\nTurning to the macro view on Slide 5. On the back of softer global demand and continued economic uncertainty, oil prices experienced some volatility during the second quarter. Yes, Brent prices still averaged $85 per barrel with support from the extension of OPEC Plus production cuts, rising geopolitical risk and firming oil demand in June. The trajectory of global economic activity, the persistence of inflation and geopolitical risks will be key factors in determining the oil price path for the remainder of this year. Next year, the pace of OPEC class barrels returning to the market will likely be the major determinant of oil prices. Our global upstream spending outlook for the year is revised slightly lower due to North American softness. In North America, we previously expected the market to decline in the low to mid-single-digit range compared to last year due to lower-than-expected first half rig activity and tempered second half expectations, we now expect year-over-year declines in North America spending to be down in the mid-single digits.\nWith our Gulf of Mexico exposure, which is expected to demonstrate another year of solid growth and our portfolio mix that is more tied to production, we believe that our North American revenues will outperform the market. Across international markets, we maintain our expectations to high single-digit growth compared to last year. The market outlook already contemplated the extension that OPEC plus cuts through the end of the year as well as any potential timing differences between the transitioning of rigs from oil to gas in Saudi Arabia.\nLooking out beyond 2024, we expect global upstream growth to be led by Latin America and West Africa offshore markets and the Middle East, albeit at a decelerated pace. As the cycle matures, we expect our customers to increasingly focus on optimizing production from existing assets, providing significant growth opportunities for our mature asset solutions. This leverages our decades of experience, deep domain knowledge and industry-leading technologies including Lucipa and coveted franchises in both upstream chemicals and artificial lift.\nTurning to global natural gas and LNG on Slide 6. We reiterate our positive outlook for global gas markets. Earlier this year, the IEA updated its projections for electricity consumption, noting that global demand for data centers driven by cryptocurrency and AI could double by 2026. This robust data center growth implies its annual electricity consumption could account for 4% of global energy demand. To put this in perspective, this would equal roughly the same amount of electricity used by the entire country of Japan.\nWe believe natural gas will be essential to meet this growing power demand, which will be additive to the growth required for New Energy sources in the future. Therefore, the notable rise in generative AI could provide upside to our current expectations for natural gas demand to increase by almost 20% between now and 2040. We are confident that strong underlying natural gas demand will lead to robust and sustainable growth in LNG. Through the end of this decade, we maintain our expectations for LNG demand to increase by mid-single digits annually, requiring an installed nameplate capacity of 800 MTPA by 2030. As we highlight on the slide, year-to-date offtake contracting for LNG is 42% higher than the same period last year. With recent contracting of Middle East capacity from Asian buyer portfolio players, we expect a record-breaking year for contracting offtake volumes. Contracting of offtake capacity is a key factor in many LNG projects reaching FID. Therefore, these recent trends only increase our confidence in the pipeline of potential projects progressing. We continue to expect global LNG FIDs of about 100 mtpa over the next 3 years, which would result in our installed capacity increasing by 70%. Importantly, our growing installed base of equipment brings significant aftermarket service opportunities for Baker Hughes across the life cycle of the equipment.\nTurning to Slide 7. I want to take a moment to reflect on the strong tailwinds outside of LNG that we are experiencing within IET's gas technology equipment portfolio. The versatility of Gas Tech Equipment uniquely sets Baker Hughes apart from our peers. This enables us to sell our equipment into numerous end markets outside of LNG where we often compete and win against the diverse group of industrial companies.\nIn the first half of this year, we have booked $6.4 billion of orders with about 85% associated with non-LNG equipment and services. This strength has been most notable in Gas Tech Equipment, where we booked almost $1.4 billion of non-LNG orders during the quarter. On the back of a robust first half, we now expect Gas Tech Equipment orders outside of LNG to exceed $3 billion for the full year, which is almost double last year's level. Looking beyond 2024, we see an opportunity for our GTE business to capture increasing share of the addressable non-LNG market, which we expect to total $100 billion to $120 billion through 2030. This significant opportunity includes a broad set of growing end markets, including gas processing and pipeline infrastructure, onshore and offshore production, downstream and industrial. This year, we have experienced a notable increase in gas infrastructure orders.\nIn the first quarter, we announced the Master Gas System Free award with Aramco. And during the second quarter, we booked the [indiscernible] pipeline expansion project in Algeria that will bring gas to Europe. In total, these 2 projects accounted for more than $1 billion of equipment bookings. Looking over the next few years, we see continued strength in gas infrastructure opportunities across the Middle East, U.S., Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa due to secular growth in global natural gas and LNG demand through at least 2040. This will drive further momentum in gas infrastructure equipment orders well beyond this year and provides opportunities for Gas Tech Services, condition monitoring and pipeline inspection.\nA key strength of our business model is to monetize equipment cycles and leverage our growing installed base for sustainable and profitable revenue growth. Beyond gas infrastructure markets, we also expect continued strength in onshore and offshore production orders led by the FPSO market. Over the next few years, we anticipate the market awards 7 to 9 FPSOs per year driven by growth in Brazil and Guyana. [indiscernible], recent discoveries in Namibia's Orange Basin provide growing confidence in FPSO orders outside the strong momentum we see over the next couple of years. In onshore production, we are optimistic about associated processing opportunities as global gas production increases, particularly in the Middle East.\nOne example is the Deforo gas field, where we have been previously awarded compression trains, stabilizer compressors, valves and condition monitoring for this strategic gas basin in Saudi Arabia. As this basin is set to significantly increase production, we see opportunity to build additional IET orders in the future. In refining and petrochemicals, we are also experiencing positive momentum. We see growing opportunities for refinery conversion to bio feedstock as well as growth in ethylene and ammonia markets driven by rising fuel, fertilizer and plastics demand. We are seeing increasing power demand led by data center and electric vehicle growth. This dynamic, coupled with renewables intermittency and planned reduction in coal-fired generation capacity is expected to result in power shortages across U.S. grid network. For example, ERCOT's Texas power grid operator has forecasted that 2030 peak summer low demand will exceed generation by 33 gigawatts. This is equivalent to the energy needed to power 25 million homes which amounts to 10x the number of homes in Houston.\nDue to these grid reliabilities and availability concerns, we are experiencing increased interest in our Turbomachinery technology for behind the meter and off-grid solutions across data centers, transportation sectors, such as airports and seaports and oil and gas markets. Our Nova LT turbines, which can run either on natural gas or hydrogen, are the core technology for our microgrid offering. We will also benefit from increased demand for utility scale power solutions through our partnership with NetPower as well as our steam turbine generators and supercritical CO2 technology that enable power generation through small modular reactor solutions.\nLastly, we have experienced solid growth across our brush portfolio, which includes solutions to meet most challenging requirements for power generation, grid stabilization and decarbonization with its electric motors, synchronous generators and condensers. As additional intermittent renewable power capacity and electrification-driven demand that are added to the grid, we expect the grid stabilization will be an area of significant growth for IET.\nIn summary, we are very excited by the strong tailwinds that we are seeing across our energy and industrial end markets. We remain confident in our ability to deliver $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion of IET orders this year. Before I turn the call over to Nancy, I wanted to briefly provide some highlights around the progress we are making on our emissions and the success we're having in helping our customers reduce their own emissions intensity. Baker Hughes was one of the first companies in our industry to make a public commitment to a reduction in our operational emissions by 2030 and achieve net 0 by 2050. As detailed in our corporate sustainability report published in May, we remain on track to achieve these goals, and we continue to provide products and services that help our customers reduce their emissions intensity. In IET, we have sold a number of zero-emission integrated compressors, or ICLs. Also, customers are increasingly interested in our more efficient turbines highlighted by increasing NovaLT order flow. Our Panametrics Flair IQ technology is also seeing increased customer adoption. It helps to monitor, reduce and control emissions associated with flaring and covers a wide range of assets, including assisted flares associated with downstream petrochemical, refinery and upstream operations.\nIn OFSE, our artificial lift product line deploys more efficient, permanent magnet motors at wellsites, replacing older, more emissive technology, combining permanent magnum motor technology with Baker Hughes' electrical submersible pump capabilities create differentiated solutions, providing advantages for our customers and producing fewer emissions. Across both segments, we have developed digital and condition monitoring solutions that enable our customers to efficiently monitor their equipment performance, highlighting any inefficiencies that drive emissions up. Our customers are clearly focused on reducing their emissions, and we have a broad suite of products to help them on this journey.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy.\n\nNancy K. Buese\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Newmont Goldcorp Corp.\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I will begin on Slide 9 with an overview of our consolidated results and then speak to segment details before summarizing our outlook. We're extremely pleased with our second quarter results. Our operational discipline and rigor are gaining traction, highlighted by our consistent improvement in EBITDA margins and returns. In just 2 years, our margins are up almost 300 basis points, a credit to our team's dedication and hard work. We're pleased with the strong margin performance in both OFSC and IET, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $1.13 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase. This was driven by strong backlog conversion in both SSPS and IET, effective management of our aeroderivative supply chain tightness and Gas Tech Services and realization of efficiency gains and productivity improvements across the business. GAAP operating income was $833 million, adjusted operating income was $847 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.58. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $0.57, an increase of 46% compared to the same quarter last year. Our continued discipline resulted in corporate costs for the quarter of $83 million, down more than 20% since our transformation effort began in 2022, a testament to our multiyear focus on driving productivity and efficiency gains. Our adjusted tax rate was down slightly year-over-year to approximately 30% as we continue to execute our tax optimization program. We have line of sight to additional tax rate improvement opportunities, and we'll execute on these in the coming quarters.\nAs Lorenzo mentioned, we had another quarter of strong order momentum, with total company orders of $7.5 billion, including $3.5 billion from IET. The diversity of IET's end markets continue to support a healthy order book, which was led by the Hasaramelk gas pipeline boosting project and 2 FPSO awards booked during the quarter. Alongside a strong order book, IET RPO ended the quarter at $30.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year and setting a new record for the company, as IET RPO is now up 50% over the last 5 years. In OFSE, RPO remained at a healthy $3.3 billion. Free cash flow came in at $106 million for the quarter, bringing our first half total to $608 million. As we previously highlighted, we expect free cash flow to be more weighted towards the back half of the year. For the full year, we continue to target free cash flow conversion of 45% to 50%.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the second quarter with cash of $2.3 billion, net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.9x and liquidity of $5.3 billion. Let's turn to capital allocation on Slide 11. In the second quarter, we returned $375 million to shareholders. This included $209 million of dividends and $166 million of shares repurchased during the second quarter. In total, for the first half of the year, we have returned $743 million to investors. For the full year, we remain committed to returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. Our primary focus is to continue growing our dividend with increases aligned with the structural growth in the company's earnings power.\nWe will continue to utilize buybacks to reach the target range, and we remain opportunistic. Now I will walk you through the business segment results in more detail and provide our outlook, starting with Industrial and Energy Technology on Slide 12. For the second consecutive quarter, IET outperformed our EBITDA guidance, mostly attributed to excellent conversion of Gas Tech Equipment backlog that drove revenue and margin upside. IET orders were strong at $3.5 billion, with non-LNG Gas Tech Equipment accounting for 97% of the total. Year-to-date, we've now booked $6.4 billion of IET orders, and we remain on track to achieve our guidance range $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. The versatility and differentiation of the IET portfolio across Industrial and Energy segments remains a significant competitive advantage for Baker Hughes, allowing us to profitably grow with new customers and applications. [ CCS ] orders were $392 million in the second quarter, led by solid order activity in both carbon capture and hydrogen related projects. This puts CTS orders for the first half of 2024 at $585 million, supporting robust year-to-date New Energy orders of $684 million. IET RPO ended the quarter at $30.2 billion, a record level and up 10% year-on-year.\nThis level of backlog provides exceptional revenue and earnings visibility over the coming years. As we execute our robust equipment backlog, this will significantly increase our installed base, which will then drive structural growth in our aftermarket service business well beyond 2030.\nTurning to Slide 13. IET revenue for the quarter was $3.1 billion, up 28% versus the prior year, led by a 59% increase in Gas Tech Equipment revenues as we continue to execute our record levels of backlog. We also experienced outstanding performance important. Gas Tech Services revenues progressed in line with expectations, increasing 5% versus the prior year. IET EBITDA was $497 million, up 37% year-over-year. EBITDA margin increased about 100 basis points year-over-year to 15.9%. I want to specifically highlight the progress in Gas Tech Equipment margins, which are up about 500 basis points compared to prior year levels due to conversion of higher-margin backlog, cost efficiency improvement and strong productivity gains. We also continue to see good margin expansion in our Industrial Tech business, led by [indiscernible], where we are benefiting from the improved output due to process enhancements and a return to normalization of our supply chain.\nNow turning to Oilfield Services and Equipment on Slide 14. The segment maintained its strong margin trajectory, keeping us on track to achieve our 20% margin target for next year. This is a testament to the work the OFSE team has done to drive cost efficiencies and maintain commercial discipline as they remain focused on profitable growth. Continued strength in flexibles helped to drive SSPS orders of $888 million, up 40% on a sequential basis. We expect the offshore market to remain strong and anticipate an increased order contribution from [ subsea tree ] awards in the second half of the year. OFSE revenue in the quarter was $4 billion, up 6% quarter-over-quarter. International revenue was up 7% sequentially. We experienced continued growth across all Middle Eastern markets and a strong seasonal recovery in North Sea, where rigs returned from maintenance following the prior quarter's delays.\nIn Latin America, we continue to experience rig reactivation delays in Mexico. In North America, 3% sequential growth was entirely attributed to the Gulf of Mexico where a sharp increase in project-related activities benefited results. North America land revenues remained relatively stable compared to first quarter, outperforming the decline in rig activity due to our weighting towards production businesses. OFSE EBITDA in the quarter was $716 million, up 13% year-over-year. This was led by solid performance on both revenues and margins. OFSE EBITDA margin rate was 17.8%, increasing 144 basis points year-over-year.\nThis strong margin improvement was led by cost efficiency and productivity enhancements that we've been executing across the business. We are particularly pleased with the continued improvement in SSPS margin performance, which is now approaching low teens. More broadly, we are clearly seeing the benefits of our transformation efforts initiated in late 2022, which are having a positive impact on our financial performance across both segments.\nTurning to Slide 15. I want to take a moment to provide more details on the actions we're taking to drive sustainable margin improvement across the company. In IET, the team has adopted a process mindset that is driving a culture of improved efficiency and productivity. We are on a journey to create an efficient organization that emphasizes the elimination of waste, continuous improvement and delivers more value to our customers. As highlighted by the strong margin outperformance so far this year, these continued optimization efforts are gaining traction across IET and are a key part of the strategy to reach our 20% margins by 2026. In OFSE, we're focusing on improving our cost competitiveness and enhancing our execution. Supply chain optimization and service delivery improvements are key strategic priorities to achieve our 20% margin targets. Commercially, we remain disciplined, ensuring we are maximizing returns and focusing on profitable growth. Combined with our leading technologies and solutions, we are now demonstrating a sustainable uplift in our OFSE margins. In our corporate functions, we're driving structurally lower corporate costs as we execute several projects to streamline activities, remove duplication and modernize management systems. This is improving clarity, transparency and the pace of decision making. We are making significant progress in changing the way we operate. What excites me the most is what lies ahead. We still have a lot of opportunity to drive margins higher and the market tailwinds for our unique portfolio of technologies and solutions are only strengthening.\nNext, I'd like to update you on our outlook. The details of our third quarter and full year 2024 guidance are found on Slide 16. The ranges for revenue, EBITDA and D&A are shown on the slide, and I'll focus on the midpoint of our guidance. Overall, we're increasingly bullish on the outlook for the company, in particular, our IET business. As Lorenzo highlighted, this segment is benefiting from strength in multiple cycles, including LNG and gas infrastructure, offshore and new energy. Our portfolio is well suited to capitalize on the positive momentum in each of these areas. Given the tailwinds in our continued operational improvement, we expect third quarter company EBITDA of $1.2 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range.\nFor IET, we expect third quarter results to benefit from continued productivity enhancements and process improvements. as well as strong revenue conversion of the segment's record backlog. Overall, we expect third quarter IET EBITDA of $525 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. The major factors driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion in Gas Tech Equipment, the impact of any aeroderivative supply chain tightness in Gas Tech and operational execution in Industrial Tech and Climate Tech Solutions.\nFor OFSE, we expect third quarter results to reflect typical seasonal growth in international and flattish activity in North America. We expect third quarter OFSE EBITDA of $760 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. Factors impacting this range include the phasing of 2024 E&P budgets, SSPS backlog conversion, realization of further cost-out initiatives and execution on larger international projects.\nTurning to our full year guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of the EBITDA range by 5%, entirely attributed to strong IET performance as our OFSE EBITDA midpoint remains unchanged. For the full year 2024, we now expect Baker Hughes EBITDA of $4.525 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range. Given the strength in first half New Energy orders, we now expect to end the year towards the high end of our $800 million to $1 billion range. We expect IET orders to remain at robust levels this year and maintain the guidance range between $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by strong momentum across all aspects of the IET portfolio.\nAs a result of robust backlog conversion and strong margin performance, we are increasing our full year outlook for IET EBITDA to $1.965 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range. Compared to our prior guidance, this amounts to a 12% increase. For OFSE, we maintain our EBITDA midpoint at $2.9 billion for our guidance range as we expect margin upside to offset lower revenue expectations in North America. In summary, for Baker Hughes, we now expect the company to generate at least 20% EBITDA growth for the second consecutive year. We remain focused on execution, driving further operational improvements and capitalizing on market tailwinds with our differentiated portfolio of products and services. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress demonstrated by our second quarter results. The structural changes we are making to the business are increasingly visible in our financial performance and provide a clear path to our upgraded guidance range. We are intensely focused on driving sustainable margin improvements and remain on track to deliver 20% EBITDA margins in OFSE and IET. We are excited about the continued improvement of our business and about the future of Baker Hughes.\nI'll turn the call back to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Nancy. Turning to Slide 18. We are exceptionally proud of the progress we have demonstrated on the margin front. EBITDA margins are expected to be in the high teens range during the second half of this year and 2024 is anticipated to produce Baker Hughes' highest margin rate. Our transformation efforts are clearly driving structural improvement in underlying margins. Our progress is clear, and we are confident in our plan to achieve 20% margins for OFSE in 2025 and IET in 2026. The story today of Baker Hughes is more than just improving operational performance. As I highlighted earlier, we have growth tailwinds in IET that span across multiple end markets including gas infrastructure, LNG, FPSOs, distributed power and New Energy. Orders from these key growth markets have been major drivers of our record equipment backlog. Throughout our transformation, we have taken steps to reinforce our culture as one Baker Hughes. Our people are the driving force behind our success. We put people first and take energy forward. I'd like to conclude by thanking the Baker Hughes team for yet again delivering very strong operating results. It's a testament to the strength of our people, the culture we're building the portfolio we have created and the value of the Baker Hughes enterprise. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chase.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. Operator, let's open the call for questions.",

Reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Chase. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with our solid first quarter results as we continue to build on the momentum from last year and shape our company. The resilience of our order book and margin progress in both OFSE and IET put us on a path towards achieving our full year guidance and overcoming external volatility. Overall, EBITDA margins continued to demonstrate strong year-over-year growth, increasing by 100 basis points. The margin upside was attributed to IT, where both Gas Tech Equipment and Industrial demonstrated strong performance.\nAs highlighted on Slide 4, we've had a positive start to the year on the orders front. This is particularly evident in IT where we booked over $2.9 billion of orders during the quarter, including large awards from Aramco for the Master Gas System Free and Black & Veatch for Cedar LNG. LNG equipment orders totaled almost $200 million during the quarter. Excluding LNG equipment, our IET business booked more than $2.7 billion of orders, the second highest of any quarter since the 2017 This was attributed to non-LNG Gas Tech Equipment orders more than tripling from prior year levels. This really underscores breadth and versatility of our IET portfolio.\nIn OFSE, we received 2 significant contract awards from Petrobras, with the first for integrated well construction services in the Buzios field. Baker Hughes has been working closely with Petrobras on the field development for many years, leveraging our expertise across both OFSE and IET, demonstrating of our combined portfolio. We have previously received awards that include Tabeau machinery equipment on 10 FPSOs for the Buzios field and multiple OFSE service contracts.\nThe second Petrobras contract awarded during the quarter was to supply electrical submissible pumps, variable speed drives and sand separation across 450 wells to help the customer in Brazil optimize efficiency, reliability and sustainability of its onshore operations in the Baha Terra cluster. We delivered strong first quarter operating results, highlighted by 50% year-over-year EPS growth. Importantly, we exceeded the midpoint of our EBITDA margin guidance driven by outstanding operational performance in IET. We booked $239 million of new energy orders and generated over $500 million of free cash flow.\nAs mentioned, IET got off to a strong start to the year. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, IET EBITDA increased by 30%, the best quarterly year-over-year growth rate in 3 years and represents 80 basis points of EBITDA margin improvement year-on-year. This was driven by the conversion of higher-margin equipment backlog, continued margin expansion in our industrial tech businesses and further efficiency and cost optimization efforts by the team, partially offset by continued tightness in the Gas Tech Services supply chain.\nIn OFSE, we continue to make solid progress on the margin front, even with some lower offshore activity during the quarter. Segment EBITDA margins were in line with guidance and improved 80 basis points compared to last year, supported by year-over-year OFS incrementals of nearly 40%. On the activity front, we experienced some delays in rigs coming out of maintenance in both Mexico and the North Sea due to tight supply chains and busy shipyards. We expect these are only timing delays and see no impact to our overall outlook for OFSE this year.\nIn line with our previous commitments, we continue to enhance returns to our shareholders. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.21, which represents an 11% increase year-on-year; repurchased $158 million of shares and remain firmly on track to deliver 60% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders.\nTurning to the macro on Slide 5. Since bottoming in December of last year, oil prices have rallied significantly, a resilient global economy, steeper-than-expected seasonal decline in U.S. oil production to start the year and the roll forward of OPEC+ production cuts have helped to keep global oil markets more balanced. OPEC+ timing on restarting global oil production, the trajectory of global economic activity and the geopolitical risk will be key factors in determining the oil price path for the remainder of the year.\nWe reiterate our 2024 North America and international drilling and completion spending outlooks as we see potential offsets to higher oil prices. In North America, our outlook remains for a year-over-year decline in the low to mid-single-digit range. We continue to anticipate declining activity in U.S. gas basins, partially offsetting modest improvement in oil activity during the second half of the year. Across international markets, we maintain our expectations for high single-digit growth. This contemplates extended OPEC plus cuts through the end of the year, as well as any potential timing differences between the transitioning of rigs from oil to gas in Saudi Arabia.\nLooking out beyond 2024, we expect continued upstream spending growth despite the recent MSC target reduction in Saudi Arabia, although at a more moderate pace than we have experienced in recent years. We expect growth to be led by offshore markets in Latin America and West Africa as well as the Middle East.\nAs we move into the next phase of the upstream spending cycle, we anticipate increasing focus on optimizing production from existing assets. At our annual meeting in January, we launched mature asset solutions, an emerging business that maximizes the health and value of our customers' mature fields. It leverages our decades of experience, deep domain knowledge and industry-leading technologies, including Leucipa, and coveted franchises in both upstream chemicals and artificial lift.\nWe continue to experience strong customer demand Leucipa for as this differentiated digital solution is driving next level efficiencies for our customers through automation, digital optimization and workflow orchestration.\nTurning to global natural gas and LNG on Slide 6. The long-term demand outlook for both remains very encouraging. Through 2040, we expect natural gas demand to grow by almost 20%, representing a 1% CAGR driven growth in underlying energy demand and the desire to drive towards a Net-zero energy ecosystem.\nLooking at non-OECD Asia, coal still accounts for about 60% of power generation, which is 3 to 4x the level utilized in the United States and Europe. As this region increasingly focuses on reducing and abating emissions, we expect coal to gas substitution to be more pervasive helping to drive a minimal digit CAGR for both India and China natural gas demand through 2040, while the rest of Asia will grow at solid low single-digit rate.\nStrong underlying natural gas demand was a robust growth in LNG over the coming decades. Through the end of this decade, we expect demand to increase by mid-single digits annually. We believe this will support stalled nameplate capacity of 800 MTPA by 2030. Looking out to 2040, we expect LNG demand growth to continue, requiring further capacity additions beyond 800 MTPA. While there could be periods of price volatility driven by temporary dislocations in supply and demand over this time period, we see these as opportunities for accelerated demand creation.\nLNG consumers who tend to be very price sensitive typically respond to lower prices with stronger demand. We have seen evidence of this recently. Global LNG demand is up 4% year-to-date against the backdrop of an approximate 50% decline in LNG prices over the same period.\nAs shown on Slide 7, we expect global LNG FIDs of about 100 MTPA over the next 3 years. This view, supported by customer dialogue and our internal LNG demand expectations would result in our installed capacity increasing by 70%. This growing installed base brings significant opportunities for Baker Hughes across the life cycle of the equipment.\nLike our industrial peers, our Gas Tech businesses typically generate more profitability on the less cyclical aftermarket services. For LNG equipment specifically, this accounted for less than 10% of our total company EBITDA last year.\nOn the new energy front, we continue to see good momentum with a number of positive developments across our 5 focus areas of CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal, Clean Power and emission abatement. As mentioned, we booked $239 million of new energy orders during the first quarter including a Climate Technology Solutions award from Snam for compression trains driven by hydrogen-ready Nova LT12 turbines. This equipment will support a new gas compressor station in Italy that will eventually transport additional hydrocarbons from Azerbaijan, Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region to Northern Europe.\nCTS also secured an order to supply ICL Zero emissions integrated compressor technology to be deployed by Total Energy for a process plant in the Rack Walter region of Argentina. We continue to expand our relationship with the key Middle Eastern industrial company, securing a CTS order for the refurbishment of steam turbines and centrifical compressor trains. This upgrade drives process efficiency improvement and 5% estimated CO2 emissions reduction as part of the customer's energy transition road map.\nAs we look out at the rest of the year, we remain confident in achieving new energy orders between $800 million and $1 billion, which would amount to a tripling of new energy orders since 2021. Longer term, we continue to be encouraged by increasing opportunities to support growing energy demand and decarbonization giving us confidence in achieving our $6 billion to $7 billion new energy orders target in 2030.\nTurning to Slide 8. I wanted to take a moment to reflect on some of the emerging themes within the energy sector. It has been a busy quarter with several industry events, including our own annual meeting in Florence where we hosted over 2,000 customers, partners and industry leaders in January. Firstly, it is becoming clearer just how complex the undertaking is the transition of the world's energy ecosystem. This complexity is driving a slower-than-expected expansion of renewable energy capacity and leading to record levels of coal demand. Consequently, we are seeing more pragmatism towards a pathway fatigue carbonization.\nWe're growing urgency to affect this trend. There is mounting consensus that there is no possible route to decarbonize the energy system without driving greater efficiency and significantly increasing gases weighting within the overall energy mix.\nEnergy providers face the multifaceted challenge of providing secure, sustainable and affordable energy against the backdrop of increasing energy demand. Gas is abundant. Lower emission, low cost and the speed to scale is unrivaled. This is the age of gas. Whether it be the super majors, the NOCs or the independent companies, all of our customers are messaging that they plan to increase their exposure to gas in the coming years. Baker Hughes is extremely well positioned to facilitate this through our upstream capabilities in OFSE and expertise in LNG and gas infrastructure in IET.\nAn excellent example of this is the reallocation of capital in Saudi Arabia, primarily towards gas, following the recent announcement to not pursue an increase to its maximum sustainable capacity. The country's shifting focus towards natural gas where production is now expected to increase by more than 60% through 2030 will require significant investment in gas infrastructure. This represents a sizable opportunity for our IET business as highlighted by our MGS3 award.\nConsidering this transition towards gas as well as increasing investments in new energy and chemicals, we see this announcement as a long-term net positive for Baker Hughes given our exposure to all 3 markets. In addition, we are seeing a number of gas infrastructure projects emerge around the world. These midstream opportunities, along with solid first quarter bookings give us confidence that non-LNG Gas Tech Equipment orders will be up more than 50% this year.\nAdding further impetus to this growth theme is an increasing demand for artificial intelligence, which is expected to be a key enabler in driving significant productivity and efficiency improvement across the entire energy value chain and could enhance decarbonization efforts.\nAt Baker Hughes, we have been utilizing AI within our digital solutions for a number of years. We continue to make great progress with our Leucipa production optimization solution in OFSE and drive greater efficiencies and reliability with our Cordiant solutions platform in IET, which both leverage AI. The efficiency and productivity benefits of AI will be balanced by the increased need for energy-intensive data centers. AI will likely drive substantial electrical load growth. Therefore, increasing both the challenge and opportunity to provide clean, reliable and firm power solutions.\nGiven the requirement for continuous power supply, the demand for distributed power systems will be substantial with gas to likely dominant fuel source. Baker Hughes is again well positioned to participate in this market through our clean power solutions, particularly our NovaLT fleet of turbines, which can run on natural gas and hydrogen. As the market scales, the size of data centers and power needs will also likely grow, which would benefit our larger scale solutions that include steam turbans for SMR solutions and net power.\nWith the growing realization that we need an all-of-the-above approach to the energy transition, the focus is shifting towards the emissions rather than the fuel source. I have spoken about this important shift for several years now, and we are pleased to see it taking hold in our customers' operations and policy initiatives. It's increasing alignment towards the view is spanning stronger momentum, in particular, for CCUS CCUS. This is very encouraging to see and provides tailwinds for our technology solutions that play across the entire CCUS value chain.\nSpecifically, on the capture side, we continue to make progress across our portfolio, where we are developing a suite of solutions that have applications across various scales and purities of CO2, complementing our capture portfolio at the decades of experience we have in CO2 compression and storage. For CO2 compression, we have experienced a strong increase in demand, both for offshore and onshore applications, while we are also involved in several CO2 storage projects.\nIn summary, all of these themes play to the strengths of Baker Hughes and continue to our conviction in our strategy. With our expansive portfolio, capabilities and solutions offerings, we are uniquely positioned to deliver value for our diverse set of energy and industrial customers. This is what differentiates Baker Hughes and enables us to deliver durable earnings and free cash flow across our free time horizons.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy.\n\nNancy K. Buese\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Newmont Goldcorp Corp.\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I'll begin on Slide 10 with an overview of our consolidated results and then speak to segment details before outlining our second quarter outlook. We are very pleased with our first quarter results above the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance. Orders remain solid as the diversity of IET's end markets continue to support a strong level of orders. We continue to make progress on driving operational improvements across the business to enhance margins and returns, highlighted by the consistent improvement in EBITDA margins and ROIC. We remain confident in our full year guidance that points to another strong year for Baker Hughes.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $943 million increased 21% year-over-year and came in above the midpoint of our guidance range which was due to stronger performance in IET. First quarter GAAP operating income was $653 million. Adjusted operating income was $660 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.45. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $0.43, an increase of 50% compared to the same quarter last year.\nOur adjusted tax rate continues to trend downwards, declining to 29.7% in the quarter as we continue to execute as planned. As a reminder, we guided to a midpoint of 29.5% in 2024, down from our average 2023 tax rate of approximately 33%.\nCorporate costs for the quarter were $88 million, $2 million lower than our guidance. Total company orders of $6.5 billion maintained strong momentum, highlighted by continued strength in IET orders of $2.9 billion. Alongside a strong order book, IET RPO ended the quarter at $29.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year, while OFSC RPO remained at a healthy $3.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year. These RPO levels provide exceptional revenue and earnings visibility over the coming years.\nFree cash flow was robust, coming in at $502 million. For the full year, we continue to target free cash flow conversion of 45% to 50% and expect free cash flow to be more weighted towards the back half of this year.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our balance sheet remains strong, as we ended the first quarter with cash of $2.7 billion, net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.8x and liquidity of $5.7 billion.\nLet's turn to capital allocation on Slide 12. In the first quarter, we returned $368 million to shareholders. This included $210 million of dividends where we have increased the quarterly dividend 3x over the past 6 quarters. In addition, we repurchased $158 million of shares. We remain committed to returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. Since the company was formed in 2017, we've now returned over $10 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Our primary focus is to continue growing our dividend with increases aligned with the structural growth in the company's earning power. We will continue to use buybacks to reach our 60% to 80% target and we'll remain opportunistic on buybacks within this range.\nNow I'll walk you through our business segment results in more detail and provide our second quarter outlook. Starting with oilfield services and equipment on Slide 13. The segment maintained its strong margin trajectory meeting our margin expectations despite heavier seasonality across our international markets. This is a testament to the work the OFSE team has done to drive cost efficiencies across the business.\nand flexibles helped to drive SSPS orders of $633 million, in line with fourth quarter levels. We expect the offshore market to remain strong and SSPS orders should remain at solid levels in 2024 and beyond. OFSE revenue in the quarter was $3.8 billion, up 6% year-over-year. International revenue was down 5% sequentially, while North America fell 3%. Delays in rig reactivations in Mexico and the North Sea impacted international activity, adding to the traditional seasonal declines typically experienced during the first quarter. In North America, offshore declined while North America land held flat.\nOFSE EBITDA in the quarter was $644 million, up 11% year-over-year. This came in slightly below our guidance midpoint due to the previously mentioned seasonal declines and slower-than-anticipated activation of offshore rigs, factors that were considered in our guidance range. OFSE EBITDA margin rate was 17%, increasing 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by continued improvements in cost efficiencies, productivity enhancements and improved execution, particularly in SSPS.\nNow turning to Industrial and Energy Technology on Slide 14. This segment performed above the midpoint of our EBITDA guidance during the quarter due to improving revenues and margins. IET orders were solid $2.9 billion with non-LNG Gas Tech Equipment orders more than tripling compared to last year, highlighting the diversity of our customer base and end market exposure. CTS orders were $193 million in the first quarter, highlighted by strong orders for our NovaLT12 turbines that can run on 100% hydrogen.\nIET RPO ended the quarter at $29.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Gas Tech Equipment RPO was $11.5 billion. Gas Tech Services RPO was $14.6 billion. Gas Tech Equipment book-to-bill was onetime, the 11th consecutive quarter of 1% or greater.\nTurning to Slide 15. IET revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, up 23% versus the prior year, led by a 46% increase in Gas Tech Equipment revenues as we continue to execute our robust backlog. IET EBITDA was $386 million, up 30% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $380 million from better gas tech equipment backlog conversion and strong performance in Industrial Tech. Both drivers were previously identified as factors that would push us to the higher end of our guidance range.\nEBITDA margin was 14.7%, up 80 basis points year-over-year against the backdrop of robust growth in Gas Tech Equipment. Solid margin improvement in both Industrial Tech and Gas Tech Equipment were partially offset by higher R&D spend related to our new energy investments and continued supply chain tightness in Gas Tech Services.\nBefore walking through our updated outlook, which is shown on Slide 16, I would like to spend some time on the progress each business is making on achieving their 20% EBITDA margin targets. We're off to a strong start to the year in OFSE and IET. EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points for both segments when compared to the same quarter last year. Looking forward, we see good progression throughout the year and remain confident in our ability to achieve these targets in 2025 for OFSE and 2026 for IET. These are important targets that set a benchmark and demonstrate our operational progress since announcing the consolidation into our 2 segments from 4 segments previously. These actions helped to streamline the organization and have created a simpler, leaner and lower cost structure that allows for faster decision-making and has driven more than [ $115 ] million of cost out across the company. In reality, we've been working on this since we brought the businesses together in 2017. To accelerate our transition to an energy technology company, we have long held the three-pronged approach of transforming the core, investing for growth and positioning for new energy frontiers.\nTo date, the success of transforming a key initiative to drive higher profitability and returns across the company has been most visible in OFSE. For this segment, margins are expected to approach 18% this year, up more than 400 basis points from pre-COVID levels. The OFSE team has done a tremendous job transforming the way the business operates with a focus on rightsizing operations, removing duplication and improving service to liberty to drive sustainable, structural improvement in OFSE margins.\nTurning to IET's margin journey. This segment's margin progress has been more measured in part due to the tremendous growth in our Gas Tech Equipment business, where we have consistently exceeded our order expectations. We are very excited by the robust growth in our equipment installed base that will drive decades of margin-accretive service growth in Gas Tech.\nThe IET team is committed to executing its margin expansion strategy, as the nucleus of this strategy is instilling a more rigorous process-driven culture across the organization. These changes are helping to drive enhanced operational discipline and dedication to continuous improvement. In addition, there is a cultural shift to focus more on value over volume. With these foundational elements in place alongside the opportunities for better R&D absorption, supply chain optimization and execution of higher-margin backlog, we remain confident in achieving 20% margins for the segment.\nNext, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the 2 business segments. Overall, the outlook remains strong for our businesses, which will be complemented by continued operational enhancements, sustained improvement in backlog execution and margin upside. We continue to focus on operational excellence and service delivery across our 2 segments.\nFor Baker Hughes, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $6.6 billion and $7.05 billion and EBITDA between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, resulting in EBITDA margin rate increasing quarter-over-quarter by approximately 70 basis points at the midpoint.\nFor OFSE, we expect second quarter results to reflect typical seasonal growth in international and flattish activity in North America. We expect second quarter OFSE revenue between $3.8 billion and $4.0 billion and EBITDA between $660 million and $710 million. Factors impacting this range include the phasing of 2024 E&P budgets, SSPS backlog conversion, realization of further cost-out initiatives and the pace of recovery and activity that was deferred in the first quarter.\nFor IET, we expect second quarter results to benefit from strong year-over-year revenue growth as we continue to execute on our near-record backlog for Gas Tech Equipment and convert our healthy backlog in Industrial technology. We also expect to see continued progress on our margins as we drive productivity enhancements and process improvements across the business.\nOverall, we expect second quarter IET revenue between $2.8 billion and $3.05 billion and EBITDA between $425 million and $475 million. The major factors driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion in Gas Tech Equipment, the impact of any aeroderivative supply chain tightness in Gas Tech and operational execution in Industrial Tech.\nTurning to our full year outlook. We maintain our 2024 guidance issued in January of this year. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect Baker Hughes revenue to be between $26.5 million and $28.5 billion and EBITDA between $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion. At the midpoint, our outlook results in EBITDA growing a strong 14% from the prior year.\nIn addition, we still expect total company new energy orders of $800 million to $1 billion, which at the high end would amount to a tripling of new energy orders since 2021.\nFor OFSE, we maintain our full year forecast of revenue between $15.75 billion and $16.75 billion, and EBITDA between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion as we expect continued strength across international markets to be modestly offset by softness in North America land. We expect IET orders to remain at robust levels this year and maintain a range between $11.5 million to $13.5 billion, driven by strong momentum across all aspects of the IET portfolio. As mentioned, we've already experienced a noticeable increase in non-LNG Gas Tech Equipment orders in the first quarter.\nAs a result of continued momentum and exceptional orders performance over the last 2 years, we maintain our full year IET guidance for revenue between $10.75 billion and $11.75 billion and EBITDA between $1.65 billion and $1.85 billion.\nIn summary, we remain confident in our ability to generate double-digit EBITDA growth for the fourth consecutive year as we remain focused on execution, driving further operational improvements, and capitalizing on market tailwinds with our differentiated portfolio of products and services. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress demonstrated by our first quarter results and remain excited about the future of Baker Hughes.\nI'll turn the call back to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO\n\nThank you, Nancy. Turning to Slide 18. 2024 is off to a strong start for Baker Hughes, highlighted by our strong margin performance in both OFSE and IET. Our continued focus on commercial enhancements and cost efficiencies are driving structural improvement in both segments underlying margins. With these transformational efforts gaining momentum, we remain on track to achieve our 20% margin targets for both segments.\nMargin improvement and EBITDA growth are important parts of the Baker Hughes story. As important, we have significantly improved our returns on invested capital, which has increased by more than 3x compared to 2019 levels. Our focus on disciplined growth and margin enhancement facilitated by transforming the way we work is helping to drive meaningful improvements in returns across the company.\nWith margins, EBITDA and returns forecast to increase further over the coming years, we expect to see stronger free cash flow conversion of at least 50% through the cycle, and as a result, higher free cash flow. When combined with our balanced portfolio, untapped market opportunities and overhauled cost structure, Baker Hughes is becoming less cyclical in nature and capable of generating more durable earnings and free cash flow across cycles.\nAll of these metrics provide a healthy backdrop as we remain committed to returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. This will add to the impressive $10 billion plus that we have already returned to shareholders since forming the new company in 2017. To put this in context, this amounts to almost 1/3 of our current market cap. We have a history of returning cash to shareholders and expect to continue that trend well into the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Chase.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. Operator, let's open the call for questions.",

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Chase Mulvehill, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Baker Hughes Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Nancy Buese. The earnings release we issued yesterday evening can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com. We will also be using a presentation with our prepared remarks during this webcast, which can also be found on our investor website.\nAs a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Chase. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.\n2023 proved to be a pivotal year for Baker Hughes as we continue our journey to reshape the company. We successfully removed $150 million of costs, realigned our IET business and recently launched actions to further streamline our OFSE business. Our strategy to transform the way we operate is working.\nTurning to Slide 4. In 2023, we set records for all primary financial metrics, including orders, revenue, EBITDA, EPS, free cash flow and most importantly, returns. Adjusted EBITDA was up 26% year-over-year, a third consecutive year of double-digit increases and exceeding prior cycle peak levels by 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.60, 76% above 2022 levels.\nFree cash flow increased 83% year-over-year to just over $2 billion. Total company orders increased 14% year-over-year as IET orders of $14.2 billion grew 12% when compared to last year's record orders and marked the third consecutive year of double-digit growth. New Energy orders totaled $750 million, up $45 year-over-year. SSPS orders increased by 27% to $3.9 billion, the largest order year since 2014. These record results highlight strong market tailwinds across both segments and the significant operational improvements the company has accomplished since 2022.\nClearly, we are pleased with the progress demonstrated in 2023 and excited about where the company is headed in 2024 and beyond.\nTurning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.09 billion came in above the midpoint of our guidance range due to the continued operational improvement and full realization of the $150 million of cost out. Free cash flow of $633 million exceeded expectations and resulted in full year free cash flow conversion of 54%. IET orders remained strong, exceeding $3 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter. In addition, we were awarded more than $1 billion of CSA commitments. In OFSE, we continue to demonstrate solid margin improvement during the quarter, with segment EBITDA margin increasing to 17.9% as OFSE EBITDA margins now exceed 20%, both record margins.\nTurning to the Macro on Slide 6. Oil prices have weakened considerably since peaking in late September. Ultimately, weaker-than-anticipated oil demand coupled with robust production growth led to an unexpected inventory build into year-end. However, prices still remain at levels that are favorable for growth across our core OFSE markets. For 2024, demand growth remains the biggest unknown in the face of global economic uncertainty and heightened geopolitical risk.\nOn the supply side, the biggest risk factor is non-OPEC supply outpacing demand, possibly requiring OPEC+ to maintain the current level of cuts through the end of 2024. The volatility in commodity prices experienced during the fourth quarter and so far in 2024, will likely have some influence on upstream development plans. Accordingly, we now see international D&C spend growth decelerating into the high single-digit range this year, which is down slightly from our prior expectations for low double-digit growth.\nNevertheless, the international cycle remains healthy, and we see no deviation from the long-term development plans set in place amongst some of the world's largest NOCs. The offshore cycle is maintaining the momentum built over the past couple of years, and we have good visibility on the development pipeline, which is expected to support strong activity levels over the next several years. In North America, activity continues to lag, and we are now anticipating no meaningful recovery in activity during the first half of the year.\nOn our last quarterly call, we expected 2024 North American D&C spend to be flattish, but now expect spending down in low to mid-single digits driven by mid-single-digit declines in U.S. land. The combination of a volatile commodity price environment, sector consolidation and the inherent elasticity of shale versus conventional developments are all factors contributing to the slower ramp-up in activity. In OFSE, we secured 2 significant multiyear integrated services contracts with a Latin American operator for drilling, completion and plug and abandonment services, highlighting the customers' confidence in Baker Hughes' diverse technology and service offering.\nIn the offshore market, we were awarded additional subsea trees during the quarter, bringing our total number of subsea tree awards in 2023 to 60. Turning to LNG on Slide 7. Despite the recent weakness in LNG prices, we believe the long-term outlook for the global LNG market remains solid. In fact, LNG prices remain at relatively strong levels compared to historical averages. For example, 2023 European and Asian gas prices averaged about 20% above the 10-year average. In the fourth quarter, global LNG demand was up approximately 4% year-over-year. For the full year, global LNG demand reached record levels of 405 MTPA up 2% compared to 2022 despite softer-than-anticipated gas demand in Europe.\nLNG demand in Europe was around 115 MTPA in line with 2022 levels. Demand in China was 71 MTPA, up 10% year-over-year. With estimated global nameplate capacity of 491 MTPA last year, effective utilization averaged 86%, which represents a tight LNG market.\nLooking into 2024, we forecast LNG demand to increase by 2% which should result in utilization rates remaining at strong levels as we forecast just 15 MTPA of nameplate capacity coming online this year.\nLooking out to 2025 and 2026, we see a similar trend of supply growth being balanced by demand growth, which should keep global LNG markets at good utilization levels. With energy markets, including LNG, still fundamentally tight, global coal demand set another record last year, increasing 1.4% year-over-year to 8.5 billion tonnes. We think this recent growth in coal demand provides additional long-term growth opportunities for LNG, where we see cleaner-burning natural gas replacing high-emission coal in the energy mix across many Asian countries, where coal is still the predominant energy source for electricity.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we were pleased to be awarded by ADNOC gas on behalf of ADNOC, two electric liquefaction systems for the 9.6 MTPA Ruwais LNG project in the United Arab Emirates. The LNG trains will be driven by Baker Hughes' 75-megawatt brush electric motor technology and will feature our state-of-the-art compressor technology making Ruwais LNG one of the first all-electric LNG projects in the Middle East.\nIn 2023, we were extremely pleased to book almost 80 MTPA of LNG orders, which outpaced FIDs of 57 MTPA. This variance was the result of the timing difference between orders and FIDs, which has been accentuated by the tightening LNG equipment market. The outlook for FIDs over the next few years remains strong, and we see projects progressing across all markets. For 2024, specifically, we expect LNG FIDs of around 65 MTPA. However, it is important to note this includes a couple of major LNG orders that were booked during 2023. As we look out to 2025 and 2026, we could see between 30 to 60 MTPA of FIDs annually, bringing total potential LNG FIDs to 125 MTPA and 185 MTPA through 2026.\nBased on existing capacity, projects under construction and future FIDs in the pipeline, we have line of sight for global LNG installed capacity to reach 800 MTPA by the end of 2030, representing an almost 75% increase in nameplate capacity from 2022 levels. This provides good visibility for significant near-term growth in Gas Tech equipment, where we have the broadest set of LNG solutions to suit customer needs, including our modular, stick build, onshore, offshore, floating and small-scale LNG offerings.\nIn addition, this expansion in our LNG installed base will provide long-term structural growth for our gas tech services.\nTurning now to Slide 8. On the New Energy front, we have seen a number of developments over the past quarter. At COP 28, which brought together 154 heads of state and other government officials and was well represented by Baker Hughes. I was particularly pleased to see the increased representation and participation from energy companies. Key commitments from the conference include doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030, net-zero methane emissions and no routine flaring by 2030, endorsement for a global hydrogen certification standard and accelerating efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power. We also continue to see progress on the policy and permitting front in the United States that should help advance emissions reductions progress. We are pleased with the U.S.' final ruling on the methane standards that should prevent an estimated 58 million tonnes of methane emissions from 2024 to 2038, according to the EPA.\nAdditionally, the state of Louisiana being granted primacy on Class 6 well permitting should help to reduce CCUS project bottlenecks in that region of the United States. In the area of hydrogen, the U.S. Treasury provided clarity on the 45V hydrogen tax credit, which could impact the pace of green hydrogen development. We are hopeful that a pragmatic resolution will be reached that actually encourages rather than inhibits new investments in this critical industry that will play a vital role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. As we have stated previously, the energy transition will likely be more challenging and take longer than many expect. This is why we, at Baker Hughes, are pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, where our technologies and capabilities have a key role to play in decarbonizing the planet irrespective of the fuel source. It is important to note the pace of the transition will not impact the ultimate size of the new energy market opportunity.\nAs an illustration, the IEA has sized the annual clean energy investment at $4.5 trillion by the early 2030s and $4.7 trillion by 2050 under their net-zero scenario. In comparison, investment in fossil fuels totaled just under $1 trillion last year.\nTurning to Slide 9. We are focused on executing our strategy over our free time horizons. Over the first horizon, we're focused on unlocking the full potential of Baker Hughes, successfully transforming our business and simplifying the way we work. We are committed to developing and commercializing our New Energy portfolio while also evolving our digital offerings across both OFSE and IET. These strategic investments, along with better penetration across various underserved energy and industrial markets will be the underpinning for driving peer-leading growth across our next 2 time horizons. While our activities in LNG and New Energy have been the focus for investors in recent years, I'd like to take this opportunity to shine a spotlight on parts of the broader IET portfolio. In Gas Tech, almost 50% of our equipment business is focused on serving customers outside of LNG. Our turbomachinery equipment, generators, motors and pumps have applications across multiple end markets, including upstream, midstream, refining, petrochemical and various industrial end markets.\nThese segments have demonstrated exceptional growth since 2020, increasing by more than 50%, and we have good visibility on a number of growth opportunities in the coming year. Take the FPSO markets, for example, we have booked more than $1 billion of awards over the past 2 years and expect the market could see a further 7 to 9 FPSOs take FID each year out to the latter part of this decade. We are also seeing a lot of potential opportunities in onshore gas processing and pipelines as natural gas becomes an important aspect of the energy mix around the world, particularly in places like the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\nThe diversity of our end markets and the opportunity set is not confined to equipment. In Gas Tech Services, over 50% of our revenue has been generated from our transactional and upgrade services, which focus on maintaining our rotating equipment utilized in upstream, midstream, refining and petrochemical sectors. Like LNG, which accounts for less than 40% of the Gas Tech Services revenue, these non-LNG markets also have significant growth opportunities as our installed base expands significantly. Our industrial tech portfolio provides additional diversity into industrial markets like aerospace, automotive, steel and electronics.\nIn Industrial Solutions, we leverage our digital technology to monitor and maintain critical equipment. We have a significant opportunity to extend this service beyond our critical equipment to the balance of plant. In industrial products, we are focused on increasing market penetration in high-margin niche sectors.\nFinally and most importantly, we are able to leverage core technologies like compressors, turbo expanders and turbines across CTS' 5 targeted new energy markets. These are CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal, clean power and emissions management, providing additional long-term growth for IET. As you can see, we have a differentiated portfolio of technologies within IET that provides Baker Hughes a unique opportunity to grow well beyond LNG.\nBefore turning it over to Nancy, I would like to speak at a high level about our 2024 outlook. In OFSE, we expect solid revenue growth led by international, with a year of strong incremental margins as we continue to focus on reshaping the OFSE cost structure in pursuit of 20% margins in 2025. In IET, conversion of our record Gas Tech Equipment RPO will drive robust IET revenue growth with margins improving despite increasing mix headwinds and putting us on a path toward our 20% margin target in 2026.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy.\n\nNancy Buese\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I will begin on Slide 11 with an overview of our consolidated results and then briefly talk to segment details before outlining our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. We were very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. We made outstanding progress on all fronts during 2023. We booked another year of record orders in IET, capitalized on market tailwinds to deliver robust revenue growth across both segments, realized the full benefit of our $150 million cost out program and continued to transform how we operate.\nFor the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $1.09 billion came in above the midpoint of our guidance range, which was due to stronger margin performance across both segments. For the year, EBITDA came in at the upper end of our original $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion guidance range. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $651 million during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $816 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.43. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $0.51, which resulted in 2023 adjusted EPS of $1.60, a new record.\nTotal company orders of $6.9 billion during the quarter maintained strong momentum, highlighted by continued strength in IET orders. For the year, IET orders totaled $14.2 billion, which sets another record. SSPS full year orders were a robust $3.9 billion, which as Lorenzo mentioned, marks our largest order intake for that business since 2014. Thanks to the sustained strength in orders, IET RPO of $29.9 billion ended the quarter at yet another record level, while OFSE-RPO remained at a healthy $3.5 billion, up 37% year-over-year.\nThese RPO levels provide exceptional revenue and earnings visibility over the coming years. Free cash flow outperformed our expectations, coming in at $633 million. For the full year, we generated over $2 billion of free cash flow, resulting in a conversion rate of 54% from adjusted EBITDA, which was above the high end of our expected range.\nIn 2024, we are targeting free cash flow conversion of 45% to 50% and expect 50%-plus conversion rates through Horizons 2 and 3.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the fourth quarter with cash of $2.65 billion, net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.9x and liquidity of over $5.5 billion. During the fourth quarter, we extended our $3 billion revolving credit facility by 4 years, which now has a maturity of November 2028 and we also used available cash to pay down $650 million of senior notes.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 13. In 2023, we returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders equivalent to 65% of free cash flow. This included almost $800 million of dividends, where we have increased the quarterly dividend twice over the past 5 quarters. In addition, we repurchased $538 million of Baker Hughes shares in 2023, including $321 million during the fourth quarter. We are committed to returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to investors and have a strong track record. Since the company was formed in 2017, we've now returned $10 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.\nWe plan to grow our dividend with increases driven by the structural earnings power and growth of the company. We will continue to utilize buybacks to reach our 60% to 80% target and we'll remain opportunistic on buybacks within this range. Now I will walk you through the business segment results in more detail and provide our 2024 outlook. Starting with oilfield services and equipment on Slide 14. The segment performed slightly above expectations as OFS margins exceeded the 20% level despite the softer U.S. land market where rig activity fell 4% during the quarter.\nSSPS orders of $654 million contributed to the highest order year since 2014 with the offshore market expected to remain strong, we expect SSPS orders to persist at healthy levels in 2024 and beyond. OFSE revenue in the quarter was $3.95 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Excluding SSPS, international revenue was up 2% sequentially as seasonal declines in Europe were more than offset by strength in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Excluding SSPS, North America revenue was down 3% sequentially as North America land declined during the quarter. OFSE EBITDA in the quarter was $709 million, up 6% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year, while also slightly above our guidance midpoint of $705 million.\nOFSE EBITDA margin rate was 17.9%, increasing 99 basis points sequentially and 79 basis points year-over-year. SSPS margins significantly improved year-over-year increasing by 300 basis points to just over 8%, driven by improved execution and commercial success.\nNow turning to Industrial and Energy Technology on Slide 15. This segment also performed above expectations during the quarter due to a better-than-expected Gas Tech margin. IET orders were $3 billion, included more than $800 million of LNG equipment, bringing full year LNG equipment orders to approximately $5.6 billion. Orders in CTS, which now comprises IET's New Energy business increased to $123 million in the fourth quarter with about 80% of these orders representing projects across the clean power and emissions management markets. IET RPO ended the quarter at $29.9 billion, up 4% sequentially. Gas Tech Equipment RPO was $12.1 billion. Gas Tech Services RPO was $14.8 billion and included more than $1.1 billion of newly signed CSA contracts. Gas Tech Equipment book-to-bill was 1.1x, the tenth consecutive quarter above 1.\nTurning to Slide 16. IET revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 24% versus the prior year, led by Gas Tech Equipment growth that was up more than 40% year-over-year, driven by execution of project backlog. IET EBITDA was $463 million, up 8% year-over-year and coming in above our guidance midpoint of $460 million. EBITDA margin was 16.1% down 233 basis points year-over-year, a solid improvement in Gas Tech equipment margin was offset by mix and higher R&D spend related to our new energy investments.\nFor 2023, IET R&D spending increased by approximately $70 million as we continue to advance our New Energy investments as well as investing in other IET technology upgrades.\nTurning to Slide 17. Before detailing our outlook, I'd like to provide an update on our business transformation activities and the path that lies ahead in unlocking the full potential of Baker Hughes. Over the course of the past 18 months, the business has undertaken significant structural changes that delivered over $150 million of annualized cost synergies, providing sustainable benefits across the organization. However, there is still more to do as we continue our transformation journey. Our focus is on operational excellence and continuous improvement in all that we do. Early this year, we launched actions in OFSE to remove duplication and drive more cost efficiency across the business. These measures resulted in additional restructuring charges during the fourth quarter with these changes being executed during the first half of 2024.\nThese charges are almost entirely related to severance costs. It's important to note that these discrete OFSE actions will drive margin upside into the back half of this year and put the segment on a clear path to achieve 20% margins in 2025. As we continue our transformation work in 2024, we continue to focus on eliminating duplication, remaining focused on execution and listening to our customers, while ensuring the company is set up for success in the back half of this decade. In 2023, we laid the groundwork for improved execution, accountability and transparency. We will draw on those foundational aspects to evolve Baker Hughes. We've begun the work of synchronizing many diverse systems and working towards efficient and streamlined processes and reporting.\nThese efforts will allow us efficiency gains, improve data, all oriented towards the goal of structural margin improvements. A further part of our transformation journey is centered around our approach to customers and meeting their needs. As we've highlighted, customers are increasingly looking for integrated solutions as they reduce the emissions footprint of their operations. It is critical that our OFSE and IET commercial teams collaborate and respond to these customer demands. Driven by this developing customer trend, we see an opportunity for greater collaboration across the Baker Hughes organization, which will be a vitally important factor in unlocking the full commercial potential of our unique and differentiated service and technology portfolio.\nNext, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the 2 business segments, which is detailed on Slide 18. Overall, the outlook remains strong for both OFSE and IET with tailwinds expected to persist across each business in spite of macro uncertainty. This will be complemented by continued operational enhancements, driving sustained improvement in backlog execution and margin upside as we pursue our 20% margin target across both segments.\nFor Baker Hughes, we expect first quarter revenue to be between $6.1 billion and $6.6 billion and EBITDA between $880 million and $960 million. For IET, we expect first quarter results to reflect seasonal declines in both Gas Tech and industrial tech businesses. However, due to improved linearity, we expect Gas Tech sequential declines to be less pronounced than prior years. Overall, for IET, we expect first quarter revenue between $2.4 billion and $2.65 billion and EBITDA between $340 million and $380 million.\nThe major factors driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion in Gas Tech Equipment and the impact of any aeroderivative supply chain tightness in Gas Tech. For OFSE, we expect first quarter results to reflect the typical seasonal decline in international revenues as well as a slow start across U.S. land markets. We therefore expect first quarter OFSE revenue between $3.7 billion and $3.95 billion and EBITDA between $630 million and $670 million. Factors driving this range include the pacing of 2024 E&P budgets, SSPS backlog conversion, realization of further cost-out initiatives and winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere.\nTurning to our full year outlook. For the full year 2024, we expect Baker Hughes revenue to be between $26.5 million and $28.5 billion and EBITDA between $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion. In addition, we expect total company New Energy orders of $800 million to $1 billion, which would amount to more than tripling of New Energy orders since 2021. We expect IET orders to remain at robust levels this year, anticipating a range between $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion, driven by strong momentum across all aspects of the IET portfolio. Importantly, we expect a noticeable increase in non-LNG Gas Tech Equipment orders. As a result of this continued momentum and exceptional orders performance over the last 2 years, we expect full year IET revenue between $10.75 billion and $11.75 billion and EBITDA between $1.65 billion and $1.85 billion. For OFSE, we forecast full year revenue between and $15.75 billion and $16.75 billion and EBITDA between $2.8 billion and $3 billion as we expect softness in North American land to more than offset continued strength across international markets.\nIn summary, 2023 was a strong year of execution for Baker Hughes, where we delivered results near the high end of our original guidance range and set records for all our primary financial metrics. In 2024, we expect double-digit EBITDA growth for the fourth consecutive year as we remain focused on execution, driving further operational improvements and capitalizing on market tailwinds with our unique solutions and equipment portfolio.\nLastly, we are intensely focused on achieving the guidance set for 2024 and our 20% EBITDA margin targets for OFSE in 2025 and IET in 2026 and while 20% segment margins are important intermediate goals, we will continue to take transformative actions to exceed these levels. Overall, we are proud of the progress demonstrated by our 2023 results and remain very excited about the future of Baker Hughes. I'll turn the call back over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Nancy. As you can see from our strong 2023 results and the exceptionally strong margin improvement illustrated on Slide 20. Baker Hughes is on its way to becoming a leaner and more efficient energy technology company. We continue to carefully execute our plan to drive margins meaningfully higher. Put simply, we remain relentless in transforming the way we operate. We also have a unique technology portfolio that will drive growth across all 3 of our horizons irrespective of the pace of the energy transition. In addition, our versatile OFSE and IET portfolios provide significant growth opportunities across underserved end markets. It's this broad-based portfolio that underpinned our [ 17% ] EBITDA compounded annual growth rate from 2020 through 2023.\nGiven our balanced portfolio, untapped market opportunities and overhaul cost structure, Baker Hughes is becoming less cyclical in nature and therefore, should generate more durable earnings and free cash flow across cycles. Finally, while on this journey, we remain committed to our employees, customers and shareholders as we continue to push Baker Hughes forward. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chase.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. Operator, let's open the call for questions.",

We also delivered strong operating results at the upper end of our EBITDA guidance range, booked almost $100 million of new energy orders and generated $592 million of free cash flow. We continue to see positive momentum across our portfolio despite persisting global uncertainty.\nTurning to the macro on Slide 5. Oil prices have rebounded as the combination of resilient oil demand and production cuts have tightened the market. As a result, the oil market is likely to see inventory draws through the rest of 2023. Continued discipline from the world's largest producers, the pace of oil demand growth in the face of economic uncertainty and geopolitical risk will be important factors to monitor as we look into 2024.\nWhile oil prices have strengthened during the second half of this year, upstream development plans are mostly set through year-end. Therefore, we remain confident in our 2023 outlook. We still expect international drilling and completion spending to be up year-over-year in the mid-teens and North America up by mid- to high single digits. As we have said previously, we expect this upstream spending cycle to be more durable and less sensitive to commodity price swings relative to prior cycles.\nHigher hydrocarbon prices do provide positive momentum into operators' development plans for next year. While it is still early and with the caveat there is growing geopolitical risk, we do see another year of solid upstream spending growth in 2024, led by international and offshore markets. In the offshore market specifically, we were awarded 21 subsea trees during the quarter which includes a significant equipment order from a sub-Saharan African operator. This award expands Baker Hughes' presence in offshore Angola and consists of 11 deepwater horizontal trees, Aptara manifolds and subsea controls.\nOFSE also saw continued growth in the North Sea, booking 2 major multiyear contracts from Vår Energi, one being a long-term contract for well intervention and exploration logging services and the other being an order to deliver 7 vertical tree systems for the Balder Field.\nTurning to LNG. Despite a soft economy, the global LNG market remains fundamentally tight. This tightness is evidenced by the recent LNG price spikes that resulted from the current geopolitical situation and strikes in Australia by LNG workers, which temporarily interrupted operations at several LNG facilities. In the third quarter, global LNG demand was up approximately 1.5% year-over-year. Year-to-date, global LNG demand has reached record levels at just over 300 MTPA. This is despite softer than anticipated gas demand and economic weakness persisting in key LNG consuming markets like Europe and China. Globally, we expect 2023 LNG demand to approach 410 MTPA or up about 2% compared to last year. With estimated global nameplate capacity of 490 MTPA this year, effective utilization is expected to be over 90%, which has historically represented a tight market.\nLooking into 2024, we forecast LNG demand to increase by 3%, which should result in utilization rates remaining at elevated levels as we forecast just 15 MTPA of nameplate capacity coming online next year. Looking out to 2025 and 2026, we see similar trend of supply growth being balanced by demand growth, which should keep global LNG markets at relatively strong utilization levels.\nLNG prices remain healthy, which has helped to sustain the strength in offtake contracting, a key driver of LNG FIDs. During the quarter, we received an order to provide additional liquefaction equipment and a power island to Venture Global as part of our upsized master equipment supply agreement of over 100 MTPA. As a reminder, we have provided LNG modules for both of Venture Global's 10 MTPA Calcasieu Pass and 20 MTPA Plaquemines projects.\nAdditionally, we were pleased to be recently awarded by ADNOC Gas on behalf of ADNOC, 2 electric liquefication systems for the 9.6 MTPA Ruwais LNG project in the United Arab Emirates. The award is expected to be booked in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was announced at this year's ADIPEC conference. The LNG trains will be driven by Baker Hughes' 75-megawatt BRUSH electric motor technology and will feature our state-of-the-art compressor technology, making Ruwais LNG one of the first all-electric LNG projects in the Middle East.\nWe are pleased to see continued traction from BRUSH Power Generation which we acquired in 2022 to enhance our industrial electric machinery portfolio and to support our strategic commitment to provide lower carbon solutions. Since then, we have secured several additional orders for our electric machinery portfolio, including a contract from Wison in the first quarter for 4 ELNG compressor trains in sub-Saharan Africa. These recent successes of BRUSH further validate our strategy of investing in bolt-on M&A opportunities that can complement the current IET and OFSE portfolios as well as our efforts in new energy.\nTurning to Slide 6. Through the third quarter, 53 MTPA of capacity has taken FID this year. For 2023, we expect to book LNG orders totaling approximately 80 MTPA given we sometimes receive larger LNG orders before projects have taken FID. The LNG project pipeline remains strong, both in the U.S. and internationally. Therefore, we expect to see similar year-over-year levels of FID activity in 2024 and could see between 30 to 60 MTPA of LNG FIDs in both 2025 and 2026.\nBased on existing capacity, projects under construction and future FIDs in the pipeline, we have line of sight for global LNG installed capacity to reach 800 MTPA by the end of 2030. This represents an almost 70% increase in nameplate capacity from 2022, which provides significant near-term growth for Gas Tech Equipment and further long-term structural growth for Gas Tech Services.\nImportantly, since 2017, there have been 204 MTPA of LNG FIDs and Baker Hughes has been selected for 201 MTPA of this new capacity. These projects are scheduled to come online over the coming years, representing an almost 50% increase in our global liquefaction installed base between now and 2028.\nTurning to Slide 7. We have long held the view that natural gas is an abundant, low-carbon and versatile energy source. It will play a critical role as both a transition and destination fuel. Accordingly, natural gas will be fundamental in satisfying the world's energy needs for many decades to come, while also improving air quality and reducing global emissions, displacing coal in the broader energy mix. We forecast that primary energy demand will continue to grow beyond 2040 due to rising population and increasing consumption per capita in the developing world. However, it is essential to meet this growing demand with affordable and reliable energy to ensure a strong global economy.\nToday's mix of primary energy demand is still heavily reliant upon coal, which accounted for 24% of global energy demand in 2022. In many Asian countries like China and India, coal is a much higher share of the energy mix. This is the opportunity for cleaner burning natural gas to be paired with renewables and/or CCUS as a baseload energy source to displace coal in the energy mix over the coming decades. That being said, all energy sources will be needed to meet increasing energy demand although with an increasing importance on minimizing global emissions. Importantly, many of our customers' long-term spending plans are beginning to reflect this evolving energy mix. This presents significant customer synergies across our IET and OFSE portfolios, providing a unique opportunity to be an integrated solutions provider as the energy transition takes shape.\nTurning to Slide 8. As we take energy forward, making it safer, cleaner and more efficient for people in the planet, we are focused on our strategic framework of transforming our core to strengthen our margin and returns profile while also investing for growth and positioning for new frontiers in the energy transition. Through these key pillars, our company is building and executing a plan to deliver sustainable value for our shareholders and stakeholders.\nAs our strategy and the energy markets have evolved, we have been increasingly focused on the execution of our strategy across 3 time horizons. Across the first time horizon, which spans through 2025, we are focused on driving enhanced margin accretion through organizational simplification and expanded efficiencies, operational discipline and optimization of asset and people productivity. Importantly, these actions are well within our control. During this period, Baker Hughes remains poised to benefit from the macro tailwinds that we see across our 2 business segments. Specifically, we remain well positioned to benefit from the continued strength in the natural gas and LNG growth cycle as well as the multiyear increases in upstream spending driven by international and offshore markets.\nWe also remain focused on navigating short-term supply constraints, specifically in aerospace sector and broader macroeconomic and political uncertainty. Throughout horizon 1, we will be focused on transforming our business and simplifying the way we work. Additionally, we remain committed to further developing and commercializing our new energy portfolio, while also evolving our digital offerings. All of this will underpin our goals to deliver 20% EBITDA margins in OFSE by 2025 and in IET by 2026.\nDuring the second horizon, which extends out to 2027, the focus shifts towards investing for the next phase of growth, where our strategy is to solidify our presence in the new energy and industrial sectors while leveraging Gas Tech Services growth across our expanding installed equipment base. At the same time, we see upstream and natural gas spending continuing to grow at a lower rate.\nWe also expect an increasing customer focus on efficiency gains and emissions reductions, offering meaningful opportunities for our IET and OFSE digital businesses as we further deploy our Leucipa, Cordant and Flare reduction solutions during this horizon. To illustrate, the IEA estimates improving efficiencies by just 10% across oil and gas operations would save almost 0.5 gigaton of CO2 per year, which is equivalent to achieving 5% of the Paris Agreement goals. Also in horizon 2, we expect to exceed our ROIC targets of 15% and 20% in OFSE and IET, respectively, and drive further margin expansions across both business segments above our stated 20% EBITDA margin targets.\nLastly, horizon 3 looks to 2030 and beyond where our execution over the coming years will position Baker Hughes to compete across many new industrial and energy frontiers, including CCUS, hydrogen, clean power and geothermal. By this time, we expect decarbonization solutions to be a fundamental component and, in most cases, a prerequisite for energy projects, regardless of the end market. The need for smarter, more efficient energy solutions and emissions management will have firmly extended into the industrial sector. Considering this backdrop, we expect our new energy orders to reach $6 billion to $7 billion in 2030 and across a much broader customer base.\nBefore turning over to Nancy, I'd like to speak to the positive momentum that Baker Hughes has built during 2023 and where we have experienced strengthening tailwinds in both OFSE and IET. International and offshore markets are set to drive the strongest year of OFSE growth in more than 5 years, while continued robust LNG activity is set to push IET orders to yet another record year in 2023. And most importantly, our improved operational execution and cost structure and continued commitment to our customers are helping us to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy.\n\nNancy Buese\n\nExecutive VP and CFO, Newmont Mining Corporation\n\nLorenzo, I will begin on Slide 10 with an overview of our consolidated results and then briefly talk to segment details, before outlining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 outlook. We were very pleased with our third quarter results as both segments continue to execute well and benefit from market tailwinds. Adjusted EBITDA of $983 million came in at the high end of our guidance range, mostly due to better-than-expected IET performance, driven by strong backlog conversion in Gas Tech Equipment and continued improving execution in Industrial Tech.\nGAAP operating income was $714 million during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $716 million. GAAP earnings per share were $0.51. Excluding adjusting items, earnings per share were $0.42. Orders for both business segments maintained strong momentum, highlighted by another record quarter for IET and the third consecutive quarter of at least $1 billion of Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems orders, the first time this has happened since 2014. New Energy orders totaled almost $100 million this quarter, which brings year-to-date orders to just under $540 million and puts us on track to hit our $600 million to $700 million target range.\nDue to the sustained strength in orders, IET RPO is at record levels, and SSPS RPO is now at the highest level since 2015, which provides strong volume and earnings visibility over the coming years. Free cash flow was strong again this quarter, coming in at $592 million and resulting in free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA of 60%. We continue to target free cash flow conversion of 45% to 50% this year.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the third quarter with cash of $3.2 billion and a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1x.\nTurning to capital allocation on Slide 12. We continue to return excess free cash flow to shareholders. We recently increased our dividend by $0.01 to $0.20 per quarter. We remain committed to growing our dividend over time, with growth ultimately tied to the structural earnings power and growth of the company. Additionally, we repurchased $119 million of stock during the quarter, which brings total repurchases at the end of the third quarter to $219 million. Including our dividend and buybacks through the end of the third quarter, we have returned $805 million to shareholders. We remain committed to returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to investors.\nNow I will walk you through the business segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on our forward outlook. Starting with Oilfield Services & Equipment on Slide 13. The segment performed above expectations in the quarter, driven by better-than-expected revenue and margin in SSPS and a resilient Oilfield Services performance in North America. SSPS orders of $1 billion maintained strong momentum as offshore project awards continue at robust levels. Accordingly, SSPS book-to-bill of 1.3x was above 1 for the seventh consecutive quarter, and SSPS RPO now sits at $3.6 billion, which is up 52% versus the same quarter last year.\nOFSE revenue in the quarter was $4 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. Excluding SSPS, international revenue was up 1% sequentially as declines in Latin America offset increases in other regions. Excluding SSPS, North America revenue was up 4% sequentially, with strength in North America offshore partially offset by North America land revenues down 2% which outperformed the U.S. land rig count that fell 10%. OFSE EBITDA in the quarter was $670 million, up 5% sequentially and up 27% year-over-year, while also slightly above our guidance midpoint of $665 million. OFSE EBITDA margin rate was 17%, with margins increasing 60 basis points sequentially and 140 basis points year-over-year as SSPS margins outperformed expectations.\nNow turning to Industrial & Energy Technology on Slide 14. This segment also performed above expectations again during the quarter. The stronger performance was primarily due to higher volume in Gas Tech Equipment and Industrial Tech, slightly offset by lower-than-expected volume in Gas Tech Services due to delivery timing for upgrades and supply chain challenges for aeroderivative components. IET also had record orders this quarter driven by robust LNG awards. IET orders were $4.3 billion, up 32% sequentially and up 84% on a year-over-year basis and included almost $2.5 billion of LNG equipment orders.\nMajor awards during the quarter included liquefaction equipment for an FLNG project in the Eastern Hemisphere and a major award to provide additional liquefaction equipment in a power island to Venture Global. IET RPO ended the quarter at $28.8 billion, up 5% sequentially. Gas Tech Equipment RPO was $12.8 billion and Gas Tech Services RPO was $13.8 billion. Gas Tech Equipment book-to-bill was 2.2x, the ninth consecutive quarter above 1.\nTurning to Slide 15. IET revenue for the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 37% versus the prior year, led by Gas Tech Equipment growth that was up over 100% year-over-year, driven by execution on project backlog. IET EBITDA was $403 million, up 23% year-over-year and coming in above our guidance midpoint of $385 million. EBITDA margin was 15%, down 160 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher equipment mix and higher R&D spend related to our new energy investments. This increase R&D spending balances our broader margin improvement objectives with the demand to drive technology growth in our Climate Technology Solutions portfolio.\nIn September, we announced a realignment of our IET product lines across 5 key value vectors, simplifying our organizational structure to focus operations and decision-making and drive margin and returns improvement. Through this realignment, which was effective on October 1 and shown on Slide 16, we are also providing increased transparency for our CTS business, a key growth engine for Baker Hughes, as well as integrating our asset performance management capabilities under Industrial Solutions.\nBefore turning to our outlook, I'd like to quickly speak to a part of our growth story that we think is a key differentiator for Baker Hughes and as highlighted on Slide 17, is the visibility we have around structural IET growth into the latter part of this decade. We believe this growth will drive meaningful free cash flow expansion for the company, which we can attribute to 4 areas. The first is LNG equipment orders. Based on our expectation, we will book almost $9 billion of LNG equipment orders across 2022 and 2023. As a result, our Gas Tech Equipment RPO is at a record level, giving IET strong equipment backlog coverage over the next few years.\nThe second is Gas Tech Services. As Lorenzo mentioned, we see the global LNG installed base growing by 70% from today through the end of this decade. Also, the 172 MTPA of capacity additions during the 2016 to 2022 timeframe, will begin to earn increasing service revenue over the medium term. Given that Baker Hughes equipment is installed on the majority of these projects, we have significant earnings and returns visibility through 2030 and beyond from our Gas Tech Services franchise, as LNG accounts for almost 80% of our $13.8 billion RPO in Gas Tech Services.\nThe third growth area that we see is across industrial solutions and industrial products. We believe that these businesses can be so much more than the collection of technologies that they are today. For Industrial Solutions, the focus of this platform is to provide an integrated suite of solutions supporting industrial asset performance management and process optimization. There is a significant opportunity to advance solutions that can provide recurring revenue streams at accretive margin rates. The starting point for this is our Cordant platform, which we launched in January this year. In Industrial Products, we've been focusing on driving further simplification and unifying the industrial hardware capabilities that we have in our portfolio today, as we focus on industry verticals that allow for stronger growth opportunities and improve profitability into the future.\nThe fourth growth area is new energy. We remain excited about new energy opportunities where we will focus on differentiated technologies that add value for our customers in CCUS, hydrogen, clean power, geothermal and emissions management. Accordingly, we see a path to growing new energy orders from our $600 million to $700 million target this year towards $6 billion to $7 billion in 2030.\nNext, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the 2 business segments, which is detailed on Slide 18. Overall, we remain optimistic on the outlook for both OFSE and IET, given strong growth tailwinds across each business as well as continued operational enhancements to drive backlog execution and margin improvement. For Baker Hughes, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be between $6.7 billion and $7.1 billion and EBITDA between $1.05 billion and $1.11 billion, implying an EBITDA midpoint of $1.08 billion. For the full year, we are increasing and narrowing our guidance ranges as we flow through third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. Accordingly, we now expect 2023 Baker Hughes revenue to be between $25.4 billion and $25.8 billion and EBITDA between $3.7 billion and $3.8 billion.\nFor IET, we expect fourth quarter results to reflect sequential and year-over-year revenue growth for both Gas Tech and Industrial Tech. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter IET revenue between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion and EBITDA between $430 million and $490 million. The major factors driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion in Gas Tech equipment and the impact of any aeroderivative supply chain tightness in Gas Tech.\nOur full year outlook for IET remains constructive for orders, revenue and EBITDA. For orders, we've increased our 2023 expectations from $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion to a new range of $14 billion to $14.5 billion. Flowing through the third quarter upside and fourth quarter guide, we now expect full year IET revenue between $10.05 billion $10.35 billion and EBITDA between $1.5 billion and $1.55 billion. For OFSE, we expect fourth quarter results to reflect the typical year-end growth in international revenue and a decline in North America. We, therefore, expect fourth quarter OFSE revenue between $3.85 billion and $4.05 billion and EBITDA between $675 million and $735 million. Factors driving this range include the pacing of some international projects, level of year-end product sales, SSPS backlog conversion and the pace of our cost-out initiatives.\nAfter including the third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance, we now forecast full year OFSE revenue between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion and EBITDA between $2.55 billion and $2.65 billion. We will provide detailed 2024 guidance alongside our fourth quarter results in January. Looking out to next year, we remain optimistic for continued growth across both OFSE and IET as well as further operational enhancements to drive increasing margins and returns. We also remain focused on navigating aeroderivative supply chain challenges and broader macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty as we head into 2024.\nMore broadly, our transformation journey continues, and we're pleased with the progress we're making in identifying areas to drive efficiencies, structurally removing costs and modernizing how the business operates. We are continuing to see the cost outperformance come through our operating results, and we see further opportunities to enhance our operating performance through continued business transformation efforts.\nIn summary, we remain relentlessly focused on achieving the targets we've set for 20% EBITDA margins in OFSE in 2025 and IET in 2026, and we remain committed to delivering our ROIC targets of 15% for OFSE and 20% for IET. Importantly, we are continuing to take actions today to help us achieve and exceed these targets. Overall, we remain excited about the future of Baker Hughes.\nI'll turn the call back over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Nancy. As we enhance our position as a leading energy technology company, we remain encouraged about the continued growth that we see for our organization across our 3 time horizons. While there is a growing consensus that the energy transition will likely take longer than many expected, our unique portfolio is set to benefit irrespective of how quickly the energy transition develops.\nFor example, a faster energy transition drives quicker growth across our Climate Technology Solutions business, while a slower energy transition would extend the cycle of our traditional oil and gas businesses. Accordingly, we have set out a strategy to grow irrespective of the pace that the energy transition unfolds. Considering this balanced portfolio, Baker Hughes is becoming less cyclical in nature and therefore set to experience solid growth irrespective of the energy transition pace. Importantly, we are laying the foundation today for a more durable earnings and free cash flow growth profile, which will enable us in parallel to deliver best-in-class performance and structurally increasing shareholder returns.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Chase.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. Operator, let's open the call for questions.",

Welcome to the Baker Hughes Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI’d now like to introduce your host for today’s conference Mr. Jud Bailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Baker Hughes second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Nancy Buese. The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com.\nWe will also be using a presentation with our prepared remarks during this webcast, which can also be found on our website -- investor website. As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nAs you know, reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. With that I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We were pleased with our second quarter results and remain optimistic on the outlook for 2023. As you can see on Slide 4, we maintained our order momentum in IET and SSPS. We also delivered strong operating results at the higher end of our guidance in both business segments, booked almost $150 million of New Energy orders and generated approximately $620 million of free cash flow. Turning to Slide 5, growing economic uncertainty continues to drive commodity price volatility globally. \nHowever, despite lower oil prices over the first-half of the year, we maintain a constructive outlook for global upstream spending in 2023. Market softness in North America is expected to be more than offset by strength in international and offshore markets.\nAs we have said previously, we expect this spending cycle to be more durable and less sensitive to commodity price swings relative to prior cycles. This is due to strong balance sheets across the industry, disciplined capital spending that is based on low asset break evens and a focus on returns versus growth.\nWe are seeing this in North America where, despite the decline in WTI prices, IOCs and large independent E&P companies have yet to deviate from development plans. It is also evident in international and offshore markets, where we continue to see steady activity increases from NOCs and IOCs and production discipline from large producers.\nOutside of the upstream markets, we remain optimistic on the LNG outlook, with solid demand growth this year led by Europe and Asia. In fact, despite a 50% decline in LNG prices over the first-half of the year, contracted long-term offtake agreements of over 45 MTPA are slightly above contracting levels over the same period in 2022.\nThe continued strength in long-term LNG contracts has been a key driver of the momentum in industry FIDs, which have now totaled 53 MTPA so far this year. This includes the recent FIDs for Phase 1 of Next Decade’s 17.6 MTPA Rio Grande project and QatarEnergy’s 16 MTPA North Field South project. Based on the continued development of the LNG project pipeline, we still expect the market to exceed 65 MTPA of FIDs this year and should see a similar level of activity in 2024.\nWe continue to see the potential for this LNG cycle to extend for several years with a pipeline of new international opportunities, expanding project visibility out to 2026 and beyond. As we have stated consistently, we fully expect natural gas and LNG to play a key role in the energy transition as a baseload fuel to help balance against intermittent renewable energy sources. We believe the expanding pipeline of LNG opportunities is tied to the growing recognition of this reality and that the transition will take more time and must be financially viable. As we highlight on Slide 6, Baker Hughes’ unique portfolio enables us to weather a choppy macro environment. \nWe have a diverse mix of long and short cycle businesses with leading technologies that play across value chains within today’s energy and industrial complex, and are well positioned to play a leading role into the future.\nIn addition to the earnings and cash flow durability of our portfolio, we continue to drive actions to optimize our corporate structure and drive higher margins and returns. While reducing costs is one lever, we are also fundamentally re-wiring the organization to simplify reporting lines, eliminate duplication, and taking measured steps to upgrade our financial reporting systems. We believe this will lead to more standardization, increased automation, and provide greater real-time information and analytical capabilities around our business performance.\nWe have now completed the actions required to achieve the first $150 million of our cost-out target by the end of 2023 and believe there are additional opportunities for further cost reductions in 2024 and beyond. As we continue to redesign our organization and install new processes and systems, our goal is to drive continued cost productivity, with the ultimate objective of exceeding 20% EBITDA levels for each business segment over the next few years.\nAs we work to optimize our organizational structure, we are also focused on capitalizing on favorable market trends across both business segments in the near-term, as well as the long-term. In the near-term, both IET and OFSE are well positioned to capitalize on multiple growth vectors, most notably the multi-year upstream growth cycle in international and offshore, the wave of LNG sanctions expected through this decade, and the New Energy opportunities that utilize our existing core technologies. Longer-term, we believe that our unique portfolio positions us well to capitalize on the Energy Transition, which is driving fundamental changes to the energy landscape, our customer base, and how they operate.\nGiven our position as a strategic supplier for both subsurface and surface solutions, our portfolio is increasingly aligned to our customers’ capital allocation decisions, and provides a unique vantage point as we work with them on planning and developing the next generation of energy projects.\nTurning to Slide 7, Baker Hughes’ portfolio and our customer relationships have never been stronger. Since 2017, we have significantly enhanced our size and scale in key regions like the Middle East, as well as our relationships with key customers. By selling a range of solutions that includes LNG, power generation, and compression solutions for onshore and offshore production applications, and integrated solutions for well construction and production, we are able to offer capabilities that uniquely position us for today and the future.\nToday, our wide range of core competencies are being utilized in select areas like deepwater projects, where we provide power generation and compression for FPSOs, in addition to subsea equipment and flexible risers.\nWe are also seeing growth opportunities through further investment in natural gas value chains, increasing investment in New Energy and higher demand for integrated solutions. Some of these unique and emerging solutions play to our strengths as they combine subsurface capabilities with highly engineered surface technologies that also layer in digital offerings across the scope of work.\nAs we look to the future, it is clear that almost all energy companies are transitioning, and while the pace of change may differ, the direction of travel is clear. We believe that as the need to decarbonize becomes more widespread, the demand for integrated solutions across these areas will grow. In fact, we are in the early stages of collaborating with key customers on a range of future opportunities that leverage our unique set of technologies for New Energy applications.\nFor example, in CCUS we can evaluate and drill reservoirs for CO2 storage and provide CO2 compression expertise. Other solutions include geothermal power, where we drill geothermal wells and provide steam turbines, and blue ammonia projects, where we provide ammonia and CO2 compression solutions, as well as the drilling and monitoring of CO2 storage wells.\nOverall, I am extremely excited about the multitude of new opportunities developing for solutions that leverage our unique portfolio. We believe, combining these growth opportunities with our business transformation objectives provides attractive upside for our margins and returns going forward.\nTurning to Slide 8, I will provide an update on each of our business segments. In Oilfield Services & Equipment, we continue to be encouraged by the multi-year cycle unfolding in international markets, particularly in offshore basins. With approximately 70% of our OFSE business internationally focused, and around 40% exposed to offshore, we remain well positioned to benefit from these market dynamics.\nOn a regional basis, we are experiencing strong growth in most areas, with particular strength in Latin America and the Middle East. We see no change to the pace of activity across international markets and continue to see promising signs in markets such as West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. One area that continues to lag is the North Sea, where U.K. fiscal uncertainty is hampering developments.\nIn North America, the market continues to trend softer on lower oil and gas prices. However, the impact of price volatility in the first-half of the year has largely been limited to the activity of private operators and in gas basins.\nOur OFSE business in North America is production-levered and the majority of our customer base is made up of major oil companies and public E&Ps, which have yet to deviate from plans laid out at the start of the year. This portfolio and customer mix results in a business that is generally less volatile than fluctuations in North America activity and rig count. This resiliency was evident during the second quarter, where our OFSE North America revenue was modestly higher despite a 15% sequential decline in the North America rig count.\nWithin our OFSE product lines, we continue to experience strong growth across the portfolio, which was led in the second quarter by Completions, Intervention & Measurements. We also continue to develop new technologies for the CIM portfolio with innovations like SONUS, the industry’s only acoustic set liner hanger system, which can cut the time taken to set a liner hanger from hours to minutes.\nIn Production Solutions, we continue to see solid growth in artificial lift globally. During the quarter, we had early commercial success with our recently acquired AccessESP technology, winning two awards with key customers in the Middle East. \nThe AccessESP system offers an efficient alternative to conventional ESP installations without the need for a heavy workover rig, which reduces time, costs and emissions while boosting well performance. In Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems, we continue to experience positive order momentum.\nWe booked a major award during the second quarter with Eni for the Baleine field offshore Ivory Coast, providing eight subsea trees and three Aptara manifolds. Operationally, we are encouraged by the early success of repositioning the Subsea Projects & Services business to focus on selected key markets with a leaner cost base.\nWhile top line trends for OFSE remain strong and should maintain strong momentum into 2024, we remain equally committed to translating higher revenue growth into higher margins and returns. For 2023, this will translate into double-digit revenue growth and an expansion of EBITDA margins by 150 basis points to 200 basis points.\nIn IET, we saw another excellent quarter commercially, with $3.3 billion in orders, maintaining the strong momentum from the first quarter. Gas Tech Equipment achieved $1.6 billion in orders, driven by multiple areas, including almost $900 million of LNG awards in the quarter.\nIn Onshore/Offshore Production, we were pleased to be awarded a major order from MODEC to supply gas technology equipment for Equinor’s BM-C-33 project in the Brazilian pre-salt Campos area. Baker Hughes will be providing turbomachinery equipment for the FPSO, including LM2500 gas turbine and steam turbine generators, for a combined cycle power generation solution to reduce the project’s carbon footprint. Combined cycle solutions are an important trend in the offshore oil and gas industry, as they enable the reduction of overall FPSO carbon emissions.\nBaker Hughes expects to reduce carbon emissions by more than 20% for this project versus similar open cycle FPSOs with the same power demand. On the New Energy front, we booked over $100 million of orders in the quarter in IET, including multiple orders for Air Products to support its Louisiana Clean Energy Complex.\nThese awards included vertical centrifugal pumps for ammonia loading, compression trains for CO2 storage, and a subsurface study undertaken by OFSE to assess the capacity of the reservoir. In addition to the Louisiana project, we also received an award for hydrogen compression equipment for Air Products’ New York Green Hydrogen facility. IET also saw increased traction in the growing blue ammonia space. During the quarter, IET secured multiple orders in the Middle East, including awards to supply syngas and ammonia compressor trains and centrifugal pump trains.\nOrders in our Industrial Technology businesses maintained strong momentum in the second quarter with 8% growth year-over-year led by Pumps, Valves & Gears, and Inspection. In our Condition Monitoring business, we secured an agreement to deliver asset protection and monitoring hardware, software, and services for a floating LNG project offshore Malaysia.\nThe scope includes Bently Nevada’s Orbit 60 condition monitoring system, Ranger Pro wireless monitoring systems, System 1 software, and cyber security enhancements, as well as end-to-end project management support and services.\nOn the operational side, Industrial Tech also continues to benefit from volume and margin improvements in Condition Monitoring and Inspection, as chip shortages and supply chain issues gradually abate. Although there is still work to do, profitability in Industrial Tech is experiencing a solid recovery that we expect to continue over the course of 2023.\nIET is also making solid progress on its strategic initiatives around digital and growing outside its traditional customer base into new markets. We received our first major award for Cordant from a large ammonia producer in the Middle East in the first quarter, delivering an integrated suite of solutions for asset performance management, process optimization and digitally enabled services through IET’s iCenter.\nBuilding on this award, during the second quarter, we signed a long-term Multi-Maintenance Program contract where we will be providing maintenance planning, project management, and resident engineering on site for the customer’s current fleet of steam turbines and centrifugal compressors. This contract demonstrates the full range of capabilities and complementary services of our IET Digital and Gas Tech Services portfolio, providing a blueprint for expanding our digital platform with new and existing customers.\nOverall, we are pleased with the continued momentum in IET this year. With a record RPO that now exceeds $27 billion, we expect to generate strong revenue growth over the next few years that will be accompanied by strong margin improvement and higher returns.\nI would also like to spend some time on Slide 8 to highlight Baker Hughes’ 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report, which was published during the second quarter, and shows that the company is on-track to meet its Scope 1 and 2 net-zero emissions goal by 2050. The report also outlined Baker Hughes’ progress toward driving more sustainable operations through improved performance in its ESG metrics.\nBaker Hughes continues to strive for a diverse and inclusive workplace, as people are at the heart of any company’s progress. Fresh perspectives, unique experiences and innovative ideas are critical to driving competitiveness going forward. To this end, Baker Hughes has enhanced its reporting with over 20 new metrics to help drive more transparency and was recognized for attracting, retaining, and developing talent.\nAs one of the first companies in the industry to announce a net-zero emissions goal, we continued to push forward with reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which have declined by 28%, compared to our 2019 baseline year. We are also now reporting on 10 categories of Scope 3 emissions. Against the backdrop of a challenging and complex global energy environment, I am proud that while we continue supporting our customers on their energy transition journeys, we have not lost sight of our goal to operate in a responsible and more sustainable way. Overall, I remain very excited on the outlook for Baker Hughes and confident we will execute on all our growth opportunities across our business, as well as the structural changes we are implementing across our organization.\n\nMultiple speakers\n\n[Lorenzo Simonelli] With that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy.  [Nancy Buese] Thanks, Lorenzo. I will begin on Slide 11 with an overview of total company results and then move into the segment details and our forward outlook. We were very pleased with our second quarter results, which exceeded the high-end of our adjusted EBITDA guidance range, included another quarter of strong orders in both business segments, and exceeded our expectations on free cash flow.\n\nNancy K. Buese\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Newmont Goldcorp Corp.\n\nWe are excited with the operational momentum we have at Baker Hughes and the growth opportunities ahead, as well as the progress we are making in removing costs and transforming how the business operates.  As we execute on these growth opportunities, we are laser focused on improving our margins and return profile as the company grows. Orders for both business segments maintain strong momentum with total company orders of $7.5 billion in the second quarter, up 28% year-over-year and driven by an increase in both IET and OFSE. Remaining Performance Obligation was $31 billion, up 5% sequentially.\nRPO for the company is at record levels and provides strong volume and earnings visibility over the coming years. OFSE RPO ended at $3.5 billion, while IET RPO ended at $27.5 billion. Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.2. IET book-to-bill was 1.3, which marks eight consecutive quarters of IET book-to-bill above 1.\nRevenue for the quarter was $6.3 billion, up 25% year-over-year, driven by increases in both segments. Operating income for the quarter was $514 million. Adjusted operating income was $631 million, which excludes $117 million of restructuring and other charges. Adjusted operating income was up 23% sequentially and up 68% year-over-year. \nOur adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 10%, up 100 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 250 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $907 million, up 16% sequentially and up 39% year-over-year.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin rate of 14.4% increased by 70 basis points sequentially and 150 basis points year-over-year, due to increased volume leverage, pricing and our cost optimization and simplification efforts. Corporate costs were $97 million in the quarter, down $3 million sequentially and $11 million year-over-year, driven by the realization of savings related to our corporate optimization process.\nFor the third quarter, we expect corporate costs to be roughly flat, compared to second quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $276 million in the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect D&A to be roughly in line with second quarter levels. Net interest expense was $58 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $200 million.\nGAAP earnings per share was $0.40. Included in GAAP earnings per share were $156 million of other income, primarily related to net gains from the change in fair value for certain equity investments, all of which are recorded in other non-operating income. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.39. Turning to Slide 12, we generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of $623 million, up $426 million sequentially, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and strong collections in IET. \nYear-over-year, our free cash flow is up $476 million. First-half free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA was 49% and we are very pleased with the team’s performance so far this year, as the process changes we are implementing continue to drive better working capital performance. On the back of strong first-half performance, we now expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA for the full-year to be in the range of 45% to 50%.\nDriving the improvement in our free cash flow expectations is stronger working capital performance and higher IET orders. We continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet with total debt of $6.6 billion and net debt of $3.8 billion, which is 1.1 times our trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA. We have around $650 million of senior notes maturing in December 2023 and we will most likely refinance this debt based on market conditions. Turning to Slide 13 and capital allocation. We maintained our quarterly dividend at $0.19 per share and also repurchased 3.6 million Class A shares for $99 million at an average price of $27.66 per share.\nrepurchased 3.6 million Class A shares for $99 million at an average price of $27.66 per share. Our capital allocation philosophy prioritizes a strong balance sheet, adequately reinvesting in our business from both a CapEx and R&D perspective, and targeting free cash conversion from adjusted EBITDA in excess of 50% on a through-cycle basis.\nFrom there, we expect to return 60% to 80% of our free cash flow back to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to Slide 14, as Lorenzo mentioned, we have executed all actions necessary to achieve our $150 million cost-out target by the end of 2023 and believe there are additional opportunities for further cost reduction in 2024 and beyond. We view this initial round of cost actions as the first step in a much larger operational and margin optimization process, which we expect to unfold over the next couple of years. For this next step, we have identified several areas to improve operating efficiency and cost structure through a more simplified organizational design, improving our processes and systems. As we execute on the next phase of this journey, our ultimate objective is to drive EBITDA margins for each business segment above 20%. Now I will walk you through the business segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward.\nStarting with Oilfield Services and Equipment on Slide 15, the segment performed above expectations in the quarter, driven by stronger revenue and margins in SSPS and stronger growth across International OFS markets. SSPS orders also maintain strong momentum as offshore project sanctioning continues at robust levels. Partially offsetting these areas of strength was lower-than-expected profitability out of our chemicals business. \nWhile chemicals did see sequential margin improvement during the quarter, we still have more work to do in order to get margins in line with historical levels, but are confident that we can get there by the end of the year. OFSE orders in the quarter were $4.2 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 24% year-over-year.\nSubsea & Surface Pressure System orders were $1.1 billion, up 48% year-over-year driven by a number of awards, including a major subsea tree order from Eni offshore Ivory Coast, and a number of Flexibles orders.\nFor the first-half of 2023, SSPS orders are up 54% year-over-year. OFSE revenue in the quarter was $3.9 billion, up 8% sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. International revenue was up 10% sequentially driven by growth in all regions, with notable strength in Europe, CIS, SSA and Middle East, Asia. With notable strength in Europe CIS, SA and Middle East Asia.\nNorth America revenue increased 5% sequentially, driven primarily by growth in SSPS. Excluding SSPS, international revenue was up 12% sequentially and North American revenue was down 1%, solidly outperforming rig count in both regions.\nOFSE Operating Income in the quarter was $417 million, up 12% sequentially and up 68% year-over-year. Operating income rate was 10.8%, with margin rates up 40 basis points sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, operating income rate has increased 310 basis points. OFSE EBITDA in the quarter was $636 million, up 10% sequentially and up 35% year-over-year. EBITDA margin rate was 16.4%, with margins increasing 20 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-over-year.\nSequential margin rates were impacted by a higher mix of SSPS equipment revenue, while the year-over-year improvement in margin rates was driven by higher volume, price improvements and our cost-out efforts in SSPS.\nIf we move to Slide 16, IET performed above expectations in the quarter despite lower-than-expected backlog conversion from Gas Technology Equipment. The stronger segment performance was primarily due to higher margin rates, which was driven by strength in Industrial Technology revenues and margins, as well as stronger growth in Gas Technology Services. IET also had another very strong quarter for orders driven by LNG and Onshore/Offshore awards. IET orders were $3.3 billion, down 7% sequentially and up 33% on a year-over-year basis.\nGas Technology Equipment orders of $1.6 billion in the quarter were up 87% year-over-year. Major awards during the quarter included equipment for the Rio Grande LNG project, as well as FPSO equipment for the BM-C-33 project in Brazil. Gas Technology Services orders of $790 million in the quarter were flat year-over-year. Industrial Technology orders of $880 million were up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in most product lines, as well as the acquisition of Quest Integrity, which was partially offset by the disposition of Nexus Controls. RPO for IET ended at $27.5 billion, up 4% sequentially. Within IET RPO, Gas Tech Equipment RPO was $11.4 billion and Gas Tech Services RPO was $13.9 billion.\nTurning to Slide 17, revenue for the quarter was $2.4 billion, up 34% versus the prior year. Gas Tech Equipment revenue was up 80% year-over-year, driven by execution of project backlog. Gas Tech Services revenue was up 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in both upgrades and transactional services, and accounting for impacts related to our exit from Russia during the second quarter of 2022. Excluding these impacts, Gas Tech Services revenue was up 7% year-over-year.\nIndustrial Tech revenue was up 9% year-over-year driven by growth in all product lines, as well as the acquisition of Quest, partially offset by the Nexus Controls disposition. We are pleased to see the supply chain and chip constraints that have negatively impacted this business begin to abate, helping to drive revenues and profitability higher.\nOperating income for IET was $311 million, up 32% year-over-year. Operating margin rate was 12.8%, down 20 basis points year-over-year. IET EBITDA was $363 million, up 28% year-over-year, driven by increased volume.  EBITDA margin was 14.9%, down 80 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher equipment mix and approximately $15 million of higher R&D spend year-over-year related to New Energy investments.\nAs communicated previously, as part of our broader New Energy strategy, we are increasing our R&D spend to enhance existing core technologies and developing some of the early-stage technologies we have in CCUS, hydrogen and clean power. So far this year in IET, we have spent around $40 million of incremental R&D for New Energy investments and we expect R&D expense to be modestly higher in the second-half of the year. Turning to Slide 18, I would like to update you on our outlook for the two business segments. Overall, we feel optimistic on the outlook for both OFSE and IET with solid growth tailwinds across each business, as well as continued operational enhancements to help drive backlog execution and margin improvement.\nFor Baker Hughes we expect third quarter revenue to be between $6.4 billion and $6.6 billion and EBITDA between $930 million and $990 million. For the full-year, our outlook remains unchanged, and we are raising the low-end of our guidance range following our strong performance in the first-half, and better visibility for the back half of the year. We now expect revenue to be between $24.8 billion and $26 billion and EBITDA between $3.65 billion and $3.8 billion.\nFor OFSE, we expect third quarter results to reflect growth in international markets and a decline in North American activity, but still expect sequential improvement on both revenue and EBITDA. We therefore expect third quarter revenue for OFSE between $3.8 billion and $4 billion and EBITDA between $635 million and $695 million.\nFactors driving this range include the pacing of some international projects, activity in the U.S. land market, backlog conversion in SSPS and the pace of our cost-out initiatives. For the full-year 2023, our outlook for OFSE remains unchanged with international and offshore growth helping to offset second-half softness in North America.\nWe now forecast OFSE revenue between $15.1 billion and $15.7 billion and EBITDA between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion. Factors driving this range include the pace of growth in various international markets, activity in North America, continued improvement in Chemicals, the pace of backlog conversion and restructuring initiatives in the SSPS segment, and our broader cost-out initiatives.\nFor IET, we expect third quarter results to reflect strong year-over-year revenue growth as we execute our backlog for Gas Technology Equipment, as well as continued solid revenue growth for Industrial Technology. We therefore expect third quarter IET revenue between $2.45 billion and $2.75 billion and EBITDA between $355 million and $415 million.\nThe major factors driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion in Gas Tech Equipment, the level of R&D spend related to our New Energy investments, and the impact of any supply chain delays in Gas Tech Equipment and Services.\nOur full-year outlook for IET remains constructive for orders, revenue, and EBITDA. For orders, we have increased our 2023 expectations by $1 billion to a range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. We feel confident in meeting the upper end of the revised range and see the opportunity to exceed the high-end depending on the timing of certain large projects.\nWe expect full-year revenue for IET between $9.65 billion and $10.35 billion and EBITDA between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. The largest factors driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion and any impacts associated with supply chain delays. Other factors include foreign currency movements and the level of R&D spend related to our New Energy investments. Lastly, we are lowering our expected tax rate range by 250 basis points.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Lorenzo, I wanted to make everyone aware that Jud Bailey will be moving on from the Investor Relations role at the end of this month to become our new VP of Business Development. Replacing Jud is Chase Mulvehill, who is joining Baker Hughes from Bank of America, and started here with us earlier this month. I would like to congratulate Jud on his new role and welcome Chase to Baker Hughes. With that, I will turn the call back over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Nancy. I would also like to welcome Chase to Baker Hughes and wish Jud well in his new role.\nTurning to Slide 19, Baker Hughes remains committed to delivering for our customers and our shareholders. We see exciting growth opportunities across our portfolio, as well as opportunities to drive higher margins and returns through the simplification and optimization of our organizational structure. Through these initiatives, our goal is to exceed the 20% EBITDA margin targets in OFSE and IET, as well as the ROIC targets in both businesses of 15% and 20% respectively.\nAnd finally, we continue to focus on generating strong free cash flow and returning 60% to 80% of this free cash flow to shareholders, while also investing for growth across our world class business. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. Will this conference call be recorded?\n\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mrs. Jod Bailey, Vice President of Investilations. So we may begin.\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Baker Hughes first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO Lorenzo Seminelli and our CFO Nancy Beasy. The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at BakerHughes.com.\n\nWe will also be using the presentation with our prepared remarks during this webcast, which can also be found on our investor website. As a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guaranteed at future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.\n\noptimistic on the outlook for 2023. As you can see on slide 4, we maintained our strong autumn momentum in IET and SPS. We also delivered solid operating results at the high end of our guidance in both business segments.\n\nbooked almost $300 million of new energy orders, and generated approximately $200 million of free cash flow.\n\nTurning to slide five, while 2023 has already started off with some macro volatility, we remain optimistic on the outlook for energy services and Baker Hughes.\n\nOur diverse portfolio features long-cycle and short-cycle businesses that position us well to navigate any periods of variability that may occur across the energy sector.\n\nDespite the elevated recession risk for major developed economies, we expect the supply demand balance in the global oil markets to gradually tighten over the course of the year. Factors driving this include China's economy recovering, non-OECD demand continuing to grow.\n\nan OPEC Plus remaining proactive in maintaining adequate and stable oil price levels.\n\nWe expect this macro backdrop to still support a double-digit increase in global upstream spending in 2023, with multiple international projects being executed and the offshore development pipeline growing.\n\nWe continue to believe that the current environment remains unique with a spending cycle that is more durable and less sensitive to commodity price swings relative to price cycles.\n\nFactors driving this extended cycle include financially stronger operator balance sheets, disciplined capital spending focused on returns versus growth, and IOCs and NOCs that are balancing modest production growth with longer term investments in new energy.\n\nAnother notable characteristic of this cycle is the continued shift towards the development of natural gas and LNG.\n\nAs the world increasingly recognizes the crucial role natural gas will play in the energy transition, serving as both a transition and destination fuel, the case for a multi-decade growth opportunity in gas is steadily improving.\n\nThis is driving operators of all sizes to dedicate more spending towards natural gas development as well as LNG projects and associated infrastructure.\n\nWe are seeing the early stages of this shift through a step up in the exploration and development of gas reserves in regions like Africa, the Middle East, and the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nWe are also seeing the introduction of new technologies and entrance into the LNG sector more broadly, as well as an evolution in contracting structures for LNG off-take volumes.\n\nFor these reasons, LNG project sanctioning activity has governed off to a strong start in 2023, with 20 MTPA already reaching FID and other projects likely to soon follow.\n\nContrary to conventional wisdom, we believe that recent declines in global LNG prices from the unsustainably high levels reached last year is a net positive for the sector by supporting the mon growth in key developing markets and bringing closer alignment on LNG pricing expectations between buyers and sellers.\n\nBased on conversations with existing and new customers, we see the potential for this LNG cycle to extend for several years with a pipeline of new international opportunities expanding project visibility out to 2026 and beyond. We remain confident that we will see 65 to 100 and 60.\n\nby this favorable macro backdrop. A primary focus for Baker Hughes in 2023 is transforming the company operationally and positioning it for the future of the energy markets.\n\nThis includes executing on our previously stated cost-out initiatives, which Nancy will talk about in more detail, and reshaping the company into two strategically managed business segments with a Lena corporate function.\n\nWe have done a lot of work evaluating our entire organization these last few months. And the changes we are driving will enable faster decision making and allow us to operate as a leaner, more simplified organization.\n\nIt will take time to reach our ultimate goals, but I strongly believe that the work we are undertaking this year will lay the foundation for consistently better operating results and higher returns in the future.\n\nI will provide an update on each of our business segments.\n\nIn our field services and equipment, despite recent volatility in oil and gas prices, we remained positive on the outlook for a multi-year cycle.\n\nwith growth trends clearly shifting in favor of international and offshore markets.\n\nWe've approximately 70% of our OFSE business internationally focused. We are well positioned to capitalize on these unfolding market dynamics.\n\nGeographically, multiple regions are poised for strong growth this year, led by the Middle East and Latin America, where the pipeline for both shallow water and deep water growth opportunities are becoming more visible.\n\nIn other markets like West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, offshore activity is also improving with multi-year drilling programs starting to come into focus.\n\nIn North America, activity has been seasonally weaker to start the year as expected, with a high likelihood of further softness as activity and gas basins responds to recent natural gas price weakness.\n\nHowever, with roughly 55% of our North American business comprised of artificial lift and production chemicals and a customer mix weighted towards the majors and large independence, we expect our portfolio to perform relatively well in the current environment.\n\nWithin our OFSE product lines, we continue to see the strongest growth and performance in our well-construction product line, which is supported by the leading technologies in our drilling portfolio.\n\nOur completions, intervention and measurement product line also continues to perform well, and will be further improved by the recently closed acquisition of Alters Intervention.\n\nAltus will complement our existing intervention solutions business and add new technology that can be scaled into new geographic markets.\n\nIn production solutions, we continue to see incremental improvements in our chemicals business as supply chain constraints ease and profitability continues to normalize.\n\nOur Singapore facility will soon be fully operational and will remain on track for margins in the chemicals business to return to historical levels by the end of this year.\n\nAnother positive development for our production solution business is the recent announcement of Lucipa, which is a platform agnostic digital solution.\n\nThis software enables the automation of field production, connecting artificial lift, fluids and chemicals, and removing unnecessary costs and manual processes, which will ultimately drive enhanced production.\n\nWe also recently announced a collaboration with CORE, a third-party digital solution that improves well-construction efficiency.\n\nfor enhancing OFSC's digital capabilities. In our subsea and surface pressure systems product line, the demand outlook continues to strengthen. During the first quarter, we booked a major award to provide equipment and services for the Agogo Field offshore Angola.\n\nWe will be providing 23 subsea trees and 11 apteromanifolds, representing our largest subsea tree order in almost five years.\n\nAs we reposition the subsidy projects and services business to focus predominantly on a few key markets, we see a robust pipeline of opportunities building and anticipate further autumn momentum for this year and beyond. For our flexible business within SSPS, we expect orders to remain strong in 2023 after a record year in 2022.\n\nGiven robust demand, conversion cycles are lengthening in the business, with limited excess capacity until 2025.\n\nOn the operational front, the integration of SSPS into our OST segment and restructuring of the business continues to progress well.\n\nIn line with the capacity rationalization for SPS that we disclosed last quarter, we are in the process of decommissioning and right-sizing multiple manufacturing sites. Our focus is now shifting to the surface pressure control business, where we see similar opportunities to right-size capacity, integrate supply chain and engineering, and localize and key growth markets.\n\nand for EBITDA margins to expand by 150 to 200 basis points as activity increases in multiple regions and self-help initiatives in key areas are executed.\n\nMoving to IET, we saw another excellent quarter commercially, continuing on the strong momentum from the end of 2022.\n\nGAS Tech equipment booked a number of LNG awards in the quarter, totaling almost $1.4 billion with continued progress across our world-class franchise.\n\nThe recent decline in energy prices have had virtually no impact on our discussions in terms of timing or the pipeline of opportunities.\n\nWith project cycle times that can last eight to ten years from the initial planning phase to final commissioning, operators take a long-term view for LNG project development and look through near-term commodity price fluctuations.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we were pleased to be awarded a major order to supply two main refrigerant compressors for the North Field South project, which will be executed by Qatar Gas. For more information, visit www.cctexas.gov\n\nThe MRCs are part of two LNG megatrains representing 16 MTPA of additional capacity that is estimated to further boost Qatar's LNG's production capacity to 126 MTPA by 2027.\n\nAlso during the quarter, Baker Hughes was awarded and awarded by Bechtel to supply two MRCs for Sempra Port Arthur's LNG Phase 1 project in Jefferson County, Texas.\n\nBaker Hughes will supply gas turbines and centrifugal compressors across two LNG trains for a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 mCPA as well as two electric motor-driven compressors for the plant's boosting services.\n\nBK Hughes was also awarded an order by Black & Deach to deliver two LM9000 driven compressor trains for the Patronos ZLNG facility in Sabah, Malaysia.\n\nPetronas specifically selected the LM9000 gas-term and technology for the two MTPA FL&G facility to reduce complexity, maximize efficiency, and minimize footprint while lowering CO2 emissions compared to other technologies in its class.\n\nOn the new energy front, we booked almost $250 million of orders in the quarter in IED, including contracts to supply CO2 compression solutions for multiple FPSO projects in Brazil.\n\nThe six gas-tab and driven compression strains will each re-inject more than one MPPA of CO2 into oil reservoirs, enhancing production rates and reducing emissions.\n\nWe were also pleased to book an order for centrifugal pumps and hydraulic powered recovery turbines for Air Products Blue Hydrogen Project in Edmonton to enable CO2 capture during the autothermal reforming process.\n\nThis award is another example of how baking shoes and air products continue to collaborate to drive the hydrogen economy forward.\n\nDuring the quarter, we also announced an agreement with HIF Global, the world's leading e-fuels company, to cooperate on the development of technology for direct air capture. HIF Global intends to test Baker Hughes' Mosaic technology to capture carbon dioxide through direct air capture and combine it with the green hydrogen to produce e-fuels.\n\nAutos in the industrial technology businesses remain tame strong momentum to start 2023 with double digit growth year over year across all product lines.\n\nled by some of the hydrogen related awards in pumps, valves, and gears.\n\nIn our condition monitoring business, we saw notable awards in the Middle East and in Europe , which featured the full suite of our capabilities in monitoring, sensing, and effort help across multiple sectors.\n\nOn the operational side, Industrial Tech also continues to benefit from volume and margin improvements in condition monitoring and inspection, as chip shortages and supply chain issues gradually abate. The whole EMU has been on the better side.\n\nAlthough supply chain functionality and operational performance is still not back to where we would like, we are seeing steady progress that we expect to continue over the course of the year. In IET Digital, Cordant, our recently launched integrated suite of solutions, is seeing some initial success. Here's your\n\nWe are pleased to be collaborating with BP on further defining and developing Cordon for asset performance management and process optimization.\n\nBP will deploy 1 p.m. in select locations across its Gulf of Mexico production assets, where Baker Hughes currently has a large installed base of rotating equipment, controls, and associated digital services.\n\nThe companies will look for opportunities to expand this collaboration across other regions in the future.\n\nOverall, we are pleased to see strong momentum for IIT continue into 2023, with a record backlog of $26.5 billion and a robust pipeline of new order opportunities in LNG, onshore offshore production and new energy.\n\nBased on our strong first quarter and the growing pipeline of project opportunities, we are increasingly confident that IET orders for 2023 are likely to meet or potentially exceed the high end of our guidance range of $10.5 to $11.5 billion.\n\nBefore I turn the call over to Nancy, I'd like to spend some time on the commitments Becky Hughes is making in the areas of sustainability and ESG.\n\nAs many of you know, we were one of the first companies in the energy sector to commit to a 50% reduction in scope one and scope two emissions by 2030 and to be at net zero by 2015.\n\nTo help achieve these goals, we are empowering Baker Hughes employees to remove carbon from our products and operations as we better integrate our carbon out program. We are also intently focused on developing our own scope-free emissions reduction roadmap and expect to have more news to share on this area later this year.\n\nOverall, I feel confident in the structural changes we are executing at Baker Hughes and our positioning to capitalize on the multiyear upstream spending cycle, the ongoing wave of LNG investments, and the acceleration in new energy opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy.\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I will begin on slide 8 with an overview of total company results and then move into the segment details in our forward outlook.\n\nTotal company orders for the quarter were $7.6 billion. Year over year orders were up 12% driven by an increase in OFSE, partially offset by a slight decline in IET. Sequentially orders were down 5% driven by industrial and energy technology, partially offset by an increase in oil-filled services and equipment.\n\nWe are again extremely pleased with the Order's performance in the quarter as we maintain strong momentum across both segments.\n\nRemaining performance obligation was $29.6 billion, up 7% sequentially.\n\nOFSC RPO ended at $3.1 billion, up 20% sequentially, while IET RPO ended at $26.5 billion, up 5% sequentially.\n\nOur total company book to bill ratio in the quarter was 1.3.\n\nIET book to bill was 1.7. Revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, down 3% sequentially and up 18% year over year, driven by increases in both segments.\n\nOperating income for the quarter was $438 million. Adjusted operating income was $512 million, which excludes $74 million of restructuring and other charges.\n\nAdjusted operating income was down 26% sequentially and up 47% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $782 million, down 17% sequentially, and up 25% year over year.\n\nOur adjusted EBITDA rate for the quarter was 13.7%, down 240 basis points sequentially, and up 80 basis points year over year.\n\nCorporate costs were $100 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect corporate costs to be roughly flat compared to first quarter levels.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $269 million in the quarter, driven by the closing of multiple acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the second quarter, we expect DNA to be around $280 million with the increase driven by the acquisition of Altus intervention. That interest expense was $64 million.\n\nincome tax expense in the quarter was $179 million.\n\nGap earnings per share was 57 cents.\n\nIncluded in gap earnings per share were $392 million in gains from the change in fair value for certain equity investments, all of which are recorded in other non-operating income.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share were 28 cents. Turning to slide nine, we maintain a strong balance sheet with total debt of $6.7 billion and net debt of $4.2 billion, which is 1.4 times our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We generated free cash flow in the quarter of $197 million.\n\nflow conversion from adjusted EBITDA to be in the low to mid 40% range for the year and anticipate the majority of our free cash flow to be generated over the second half of the year.\n\nTurning to slide 10 and capital allocation.\n\nWe maintained our quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share, and we did not repurchase any stock during the first quarter.\n\nDespite slowing down our buyback pace from last year, as we closed and began integrating multiple small acquisitions, we remain committed to returning 60 to 80 percent of our free cash flow back to shareholders, with a priority of increasing our regular dividend over time.\n\nTurning to slide 11, as Lorenzo mentioned, we continue to make progress with our $150 million cost-out target and expect all actions necessary to achieve these savings to be completed by the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe majority of these savings will come from direct structural cost reductions as we consolidate the former four product companies into two business segments. These actions drive a smaller executive leadership function, the removal of duplicative spending, and an overall leaner corporate structure.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we benefited from approximately $15 million of cost out related to the consolidation into two business segments. The balance of the identified savings will come from additional headcount reductions and more efficient cost measures related to the streamlining of multiple support and corporate functions across the organization.\n\nwe have identified additional areas to remove excess layers, decentralized key functions, and standardized key operating processes that will result in significant additional cost savings.\n\nAlthough we have not yet quantified the additional cost-out savings, we plan to have all the work completed on any additional restructuring by the end of the second quarter and to realize the full cost-out benefit by the end of the year.\n\nNow I will walk you through the business segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. Starting with oil filled services and equipment on slide 12, orders in the quarter were $4.1 billion, up 10% sequentially and up 25% year over year.\n\nFSPS orders were $1.2 billion. Up 60% year-over-year driven by an increase in sub-C3 awards across multiple regions. Most notably, we received a large sub-C equipment order from E&I for a Google Phase III and an SPC order in the Middle East.\n\nOFSE revenue in the quarter was $3.6 billion, flat sequentially, and up 19% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the seasonal decline in the traditional oilfield services businesses.\n\nwas offset by an increase in SSPS revenue driven by the timing of backlog conversion. International revenue was up 1% sequentially, driven by Latin America up 10% and Europe CIS SSA up 1% offset by Middle East Asia down 2%.\n\nby an increase in SSPS revenue driven by the timing of backlog conversion. International revenue was up 1% sequentially driven by Latin America up 10% and Europe , CIS, SSA up 1% offset by Middle East Asia down 2%. North America revenue decreased 4%.\n\nExcluding SSPS, international revenue was down 3% sequentially, and North America revenue was down 1%.\n\nOFSE operating income in the quarter was $371 million down 11% sequentially and up 75% year over here.\n\nOperating income rate was 10.4%, down 120 basis points sequentially and up 330 basis points on a year-over-year basis. OFSC EBITDA in the quarter was $579 million, down 6% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year.\n\nEBITDA margin rate was 16.2%, with margins decreasing 100 basis points sequentially, primarily due to seasonality in the services business, lower cost productivity, and a higher mix of SSPS revenue converting during the quarter. Our over-year EBITDA margins were up 180 basis points.\n\nIf we move to slide 13, IET orders were $3.5 billion, down 18% sequentially and down 1% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nGas technology equipment orders in the quarter were down 9% year over year.\n\nMajor awards during the quarter included equipment for Qatar's Northfield South LNG expansion and Sempra's Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project, as well as compression equipment for CO2 re-injection for multiple FPSOs in Brazil.\n\nGas Technology Services orders in the quarter were up 5% year over year, driven by strong upgrades and transactional services.\n\nIndustrial Technology Orders were up 16% year-over-year with all subsegments delivering double-digit orders growth.\n\nRPO for IET ended at $26.5 billion, up 5% sequentially.\n\nWithin IET, RPO, gas tech equipment RPO was $10.5 billion and gas tech services RPO was $13.6 billion.\n\nTurning to slide 14, revenue for the quarter was $2.1 billion, up 18% versus the prior year.\n\nGas tech equipment revenue was up 52% year over year driven by the execution of project backlog.\n\nGas tech services revenue was up 2% year over year, driven by transactional services offset by the discontinuation of our Russia operations. Transitional technology revenue was up 4% year over year.\n\nInspection and condition monitoring revenue was up year over year while PBG, PSI, and Nexus controls were down year over year.\n\nOperating income for IET was $241 million flat year over year.\n\nOperating margin rate was 11.3%, down 200 basis points year over year.\n\nIET EBITDA was $297 million, up 2% year over year. EBITDA margin was 13.9%, down 210 basis points year over year.\n\nHigher volume was offset by higher equipment mix and higher R&D spending related to new energy investments. Turning to slide 15, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the two business segments.\n\nOverall, we remain optimistic on the outlook for both OFSC and IET, with solid growth tailwinds across each business, as well as continued operational enhancements to help drive backlog execution and margin improvement.\n\nFor BakerFuse, we expect second quarter revenue to be between $6.1 and $6.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $845 and $905 million.\n\nFor the full year, our guidance remains unchanged.\n\nHowever, with the strong performance in the first quarter and positive outlook for the second quarter, we now believe that Adjustity Bidah is trending between the midpoint and the upper end of the guidance range of $3.6 to $3.8 billion.\n\nFor OFSE, we expect second-quarter results to reflect growth in international markets and softness in North America, but still see sequential improvements on both revenue and EBITDA.\n\nWe expect second quarter revenue for OFC between $3.65 and $3.85 billion, and EBITDA between $590 and $650 million.\n\nFor the full year 2023, we remain positive on the outlook for OFSC. International activity is tracking in line with our expectations, but we now expect North America DMC spending to increase in the low double digits in 2023.\n\nwhich is lower than the mid to high double digit growth expectation that we communicated in January . Despite the weaker outlook in North America, our full year outlook for OFSC remains unchanged with revenue between $14.5 and $15.5 billion dollars and EBITDA between $2.4 and $2.8 billion dollars in 2023.\n\nFor IET, we expect second quarter results to benefit from strong revenue growth year over year as we execute on our backlog for gas tech equipment while industrial technology is expected to grow modestly.\n\nWe expect second quarter IET revenue between $2.35 and $2.75 billion and AVIDDAB between $320 and $380 million.\n\nFor the full year, our outlook for IET is a little more constructive as we see positive order momentum continuing and supply changes, corruption, and both gas tech and industrial tech gradually improving and line with expectations.\n\nFor orders, we are maintaining our guidance range but feel increasingly confident in meeting high end of the range and see the opportunity to exceed the high end and potentially match 2022 order levels. As we get more visibility on the timing for select projects, we'll provide updates during the year.\n\nFor revenue and EBITDA, our guidance remains unchanged, but with a bias that each could trend above the midpoint of the range. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Lorenzo.\n\nThank you, Nancy. Turning to slide 16, Baker Hughes is committed to delivering for our customers and our shareholders. We remain focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities across OFSE and IET, including LNG and new energy. We continue to invest in R&D to develop our technology portfolio in hydrogen, hydrogen, and hydrogen.\n\ncarbon capture, and clean power. We also remain committed to delivering on our cost-out objectives by optimizing our corporate structure to enhance our margin and return profile. We continue to target EBITDA margins of 20% in OFSE and IET.\n\nand increasing ROIC in both businesses to 15% and 20% respectively. And finally, we continue to focus on generating strong free cash flow and returning 60 to 80% of this free cash flow to shareholders while also investing for growth across our world-class business. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John .\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. Operator, let's open the call for questions.\n\nThank you ladies and gentlemen. If you have questions at this time, please press star one one on your touch phone telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If your question has been answered or you wish to move yourself from the queue press star one one again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up.\n\nPlease send Bible we can find a can erase her. Enough first question coming from the line of teams with with ever quite silent is open.\n\nHey, good morning. My name is Nancy Judd.\n\nI wanted to start quickly on LNG. You talked a lot about it during the prepared remarks. I don't want to belabor the point too much, but clearly we've hit another momentum point here with a good number of awards coming through for you guys.\n\nbut also a lot of FIDs either happening or about to happen. So I'm curious what you see over the next couple of months as a kind of timing and cadence. I know that things are hard to call exactly, but it seems like we've kind of pulled forward here. And then as we think out further in the out years, you know, what you see on the\n\nyou know, two to five year type of horizon.\n\nI think you've seen some of the comments made by the G7 and others that natural gas and LNG has a role to play, not just as a transition, but as a destination fuel. Even though 2022 saw the pace of FID slow down somewhat because of the high interest rates and also the inflation.\n\nThe customer conversations have continued and I'm very pleased that we were able to book the Qatar NFS expansion, also temperate offer and also some smaller projects in Asia Pacific and West Africa during the course of the first quarter and they're still several more projects that we're tracking for FID this year.\n\nYou've seen some of the external press around Rio Grande and what they're expecting from the FAFSA, etc. We remain confident that this year we'll see between 65 MTPA to 115 MTPA of FIDs in 23. In terms of pipeline of opportunities, they continue to grow as well. I think a good example is Cheniere's 20 MTPA expansion that they've communicated. It's being passed.\n\nAnd so we're seeing a number of also international projects. So based on what we see today, there's a reasonable expectation that LNGFIDs in 24 could be approaching the same FID levels we see in 2023. Still at least call, but there are a number of projects that are moving towards that. And then it continues in 25 and 26.\n\nWe also see a set of opportunities improving and with the potential for FID ranges between 30 to 60 MTPA each year. So again, the market is very active at the moment and we like the position that we have in helping our customers. Fair enough. Okay, got it. Hi, my name is Greg Caio.\n\nOn the new energy side, impressive orders this quarter of $300 million, especially compared to $400 million for all of last year. Could you maybe talk to some of the trends you're seeing in those businesses? Is this a function of, okay, we've got the various, the IRA, the REpowerEU, all these kind of government programs coming through and so it's kind of\n\nforward some of this activity and I'd say we're very pleased with our progress on the new energy orders. I mean in the first quarter you said it we booked 300 million dollars of orders a large portion of that 250 were in IAT large orders around CCUS in Latin America CO2 compression for multiple FPSOs.\n\ntwo hydrogen awards in North America. So I think it's fair to say that we anticipate that at least in 2023 we should exceed the 400 million guidance we gave. Again, we're looking at the pipeline of opportunities. And over the course of the next three to four years, we think that the energy, new energy content should be around 10% of our gas.\n\nSo, the overall direction is positive. I think it's in line with what we've been saying. We have seen some acceleration. Feel good about our positioning and also the product capability we have here. Got it. ThanksVinter!\n\nThank you. And we'll move on to the next question. And our next question coming from the line of our own Tyron from JPM Chase. Your line is open. Yeah, good morning. Lorenzo, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of IET orders. You expressed, I believe, confidence now.\n\nat the upper end of the range and perhaps achieving the 10.5 to 11.5 billion dollar order guide. But what is driving the potential upside? Yes, sure, Roon. And look, feel good about some IT. And again, we indicated that we should be at the upper end of the guidance range. And you had some of the comments around LNG, the activity we're seeing there.\n\nAlso, some of the new energy coming through from an audit perspective. So those are elements that clearly help us. We still expect the offshore production to be down after a very strong year in 2022 with the FPSOs. But overall, again, positioning for the operating...\n\nsome details on some of the self-help initiatives. I know you last quarter you talked about rationalizing some of the capacity. But what are you seeing in terms?\n\nof the revenue opportunities synergies as you've combined in OFS with OFC. Yeah, definitely. And look, we've been indicating that we wanted to rationalize some of our capacity. And as you look at SSPS, we've taken several steps.\n\nalso at the end of last year and beginning of this year, to really take out some of our excess capacity on the subsea trees. We've also been rationalizing capacity in Asia, Latin America, outsourcing some of the basic machining that we've typically done in the UK. And now we're looking also at some of the facilities for SPC.\n\nwe go forward. So on the actual offshore market, again, we've seen some strong momentum. You saw our orders and again, the highest order rate from a five year period for the business and wishing good traction and flexible. So market momentum is positive at this stage and we see that continuing also in 2024.\n\nThank you. One more for our next question. And our next question coming from the line up, Chase Mokefield with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey, good morning, everyone. Lorenzo, Lorenzo, I guess the first question to you, you know, back at your annual meeting, you announced a few new digital offerings.\n\nwhich included Lucidia in the OFFE segment and Corda in the IET segment. So could you speak to how these differentiated digital offerings actually can help you accelerate your digital strategy and how they complement your current digital solutions offering?\n\nDefinitely Chase, and I was with a customer yesterday and actually reviewing the opportunity of Lucipa on the OFSC side. As you know, Lucipa is a cloud-based automated fuel production software solution really designed to help oil and gas operators proactively manage increased production and reduce carbon emissions. We're pleased to have Pan American Energy Corp, a leading company in Argentina.\n\nas the launch customer and actively talking to other customers also here in North America. We also announced a collaboration with Korva and have a minority investment to improve efficiency in RIG operations through analytics, real-time data and visualization.\n\nI'd say we're at the early stages of really being able to provide that suite of capabilities and good customer engagement. On the IET side, you mentioned it correctly, Cordant. Cordant is an integrated suite of solutions, really supporting our industrial asset performance management and process optimization. It builds on the broad and established rotating equipment.\n\nsensors, valves, pumps, gears, and inspection service domain we have within the space. Cordon is available today through a modular approach and pleased that we announced the collaboration with BP to further define and develop Cordon.\n\nand BP is going to be deploying 1pm in select locations across the Gulf of Mexico production assets where we have a large installed base of rotating equipment and also associated digital services. In addition in the first quarter, we want an important contract with a fertilizer customer.\n\nAgain, the scope of work includes artificial intelligence, machine learning, predictive analytics and it's really going to be able to help on the OEM physics-based analytics to improve their capability and reaching their production targets. It's a multimillion dollar order which we're very pleased about and seeing good traction across the Japanese ones.\n\nby the end of two queue. So maybe it's a little bit early to ask, but can you maybe spoon a minute or two and kind of give us some color around where you see the most opportunity for incremental cost savings across Baker.\n\nYeah, happy to. So we really started this whole project back in September 22, and we've just identified so many ways to think about it.\n\ncost out to the organization and really a more efficient operating structure overall. And I would note in the first quarter we recognized about 15 million of those cost outs. So we're starting to see that just simply from the movement of four product companies into the two business segments. So when we think about the cost outs at the moment there's, I think about it in two buckets. The first is, and it's probably two-thirds of the first 150, that's really just...\n\nsimplification in the organization, streamlining the operations, and that allows us to kind of take out some layers.\n\nsmaller functionality, removal of duplication, and just leaner overall at corporate, and then also pushing us to what we call a strategically managed business structure and putting the activities closer to the business. I think there's more we can do there as we think about that first bucket of cost-outs. The second is really cost controls and thinking about optimizing all of our support functions and thinking about what that bigger integral function is worth to have video content controls and allow for president bullying. I mean, as an automotive scientist, having all these processes drawn out in order to\n\nhow we spend our money with technology, external expenses, third party services and the like. So I think there's opportunities in both ways and we're going to continue to methodically work through all of it and thinking about how do we centralize activities that need to be at core, how do we put the right things at the business and then really standardizing some of our key operating processes. So we do think that's going to generate additional savings. So we need to get through this first bit of the cost out effort.\n\nAnd then we will come back to you with a better signal. So we think there's more there, but it's probably too soon to call. And then you had it right as we're working hard to get all this done by Q2, so we can start realizing the savings run rates by the end of 2023. Okay, perfect. Thanks, Julie Fuller. I'll turn it back over.\n\nThank you one moment please for our next question. And our next question coming from the lineup. Scott Gruber with Citi, your line is open.\n\nYes, good morning. Question on the outlook for your North American business within OFSE. Lavenda, you lowered you know your year-on-year D&C spend forecast which looks appropriate in light of the onshore drilling activity trending down here and it's you know likely down exit to exit.\n\nBut oil production is still growing in the US. It's still growing in Canada, which should drive chemicals growth And I believe Gulf of Mexico revenues should still be up for Baker this year.\n\nI think you can still hold the billion dollar or so revenue run rate. Through year end, even if the land rate count onshore is down.\n\nYes, Scott, look, I think there's certainly a lot of moving parts in the North America market at the moment. Coming into the year, we expected some privates to drop oil rigs early in the year, but that would be gradually offset over the course of the year by the public EMPs and some majors adding some rigs. The natural gas pricing has been weaker.\n\nAnd so we would expect 30 to 40 rigs or so additional to be dropped over the course of 2023. On the oil side though, we don't see much risk to the oil activity. If we stay at around $80, you know, we should be able to stay level on the rigs. And I don't think we'll see much impact unless we start to go below the...\n\nAnd then a question on the Middle East, you know, following the OPEC production cut, are you seeing or do you expect to see any impact on your chemical and less sales in the Middle East this year?\n\nYes, Scott, right now we see no major change really limited in our international outlook and expect international spending to increase in the mid double-digit range. Again, as you think about the Middle East, the GCC countries, drilling plans for this year are pretty well set along with the procurement of materials and labor.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if there was a material deviation from current plans. However, looking into 2024, we'll have to monitor the health of the global economy and also the old demand. And if OPEC plus cuts wind up being deeper or lasting longer.\n\nIt could impact the growth trajectory to some degree in 2024, but it's too early to say. I think you've got to remember that a lot of these customers are looking at production capacity over the long term increasing and have been dedicated to that on the natural gas development. We'll monitor the situation, but at this time limited impact.\n\nOkay, appreciate the covers. Thank you. Thank you. One moment please. This one. Next question.\n\nAnd our next question coming from the line up Luke Limon with 5% on your line is open Hey, good morning Lorenzo could you talk a little more about your agreement with HIF for direct air capture with your mosaic business and maybe\n\nwhat the timeline could be and what the opportunities that you see for Mosaic over the next few years. Yeah, definitely Luke and look as we've mentioned previously partnerships are critical to delivering the energy transition. So, you know, there's no one company or technology that's going to solve the problem.\n\nPartnerships like this that we have with HIF we think are crucial to be able to demonstrate and showcase the technology. HIF is a great case where they're developing projects to produce e-fuels by blending green hydrogen and CO2. Again, being, I'm really very current on these products that I really think our projects\n\nwith them alongside others such as Porsche and also other investors and we're going to be providing them a number of compressors, turbines, pumps, valves and other technology and per facility you know that's good content for us. We announced during the course of the quarter and intend to cooperate on the development of the direct air capture and\n\nIf you look at Mosaic, it's a company that has specialized in metal organic frameworks, MOP, which have the potential to capture low concentration CO2. What we're going to be doing is demonstrating that with a prototype with his in 2024 and again enabling them to...\n\nstart to deploy their e-fuel projects. So, feel good about the partnership here and also the opportunity going forward. It's a game changer. Again, if you look at e-fuels because they utilize the same infrastructure that's existing today. And so, from an investment level, it can be a nice substitution with a low...\n\nHey, thank you. First question relates to gas tech services. The revenue grew year over year here in first quarter, which I think is pretty impressive considering the comparison includes benefit from Russia last year. Maybe you could talk to the year over year outlook as we progress through the year. I guess you\n\nStill have a difficult comparison with Russia in the second quarter, but then that goes away as we get into the back half. Just talk about what we should expect there if you could.\n\nYeah, we're seeing really good growth in the services side of the business and we do anticipate solid recovery. I would say we're cautiously optimistic. One of the limiters still is the supply chain recovery, especially on the aviation side, so as we think about the inputs for services that's still in its recovery phase. But yeah, we're very supportive of where services is going and we\n\nthere wasn't any in the first quarter. You're talking about 60, 80% return of free cash flow in the year. I'm just curious, is it more about price sensitivity on the stock price? Are there M&A that is being contemplated? Is it just a matter of wanting to hold on to some more cash because of what's going on in the banking system? Maybe you could just sort of talk to those drivers. Yeah, absolutely. And you have it right. We do still plan to buy back shares at some point this year.\n\ntime for us to let the organization settle and then as you know is our free cash flow is very much back half-weighted so we're just\n\nWe're just kind of restoring our cash levels at the moment, letting that build throughout the course of the year, but we do intend to resume buybacks at some point later this year.\n\nThank you so much. Thank you. I'm on for our next question. And our next question coming from the line up, David Anderson with Barclays.ch WWE's\n\nGood morning Lorenzo. I'm just checking back to the Middle East. Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about Abu Dhabi and specifically you have a very unique position there with that knock drilling\n\nI believe you've been on your integrated services. You're on something like 40 rigs right now with ad-noc drilling I was wondering how you how that's progressing maybe kind of talk about some of the some of the work that you're pulling in there And where that number is going to we just saw an announcement with that I've got opera zaka was just awarded\n\nall ideas work. So maybe, can you just talk about that business in particular and how that's developing and where you see that going? Dave, I should be asking you the question, considering you were just out there in the Middle East. But look, we feel very good about the relationship that we have with the ad-noc drilling. And as you know, it started several years ago, also our position within UAE. And I'd say that with the announcements that...\n\nAlso, ADNOC is made relative to the commitment to increasing production. We see positive momentum with the ADNOC drilling and we have specific technologies that are appropriate that allow the time to drill to come down and drive efficiencies and productivity. So I'd say we are...\n\noptimistic about the future growth and obviously participating with Admoc really. Do you need to bring in more equipment in there? I mean, I guess capacity is gonna be one of things we're gonna be talking about quite a bit going forward. But just in terms of that business itself, do you need to pull in more? Do you need to build more? Do you have enough kind of on hand?\n\nYou know, Dave, with the partnership we have, we look on an annual basis at what is required from a tool perspective. And one of the key ways in which we drive efficiency and also we drive better performance is by having these discussions early. So rest assured, with that not drilling, we're tied to the hip. So anything that they've got planned, we already were discussing 12 months ago to make sure that we were ready for them. Thank you.\n\nAnd I just looking bigger picture at this at this region Middle East Asia was was essentially flat in 4q I'm sorry in the in the fork in the first quarter. I'm assuming that weakness was because of product sales that weren't recurring From the fourth quarter, but can you just talk about how revenue kind of should progress?\n\nthroughout the rest of the year in this part of the market? Make sure we kind of stay at this sort of 20% year on year growth clip throughout the year? Should that be the expectation here? Yeah, you're correct in your assessment relative to the difference between fourth quarter and first quarter. The fourth quarter, you do traditionally have direct tool sales that take place that don't take place in the first quarter.\n\nAs you look forward, again, we're continuing to see that there's good international growth and within Southeast Asia as well, and we should continue to see that progression. Okay. Thanks, Lorenzo. Thank you. One moment for our next question. In our next question coming from the line up.\n\nSteven Gungaro with Stiefel. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess two things as it relates to OFSC. Can you talk about just current pricing trends internationally? And then maybe as a follow-up, when you think about the 20% EBITDA margin target, how much of that is price versus...\n\nsort of activity in self-help etc. In terms of the pricing environment, as you look at North America starting to level off, we expect our pricing for our technology in North America to remain firm. Internationally, we're gaining good traction given the strong activity levels and some of the tightness in the market.\n\nThat being said, it will take some time to flow through from an earnings standpoint. And as you look at the construction of the 20%, we've always said that it's a combination of some of the pricing but a lot of self-help as well.\n\nThanks, and when you think about production chemicals, I think Nancy mentioned getting back to sort of historical levels by the end of the year. Can you just give us kind of an update on the traction there, and are those historical levels accretive to overall service margins? I think they are, but just checking.\n\nYeah, definitely. I think we continue to see positive developments in our chemicals business, improving margins. Chemical pricing has been favorable. Input prices have stabilized and we improved parts of our supply chain. As you know, we've got a new facility that ramps up in Singapore. We've got another facility that ramps up in Singapore.\n\nKSA later on this year. As you look at margins in the first quarter, they increased sequentially and are now up to 500 basis points year over year. We're still though two to 300 basis points below the long-term average for this business. So we've still got some work to do to get back to the prior levels, but we expect that to be more normalized in the second half of 2023.\n\nGreat, thank you for the call. Thank you. I'm on for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Roger Reed with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yeah, thank you. Good morning. I think most of the stuff's been hit. I just have one question. It was a topic at the event back at the end of January on servicing and the maintenance for the LNG.\n\nagreements we have. It's pretty much trending the way we anticipated and so no change from what we said in January . Again, as you know, there has been some push out from 2022 and we'll anticipate that that starts to catch up in 23 and 24. That's it for me. Thank you.",

(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jud Bailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Baker Hughes Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Nancy Buese. The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com.\nAs a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. As you know, reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd like to start off by highlighting a couple of changes for this earnings call. For the first time, we are hosting our earnings call from Florence, Italy, where we will host our Board meeting later this week and welcome over 2,000 customers and industry experts next week at our annual meeting. We will also be using a presentation during this webcast, which has also been published on our investor website that we will reference over the course of our prepared remarks.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, we were very pleased to end 2022 with solid momentum across our two business segments. In the fourth quarter, we saw continued margin improvement in our OFSE segment and an extremely strong level of orders for IET, which was driven by multiple awards across different end markets.\n2022 was an important year for Baker Hughes on a number of fronts. Strategically, we took a large step forward in reshaping the company as we announced our formal restructuring and resegmentation of Baker Hughes into two business segments. This kicked off a major transformation effort across the organization, including key executive management changes, which will fundamentally improve the way the company operates.\nOperationally, our performance for the year was mixed. During the first half of this year, we experienced multiple headwinds across our organization as well as a number of operational challenges. While our performance improved over the second half, we still have more work to do and are focused on various initiatives to improve shorter-term execution and meet the longer-term financial objectives we laid out at an investor conference last September.\nCommercially, orders performance in LNG and new energy hit new highs and are poised to remain strong into 2023. In 2022, we booked almost $3.5 billion in LNG equipment orders, our highest ever and booked over $400 million in new energy orders, showing over 50% growth versus 2021.\nAlthough not yet back to previous historical levels, orders for our offshore-exposed businesses also accelerated. Within OFSE, SSPS booked over $3 billion in orders in 2022, representing 36% growth versus 2021. In IET, onshore/offshore production recorded equipment orders of almost $1.9 billion in 2022. We are also seeing improvements in our industrial segments, with industrial technology orders of $3.3 billion in 2022 up 6% year-over-year. As we look ahead to 2023, we expect order momentum to continue across both OFSE and IET despite what is likely to be a mixed macro environment.\nTurning to Slide 5. In 2023, the global economy is expected to experience some challenges under the weight of inflationary pressures and tightening monetary conditions. Despite recessionary pressures in some of the world's largest economies, we maintain a positive outlook for the energy sector.\nWith years of underinvestment now being amplified by recent geopolitical factors, global spare capacity for oil and gas has deteriorated and will likely require years of investment growth to meet forecasted future demand. For this reason, we continue to believe that we are in the early stages of a multiyear upturn in global activity and are poised to see a second consecutive year of solid double-digit increases in global upstream spending in 2023. In addition to strong growth in traditional oil and gas spending we also believe that the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and potential new legislation in Europe will support significant growth opportunities in new energy in 2023 and beyond.\nWe also remain positive on the near-term and long-term prospects for the natural gas and LNG investment cycle. Near term, we believe that the likely reopening of China, combined with Europe's need to refill gas storage supplies will play a critical role in keeping global gas and LNG markets tight. Longer term, we remain optimistic on the structural growth outlook for natural gas and LNG as the world looks to lower emissions and displace the consumption of coal.\nWhile cost inflation and higher interest rates slowed the pace of new LNG FIDs in 2022, we are seeing progress on a number of fronts. We continue to expect significant growth in new project sanctions in 2023, with elevated activity levels likely continuing into 2024. Following 36 MTPA of LNG FIDs in 2022, we continue to expect to see an additional 65 to 115 MTPA of LNG projects reach FID in 2023.\nJust as important as the near-term outlook for LNG orders, we are now gaining visibility into new project opportunities that are developing towards the middle of the decade. Most notably, we are seeing progress on a number of brownfield initiatives and advancements in our new modular concepts that is likely to extend the current wave of activity several more years.\nTurning to Slide 6. Given this macro backdrop, Baker Hughes is intensely focused on four key areas in 2023 in order to drive future value for shareholders. First, we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities that are building across both business segments. These opportunities reach across the entire OFSE portfolio as well as in IET, most notably in LNG, onshore/offshore production and new energy.\nSecond, we remain focused on optimizing our corporate structure and transforming the Baker Hughes organization to drive improvements in our margin and returns profile. While we are still in the early stages of this process, we are increasingly confident in driving at least $150 million of cost out by the end of 2023 as well as structural changes that will simplify the organization and enhance our operational efficiency. The cost out and integration initiatives we are undertaking over the next 12 to 18 months will play a key role in hitting our EBITDA margin target of 20% in OFSE and IET over the next 2 to 3 years, and delivering return on invested capital of 15% and 20% for OFSE and IET, respectively.\nThird, we continue to develop our portfolio of new energy technologies. We've been particularly active over the last few years acquiring and investing in multiple new technologies around hydrogen, carbon capture, clean power and geothermal. We are now transitioning more towards the incubation of the existing portfolio. This will enable our new energy portfolio to achieve its full commercial potential with a particular focus on high-impact technologies like NET Power and Mosaic.\nFinally, we will continue to focus on all these initiatives and while also generating strong free cash flow and returning 60% to 80% of this to shareholders through a combination of share buybacks and dividends. In 2022, we increased our dividend for the first time since 2017. Going forward, our goal is to continue to increase shareholder returns with an emphasis on continuing to grow the dividend as the IET business experiences broader structural growth in revenue and earnings.\nTurning to Slide 7. I'll provide an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services and Equipment, the outlook remains promising with growth trends shifting more in favor of international and offshore markets while North America activity levels off. Importantly, the team continues to execute well as supply chain pressures moderate and the pricing environment remains favorable.\nGeographically, the Middle East retains the most promising outlook with activity scheduled to increase in multiple countries this year and likely next year. In Latin America and West Africa, offshore activity is driving growth in several countries, and creating opportunities across our diverse portfolio. In North America, visibility remains limited given the current oil and gas price environment and generally expect range-bound activity from current levels over the course of 2023.\nWithin our OFSE product lines, we have seen strong growth for well construction driven by opportunities across our drilling portfolio and for CIM, where our Completions portfolio continues to see solid improvement. In Production Solutions, we saw strong volume growth and margin improvement in our chemicals business throughout the year as supply chain constraints continue to ease and profitability normalizes. For 2023, we expect further improvement in our chemicals business as margin levels normalize back to historical levels and our Singapore plant becomes fully operational.\nOur legacy OFS segment executed well in the fourth quarter and we were pleased to see them achieve 19.6% EBITDA margins and 20% when normalizing for the impact of Russia. In SSPS, order activity remains strong as offshore activity continues to pick up. Importantly, we saw good order traction in both subsea trees and flexibles in the fourth quarter. After a record year in 2022 in flexibles orders, we expect another strong year in 2023 as well as a significant increase in subsea-trees awards.\nWe also continue to make progress on integrating SSPS into our OFSE segment as well as restructuring the business to drive better profitability and returns. After a thorough review of the SSPS business, Maria Claudia and her team are finalizing plans to rationalize approximately 40% to 50% of the manufacturing capacity in subsea production systems. These steps will be in addition to the cost savings gained from removing management layers and will largely come into effect in 2024. For 2023, we expect OFSE to deliver double-digit revenue growth and solid improvements in margins as activity increases in multiple regions, inflationary pressures subside and we execute our cost-out program and pricing remains favorable in most key markets.\nMoving to IET, the fourth quarter generated record orders driven by multiple awards in LNG and multiple awards in onshore/offshore production. Operationally, IET continues to navigate challenges in the gas tech services as well as challenges in different parts of the supply chain, ranging from chips and circuit boards to gas engines, castings and forgings. Orders during the fourth quarter for gas technology illustrate the breadth and depth of this portfolio.\nIn LNG, we saw continued progress across our world-class franchise. During the quarter, we were pleased to be awarded another major order to provide an LNG system for the second phase of Venture Global's Plaquemines project. This order builds on an award in the third quarter of 2022 for another power island system. Furthermore, this follows an award in the first quarter of 2022 for the first phase of Plaquemines and a similar contract for VG's Calcasieu Pass terminal in 2019, which are all part of a 70 MTPA master supply agreement.\nIn onshore/offshore production, IET booked contracts for five different projects in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa worth almost $900 million on a combined basis. With these awards, IET maintains its leadership in the FPSO market by providing power generation systems, compression trains and pumps that totals more than 30 aero-derivative gas turbines, 2 steam turbines and 20 compressors of various sizes.\nOn the new energy front, we were pleased to book an order from Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering to supply CO2 compression equipment to Petronas' Kasawari offshore carbon capture and sequestration project in Sarawak, Malaysia. The project is expected to be the world's largest offshore CCS facility, with capacity to reduce CO2 emissions by 3.3 MTPA. Baker Hughes will deliver two trains of low-pressure booster compressors to enable CO2 removal through membrane separation technology as well as two trains for reinjecting the separated CO2 into a dedicated storage site.\nOrders in our industrial technology business continued to perform well with strong traction this quarter across inspection and pumps, valves and gears. In our inspection business, we achieved significant commercial wins in the recovering aviation industry, including a record deal for visual inspection services in Latin America region as well as a number of orders for advanced ultrasonic testing systems with different customers in Asia Pacific.\nIn addition to solid growth in orders, we were pleased to see some signs of operational improvement in our industrial tech businesses, led by volume and margin increases in condition monitoring and inspection. We expect this positive momentum to continue into 2023 as the chip shortage and supply chain issues start to abate and backlog convertibility recovers.\nAs we enter 2023, IET has a record backlog of $25 billion and a robust pipeline of new order opportunities in LNG, onshore/offshore and new energy, and we now expect IET orders in 2023 between $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. Despite the supply chain challenges, we are closely monitoring for both gas tech and industrial tech. We are well positioned to execute on this backlog to help drive significant revenue growth in 2023 and 2024.\nWhile 2022 presented some unique challenges to Baker Hughes, it was also a pivotal year for us strategically and accelerated a number of changes in the organization. As we look at 2023 and beyond, I feel confident in the structural changes we are executing and are positioning to capitalize on the multiyear upstream spending cycle, the unfolding wave of LNG investment and the acceleration in new energy opportunities.\nAcross our entire enterprise, Baker Hughes is focused on significantly improving our margins and financial returns and meeting our customers' needs in a quickly-changing energy landscape. Achieving these goals will require acute focus across the entire organization as well as the depth and scale of global resources and engineering talent.\nThe culture of this company is unique in its diversity, its inclusiveness and its principles as well as its ability to adapt to change. Our team is focused on taking energy forward, transforming the way we operate and achieving the margin and return targets we have laid out to help drive best-in-class shareholder value and returns.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy.\n\nNancy K. Buese\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I will begin on Slide 9 with an overview of total company results and then discuss our balance sheet, free cash flow and capital allocation before then moving into the business segment details and our forward outlook.\nTotal company orders for the quarter were $8 billion, up 32% sequentially driven by industrial and energy technology, up 82% versus the prior quarter. Oilfield Services and Equipment orders were flat sequentially. Year-over-year, orders were up 20%, driven by an increase in both segments. We're extremely pleased with the orders performance at IET during the quarter, following strong orders throughout 2022. Total company orders for the full year were $26.8 billion, an increase of 24% versus 2021.\nRemaining performance obligation was $27.8 billion, up 13% sequentially. OFSE RPO ended at $2.6 billion, up 8% sequentially, while IET RPO ended at $25.3 billion, up 13% sequentially. Our total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.4 and IET was 1.8. Total company book-to-bill for the year was 1.3 and IET was 1.6.\nRevenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion, up 10% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year, driven by increases in both segments. Operating income for the quarter was $663 million. Adjusted operating income was $692 million, which excludes $29 million of restructuring, impairment and other charges. Adjusted operating income was up 38% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 11.7%, up 240 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 130 basis points.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $947 million, up 25% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rate was 16%, up 190 basis points sequentially and up 70 basis points year-over-year. Corporate costs were $100 million in the quarter, driven by the realization of some of our corporate optimization efforts. For the first quarter, we expect corporate costs to be roughly flat compared to fourth quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $255 million in the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect D&A to remain flat with fourth quarter levels.\nNet interest expense was $64 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $157 million. GAAP earnings per share was $0.18. Included in GAAP earnings per share were unrealized mark-to-market net losses in fair value for investments in ADNOC Drilling and C3 AI of $89 million and $11 million, respectively. Also included were $81 million of charges related to the termination of the Tax Matters Agreement with General Electric. These are all recorded in other nonoperating loss. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.38.\nTurning to Slide 10. We maintain a strong balance sheet with total debt of $6.7 billion and net debt of $4.2 billion, which is 1.4x our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We generated free cash flow in the quarter of $657 million, up $239 million sequentially, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and strong cash collections. For the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to decline sequentially, primarily driven by seasonality. We will continue to target 50% free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA on a through-cycle basis but expect 2023 to be in the low to mid-40% range.\nTurning to Slide 11 and capital allocation. We increased our quarterly dividend by $0.01 to $0.19 per share during the fourth quarter and also repurchased 4.2 million Class A shares for $101 million at an average price of $24 per share. For the full year 2022, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders.\nDuring the quarter, we closed the recently announced acquisition of BRUSH Power Generation, Quest Integrity and AccessESP. The total net cash paid for these three transactions was approximately $650 million. To fund these transactions, we took advantage of our strong balance sheet and used cash on hand.\nBaker Hughes remains committed to a flexible capital allocation policy that balances returning cash to shareholders and investing in growth opportunities. Our capital allocation philosophy starts with the priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet and targeting free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA in excess of 50% on a through-cycle basis. This framework will enable Baker Hughes to return 60% to 80% of our free cash flow back to shareholders.\nThis will also allow us to invest in bolt-on M&A opportunities that can complement the current IET and OFSE portfolios as well as our efforts in new energy. As we look to return cash to shareholders, we will prioritize growing our regular dividend given the secular growth opportunities for IET and complementing this with opportunistic share repurchases.\nNow I will walk you through the business segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on outlook going forward. Starting with Oilfield Services and Equipment on Slide 12. Orders in the quarter were $3.7 billion, flat sequentially. Subsea and surface pressure system orders were $738 million, up 45% year-over-year, driven by an increase in subsea-tree awards across multiple regions. OFSE revenue in the quarter was $3.6 billion, up 5% sequentially driven by increases across all product lines.\nInternational revenue was up 5% sequentially, driven by Latin America, up 10% and Middle East, Asia, up 7%, offset by Europe, CIS, SSA down 2%. North America revenue increased 5% sequentially. Excluding SSPS, both international and North America revenue were up 5%.\nOFSE operating income in the quarter was $416 million, up 28% sequentially. Operating income rate was 11.6%, with margin rates increasing 210 basis points sequentially. OFSE EBITDA in the quarter was $614 million, up 16% sequentially. EBITDA margin rate was 17.1%, with margins increasing 160 basis points sequentially, driven by increased volume and price improvements, partially offset by cost inflation. Year-over-year EBITDA margins were up 160 basis points.\nWe are really pleased with the margin performance in OFSE, particularly in the legacy OFS segment, which achieved a 19.6 EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. Legacy OFS EBITDA margins were 20%, excluding under-absorbed costs incurred prior to the completion of the sale of OFS Russia to local management in November.\nTurning to Slide 13. IET orders were $4.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year and a record orders quarter for IET. The strong fourth quarter orders performance closed out a great 2022 for IET with $12.7 billion of orders, up 28% year-over-year. Gas technology equipment orders in the quarter were up 36% year-over-year.\nGas tech equipment orders were supported by the LNG award for the second phase of Venture Global's Plaquemines project, a number of onshore/offshore production awards, and the award for CO2 compression equipment for the Kasawari CCS project. Gas tech services orders in the quarter were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower contractual services orders, partially offset by an increase in upgrades.\nRPO for IET ended at $25.3 billion, up 13% sequentially. Within IET RPO, gas tech equipment RPO was $9.5 billion, and gas tech services RPO was $13.6 billion. Industrial technology orders were up 6% year-over-year. Pumps, valves and gears, inspection and PSI and controls orders were up year-over-year, offset by condition monitoring orders, which were down year-over-year.\nTurning to Slide 14. Revenue for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up 1% versus the prior year. Gas tech equipment revenue was up 24% year-over-year, driven by the execution of project backlog. Gas tech services revenue was down 17% year-over-year, driven by lower contractual services and upgrades. This was primarily related to the loss of service revenue from the discontinuation of our Russia operations, foreign exchange movements, supply chain delays and outage pushouts.\nAs we've noted previously, the strength in commodity prices continues to shift maintenance schedules for some of our customers, a dynamic that we believe should normalize over time. Gas tech services also continues to see supply chain delays, largely stemming from delivery delays in aero-derivative gas turbines and associated components. This is an area that we will continue to monitor and manage going forward.\nIndustrial technology revenue was flat year-over-year. Conditions monitoring, inspection and PSI and controls revenue was up year-over-year while PVG was down year-over-year.\nOperating income for IET was $377 million, down 5% year-over-year. Operating margin was 16.2%, down 110 basis points year-over-year. IET EBITDA was $429 million, down 4% year-over-year. EBITDA margin rate was 18.4%, down 110 basis points year-over-year with higher equipment mix, cost inflation and higher R&D spending, partially offset by higher pricing and slightly higher volume. As we increasingly execute on our record gas tech equipment backlog, we are seeing a meaningful shift in the mix of our revenue profile, with equipment revenue representing 55% of total revenue in the quarter versus 45% a year ago.\nTurning to Slide 15. I would like to update you on our outlook for the two business segments and our cost-out program. With new reporting segments, we're providing a formal outlook in order to give another level of transparency for each business segment as well as further details around our forward-looking expectations. As we transition to this new framework, we're providing a range of expectations and also highlight the variables that drive the different potential outcomes. Overall, we feel optimistic on the outlook for both OFSE and IET, with solid growth tailwinds across our business as well as continued operational enhancements to help drive margin improvement.\nIn addition to executing on the growing pipeline of commercial opportunities, a key focus for Baker Hughes in 2023 is transforming our organization through at least $150 million of annualized cost out by the end of this year. All necessary actions to achieve this target should be completed by the end of the second quarter and the full impact will be realized by the end of the fourth quarter.\nFor Baker Hughes, we expect first quarter revenue between $5.3 billion and $5.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $700 million and $760 million. For the full year, we expect revenue between $24 billion and $26 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion.\nFor OFSE, we expect first quarter results to reflect usual seasonal declines in international activity as well as typical seasonality in North America. We, therefore, expect first quarter revenue for OFSE between $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion and EBITDA between $515 million and $585 million. Factors driving this range include the magnitude of seasonality in some international markets, timing of budget deployments in the U.S., backlog conversion in SSPS and the pace of our cost-out initiatives.\nFor the full year 2023, we expect another strong year of market growth internationally, spread across virtually all geographic regions, led by the Middle East, Latin America and West Africa. Overall, we expect international D&C spending to likely increase in the middle double digits on a year-over-year basis.\nIn North America, we expect activity levels to likely remain range bound for the balance of the year depending on oil and natural gas prices and activity levels among private operators. However, we believe that this level of activity as well as cost inflation will still translate into North America D&C spending growth in the mid to high double digits in 2023.\nGiven this macro backdrop, we would expect OFSE revenue between $14.5 billion and $15.5 billion and EBITDA between $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion in 2023. Factors driving this range include the pace of growth in various international markets, a range of potential outcomes in North America activity, continued improvement in chemicals, the pace of backlog conversion and cost-out initiatives in the SSPS segment and our broader cost-out initiatives.\nFor IET, we expect strong revenue growth on a year-over-year basis supported by backlog conversion of gas tech equipment and modest growth in an industrial technology. We, therefore, expect first quarter IET revenue between $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion and EBITDA between $250 million and $300 million. The major factors driving this revenue range will be the pace of backlog conversion for gas tech equipment, growth in industrial tech driven by improving supply chain dynamics and the impact of any continued deferrals in maintenance activity or supply chain delays at gas tech services.\nFor the full year, as Lorenzo mentioned, we now expect IET orders to be between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion driven by LNG and onshore/offshore production. We forecast full year IET revenue between $9.5 billion and $10.5 billion and EBITDA between $1.35 billion and $1.65 billion. The largest factor driving this range will be the pace of backlog conversion for gas tech equipment and any impacts associated with supply chain delays. Other factors that drive this range include foreign currency movements, the pace of improvement in supply chain impacts at industrial tech, the level of R&D spend related to our new energy investments and the timing of maintenance activity in gas tech services.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you, Nancy. Turning to Slide 16. Baker Hughes is committed to delivering for our customers and our shareholders. We remain focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities across OFSE and IET, including LNG and new energy, where we are increasing R&D to develop our technology portfolio in hydrogen, carbon capture and clean power.\nWe also remain committed to optimizing our corporate structure to enhance our margins and return profile, where we are targeting EBITDA margins of 20% in OFSE and IET and increasing ROIC in both businesses to 15% and 20%, respectively. And finally, we will continue to focus on generating strong free cash flow and returning 60% to 80% of this free cash flow to shareholders, while also investing for growth across our world-class business.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Jud.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Lorenzo.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jud Bailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Baker Hughes Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Brian Worrell. The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com.\nAs a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. As you know, reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We were generally pleased with our third quarter results with strong performance in OFS, while TPS successfully managed multiple challenges. We also saw strong orders performance with continued momentum in OFE as well as TPS.\nAs I mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, the macro outlook has grown increasingly uncertain. The global economy is dealing with the strongest inflationary pressures since the 1970s, a rising interest rate environment and sizable fluctuations in global currencies.\nDespite these economic challenges, we remain constructive on the outlook for oil and gas and believe that underlying fundamentals remain supportive of a multiyear upturn in global upstream spending. Operators around the world have shown a great deal of financial discipline, which we expect to translate into a more durable upstream spending cycle, even in the face of an unpredictable commodity price environment.\nIn the oil market, we expect continued price volatility as demand growth likely softens under the weight of higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. However, we expect supply constraints and production discipline to largely offset any demand weakness. This should support price levels that are conducive to driving double-digit upstream spending growth in 2023.\nIn the natural gas and LNG markets, prices remained elevated as a multitude of factors increased tensions on an already stressed global gas market. Europe's surging demand for LNG has redirected cargoes from other regions and created an exceptionally tight global market that could get even tighter in 2023. This situation has resulted in record-high LNG prices but has also slowed down switching from coal to gas in some developing countries.\nWe believe that significant investment is still required over the next 5 to 10 years to ensure natural gas' position as a key part of the energy transition. However, while the current price environment is attractive for new projects, this is also a pivotal time for the industry with price-related demand destruction occurring in some markets and LNG developers facing inflationary pressures and a higher cost of capital for new projects.\nAs a result, we believe the landscape may be shifting in favor of established LNG players with the scale, diversity and financial strength to navigate the risks and uncertainties. Those with brownfield projects and projects that utilize faster-to-market modular designs may be particularly advantaged in the coming years.\nOn the new energy front, recent policy movements in Europe and the United States are likely to help support a significant increase in clean energy development. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act should be particularly impactful in accelerating the development of green hydrogen, CCUS and direct air capture.\nWhile we have not changed our expectations for the ultimate addressable market sizes in these areas, the attractive tax incentives could accelerate development ahead of previously expected forecast. We also believe that the bill will create favorable economic conditions for our portfolio of new energy investments.\nGiven the dynamic macro backdrop, Baker Hughes is focused on preparing for a range of scenarios and executing on what is within our control. Last month, we announced the restructuring and resegmentation of the company into 2 reporting segments: OFSE and IET. This resegmentation will simplify and streamline our organizational structure with at least $150 million of cost out and a 25% reduction in the executive management team.\nThese changes will sharpen our focus, improve operational execution and better position Baker Hughes to capitalize on the quickly changing energy markets. This new structure will elevate new leadership while also creating better flexibility and economies of scale across the 2 business segments.\nImportantly, we expect these changes to increase shareholder value and improve the long-term optionality and growth opportunities for Baker Hughes, as our markets and customers continue to evolve. In parallel, we continue to invest in Baker Hughes portfolio through early-stage new energy investments and tuck-in M&A.\nIn addition to the investments in early-stage technologies like Mosaic, NET Power and HIF Global earlier this year, we announced several strategic acquisitions in the third quarter that will complement our current portfolio and enhance our strategic position. Perhaps the most notable is the recent acquisition of the Power Generation division of BRUSH Group, which positions us well to participate more directly in electrification.\nOther transactions also include the acquisitions of Quest Integrity and AccessESP, which enhance our inspection capabilities and broadens our ESP technology portfolio.\nNow I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services, we remain optimistic on the outlook for the sector with growth trends now clearly shifting more in favor of the international markets. The team continues to execute well as they capture net pricing increases and supply chain pressures gradually moderate.\nInternationally, growth continues to be led by Latin America, West Africa and the Middle East. In all of these markets, offshore activity is noticeably strengthening, while our drilling services and completions business are well positioned to win. In Latin America, Brazil offers the best combination of visibility and growth in the region, while Mexico and Guyana are also improving.\nSimilarly, in West Africa, we are seeing offshore projects move forward in multiple countries in the region. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and UAE are exhibiting the best near-term growth that is expected to continue into 2023 and beyond. Looking ahead, we expect continued growth through the end of this year and double-digit international growth in 2023.\nIn North America, pricing across our portfolio remains firm while drilling and completion activity are beginning to level off after significant growth over the last 2 years. Although the U.S. market will be more dynamic and dependent on oil prices, we generally expect solid activity levels through the end of this year, with an opportunity for modest growth in 2023 driven by public operators.\nOperationally, our OFS business is executing well and remains on track to achieve our target of 20% EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022. Over the course of the year, we have generated solid margin improvement across multiple product lines, including drilling services, completions, artificial lift and wireline.\nImportantly, a key driver of margin enhancement has been the continued improvement in our production chemicals business. After several difficult quarters impacted by supply chain and inflation, chemicals has now generated sequential margin rate improvement for 2 consecutive quarters. Although margin rates are not yet back to prior levels, we have a line of sight to further increases and expect to be at more normalized levels in 2023.\nMoving to TPS. The third quarter represented another solid performance in orders. We remain on track to generate $8 billion to $9 billion in orders in 2022 and in 2023. Operationally, TPS navigated several challenges and delivered solid results despite further pressure on the euro and continued market pressure on TPS services. The primary growth driver for TPS continues to be LNG, where multiple projects are expected to move forward for FID in 2022 and 2023.\nAlthough inflationary pressures and rising interest costs have slowed progress on some projects, we remain comfortable with our expectation of 100 to 150 MTPA reaching FID by the end of 2023, including the 31 MTPA that has reached FID year-to-date.\nDuring the quarter, we were pleased to be awarded another order by New Fortress Energy to support their Fast LNG facilities project. NFE will deploy Baker Hughes' technology for various offshore projects across the globe. This represents the third order we have booked with New Fortress since the second quarter of 2021, and we have now received 7 MTPA of Fast LNG orders. Additionally, we were awarded an order to deliver power generation equipment for a major LNG project in North America.\nDuring the quarter, we were also pleased to announce a new service contract for the maintenance and monitoring of turbomachinery equipment operations at ENI-led Coral FLNG, which is the first deepwater floating LNG facility operating off the coast of Mozambique.\nThis new service agreement builds on an existing Coral FLNG contract awarded to Baker Hughes in 2017. As part of the scope, Baker Hughes will fully leverage its growing digital capabilities by providing remote monitoring and diagnostic services as well as a suite of other services based on Bently Nevada's System 1 technology.\nOutside of LNG, TPS received an additional award to supply 12 electric motor-driven compressors to support gas processing for Saudi Aramco's Jafurah unconventional gas project. This order follows a similar award last quarter, bringing the total to 26 compressor trains supplied to the Jafurah project.\nWe also continued to grow our collaboration with Air Products, securing contracts to supply advanced High Pressure Ratio Compressor technology for the net-zero hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta and a steam turbine generator for the green ammonia process at the NEOM green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia. With these awards from Air Products, our new energy orders so far this year total over $170 million. We still expect new energy orders for 2022 to be around $200 million.\nNext, on Oilfield Equipment. Growth in the subsea and offshore markets continues to trend positively and should maintain solid order momentum over the next couple of years. OFE saw another record orders quarter in the Flexibles business with over $1 billion in orders year-to-date. The Flexibles team continued winning in Brazil as well as in China, retaining incumbency with key customers.\nDespite these positive order trends, we remain disappointed with the underlying profitability for OFE. As we highlighted in our strategy update last month, we have announced several actions to rectify these issues, including an initial $60 million in cost savings from removing management layers and integrating multiple functions and capabilities with OFS.\nBeyond the cost-out program, we expect to drive further margin improvement by rightsizing OFE's facilities footprint, addressing supply chain deficiencies and leveraging the shared engineering resources across the border of OFSE organization. As a part of this process, we are well into the wholesale reassessment of the subsea equipment business, which will drive out costs and determine the appropriate size and scale for this business.\nWe have already identified multiple facility rationalization opportunities and feel increasingly confident about the ability to improve profitability in this business. We expect to provide an update on the strategic review of SPS in the first half of 2023.\nFinally, in Digital Solutions, order activity remained resilient in the third quarter, but the operating environment continues to be challenged by the ongoing disruption to supply chains for chips and electrical components. During the quarter, Bently Nevada secured a multiyear SaaS agreement, expanding its existing scope to deliver plant-wide software across a customer's entire installed base in Europe.\nThe solution brings together System 1 cloud-based software advanced analytics powered by Augury as well as services and enterprise training. This project marks the first award with the Augury alliance and demonstrates the potential to drive growth through differentiated digital and hardware offerings.\nOn the operational side, while we have seen some improvement in availability of chips, timing of delivery and the size of allocation remains uncertain, which is restricting our team's ability to effectively and efficiently execute on backlog. For the aspects we control, the team has acted, moving to qualify additional suppliers as well as redesigning circuit boards to utilize more standardized chips.\nBeyond addressing the supply chain issues, we also recently announced the combination of the DS portfolio with TPS to create industrial and energy technology. We are in the early stages of removing functional layers and integrating the portfolio with TPS, which we expect to generate initial cost savings of at least $50 million by the end of 2023.\nWe expect significant commercial and technological benefits from closer integration and believe that IET will be uniquely positioned to enable more reliable, efficient and lower carbon solutions across the energy and industrial complex. 2022 has presented some unique challenges for Baker Hughes and driven several important decisions to better position the company for an evolving energy landscape.\nAs we head towards 2023, while we are preparing for a volatile environment, we are confident that we can navigate these challenges with the support from our recent corporate actions and our world-class team. We are intently focused on improving our operational execution, capitalizing on the multiyear upstream spending cycle and the unfolding wave of LNG FIDs.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to make an announcement about our executive leadership team. After many years with the company and 6 years as our CFO, Brian Worrell will be leaving Baker Hughes in 2023.\nBrian has not only been our CFO but also a key leader driving our strategy as well as our separation from GE. I would like to thank Brian for the instrumental role he has played in the formation and transformation of Baker Hughes.\nReplacing Brian effective November 2, will be Nancy Buese, who has over 15 years of public CFO experience in the mining and energy sectors and more than 30 years of finance and accounting experience. We believe that Nancy's experience in multiple sectors will be instrumental as we continue to transform all aspects of Baker Hughes and increase shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Worrell\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $6.1 billion, up 3% sequentially driven by OFE and OFS, partially offset by a decrease in Digital Solutions and TPS. Year-over-year, orders were up 13% driven by increases across all 4 segments. We are pleased with the orders performance in the quarter following strong orders in the first half of the year.\nRemaining performance obligation was $24.7 billion, up 1% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $9.1 billion, up 3% sequentially. And services RPO ended at $15.6 billion, flat sequentially.\nOur total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.1, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.3. Revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, up 6% sequentially driven by increases across all segments. Year-over-year, revenue was up 5% driven by OFS and Digital Solutions, partially offset by lower volumes in TPS and OFE.\nOperating income for the quarter was $269 million. Adjusted operating income was $503 million, which excludes $235 million of restructuring, impairment, separation and other charges. The restructuring charges in the third quarter were primarily driven by cost reduction projects for the recently announced reorganization as well as global footprint optimization in our OFS and OFE businesses.\nAdjusted operating income was up 34% sequentially and up 25% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 9.4%, up 190 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 150 basis points.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $758 million, up 16% sequentially and up 14% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rate was 14.1%, up 120 basis points sequentially and up 110 basis points year-over-year.\nCorporate costs were $103 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect corporate costs to be flat compared to third quarter levels.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $254 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect D&A to increase slightly from third quarter levels.\nNet interest expense was $65 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $153 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.02. Included in GAAP diluted loss per share was a $50 million loss from the net change in fair value of our investment in C3 AI, which is recorded in other nonoperating loss. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.26.\nTurning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $417 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect free cash flow to improve sequentially, primarily driven by higher earnings and seasonality.\nAs we highlighted in the second quarter, we still expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA to be below 50% for the year. In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase program, repurchasing 10.7 million Baker Hughes Class A shares for $265 million at an average price of $24.79 per share.\nBefore I go into the segment results, I would like to remind everyone that we will be changing our reporting structure in the fourth quarter to the 2 business segments, OFSE and IET, which went into effect on October 1. Although we will go from 4 reporting segments to 2, our aim is to provide more transparency across the different businesses.\nGoing forward, we will be reporting total OFSE revenue, operating income and EBITDA. We will also provide Tier 2 revenue disclosures across the 4 business lines of well construction, completions intervention and measurements, production solutions and subsea and surface pressure systems.\nWe will provide a geographic breakout of OFSE revenue into 4 regions: North America; Latin America; Middle East, Asia; and Europe, CIS, Sub-Saharan Africa. We will be reporting total IET revenue, operating income and EBITDA. We will also provide Tier 2 revenue disclosure across the 6 business lines of gas tech equipment, gas tech services, condition monitoring, inspection, industrial pumps, valves and gears and other. During the fourth quarter, we will provide 3 years of restated historical financials in this format.\nNow I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. Starting with Oilfield Services. Revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion, up 6% sequentially. International revenue was up 4% sequentially, led by increases in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Latin America, partially offset by lower revenues in Russia Caspian and Europe. North America revenue increased 10% sequentially with low double-digit growth in North America land.\nOperating income in the quarter was $330 million, up 27% sequentially. Operating margin rate was 11.6%, with margins increasing 190 basis points sequentially.\nYear-over-year, margins were up 380 basis points. The higher margin rate was primarily driven by increased pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by cost inflation.\nAs we look ahead to the fourth quarter, underlying fundamentals continue to improve with strong growth prospects internationally but with North America activity leveling off. For the fourth quarter, we expect a solid sequential increase in OFS revenue and still expect EBITDA margin rates between 19% and 20%, depending on timing of completing the sale of our Russia business.\nAlthough it is still early, I would like to give you some initial thoughts on how we see the OFS market in 2023. In the international market, we expect continued broad market growth spread across virtually all geographic regions.\nOverall, we believe that total international D&C spending is likely to increase in the low to mid-double digits on a year-over-year basis. While global macro risk could negatively impact oil prices and, therefore, activity in some areas, we would expect the longer cycle nature of international spending to still drive double-digit growth in most scenarios.\nIn North America, there's far less visibility, and market dynamics will be more dependent on oil prices. That being said, we expect public operators to modestly add to their 2022 exit rate while private operators could modestly decrease or increase activity depending on a number of factors. As a result, we believe this type of activity level will translate into North America D&C spending growth in the mid- to high double digits in 2023.\nWith this type of macro backdrop, we would expect to generate solid double-digit revenue growth in OFS in 2023. EBITDA margin rate for the full year should be in line with and potentially higher than the OFS fourth quarter 2022 exit margin rate.\nMoving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders for the quarter were $874 million, up 21% year-over-year, driven by a strong increase in Flexibles as well as SPC and services, partially offset by a decrease in SPS and the removal of subsea drilling systems from consolidated results.\nRevenue was $561 million, down 7% year-over-year primarily driven by SPS and the removal of SDS, partially offset by growth in Flexibles, SPC and services. Operating loss was $6 million, down $20 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower volumes from SPS in the quarter and the removal of SDS.\nOFE's lower operating margin rate was primarily driven by lower volume, cost inflation and lower cost productivity. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to slightly higher sequentially, with operating income still below breakeven due to cost underabsorption following the suspension of recent contracts.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we expect continued recovery offshore as activity in several basins is set to further strengthen. We expect mid- to high single-digit growth in OFE revenue driven by backlog conversion and growth in subsea services. We expect operating income for the year to be around breakeven with any potential upside driven by the timing of our cost-out and restructuring efforts.\nNext, I will cover Turbomachinery. Orders in the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Equipment orders were up 13% year-over-year supported by liquefaction equipment awards for NFE and an award for power generation equipment for a major LNG project in North America.\nService orders in the quarter were down 1% year-over-year driven by lower contractual services orders, partially offset by an increase in upgrades. Revenue for the quarter was $1.4 billion, down 8% versus the prior year.\nEquipment revenue was down 17% driven by lower backlog conversion and foreign currency movements. Services revenue was flat year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in transactional services and upgrades, offset by a decrease in contractual services and foreign currency movements.\nOperating income for TPS was $262 million, down 6% year-over-year. Operating margin rate was 18.2%, up 40 basis points year-over-year driven by favorable services mix and productivity on equipment contracts, partially offset by cost inflation.\nFor the fourth quarter, we expect another strong orders quarter and still expect TPS orders in 2022 to be in the $8 billion to $9 billion range. We expect a double-digit increase in TPS revenue in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis driven by higher equipment volume from planned backlog conversion.\nWith this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to be moderately lower on a year-over-year basis due to a higher equipment mix compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.\nLooking into 2023, we expect continued strength in TPS orders in the $8 billion to $9 billion range supported by LNG and onshore/offshore production. We expect TPS revenue to grow in the low 20% range in 2023 driven primarily by equipment backlog conversion. However, similar to this year, revenue growth will also be impacted by any project movements in backlog as well as foreign currency movements.\nOn the margin side, we expect operating income margin rate to decline modestly in 2023 due to higher equipment mix as well as a step-up in R&D spending in our CTS and IAM growth areas to drive new technology commercialization.\nFinally, in Digital Solutions, orders for the quarter were $547 million, up 5% year-over-year. We saw improvements in oil and gas and transportation end markets, partially offset by lower power and industrial orders. Sequentially, orders were down 10%, with all end markets lower.\nRevenue for the quarter was $528 million, up 4% year-over-year driven by higher volumes across all Digital Solutions product lines. Sequentially, revenue was up 1% driven by higher volume in Nexus Controls and PSI, partially offset by lower volume in Bently Nevada.\nOperating income for the quarter was $20 million, down 22% year-over-year largely driven by lower cost productivity and cost inflation as we continue to work through electronic shortages, partially offset by higher volume. Sequentially, operating income was up 11% driven by higher volumes. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue growth and a strong increase in operating margin rates.\nLooking into 2023, we expect DS revenues to increase mid-single digits, which assumes revenue growth from backlog conversion improvements as chip shortages ease and energy markets remain robust. This will be partially offset by expected declines across all our industrial businesses due to likely global economic weakness. We expect these volume increases to drive solid growth in operating margins.\nLastly, and before we move to Q&A, I would like to thank Lorenzo and the Baker Hughes team for all their support over the years. This company has come a long way since the merger with GE Oil & Gas and is in great financial condition with a strong balance sheet and outstanding finance team. Baker Hughes is well positioned to execute on the continued transformation into a leading energy technology company. It has been a pleasure to work with all of you.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Jud.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator, let's open the call for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jud Bailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Baker Hughes Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Brian Worrell. The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com.\nAs a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. As you know, reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our second quarter results were mixed as each product company navigated a different set of challenges, ranging from component shortages and supply chain inflation to the suspension of our Russian operations. While OFS and TPS are managing through the current situation fairly well, OSE and DS have both experienced more difficulty.\nAs we look to the second half of 2022 and into 2023, the oil markets face an unusual set of circumstances and challenges. On one hand, the demand outlook for the next 12 to 18 months is deteriorating as inflation erodes consumer purchasing power and central banks aggressively raise interest rates to combat inflation.\nOn the other hand, due to years of underinvestment globally and the potential need to replace Russian barrels, broader supply constraints can realistically keep commodity prices at elevated levels, even in a scenario of moderate demand disruption. As a result, we believe the outlook for oil prices remains volatile but still supportive of relatively strong activity levels as higher spending is required to reorder the global energy map and likely offset moderate demand disruption in most recessionary scenarios.\nIn the natural gas market, the redrawing of the energy map is having an even greater impact with sustained high prices, a frenzy of offtake contracting activity and a growing pipeline of major LNG projects that seem likely to reach FID. There has been a significant increase in long-term LNG offtake agreements in the U.S., totaling over 35 MTPA during the first half of 2022.\nFor comparison, year-to-date LNG contracting activity is 3x greater than the average annual U.S. contracting volume going back to 2015. This sharp increase reflects the growing importance of natural gas and LNG as governments rebalance their priorities between sustainability, security and affordability.\nWe believe that solving this energy trilemma will be another long-term positive for natural gas. This team will continue to grow in importance as countries around the world face acute energy shortages and are working to avoid industrial interruptions in certain sectors of their economies.\nOverall, we remain very positive on the outlook for natural gas. We also believe that a significant increase in natural gas and LNG infrastructure investment is required over the next 5 to 10 years in order to make natural gas a more affordable and reliable baseload fuel source that can be paired with the intermittent renewable power sources.\nAgainst this uncertain macro backdrop, Baker Hughes is preparing for all scenarios, and we'll continue to execute on our long-term strategy. If commodity prices remain resilient, as we expect, our portfolio is well positioned to benefit from a strong LNG cycle and a multiyear upstream spending cycle. We will also continue to invest in our energy transition and industrial initiatives while also returning 60% to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders.\nHowever, if the global economy experiences further turbulence and commodity price volatility, we believe our balanced portfolio of short- and long-cycle businesses will enable us to generate peer-leading free cash flow and allow us to maintain our policy of returning cash to shareholders. In addition to a strong backlog that affords cash flow visibility, we have best-in-class balance sheet that allows us to invest opportunistically either through share buybacks or tuck-in investment opportunities. In either scenario, Baker Hughes is well positioned to create value for shareholders.\nFrom an operational and strategic perspective, we were active over the first half of the year, executing on a number of exciting tuck-in acquisitions and new energy investments such as Mosaic, NET Power and HIF Global, which position us in key technologies for the future. We have also been focused on setting up internal commercial structures like CTS and IAM, which will help us to capitalize on opportunities in the energy transition and industrial areas.\nIn addition to these initiatives, our time is increasingly focused on optimizing and formalizing our operations around 2 core business areas of OFSE and IET. As the energy markets continue to evolve, it is becoming clearer that aligning across these 2 core areas make strategic sense.\nWe are focusing on ways to simplify our process and systems with a distinct focus on productivity and efficiency across our operations. As we look to drive additional synergies between both TPS and DS and OFS and OSE, we believe that this will be a significant area of opportunity for Baker Hughes as we look to further streamline our organization and position it for the future.\nNow I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services, activity levels continue to trend positively in both the international and North America markets, and net pricing is being achieved across multiple product lines. We also see improving visibility for growth in some key areas into 2023 and beyond.\nIn international markets, broad diversified growth continues with recent strength in Latin America, West Africa and the Middle East. We expect growth in most international markets to continue, with the strongest increases likely to come from the Middle East over the second half of the year and into 2023. Producers in the region are committed to an orderly increase in production and are beginning to execute drilling plans to improve both oil and natural gas production capacity in the region.\nIn North America, activity and pricing remained strong, with the rig count continuing to track above our expectations. We expect continued modest growth in the rig count in the coming months, but the outlook for 2023 will be dependent on the broader macro factors and oil prices.\nOperationally, I'm pleased overall with the progress made by the OFS team during the second quarter in navigating the challenges related to Russia as well as supply chain constraints and inflation. During the second quarter, the suspension of our OFS operations in Russia accelerated quicker than anticipated as we moved closer to reaching an agreement to sell our OFS operations in the country.\nOutside of the impact from Russia, our OFS business executed well in the second quarter with improvements in our production chemicals business. After being weighed down for several consecutive quarters by supply chain and inflationary impacts, chemicals saw a sequential increase in margin and has line of sight to further increases in the coming quarters. Going forward, we expect to continue to drive margin improvement despite the cost headwinds from the suspension of our operations in Russia.\nMoving to TPS. The second quarter represented another solid performance in orders, where we remain on track to generate $8 billion to $9 billion in orders in 2022 with an optimistic view of 2023. Operationally, TPS performed well despite some revenue impacts from the suspension of operations in Russia as well as some project shipment delays across both equipment and services.\nWe continue to believe that we are at the beginning of another constructive LNG cycle, particularly for U.S. projects, including the FID for VG’s Plaquemines Phase 1 at the end of May and Cheniere's FID of Corpus Christi Stage 3 in June. We continue to expect 100 to 150 MTPA of LNG FIDs over the next 2 years, with additional FIDs in 2024 and 2025.\nDuring the second quarter, we were pleased to be awarded an order to provide 7 mid-scale LNG trains to support the Stage 3 expansion project of Cheniere's Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility. Each train is comprised of 2 electric motor-driven compressors, producing approximately 1.5 MTPA of LNG, totaling 10.5 MTPA of production capacity. This award builds on the strong relationship between Baker Hughes and Cheniere since 2012 as we currently provide all liquefaction equipment for Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sabine Pass projects.\nOutside of LNG, the TPS team booked an important gas processing award in Saudi Arabia to supply 14 electric motor-driven compressors for the Jafurah unconventional gas field project, the largest nonassociated gas field in the country. Baker Hughes is leveraging its local compressor packaging facility in Modon to deliver the equipment and support the kingdom's in-country total value-add program.\nAlso, during the quarter, TPS booked an award from Tellurian to provide electric-powered Integrated Compressor Line technology and turbomachinery equipment for a natural gas transmission project in Southwest Louisiana. The project is expected to supply upwards of 5.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily with virtually no emissions.\nICL zero-emissions is landmark technology that lowers the carbon footprint of a key segment of the natural gas supply chain and is already reducing the climate footprint of pipeline projects in many regions that deliver vital gas supplies. This order marks the first time Baker Hughes will install its ICL decarbonization technology for pipeline compression in North America.\nDuring the quarter, TPS' CTS organization continues to support the growth of the hydrogen economy. TPS secured a contract with Air Products to supply advanced syngas and ammonia compression technology for the production of green ammonia for the NEOM carbon-free hydrogen and ammonia facility in Saudi Arabia. This order builds on our hydrogen collaboration framework with Air Products and leverages Baker Hughes' broad experience and references in supplying syngas and ammonia compressors.\nNext, on Oilfield Equipment, we are encouraged to see improving demand trends across the different business areas. However, we remain disappointed with the overall level of profitability of the business and are executing on further actions to drive additional cost out and improve operations across the portfolio.\nAt a macro level, trends in the subsea and offshore markets continue to improve and should have solid order momentum over the next couple of years. Despite recent commodity price volatility, we believe that a solid pipeline of deepwater opportunities will continue to develop across a few key markets.\nImportantly, we continue to see OFE gain momentum outside of Brazil with its offshore flexible pipe technology, securing several large contracts with multiple customers across the Americas and the Middle East. OFE will provide flexible pipe systems and services, including risers, flowlines and jumpers to improve oil recovery and help to extend field life and profitability.\nOFE booked their highest orders ever in flexibles in the second quarter and over $600 million in flexible orders for the first half of the year in 2022, also a record. While activity and project awards are improving offshore, we recognize that we have work to do in OFE to drive operating margins back to an acceptable level.\nWe are driving continued actions across the business to improve operations while also ensuring we have the appropriate resources in place to take this business forward. We are also in the final stages of planning more integration between OFE and OFS, driving more efficient cost management across certain parts of the OFSE business area globally.\nFinally, in Digital Solutions, while order activity was strong in the second quarter, the business continues to be hampered by supply chain challenges, mainly electronic shortages, as well as inflationary pressures. During the quarter, DS saw continued interest for its condition monitoring systems and services in the industrial sector.\nBently Nevada secured a contract to upgrade the machinery protection systems for critical machines at a steel plant in the Middle East. The contract includes Bently Nevada's latest Orbit 60 system, which will provide the customer reliable protection and will enable advanced condition monitoring without additional hardware spend.\nDS also gained traction with its emissions management portfolio of technologies. Following an MOU signed in February, DS secured a contract with Petrosafe for the first deployment of Flare.IQ technology for refining operations in Egypt. The deployment will be implemented at the APC Refinery in Alexandria, supporting Egypt's low-carbon strategy and tackling emissions in the sector as the country prepares to host COP27 in November.\nWe also recently reached an agreement for the sale of our Nexus Controls product line to General Electric. GE will continue to provide Baker Hughes with GE-marked control products currently in the Nexus Controls portfolio. And Baker Hughes will be the exclusive supplier and service provider of such GE products for its oil and gas customers' control needs. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023.\nAs we have mentioned in the past, we continue to make strategic and operational changes across DS, including recent leadership changes in Bently Nevada during the quarter. We are also conducting a review of the broader DS portfolio, taking actions to ensure we have the right business composition to serve our customers and drive returns.\nAs we move forward, there is clearly more work to do. We are committed to driving better performance, profitability and returns for the DS business.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to spend a few moments highlighting some of the achievements from our corporate responsibility report that was published at the end of the second quarter. This report provides an expanded view of our environmental, social and governance performance and outlines our corporate strategy and commitments for a sustainable energy future.\nWe again lowered our emissions footprint and expanded our emissions reporting. We achieved an 8% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions in 2021 versus 2020 and a 23% reduction in '21 compared to our 2019 baseline. We also expanded reporting of scope-free emissions across our value chain to include emissions from several new categories.\nI'm also pleased to say that in 2021, we launched Carbon Out, an internal company-wide initiative to take carbon out of our operations and meet our pledge to achieve a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. We further expanded our programs and processes to embed diversity, equity and inclusion into our operating process. We launched a global council in 2021 to increase accountability on this strategic priority. And we updated our process to evaluate and reconcile pay equity across the company.\nOverall, Baker Hughes is successfully executing on its vision as an energy technology company and to take energy forward, making it safer, cleaner and more efficient for people and the planet. Our corporate responsibility report demonstrates our progress in many of these areas. Baker Hughes is well positioned to drive energy efficiency gains to meet global energy demand and support broader decarbonization objectives.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Worrell\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $5.9 billion, down 14% sequentially, driven by TPS and OFE, partially offset by an increase in Digital Solutions and OFS. Year-over-year, orders were up 15%, driven by increases across all 4 segments.\nWe are pleased with the orders performance in the quarter following strong orders performance in the last 2 quarters. Remaining performance obligation was $24.3 billion, down 6% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $8.8 billion, down 11% sequentially. And services RPO ended at $15.5 billion, down 3% sequentially. The decrease in the RPO was driven by the suspension of our operations in Russia and foreign currency exchange movements.\nOur total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.2, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.2. Revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, up 4% sequentially driven by Digital Solutions, OFS and OFE, partially offset by lower TPS volumes. Year-over-year, revenue was down 2%, driven by decreases in OFE and TPS, partially offset by increases in OFS and Digital Solutions.\nOperating loss for the quarter was $25 million. Adjusted operating income was $376 million, which excludes $402 million of restructuring, impairment, separation and other charges. Included in these charges was $365 million related to the suspension of our operations in Russia.\nAs I will explain in a moment, our Russian activities were either prohibited under applicable sanctions or unsustainable in the current environment. Adjusted operating income was up 8% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 7.5%, up 20 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 100 basis points.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $651 million, up 4% sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rate was 12.9%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA margins were largely impacted by the suspension of our Russia operations during the quarter and foreign currency exchange movements.\nCorporate costs were $108 million in the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect corporate costs to decline and be more in line with first quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $275 million in the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect D&A to decline roughly $5 million sequentially as a result of the impairments taken in the second quarter. Net interest expense was $60 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $182 million.\nGAAP diluted loss per share was $0.84. Included in GAAP diluted loss per share are $426 million of losses related to our OFS business in Russia due to its classification as held for sale at the end of the second quarter. Also included was an $85 million loss from the net change in fair value of our investment in ADNOC Drilling and a $38 million loss from the net change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai, all of which are recorded in other nonoperating loss. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.11.\nTurning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $147 million. Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by lower collections, which are largely timing-related, as well as a build in inventory as we get ready to execute on our large order backlog. For the third quarter, we expect free cash flow to improve sequentially, primarily driven by higher earnings and seasonality.\nWe now expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA to be below 50% for the year due to lower cash generation from Russia. In the second quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase program, repurchasing 6.7 million Baker Hughes Class A shares for $226 million at an average price of $34 per share.\nBefore I go into the segment results, I would like to give you an update on our Russia operations, how these impacted our second quarter results and how the current situation factors into our forward outlook. As I mentioned earlier, our OFS business in Russia was classified as held for sale at the end of the second quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, we took the step to suspend our Russia OFS operations to ensure compliance with all sanctions. As a result, our OFS Russia revenue declined 51% sequentially to approximately $60 million in the second quarter, leading to meaningful cost under absorption as we maintained our full cost base. Looking ahead, we are required to maintain our operating costs in the country until we reach a resolution for our Russian operations.\nIn TPS, we have suspended work on equipment and service contracts in Russia. As a result, these projects have been removed from RPO, and second quarter revenue was impacted by roughly $160 million, but with minimal impact to TPS operating margins. For the full year, we estimate that TPS revenue will be impacted by approximately $400 million, but again, with minimal impact to TPS margins in 2022.\nIn OFE, we have suspended all equipment and service contracts in Russia. OFE will be impacted by lower volume and cost under absorption over the next few quarters due to the removal of these projects from RPO.\nNow I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. Starting with Oilfield Services. Revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 8% sequentially. International revenue was up 8% sequentially, led by increases in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East, partially offset by lower revenues in Russia Caspian. North America revenue increased 9% sequentially, with low double-digit growth in North America land.\nOperating income in the quarter was $261 million, up 18% sequentially. Operating margin rate was 9.7%, with margins increasing 80 basis points sequentially driven by price improvement and productivity, partially offset by impacts from Russia and cost inflation. Year-over-year, margins were up 240 basis points.\nExcluding Russia, OFS operating margin rate was 10.3% and OFS EBITDA rate was 18%. As we look ahead to the third quarter, underlying energy fundamentals continue to improve, and we expect to see growth in both international and North American activity as well as continued improvements in pricing.\nFor the third quarter, OFS revenue should increase sequentially in the mid-single-digit range. With this revenue framework, we would expect our margin rate to increase by approximately 50 to 100 basis points sequentially, which assumes that we will continue to carry between $25 million to $30 million of cost per quarter related to Russia.\nFor the full year 2022, we continue to see an improving outlook across most major markets. In the international markets, we expect the continuation of a broad-based recovery with industry-wide activity growth in the mid-double digits. In North America, we expect continued activity increases with the broader market set to experience strong growth of 50% or greater.\nGiven this macro backdrop, we would expect OFS revenue to increase in the mid-double digits in 2022. We expect EBITDA margin rates to increase over the next 2 quarters and to be between 19% and 20% in the fourth quarter, depending on timing of the resolution of our Russia business.\nMoving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders for the quarter were $723 million, up 6% year-over-year, driven by a strong increase in flexibles and services, partially offset by a decrease in SPS and the removal of subsea drilling systems from consolidated results. Revenue was $541 million, down 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by SPS, SPC and the removal of SDS, partially offset by growth in services and flexibles.\nOperating income was negative $12 million, down $40 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower volume in the quarter. OFE's lower operating margin rate was primarily driven by lower volumes in SPS and some operational challenges on certain projects.\nAlthough OFE has had to navigate some challenges this year, the current level of performance is unacceptable. And as Lorenzo mentioned, we are evaluating additional ways to drive cost out and better operating performance, which includes more integration across OFS and OFE.\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate revenue to be approximately flat to down low single digits sequentially, depending on the timing of backlog conversion. We expect operating income to be below breakeven due to cost under absorption following the suspension of contracts related to Russia.\nFor the full year 2022, we still expect a recovery in offshore activity and project awards, which should help drive a double-digit increase in orders. We expect OFE revenue to decline double digits, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of SDS and OFE margins to be below breakeven.\nNext, I will cover Turbomachinery. Orders in the quarter were $1.9 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Equipment orders were up 38% year-over-year, driven by a gas processing award in Saudi Arabia and an order for Cheniere's Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion. Service orders in the quarter were up 14% year-over-year, driven by installation orders and growth in contractual and transactional services, partially offset by a decrease in upgrades.\nRevenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, down 21% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was down 30%, driven by changes in project schedules and foreign currency movements. Services revenue was down 11% year-over-year, driven by a decrease in upgrades, transactional services and Russia-related impacts during the quarter, offset by contractual services.\nOperating income for TPS was $218 million, down 1% year-over-year. Operating margin rate was 16.8%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. Margin rates in the second quarter were favorably impacted by higher services mix.\nOverall, the TPS team has navigated multiple headwinds as the year has unfolded, including Russia-related impacts, foreign currency movements and the challenging supply chain environment. Despite these headwinds, we still feel confident in the full year operating income outlook relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year.\nFor the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher equipment volume from planned backlog conversion. With this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to be moderately lower on a year-over-year basis, depending on the ultimate mix between equipment and services. For the full year, we still expect TPS orders to be between $8 billion and $9 billion, driven by increasing LNG awards.\nWe now expect revenue growth to be roughly flat to up low single digits versus 2021, the lower revenue growth versus expectations earlier in the year by the suspension of operations in Russia, the depreciation of the euro versus the dollar and some modest changes in project execution schedules. On the margin side, we now expect operating income margin rates to be slightly higher on a year-over-year basis, depending on the mix between services and equipment.\nFinally, in Digital Solutions, orders for the quarter were $609 million, up 13% year-over-year. DS continues to see a strengthening market outlook and delivered growth in orders across oil and gas and industrial end markets. Sequentially, orders were up 7%, driven by higher industrial and power orders. As oil and gas end markets finally start to recover, DS orders are now at the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2019.\nRevenue for the quarter was $524 million, up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes in PPS and Waygate, partially offset by lower volume in Bently Nevada and Nexus Controls. Sequentially, revenue was up 11%, driven by higher volume in PPS, Bently Nevada and Nexus Controls, partially offset by lower volume in PSI.\nOperating income for the quarter was $18 million, down 28% year-over-year, largely driven by mix, inflation and lower productivity. Sequentially, operating income was up 21%, driven by higher volume. Overall, DS continues to be affected by both chip and electronic component availability shortages, negatively impacting the convertibility of our backlog and our ability to drive higher productivity.\nAs Lorenzo mentioned, we continue to make strategic and operational changes across DS, designed to improve performance, as evidenced by recent leadership changes and the recently announced sale of Nexus Controls to GE. For the third quarter, we expect to see low single-digit sequential revenue growth and a slight increase in operating margin rates. For the full year, we expect DS revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income margin rates to average in the mid-single digits for the full year.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Jud.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Brian.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone.\n\nAs a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Jud Bailey, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nMD and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Baker Hughes first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Brian Worrell. The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com.\n\nAs a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. As you know, reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nThank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results reflect operating in a very volatile market environment during the first few months of 2022. On the positive side, TPS orders were up over 100% year-over-year, with TPS book-to-bill of 2.2 as the LNG order cycle continues to unfold. We also experienced some challenges in parts of our business due to continued pressures from broader global supply chain constraints as well as some impact from the recent geopolitical events.\n\nAs we look ahead to the rest of 2022, we see a favorable oil and gas price backdrop as well as a dynamic operating environment with perhaps the most challenging supply chain and inflationary environment we have seen in several decades. The recent and unfortunate geopolitical events are amplifying several trends, including broad-based inflation and supply pressure for key materials, commodities and labor. These events are also driving changes on the economic front, where the world is transitioning from an era of strong economic growth to an environment that is more tenuous and likely to feature diverging economic conditions regionally.\n\nDespite broader political uncertainty around the world, Baker Hughes is committed to helping deliver energy globally in a safe, clean and reliable manner, while also maintaining our commitment to net zero carbon emissions and leadership in the energy transition.\n\nTo meet the world's energy needs in a responsible manner, we believe multiple years of spending growth will be required, as well as significant increase in LNG infrastructure investment.\n\nWhile there is some near-term risk on the demand side, we expect global oil and gas supply to remain constrained in the coming years, which should support higher commodity prices and multiple years of spending growth from our customers.\n\nRecent geopolitical events have severely constrained what was already a tight global natural gas market and have refocused the world on the importance of energy security, diversity and reliability. As the world reacts to the rapid changes in the global commodity market, governments are prioritizing natural gas and LNG as a key transition and destination fuel.\n\nWe continue to see a focus on prioritizing LNG from stable, lower cost markets and locations that can provide cleaner LNG.\n\nGiven the current LNG price environment and the quickly changing dynamics, we believe that global LNG capacity will likely exceed 800 MTPA by the end of this decade to meet growing demand forecast. This compares to the current global installed base of 460 MTPA and projects under construction totaling almost 150 MTPA. In order to be operational by 2030, this additional capacity will need to reach FID by around 2025.\n\nDespite the volatile yet improving medium-term macro environment, Baker Hughes remains focused on executing our strategy and we continue to drive further optimization across the two core business areas of OFSE and IET.\n\nEarlier this year, we created Climate Technology Solutions, or CTS, and Industrial Asset Management, or IAM. The creation of these two groups is critical to accelerating the speed of commercial development across our key growth areas of new energy frontiers and industrials.\n\nWe continue to make steady progress in developing our Climate Technology Solutions capabilities with recent investments and partnerships in NET Power, HIF Global and the acquisition of Mosaic Materials, which features a promising direct air capture technology. Mosaic’s materials science and technical expertise including their unique metal organic framework technology provides Baker Hughes with the potential to efficiently capture low concentrations of CO2 across a number of applications.\n\nNET Power is an emission-free gas-to-power technology, where Baker Hughes will develop supercritical CO2 turboexpanders and other critical pumping and compression technology. We will also bring system integration and process knowledge experience to the partnership to help accelerate the market positioning and deployment of NET Power’s emission-free and low-cost electric power.\n\nHIF Global develops projects in multiple geographies to produce e-fuels by blending green hydrogen and CO2. Baker Hughes is investing alongside EIG, Porsche, AME and Gemstone and will provide compressors, turbines, pumps, valves and other technology on future projects.\n\nWe are also discussing how our recently acquired Mosaic Materials’ DAC technology could be incorporated into these future projects.\n\nOverall, we are excited about adding another carbon capture technology to our portfolio and the potential of these two partnerships to open new market opportunities in clean power and low carbon fuels for Baker Hughes.\n\nIn Industrial Asset Management, we signed an important agreement with Accenture, C3.ai and Microsoft to collaborate on the build-out of the IAM solutions offering. The partnership will focus on creating and deploying Baker Hughes IAM solutions that use digital technologies to help improve the safety, efficiency and emissions profile of industrial machines, field equipment and other physical assets.\n\nIn addition to advancing our commercial efforts in CTS and IAM, we also remain focused on optimizing our broader organizational structure under the core business areas of OFSE and IET.\n\nAt the beginning of April, we took some steps to strengthen and better position Oilfield Services to more closely align our products, services and solutions to the lifecycle of the well and ultimately to what our customers require.\n\nOFS will move from a product line oriented structure to a solutions-focused business, centered around well construction, completions, intervention and measurements, and production solutions.\n\nIn addition to the organizational changes in OFS, we were pleased to announce an agreement to acquire Altus Intervention, a leading international provider of well intervention services and downhole technology. The acquisition complements OFS’ existing portfolio by enhancing our life of wealth capabilities as operators look to improve efficiencies from mature fields.\n\nMaria Claudia and the OFS team are enhancing their operating model to become more competitive, improve the speed of decision-making and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market.\n\nThese organizational changes are important steps in the OFS’ journey as customers are increasingly asking for integrated offerings and more solutions-oriented outcomes as well as a continuation of the strong productivity improvements in OFS over the past few years.\n\nAs we continue to evolve Baker Hughes across the two business areas of OFSE and IET, we expect more meaningful synergy opportunities between TPS and DS. We are also focused on driving better returns in our OFE business as well as further synergies between OFS and OFE.\n\nNow I'll give you an update on each of our segments.\n\nIn Oilfield Services, activity levels at the start of the year have continued to trend positively in both the international and North American markets. We also see improving visibility for stronger growth in several key areas over the rest of 2022.\n\nIn the international markets, underlying activity is improving broadly with particular strength in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. The uncertainty in Russia is an offset.\n\nWe expect growth in most international markets to continue with the strongest increases likely to come from the Middle East over the second half of the year and into 2023. Producers in the region are in the early stages of investing in capacity expansion and should help drive a multiyear increase in activity across the region.\n\nIn North America, drilling and completion activity continues to move solidly higher with further increases expected over the course of the year. Although current oil and gas prices would normally suggest a stronger increase in activity, the combination of E&P capital discipline and industry shortages in labor and equipment is likely to keep short-term incremental increases more moderate in nature.\n\nWhile we are pleased with the growth in activity and the growing pipeline of work, in many regions, underlying operations continue to be impacted by supply chain and inflationary pressures and, most recently, disruption to our operations in Russia. Our offs team is working extremely hard to offset these headwinds with price increases, sourcing actions and a global team working to solve logistics constraints.\n\nThe product line that continues to feel the most supply chain-related pressure is our production chemicals business, where we have taken actions to enhance our sourcing and manufacturing functions.\n\nIn addition to recently enacting a supply surcharge and changing out some of the leadership in our chemicals business, we are also taking steps to source and produce chemicals closer to key demand hubs with the opening of our production chemicals facility in Singapore later this year and the recently announced JV with Dussur in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs we look over the balance of the year, we remain committed to achieving a 20% EBITDA margin by the fourth quarter.\n\nMoving to TPS, the first quarter represented a continuation of the successes we achieved in 2021. TPS orders totaled $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, driven again by strong orders in LNG.\n\nWe believe that we are at the beginning of another constructive LNG cycle, which is being expedited by the current geopolitical situation, particularly for US LNG projects.\n\nOur positive long-term view is also supported by the recent improvements in policy sentiment in certain parts of the world towards natural gas role within the energy transition.\n\nThe recent EU taxonomy changes to now include natural gas as a transition fuel as an example of this, and the added need to diversify and provide energy security will likely intensify policy efforts.\n\nAs these market dynamics play out, a number of projects should accelerate and we now believe that 100 to 150 MTBA of LNG FIDs will be authorized over the next 2 years, with additional FIDs becoming more likely in 2024 and 2025.\n\nGiven the strong TPS orders performance in the first quarter as well as the acceleration in timing for several LNG projects, we now expect TPS orders to increase in 2022 versus 2021.\n\nDuring the first quarter, we were pleased to be awarded a major order to provide an LNG system for the first phase of Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG project.\n\nWe will be providing 24 modularized compression trains for the first phase of the project and this award is part of a 70 MTPA master equipment supply agreement.\n\nThe highly efficient liquefaction train system is modularized, helping to lower construction and operational costs with a plug-and-play approach that enables faster installation and first cargo.\n\nThis important order builds on an award in the fourth quarter of 2021 for power generation and the electrical distribution equipment for the comprehensive power island system for the Plaquemines project.\n\nThe Plaquemines order follows a similar contract for VG’s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal in 2019. In 2021, Baker Hughes successfully completed delivery of the ninth and final block for Calcasieu Pass. All shipments were finalized ahead of schedule and excellent achievement by our team. Calcasieu Pass holds the global record for the fastest construction of a large scale Greenfield LNG project moving from FID to first LNG in 29 months.\n\nOutside of LNG, we booked an award for NovaLT16 turbines, which will run on 100% hydrogen for Air Products new net zero blue hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nOur collaboration with Air Products will be critical for a net zero future and this order follows the award we received for advanced compression technology for the NEOM carbon-free green hydrogen project.\n\nWe were also pleased to be awarded a contract by TERNA to supply gas turbines and compressors that can run on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen for a new compression station for the Greek natural gas transmission system.\n\nBaker Hughes will provide free compression trains deploying our NovaLT12 hydrogen-ready gas turbines and PCL compressors with the capability to transport up to 10% hydrogen for this project.\n\nThe project directly supports the EU’s hydrogen strategy goals to accelerate the development of clean hydrogen and show its role as a cornerstone of a climate-neutral energy system by 2050.\n\nThese latest hydrogen orders build on Baker Hughes’s extensive experience in developing and supplying turbomachinery equipment to compress, transport and utilize hydrogen.\n\nNext, on Oilfield Equipment, we are encouraged to see improving demand trends across the different business areas. Although recent world events impacted first quarter results, we remain disappointed with the overall level of profitability.\n\nAt a macro level, trends in the subsea and offshore markets continue to improve. In the subsea tree and flexible pipe market, we expect a solid increase in industry awards this year as a firm commodity price outlook supports a growing pipeline of deepwater opportunities in core markets.\n\nIn our international wellhead business, we also see a positive order outlook across multiple regions and particularly in the Middle East.\n\nIn the first quarter, we were awarded a contract in Asia to provide subsea wellheads and subsea production systems plus related services, including 12 subsea trees for a deepwater gas field. We also achieved our first award in Ivory Coast, where we will supply subsea trees, flexible flow lines and rises to develop the Baleine deepwater oil field.\n\nIn Latin America, we were pleased to build on our flexible pipe business success, securing awards for flexible pipe systems in services that will be deployed across a number of key post-salt revitalization programs, enabling increased oil recovery and extending the life of multiple subsea developments.\n\nFinally, in Digital Solutions, order activity remains solid with growth across our industrial end markets as well as improvement in the oil and gas markets.\n\nDS continues to be affected by supply chain challenges and electronic shortages as well as continued inflationary pressures. The team is working tirelessly to manage the situation and navigate the evolving supply chain issues that have been exasperated by recent events.\n\nIn the first quarter, we made a number of changes in the DS business as we look to improve the overall performance.\n\nWe unified our unique sensor business units, Panametrics, Reuter Stokes and Druck under one product line, Precision Sensors and Instrumentation, or PSI. As a combined business, PSI will better support potential investment opportunities crucial for the future development and help optimize the unique technology and commercial requirements of each brand. Unifying the businesses will also help drive better cost and operational performance.\n\nWhile we recognize that there is still more work to do, we also continue to make key personnel and operational changes across DS to drive performance, profitability and return improvements and to ensure that we have the right team in place to take this business forward.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bentley Nevada secured an important contract with a refiner in Brazil. Our ARMS reliability OnePM solution will support the customers’ operations by providing visibility on over 10,000 assets.\n\nWe will be providing optimal digital strategies to support asset integrity and availability, which will lead to maintenance cost optimization and effectively enable risk management while delivering enhanced performance.\n\nDespite some of the challenges this quarter, we are optimistic on the outlook across both of our core business areas and excited about the new energy investments we are making for Baker Hughes.\n\nWe believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from an extended cyclical recovery in OFSC and longer term structural growth trends in LNG, new energy and industrial asset management.\n\nImportantly, we expect to generate strong free cash flow as the cycle plays out and remain committed to returning the majority of it back to shareholders.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian\n\nBrian Worrell\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I will begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details.\n\nOrders for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% sequentially driven by OFE and TPS partially offset by a decrease in Digital Solutions and OFS. Year-over-year, orders were up 51%, driven by increases across all four segments.\n\nWe are particularly pleased with the orders performance in the quarter, especially in TPS, following a strong orders performance in the fourth quarter. Remaining performance obligation was $25.8 billion, up 10% sequentially.\n\nEquipment RPO ended at $9.9 billion, up 20% sequentially. And services RPO ended at $15.9 billion, up 4% sequentially.\n\nOur total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.4 and our equipment book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.9.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 12% sequentially with declines in all four segments. Year-over-year, revenue was up 1%, driven by increases in OFS and Digital Solutions partially offset by decreases in OFE and TPS.\n\nOperating income for the quarter was $279 million. Adjusted operating income was $348 million, which excludes $70 million of restructuring, separation and other charges.\n\nAdjusted operating income was down 39% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 7.2%, down 320 basis points sequentially. Year-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 160 basis points.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $625 million, down 26% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rate was 12.9%, up 120 basis points year-over-year.\n\nAs I will expand in a moment, our adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA margin rates were impacted by geopolitical events as well as broader global supply chain challenges.\n\nCorporate costs were $105 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect corporate costs to be roughly flat compared to the first quarter.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $277 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect D&A to be slightly up compared to first quarter levels. Net interest expense was $64 million. Income tax expense in the quarter was $107 million.\n\nGAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.08. Included in GAAP diluted earnings per share is an $85 million gain from the net change in fair value of our investment in ADNOC drilling and a $74 million loss from the net change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai. Both are recorded in other non-operating loss. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.15.\n\nTurning to the cash flow statement, free cash flow in the quarter was negative $105 million.\n\nFree cash flow in the quarter was impacted by lower collections from a select number of international customers, which are largely timing related as well as a build in inventory as we get ready to execute on our large order backlog.\n\nFor the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to improve sequentially, primarily driven by higher earnings and stronger collections.\n\nWe continue to expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA to be around 50% for the year, but anticipate the majority of our free cash flow to be generated over the second half of 2022.\n\nThe quarterly progression should be more in line with what we experienced during 2018 and 2019.\n\nIn the first quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase program, repurchasing 8.1 million Baker Hughes Class A shares for $236 million at an average price of just under $29 per share.\n\nAs of March 31, GE’s ownership of Baker Hughes Class B shares represented 4% of the total company, down from just over 11% at the end of 2021. GE’s overall ownership of Class A and Class B shares was 11.4% at the end of the first quarter, down from 16.2% at the end of 2021.\n\nBefore I go into the segment results, I will comment on the current situation in Russia and how it currently factors into our broader outlook.\n\nRussia represented roughly 4% of total company revenue in the first quarter and we recently announced that we have halted all new investment in the country.\n\nAdditionally, sanctions from the U.S., UK. and the EU continue to evolve and are making ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more difficult.\n\nAs a result, we expect erosion of our Russia-related revenues over the course of 2022, particularly in OFS. However, the pace and magnitude of this is difficult to predict given the dynamic nature of the situation. Therefore, there is a range of possible outcomes we are preparing for across our product companies.\n\nOn broader supply chain, while we did see some areas stabilize in the first quarter, there continues to be pressure on electronics, challenges in logistics and an evolving understanding of implications due to global and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nWe remain focused on being adaptable to deliver for our customers and on our commitments.\n\nNow I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward.\n\nIn Oilfield Services, the team delivered a solid quarter despite some of the global challenges. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, down 3% sequentially. International revenue was down 7% sequentially, led by declines in the North Sea, Russia Caspian, the Middle East and Latin America. North America revenue increased 6% sequentially with solid growth in both North America land and offshore.\n\nOperating income in the quarter was $221 million, down 14% sequentially.\n\nOperating margin rate was 8.9% with margins declining 110 basis points sequentially driven by lower volume, less favorable mix and continued inflationary pressure in the Chemicals business.\n\nYear-over-year margins were up 230 basis points.\n\nAs we look ahead to the second quarter, underlying macro fundamentals continue to improve, and we expect to see strong growth in both international and North American activity, as well as improvement in pricing. This is likely to be partially offset by weakness in Russia.\n\nWe estimate that our second quarter revenue should increase sequentially in the mid- to high single-digit range. With this revenue framework, we would expect our margins to increase by approximately 100 to 200 basis points sequentially.\n\nFor the full year 2022, we see an improving outlook across most major markets, which is partially tempered by global supply chain and geopolitical factors.\n\nIn the international market. We expect the continuation of a broad-based recovery, with industry-wide activity growth in the low to mid-double digits.\n\nIn North America, we expect continued activity increases with the broader market set to experience strong growth in excess of 40%.\n\nGiven this macro backdrop and some of the headwind considerations I noted earlier, we would expect OFS revenue to increase in the low to mid-double digits. The largest variable to this range is the number of potential outcomes in Russia.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, we still expect margin rates to increase throughout the year and continue to target 20% EBITDA margins by the fourth quarter.\n\nMoving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders for the quarter were $739 million, an increase of over 100% or $394 million year-over-year.\n\nThe strong orders performance was driven by SPS, supported by a large subsea tree contract in Asia, along with growth in flexibles, surface pressure control and services.\n\nAs a reminder, we removed subsea drilling systems from consolidated OFE operations when we completed the merger with MHWirth in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nRevenue was $528 million, down 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by SPS, SPC and the removal of SDS, partially offset by growth in services and flexibles.\n\nOperating loss was $8 million, down $12 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower volume in the quarter. OFE’s lower revenue and operating margin in the quarter were driven by lower equipment backlog conversion in SPS.\n\nFor the second quarter, we anticipate revenue to be approximately flat to up mid-single digits sequentially, depending on the timing of backlog conversion. We expect operating income to be around breakeven or slightly positive.\n\nFor the full year 2022, we expect a recovery in offshore activity and project awards, which should help drive a solid increase in orders when adjusting for the removal of SDS.\n\nWe expect OFE revenue to decline double digits, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of SDS and OFE margin rate to be in the low single-digit range.\n\nNext, I will cover Turbomachinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution.\n\nOrders in the quarter were $3 billion, up $1.6 billion year-over-year, a new quarterly record for TPS. Equipment orders were up $1.5 billion year-over-year, driven by a significant award to provide an LNG system for the first phase of VG’s Plaquemines LNG project in North America.\n\nService orders in the quarter were up 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in contractual and transactional services, partially offset by lower order volumes and upgrades.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, down 9% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was down 26%, driven by timing of project execution.\n\nServices revenue was up 6% year-over-year, driven by higher volume in upgrades, pumps and valves.\n\nOperating income for TPS was $226 million, up 9% year-over-year. Operating margin was 16.8%, up 280 basis points year-over-year.\n\nMargin rates in the first quarter were favorably impacted by higher services mix and strong cost productivity, especially on projects at or near completion. \n\nFor the second quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to up mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis driven by higher equipment volume from planned backlog conversion.\n\nWith this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to be roughly flat to slightly higher versus the second quarter of 2021, depending on the ultimate mix between equipment and services.\n\nFor the full year, we expect strong growth in TPS orders versus 2021, driven by increasing LNG awards. We also continue to see a solid pipeline in our onshore/offshore production segment along with opportunities in pumps, valves and new energy areas.\n\nWhile we expect very strong growth in orders, revenue growth should likely range between high single digits to low double digits.\n\nOn the margin side, we continue to expect operating income margin rates to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2022, depending on the mix between services and equipment.\n\nAs we mentioned last quarter, included in this framework is an expected increase in investments and R&D expenses that relate to our new energy and industrial growth areas.\n\nFinally, in Digital Solutions, orders for the quarter were $567 million, up 3% year-over-year. DS continues to see a strengthening market outlook and delivered growth in orders across most end markets. Sequentially, orders were down 6%, driven by typical seasonality.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $474 million, up 1% year-over-year primarily driven by higher volumes in precision sensors and instrumentation and weight gate, partially offset by lower volume in PPS, Nexus Controls and Bently Nevada.\n\nSequentially, revenue was down 15%, driven by typical seasonality and challenges in the global environment, particularly supply chain.\n\nOperating income for the quarter was $15 million, down 38% year-over-year largely driven by headwinds from electronics shortages, some cost inflation and COVID-19-related lockdowns in China. Sequentially, operating income was down 71% driven by lower volume.\n\nFor the second quarter, we expect to see strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin rates back into the mid-single digits. For the full year, following five quarters in a row of positive book-to-bill, we expect solid DS revenue growth as supply chain constraints begin to ease over the second half of the year and backlog conversion improves. With higher volumes, we expect to see strong improvements in DS margins, which should approach high single digits for the total year.\n\nOverall, we have navigated a volatile environment during the quarter, delivering strong orders across the company and positioning to execute on our record backlog. Despite very troubling and challenging geopolitical events and broadly stressed global supply chains, we are confident in our ability to adapt and execute as the rest of the year unfolds. With that, I will turn the call back over to Jud.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nMD and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator, let's open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have questions at this time, please press the star then the one key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. In the consideration of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up.\n\nOur first question coming from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nJames Carlyle West\n\nSenior MD and Fundamental Research Analyst, Evercore ISI, Research Division\n\nHey, good morning, Lorenzo, Brian.\n\nSo, Lorenzo, you gave some great detail on the LNG outlook. But I was wondering if we could get a little more color from your conversations specifically with customers as things have clearly changed pretty dramatically in the last 8 or 9 weeks as LNGs come into focus here. And if you could maybe provide us what they are saying, what their urgency level is, kind of just a little more detail on how those conversations are going and how accelerated this buildout cycle could be.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nYes. Sure, James. And I think it’s clear the unfolding situation in Europe has definitely accelerated the pace of discussions on the next wave of LNG projects aiming to take FID. We’ve already started to see market momentum pick up in 2021, as country set net-zero targets and also started to realize the role of natural gas and what it would play in the energy transition. Now I’d say we are arguably in the early stages in what could be a multi-year reorganizing of the global energy system. And with that, it will take time for the LNG landscape to evolve. And based on the discussions with customers, we see a significant step-up in a number of customers looking to take earlier FIDs with also increased long-term supply agreements. We now expect 100 to 150 MTPA to take FID over the next 2 years, with the potential of more FIDs in ‘24 and ‘25. As you know, a lot of these projects are in the U.S. So U.S. should be a big better and fishery as these redrawing of the global energy map. But also as we look at other places such as East, Middle East, Mexico and also Asia, we’re seeing increasing interest from customers. I think we’re very well positioned with some interesting concepts around flexibility and also speed to market. And with our highly efficient modularized reflection train system, which again was emphasized in VG, we are helping to lower construction and operational costs with the plug-and-play approach that enables faster installation, so feeling good about the LNG outlook for the number of years.\n\nJames Carlyle West\n\nSenior MD and Fundamental Research Analyst, Evercore ISI, Research Division\n\nSure. Thanks for that, Lorenzo. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for me, you made this investment in April, a few weeks ago or a week ago with HIF Global to expand, I think, e-fuels. Could you maybe comment on what exactly is going on there, what that market looks like? How you see that playing out?\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nYes, sure, James. HIF is a great opportunity, and we’re pleased to be involved with this customer, and it’s another example of how collaboration can really help to drive the energy transition. HIF Global develops projects to produce e-fuels by blending green hydrogen and CO2. And we’ve invested alongside AME, EIG, Porsche and Gemstone, great partners to really help HIF continue to develop carbon neutral e-fuel projects in the United States, Chile and Australia. With a small minority investment in this equity round we will be providing compressors, turbines, pumps, valves and other technology on future projects. And I think what’s interesting here is, again, as you look at electricity-based fuels or e-fuels, their clean carbon-neutral fuels produced from renewable green hydrogen and carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere. And they can be used by existing cars and trucks without any modification to the engines, and e-fuels require no new infrastructure transportation or filling station. So a good opportunity and an expanding market for us.\n\nJames Carlyle West\n\nSenior MD and Fundamental Research Analyst, Evercore ISI, Research Division\n\nGot it. Thanks, Lorenzo.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question coming from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\n\nYes. Good morning, everyone.\n\nHi, Brian. Hi, Lorenzo. I guess kind of a follow-up question on James, a question around LNG. And obviously, you’ve taken up your guidance for LNG – or sorry, for TPS orders this year based on strong LNG. So you’ve been guiding flat. Now you expect kind of strong order growth momentum. So I don’t know if you want to kind of quantify what strong means. And then we kind of all understand what’s happening in LNG and accelerated growth opportunities here. But maybe just step back a little bit and talk about your upstream onshore, offshore order opportunities. Because it ultimately looks like the base orders related to kind of some of the onshore/offshore stuff has taken a step higher as well.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nYes, Chase. On TPS, again, we’re seeing a continued order momentum that we saw start at the end of ‘21, and it’s really accelerated in ‘22, primarily driven by LNG, also the new energy opportunities, even though they are smaller in nature. But when you look at the LNG projects that are moving forward as I mentioned before, and you think about the likely timing, it could translate in an order number for TPS of $8 billion to $9 billion in 2022. And importantly, based on customer discussions, we’d expect our order levels to remain elevated in 2023 as well. As you can see, a lot of this on the LNG projects is a pull forward and also strong long-term LNG fundamentals. And we also see a continued traction in the new energy space. And as you saw again in the first quarter, we booked some awards on the new energy space, and we’re still at the upper end of our 100 to 200 range as we continue to see new energy orders in 2022.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\n\nOkay, alright. That’s helpful there. Nice to hear. Strong orders are going to continue into 2023 for TPS. The follow-up is really obviously, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is causing Europe and other countries to focus on energy security. Obviously, this is positive on the LNG front. But what does that ultimately mean for the energy transition? Do you think that it actually slows the pace of adoption? Does it speed it up? Like what does it mean for energy transition?\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nYes, Chase, it’s a question that many are posing then. I think the focus right now in the near-term has switched to energy security, reliability and diversity. But we don’t believe that sustainability goes away. And in fact, if you look at some of the policies even introduced in Germany, the 2035 Energy Plan still continues focus on sustainability. We think the current environment will actually accelerate clean energy initiatives, particularly for fuels like hydrogen, which EU is making a large part of its long-term energy plan. What we’re seeing from the current situation is that you cannot become too reliant on one country or one source of energy. So diversity of supply is critical. And we think that pragmatism has come back into this discussion and the role of energy. Not just renewables but also, as we’ve mentioned before, gas playing a key critical role. Given the elevated commodity prices, a number of major oil companies and NOCs are going to report good profits and free cash flow. We think they will use this to continue actually developing and accelerating their carbon or decarbonization plans as well as healthy shareholder returns. And you can see that also with an example like Aramco with its CapEx plan that includes significant hydrogen. So we think Baker Hughes is very well positioned then with gas, LNG, hydrogen, CCUS, oil and pipelines. And we’ve got the technologies that are going to continue to drive this transition.\n\nChase Mulvehill\n\nResearch Analyst, BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\n\nAlright. Perfect. Thanks, Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question coming from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nConnor Joseph Lynagh\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nYes, thanks. I was hoping maybe we could talk a little bit more about Russia. So just wanted to understand, first off, the data point on the 4% of revenues. Is that already fully accounting for any ruble depreciation impacts? And so is what you’re basically guiding to actual activity declines? And I’m curious further to that, is it at this point, you have received notification from your customers that your activity will decline or is that just your expectation based on what you’re seeing in the market?\n\nBrian Worrell\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nYes. Connor, to hit the first part, this does include the impact of what was going on with the ruble. And as you know, it’s been down and up again and is relatively stable at this point in time. And you hit it, it represented roughly about 4% of revenues in the first quarter. And look, I’d say in terms of how we’re thinking about it for the full year, you got to take a step back and realize that sanctions from the U.S., UK. and EU continue to evolve and are evolving and are making ongoing operations increasingly complex and a bit more difficult. And kind of to give you some perspective on the quarter, we did see some decremental impact on EBITDA, about the same level on EBITDA that as Russia represented in terms of revenue of the total company. And it was really driven from lower volumes from not being able to move people and assets into the country. I’d say there were also some logistical delays and delivery challenges, which largely impacted OFE in both equipment and services. And then we also saw some logistical delays and delivery challenges in TPS, primarily in services as well. So those were the two areas that we saw the most significant impact in the quarter from Russia. And if you a step back and look at what we talked about going forward and kind of the framework that we tried to provide you for the year, we did contemplate everything that we know today and the anticipation that things are going to continue to evolve there. So based on what we talked about in terms of the revenue outlook for OFS, up low to mid-double digits, the low end really assumes that our OFS Russia operation declines over the course of the year to basically an immaterial level, so by the end of the year, really, really low there. We do have inventory in the country. But given the sanctions, are unable to import key technologies for some of the services. So there will be a drop off over the course of the year, barring something unforeseen. And there will be some impacts in TPS associated with that. But look, as we get more clarity on the situation, we will clearly react and take the appropriate cost actions to offsetting the declines in volume, which we also included in the framework that we provided you. And then, as you think about Russia and the impact on the global environment, we’re obviously working through supply chain challenges that come with things coming out of Russia and Ukraine, or not as the case may be. And then, Connor, you got to take a look to – there is going to be some offsetting activity increase to soak up the supply to meet the demand that goes away from potential declines in Russian output. And as you know, that’s not going to be one-for-one in terms of timing. So we are seeing increased activity in North America. You’ve seen increased plans, particularly in the Middle East to invest more to bring more supply to market. So we will see some impacts from that, but there is likely to be a delay versus the impact you see in Russia.\n\nMultiple speakers\n\n[Connor Lynagh] Yes, thanks for all that color. The last portion you were talking about there was my follow-up. So basically, at this point, have you seen any of your major international customers alter plans or accelerate plans or indicate that they are planning to accelerate? Certainly, it seems like there is going to be some loss of Russian oil volumes to the market. I am curious how some of these bigger companies are going to respond to that? [Brian Worrell] Yes. Yes, we are seeing customers talk about increasing their spend plan. I would say particularly, we have seen that in the Middle East and have started to see awards increase. And I think you will start to see some of that flow through here in the second half of the year and into ‘23. Obviously, we talked about the outlook in North America. That’s clearly a reaction to what’s going on in the market and what’s happening in Russia. And look, Lorenzo talked about what we are seeing in TPS orders for the year, and the situation has certainly had an impact on that. And ironically, a little bit Connor, as I look at everything we are seeing right now, ‘23 is shaping up with some pretty good visibility, maybe even a little better than ‘22, because of the volatility right now. But with the backlog that we are building on the back of potentially $8 billion to $9 billion of orders in TPS with some service tailwinds, you saw service orders up in TPS 8% this quarter with strong returns and cash flow, with a lot of operators, I think you are likely to see that continue. And then we talked about what you are seeing in the upstream space. And I talked about that timing disconnect and things coming in later, I think ‘23 is shaping up with pretty good visibility and is looking to be pretty strong based on what we are seeing today. So look, we will manage through the volatility in ‘22, but I think we are positioning things to be able to take advantage of the broader context of things going on in the marketplace across the portfolio.\n\nConnor Joseph Lynagh\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley, Research Division\n\nGot it. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is coming from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.\n\nScott Andrew Gruber\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Citigroup Inc, Research Division\n\nYes. Thanks. So, just building upon Connor’s last question there, it sounds like the visibility into ‘23 is improving. What’s the potential for the international OFS market to actually see an acceleration in spending in ‘23, given the fact that budgets for this year were set before the surge in oil prices? And some additional color, if you will, on longer cycle projects, building in the queue to support growth in ‘23 and beyond.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nYes scot just done. internnational look based on the conversations with our customers, we expect broad based recovery internally with all major geographies, and overall internnational growth in the low tomid-teens. We believe Middle East could be one of the strongest markets in 2022 and is likely in the early stages of a growth cycle as the ocs in the region look to add production capacity on a gradual long term basis- a good outlook going into 2023 as well. We also expect to see another strong year of growth in Latin America, led by Brazil and Mexico, and then, as we go forward, we would expect North Sea and Asia, Pacific todissees a solid growth in 2022 and not a strongest Middle East or Latin America, but solid growth and largely West Africa is also seeing some incremental activity and strong growth as we go forward. I think on the offshore side- you we'd say at a macro level, the trends in the Subsea and offshore markets continue to improve and as you look at our first quarter as well, on an orders perspective, you can see that and the subsea tree and flexible pipe market. We expect to see a solid increase and industry awards this year and see it coming back for the foreseeable future.\n\nMultiple speakers\n\n[Scott Gruber] Got it. And with some of the international operators pulling forward some projects and responding to oil prices, can you provide some color on the pricing trends you are seeing on the international side OFS market? I imagine things are getting better. But do you foresee sufficient momentum there to propel above normal incrementals in ‘23 and continue to expand your margins beyond the 20% threshold? [Lorenzo Simonelli] Scott, generally speaking, we are starting to get good pricing leverage and getting net pricing, particularly in North America, but also in some of the international markets. Right now, it varies by market, but we are having more success and better discussions around higher pricing levels.\n\nBrian Worrell\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nYes. And look, I'd say particularly from an OFS perspective, as the chemicals business recovers, I would expect to see some improvement in incrementals there. And then the only thing I would say, Scott, is we are all dealing with inflation in the market and we are working hard to get surcharges in and price increases in. But that’s something you got to take into consideration as you think about the next 12 months or so.\n\nScott Andrew Gruber\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Citigroup Inc, Research Division\n\nThanks. I appreciate the color.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is coming from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.\n\nArun Jayaram\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nYes. Good morning. You booked Plaquemines, the LNG system this quarter with Venture Global. And I believe Calcasieu Pass was booked in the third quarter of 2019. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the margin potential of this project relative to Calcasieu Pass, and obviously a much more challenging supply chain and inflationary environment, and what are you doing in order to protect your margins from those inflationary pressures?\n\nBrian Worrell\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company",
    "content2": "Yes. Arun, look, we are very pleased that we have gotten the second phase of our work with VG here with Plaquemines. And look, I think it’s fair to assume that margins will be similar to what we saw on Calcasieu. I mean there is a couple of things going on here. Obviously, we have got experience with this type of project with this customer before. So, there are some natural synergies that come through in this project that we didn’t have in the first one. You did mention inflation there. Obviously, we have priced that in and have worked on productivity to help offset that as well. And look, you can imagine as we have said before, when we quote and when we win orders, we go out and we place orders for long lead items. Certainly have a view of what we believe is happening in the market today and what will happen and take the appropriate actions to protect ourselves and the customer from that inflation as much as possible. But look, this is a great order for us. It’s similar to what we did with Calcasieu. And you heard Lorenzo talk about we delivered all these modules ahead of schedule, which was very helpful for VG getting to first cargo in record time. So, our track record here is pretty good, and we are really excited about this space and this order and our partnership with VG.\n\nArun Jayaram\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nGreat. And I just had a follow up. I think you delivered Calcasieu Pass in less than 30 months or so, which is very, very impressive. One of the questions we have been getting from clients just given what’s going on in LNG is this fast LNG concept, which is offshore – either these are generally a third of the size of some of the onshore facilities. But could you talk a little bit about that? Does Baker have a toolkit that can participate in the offshore LNG market? How do you see this playing out? And is this a sandbox you do want to play in?\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nSo Arun, I think you know well, we have capability and capacity to handle many different types of LNG equipment orders at the same time. We've got great capability in our facilities. And as you look at the 30 years we have been in LNG, we have always been looking at new technologies to reduce the cycle time and also to plug-and-play. So, this new modularized approach of fast LNG can be applied both to onshore and offshore. And the number of customer discussions are intensifying around the speed to market. So, I think again, with the technology enhancements we've made, we are well positioned to capture the market here.\n\nArun Jayaram\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen David Gengaro\n\nMD & Senior Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nThanks. Good morning gentlemen. Do you mind going back to your prepared comments on your oilfield services side and some of the changes you have made there. Can you talk about sort of the path to 20% EBITDA margins by the end of the year and maybe with some color around the impact of some of these changes you have made?\n\nMultiple speakers\n\n[Brian Worrell] Yes. Look, so I would say overall, we still feel confident, Stephen, in hitting our margin target rates and getting OFS to a 20% EBITDA margin rate on a consistent basis. And I would say from here, there is a couple of things that should drive margin improvement. The biggest driver will be better profitability in our chemicals business which, as you know, has been squeezed by higher input costs, higher logistics and shipping costs and some raw material shortages. As Lorenzo mentioned, we put in pricing increases and surcharges to help offset that. But chemicals had about 170 basis point drag on OFS margins in the first quarter. So look, normalization of broader logistics and supply chain issues that have disrupted shipment schedules here in the quarter should also help with that. These two issues, if you combine with the volume improvement that we are expecting, should be enough to get us to the 20% level. In addition, we are set to bring on new chemical plants in Singapore and Saudi in ‘22 and ‘23, which will lower the cost for chemicals, get us closer to some of our customers and give us some advantages for our Eastern Hemisphere delivery. We are also continuing to work other productivity initiatives with Maria Claudia and the team, primarily around service delivery, with our remote operations continuing to drive margin improvements there. And we have been executing on supply chain rationalization as well as sourcing from some lower-cost countries, and that’s been part of a multiyear plan. So, we have got a lot of things that we have been working and are continuing to work to get the margin rates to that 20% level. But as I said, sort of broader supply chain and logistics and normalization of the chemicals margins, which we think have troughed here in the first quarter will get us there, and then there should be some icing on top. [Lorenzo Simonelli] And Stephen, just to add, the new organization that we announced is going to improve the speed of decision-making and also be able to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the market. So, it’s very much customer focused and allows us to be more responsive and more comprehensive in our integrated solutions and capture more of the market share of operating costs related to spend. So, it’s what our customers have been asking for, and we are delivering.\n\nStephen David Gengaro\n\nMD & Senior Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nThanks. And as a quick follow-up, on the chemicals – on the supply chain side, I mean clearly, Russia kind of disrupted what looked like, I think stabilization. But what’s your visibility and sort of confidence that things will sort of start to normalize here as you get into the second half of the year?\n\nBrian Worrell\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nYes. Look, I would say we started to see some encouraging signs in the latter part of the fourth quarter as chemical prices started to stabilize and logistics started to look a bit better. But obviously, with everything going on in Russia and the increase in commodity prices that’s created some more headwinds. We have seen stabilization in the broader base chemical space. But I would say where inflation is still tough is in the specialty chemical market. And as I mentioned, we had some unique issues with the supplier who had a facility that was basically shutdown and getting that facility back up and running has taken them a bit longer. So, we have been having to get some alternative supply. That’s starting to normalize as well. So, we should see some recoveries come through. And then look, we have made some changes. We recently changed out leadership in chemicals. We are doing some specific things in supply chain to deal with the current environment. We broadened our sourcing relationships just given what we experienced with this large supplier that we had. We have actually taken a look and have eliminated some products where volumes were low and margins were relatively low to free up the capability to focus on some areas where we make more money and deal with some of the supply chain challenges and focus the team there. And then with the new factories coming on, it’s allowed us an opportunity to take a step back and look at the overall supply base, how we are contracting, and we have made some changes there that we should start to see come through here in the second half. But good visibility to what’s going on there. The team understands it, just working through a little bit of a perfect storm here that seems to be abating.\n\nStephen David Gengaro\n\nMD & Senior Analyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\n\nVery good, Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question coming from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nJ. David Anderson\n\nDirector and Senior North America Oilfield Services & Equipment Analyst, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nHey. Good morning Lorenzo. So, a question on the global push to build out LNG capacity, I had heard anecdotally it was a minimum of 4 years to bring a new train on, start to finish. But you are talking about Plaquemines closer to 29 months, you talk some modular design. Is this the new standard that we should be thinking about these projects? And I guess related to that, is there a limit to how much equipment you can provide in a given year in terms of your manufacturing capacity if these projects are accelerated?\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nYes, Dave. And I think you have to go back to the tenure we have had in the LNG cycle. And we have always said that there is going to be small-scale, mid-scale, large-scale, and we are going to be participating in all of those and also looking at modular as well as stick build. And depending on the customers’ needs, we are going to be providing them. Clearly, the modular is faster to market. It is a plug-and-play model. So, we are seeing increased interest from some of the independent players, and I would say also within North America. Globally with some of the larger projects, they still continue on the stick build. We don’t have a challenge on capacity. Again, we have had big flows of LNG projects in the past, and we feel good about being able to manage it. And our facilities that are set up in Florence and Massa and Avenza in Italy, are well prepared for the LNG project wave.\n\nJ. David Anderson\n\nDirector and Senior North America Oilfield Services & Equipment Analyst, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nSo, if we think about the U.S. build-out of export capacity, what are – are there any other kind of areas where you think there are bottlenecks that need to be freed up? Would you expect most of the awards going forward to be in this modular category? Just curious how you think about that kind of supply. You are just one part of it, of course. So, I am just wondering, looking out the rest of that, are there other areas that are at bottlenecks that could either speed up or slowdown these projects?\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nI think the area that people are looking at and also reacting to is on the EPC side. And that’s one of the areas that I think is a focus right now. I would say also the modular approach reduces some of the dependence on the full aspect of EPCs. And so it’s a faster approach from that perspective. But labor continues to be constrained. And so that’s something that’s being looked at.\n\nJ. David Anderson\n\nDirector and Senior North America Oilfield Services & Equipment Analyst, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division\n\nGood. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question is coming from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nRoger Read\n\nYes. Thank you. Good morning. How are you?\n\nJust a couple of quick questions. The first one is you made the comment about supply chain easing up as the year goes on, and understand chemical is a little different than some of the others. But as we think of some of the pieces that will go into these LNG orders, some of the issues going over in China, is there any risk of that affecting?\n\nMultiple speakers\n\n[Lorenzo Simonelli] Hey Roger, I will go ahead. You cut off there a little bit. But on --  [Roger Read] Sorry. [Lorenzo Simonelli] That’s alright. On supply chain, it tends to be challenging. And obviously, with everything going on in the global geopolitical space, it’s been a little more challenging. But look, I would say from how it impacts us and how we are dealing with it, we are managing the price increases in various metals like copper and steel and nickel. There is no supply issue, it’s just managing through those pricing. And you can imagine that, that’s going into our quotes. And to deal with all of this, we have taken down the timing and validity of our quotes to be able to deal with this. So, customers know what’s going on, and they can have good visibility into what the cost of these projects are going to be. Look, from a castings and forgings standpoint, we are still able to get supply. We are dealing with scarcity in Europe and higher pricing there. So, we are seeing – what we are doing with our customers, our suppliers are doing as well, with quotes are only valid for a shorter period of time given the raw material pricing and the unique energy challenges in Europe. But look, that’s the beauty of being part of a global company like Baker Hughes. I mean we have been able to shift supply into China. We focused on Northwest China to be able to deal with some of the port issues and things we are seeing in COVID. We had really good experience there. We have also moved some supply to Mexico and India. So, we are able to pivot because we have got a large supply base and can direct that demand to different places. So, we feel good about what we are doing there on supply chain. We expect to see some stabilization come through, but have a great sourcing team, working with the projects team to make sure we can fulfill on the demand that we see coming through. From a logistics standpoint, I would say the team has done an outstanding job of managing that. Our inflation we have seen in logistics is well below the headline prices that you have seen. We have changed ports that we are using in North America and China. So, we have been incredibly reactive here. I don’t see it being a big constraint today for the LNG cycle that we are seeing, but that’s something that we will have to watch as it evolves.\n\n[Roger Read] Okay, great. Thanks. And then the follow-up, as we think about just – we had one of your competitors yesterday talk about exceptional tightness in North America. I was just curious your view on availability and – of equipment, labor, et cetera, as we think about the international markets ramping up and at what point you would see significant tightness really helping out on the pricing side there. I understand things should get better as this year goes along, given the guidance, but where we could see things get very, very good on the OFS and OFE sides. [Brian Worrell] Yes. Look, I would say broadly, tightness you are seeing outside of the U.S., it’s similar to what you are seeing inside of North America, some labor tightness around the globe in some markets, not as much as you are seeing in North America. And look, just given the overall increase in activity, you are seeing tightness in supply of equipment. I think we have all got capability or I know we have got capability to ramp up and have been planning on that. But – but look, when you have got demand up as much as you are seeing in North America and globally, general economic tendencies come back into play and you start to see the ability to have more constructive pricing discussions, deal with some of those supply/demand issues. And I would say the international market, as you know, is more longer term contract base versus spot market like you see in North America. Where you see some real opportunity here is on some of that spot business, and I would say we are being very constructive with our customers, taking into account what we are seeing on the supply chain, what we are seeing in overall demand, and it’s a constructive backdrop for OFS at the moment.\n\nRoger Read\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Lorenzo Simonelli for any closing remarks.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Baker Hughes, a GE company\n\nYes. Thank you very much, and thank you to everyone for joining our earnings call today. Just before we end the call, I wanted to leave you with some closing thoughts. Despite some of the challenges this quarter, we are optimistic on the outlook across both of our core business areas and excited about the new energy investments we are making for Baker Hughes. We believe that our upstream oil and gas businesses are poised to capitalize on a strong multiyear recovery, while our industrial businesses are poised to benefit from a strong LNG cycle, growth in new energy orders and the development of our industrial asset management capabilities. While we benefit from these macro tailwinds, we expect to generate strong free cash flow and return 60% to 80% of it back to shareholders. So, thanks for taking the time. We look forward to speaking to you all again soon. And operator, you may close out the call.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating in today’s conference. You may all disconnect.\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\n[music]\n\n[music]\n\nGood day, Ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Baker Hughes company. First quarter 2022 earnings conference call.\n\nAt this time. All participants are in the listen. onlylimode later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructful by that time.\n\nIf anyone should require assing in the conference, Please press bar. Then there are on your touchdown telephone.\n\nAs a min, this conference call being recorded.\n\nI would now like to introduce your host, today's conference.\n\nIs a Jud dailey Vice President of Investor Relations.\n\nSorry may begin.\n\nThank you. Good morning everyone and welcome to the Baker Hughes first quarter 2022 earnings conference call here with me, ER Chairman and CEO lorenza simminineelli, and our cefo Brian ol. The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found at our website at Aker Hughes Com.\n\nAs a reminder, during the course of this conference call we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and a website for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. As you know, reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. With that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nThank you, judd. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Our first quarter results reflect operating in a very volatile market environment during the first few months of 2022. on the positive side, TPS orders were up over 100% year-over-year, with TPS book to Bill of two point two as the LNG order cycle continues to unfoldwe also experienced some challenges in parts of our business due to continued pressures from broader global supply chain constraints that were as some impact from the recent geopolitical events.\n\nAs we look ahead to the rest of 2022 we see a favorable oil and gas price backdrop as well as a dynamic operating environment with perhaps the most challenging supply chain and inflationary environment we have seen in several decades. The recent and unfortunate geopolitical events are amplifying several trends including broad-based inflation and supply pressure for key materials. Commodities and labor dividends are also driving changes on the economic front wherether. While this transitioning from an era of strong economic growth to an environment that is more tenuous and likely to feature diverging economic conditions regionally.\n\nDespite broader political uncertainty around the world, Baker hugh committed to helping deliver energy globally in a safe, clean and reliable manner, while also maintaining our commitment to net zero carbon emissions and leadership in the energy transition.\n\nTo meet the world's energy needs in a responsible manner, we believe multiple years of spending growth will be required, as well as significant increase in LNG infrastructure investment.\n\nWhile there is some near-term risk on the demand side, we expect global oil and gas supply to remain constrained in the coming years, which should support higher commodity prices and multiple years of spending growth from our customers.\n\nRecent geopolitical events have severely constrained what was already a tight global natural gas market and have refocused the world on the importance of energy security, diversity and reliability. As the world reacts to the rapid changes in the global commodity market, governments are prioritizing natural gas and LNG as a key transition and destination fuel.\n\nWe continue to see a focus on prioritizing LNG from stable, lower cost markets and locations that can provide cleaner LNG.\n\nGiven the current LNG price environment and the quickly changing dynamics, we believe that global LNG capacity will likely exceed 800 MTPA by the end of this decade to meet growing demand forecast. This compares to the current global installed base of 460 MTPA and projects under construction totaling almost 150 MTPA.\n\nIn order to be operational by 2030 this additional capacity will need to reach FID by around two million and twenty-five and.\n\nDespite the volatile yet improving medium-term macro environment, Baker Hughes remains focused on executing our strategy and we continue to drive further optimization across the two core business areas of osse and it.\n\nEarlier this year we created climate technology solutions, or CTS, and industrial asset management, or am. The creation of these two groups is critical to accelerating the speed of commercial development across our key growth areas of new energy frontiers and industrials.\n\nWe continue to make steady progress in developing our climate technology solutions capabilities, with recent investments and partnerships in net power, hif global and the acquisition of mosaic materials, which features a promising direct air capture technology. Mosaic's material science and technical expertise, including their unique metal-organic framework technology, provides Baker huuse with the potential to efficiently capture low concentrations of co two across a number of applications.\n\nNet power is an emission-free gas to power technology where Baker Hughes will develop super-critical co two turboic fanders and other critical pumping and compression technology.\n\nWe will also bring system integration and process knowledge experience to a partnership to help accelerate the market positioning and deployment of net powers, emission-free and low-cost electric power.\n\nHf global develops projects in multiple geographies to produce E fuels by blending green hydrogen and Co. twobaker hues is investing alongside eig porsche, amme and gemstone and will provide compressors turbines, pumps.\n\nValves and other technology on future projects.\n\nWe are also discussing how our recently acquired mosaic materials, the AC technology, could be incorporated into these future projects.\n\nOverall we're excited about adding another carbon capture technology to our portfolio and the potential of these two partnerships to open new market opportunities in clean power and low carbon fuel for Baker hu.\n\nIn industrial asset management. We signed an important agreement with exaccenture, cfi and Microsoft to collaborate on the buildout of the am solutions offering. The partnership will focus on creating and deploying Baker use am solutions that use digital technologies to help improve the safety, efficiency and emissions profile of industrial machines, field equipment and other physical assets.\n\nIn addition to advancing our commercial efforts in CTS and iim, we also remain focused on optimizing our broader organizational structure under the core business areas of ose and it.\n\nAt the beginning of April , we took some steps to strengthen and better position oilfield services, to more closely align our products, services and solutions to the life cycle of the well and ultimately, to what our customers require.\n\nOs will move from a product line-oriented structure to a solutions-focused business centered around well construction completions, intervention and measurements, and production solutions.\n\nIn addition to the organizational changes in Os, we were pleased to announce an agreement to acquire alis intervention, a leading international provider of well intervention services and downhold technology. The acquisition complements offto's existing portfolio by enhancing our life of well capabilities, as operators look to improve efficiencies from mature fields.\n\nMaria cloudy and the OFS team are enhancing their operating model to become more competitive, improve the speed of decision-making and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market.\n\nThese organizational changes are important steps in the ifs's journey, as customers are increasingly asking for integrated offerings and more solutions-oriented outcomes, as well as a continuation of the strong productivity improvements in ifs over the past few years.\n\nAs we continue to evolve Baker use across the two business areas of ose and it, we expect more meaningful synergy opportunities between TPS and dss. We are also focused on driving better returns in our ose business as well as ferther synergies between Os and OFE.\n\nNow I'll give you an update on each of our segments.\n\nIn ofield services, activity levels at the start of the year have continued to trend positively in both the international and North American markets. We also see improving visibility for stronger growth in several key areas over the rest of 2020 -two.\n\nIn the international markets. Underlying activity is improving broadly, with particular strength in Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.\n\nThe uncertainty in Russia is an offset.\n\nWe expect growth in most international markets to continue, with the strongest increases likely to come from the Middle East, over the second half of the year and into 2023. producers in the region are in the early stages of investing in capacity expansion and should help drive a multiyear increase in activity across the region.\n\nIn North America, drilling and completion activity continues to move solidly higher, with further increases expected over the course of the year. Although current oil and gas prices would normally suggest a stronger increase in activity, the combination of EMP capital discipline and industry shortages in labor and equipment is likely to keep short-term incremental increases more moderate in nature.\n\nWhile we are pleased with the growth in activity and the growing pipeline of work, in many regions, underlying operations continue to be impacted by supply chain and inflationary pressures and, most recently, disruption to our operations in Russia. Our offs team is working extremely hard to offset these headwinds with price increases, sourcing actions and a global team working to solve logistics constraints.\n\nThe product line that continues to feel the most supply chain-related pressure is our production chemicals business.\n\nWhere we have taken actions to enhance our sourcing and manufacturing functions.\n\nIn addition to recently enacting a supply surcharge and changing out some of the leadership in our chemicals business, we are also taking steps to source and produce chemicals closer to key demand hubs, with the opening of our production chemicals facility in Singapore later this year and the recently announced JV with dussaw in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs we look over the balance of the year, we remain committed to achieving a 20% EBITDA margin by the fourth quarter.\n\nMoving to TPS, the first quarter represented a continuation of the successes we achieved in 2021. ppps orders totaled $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, driven again by strong orders in LNG.\n\nWe believe that we are at the beginning of another constructive LNG cycle, which is being expedited by the current geopolitical situation, particularly for U's LNG projects.\n\nOur positive long-term view is also supported by the recent improvements in policy sentiment in certaind parts of the world towards natural gas role within the energy transition.\n\nThe recent EU taxonomy changes to now include natural gas as a transition fuel as an example of this, and the added need to diversify and provide energy security will likely intensify policy efforts.\n\nAs these market dynamics play out, a number of projects should accelerate and we now believe that 100 to 100 and fifty mtba of lngfids will be authorized over the next two years, with additional FIDs becoming more likely in 2020 -four and 2020 -five.\n\nGiven the strong TPS orders performance in the first quarter, as well as the acceleration in timing for several LNG projects, we now expect TPS orders to increase in 2022 versus 2021.\n\nDuring the first quarter we were pleased to be awarded a major order to provide an LNG system for the first phase of venture globales plhaman's LNG project.\n\nWe will be providing 24 modle ized compression trains for the first phase of the project and this award is part of our 70 ntpa master equipment supply agreement.\n\nThe highly efficient liquefaction train system is modorized, helping to lower construction and operational costs with a plug-and-play approach that enables faster installation and first cargo.\n\nThis important order builds on an award in the fourth quarter of 2021 for power generation and the electrical distribution equipment for the comprehensive power Island system for the platquinenss project.\n\nThe plmman's order follows a similar contract for V G's calkashe pass LNG terminal in 2019. in 2021, bakyhu' successfully completed delivery of the ninth and final block for calkashe pass. All shipments were finalized ahead of schedule, an excellent achievement by our team. calkashe pass holds the global record for the fastest construction of a large-scale green field LNG project, moving from FID to first LNG in 2009 months.\n\nOutside of LNG we booked an award for Nova ltt 16 turbines which will run on 100% hydrogen for air products. New net zero blue hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nOur collaboration with our products will be critical for a net zero future, and this order follows the award we received for advanced compression technology for the neon-carbon-free green hydrogen project.\n\nWe were also pleased to be awarded a contract by terut to supply gas turbines and compressors that can run on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen for a new compression station for the Greek natural gas transmission system.\n\nBaker hugh will provide free compression trains deploying our novlt 12 hydrogen-ready gas turbines and pcl compressors with the capability to transport up to 10% hydrogen for this project.\n\nThe project directly supports the EU's hydrogen and strategy goals to accelerate the development of clean hydrogen and sure its role as a cornerstone of a climate neutral energy system by two thousand and fifty.\n\nThese latest hydrogen orders build on Baker us's extensive experience in developing and supplying turbomachinery equipment to compress transport and utilizede hydrogen.\n\nNext nor field equipment. We are encouraged to see improving demand trends across the different business areas. Although recent world events impacted first quarter results, we remain disappointed with the overall level of profitability.\n\nAt a macro level, trends in the Subsea and offshore markets continue to improvein the subsea tree and flexible pipe market we expect a solid increase in industry awards this year as a firm commodity price outlook supports a growing pipeline of deepwater up opportunities in core markets.\n\nIn our international wellhead business. We also see a positive order outlook across multiple regions, and particularly in the Middle East.\n\nIn the first quarter we awarded a contract in Asia to provide subsea wellheads and subsea production systems plus-related services, including 12 subsea trees for a deepwater gas field.\n\nWe also achieved our first award in Ivory Coast, where we will supply subsea trees, flexible flow lines and rises to develop the valing deepwater oilfield.\n\nIn Latin America, we were pleased to build on our flexible pipe business success, securing awards for flexible pipe systems and services that will be deployed across a number of key post-sal revitalization programs, enabling increased oil recovery and extending the life of multiple Subsea developments.\n\nFinally in digital solutions, order activity remains solid, with growth across our industrial end markets, as well as improvement in the oil and gas markets.\n\nDs continued to be affected by supply chain challenges and electronic shortages, as well as continued inflationary pressures. The team is working tirelessly to manage the situation and navigate the evolving supply chain issues that have been as aspirated by recent events.\n\nIn the first quarter we made a number of changes in the DS business as we look to improve the overall performance.\n\nWe unified our unique sensor business units- Panametrics router, Stokes and drug- under the one product line: Precision sensors and instrumentation, or psi. As a combined business, psi will better support potential investment opportunities crucial for the future development and help optimize the unique technology and commercial requirements of each brand. Unifying the businesses will also help drive better cost and operational performance.\n\nWhile we recognize that there is still more work to do, we also continue to make key personnel and operational changes across ES to drive performance, profitability and return improvements and to ensure that we have the right team in place to take this business forward.\n\nDuring the quarter, bentin Nevada secured an important contract with a refiner in Brazil. Our arms reliability one PM solution will support the customers's operations by providing visibility on over one thousand assets.\n\nWe will be providing optimal digital strategies to support asset integrity and availability, which will lead to maintenance cost optimization and effectively enable risk management, while delivering enhanced performance.\n\nDespite some of the challenges this quarter, we are optimistic on the outlook across both of our core business areas and excited about the new energy investments we are making for bor hu.\n\nWe believe that we are well positioned to benefit from an extended cyclical recovery in oversse and longer-term structural growth trends in LNG, new energy and industrial asset management.\n\nImportantly, we expect to generate strong free cash flow as the cycle plays out and remain committed to returning the majority of it back to shareholders.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to brri.\n\nThanks Lorenzo. I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details.\n\nOrders for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% sequentially, driven by OFE and TPS, partially offset by a decrease in digital solutions and Os. Year-over-year orders were up 51%, driven by increases across all four segments.\n\nWe are particularly pleased with the orders' performance in the quarter, especially in TPS. Following a strong orders' performance in the fourth quarterremaining performance obligation was $25.8 billion, up 10% sequentially.\n\nEquipment RPO ended at $9.9 billion, up 20% sequentially. And services RPO ended at $15.9 billion- of 4% sequentially.\n\nOur total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was one point four and our equipment book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was one point nine.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, down 12% sequentially, with declines in all fourre segments.\n\nYear-over-year revenue was up 1%, driven by increases in Os and digital solutions, partially offset by decreases in OFE and TPS.\n\nOperating income for the quarter was $279 million. Adjusted operating income was $348 million, which excludes $7 million of restructuring, separation and other charges.\n\nAdjusted operating income was down 39% sequentially and up 29% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 7%, down 320 basis points sequentially.\n\nYear-over-year, our adjusted operating income rate was up 160 basis points.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $625 million, down 26% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rate was 13% of 120 basis points year-over-year.\n\nAs I will expand in a moment. Our adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA margin rates were impacted by geopolitical events as well as broader global supply chain challenges.\n\nCorporate costs were $105 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect corporate costs to be roughly flat compared to the first quarter.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $277 million in the quarter. For the second quarter we expect DNA to be slightly up compared to first quarter levels.\n\nNet interest expense was $64 million.\n\nIncome tax expense in the quarter was $107 million.\n\nGaap diluted earnings per share was eight cents. Included in GAAP diluted earnings per share is an $85 million gain from the net change in fair value of our investment in adnot drilling and a $74 million loss from the net change in fair value of our investment in C three AI. Both are recorded in other nonoperating loss.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share were 15 cents.\n\nTurning to the cash flow statement, free cash flow in the quarter was negative $105 million.\n\nFree cash flow in the quarter was impacted by lower collections from a select number of international customers, which are largely timing related, as well as a build-in inventory as we get ready to execute on our large order backlog.\n\nFor the second quarter, we expect free cash flow to improve sequentially, primarily driven by higher earnings and stronger collections.\n\nWe continue to expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA to be around 50% for the year, but anticipate the majority of our free cash flow to be generated over the second half of 2020 -two.\n\nThe quarterly progression should be more in line with what we experienced during 2018 and two thousand and nineteen and.\n\nIn the first quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase program, repurchasing eight point one million Baker hugh Class a shares for $236 million at an average price of just under $29 per share.\n\nAs of March, thirty-first GE's ownership of Baker Hughes Class B shares represented 4% of the total company, down from just over 11% at the end of 2021.\n\nGe's overall ownership of Class a and Class B shares was 11% at the end of the first quarter, down from 16% at the end of 2021.\n\nBefore I go into the segment results, I will comment on the current situation in Russia and how it currently factors into our broader outlook.\n\nRussia represented roughly 4% of total company revenue in the first quarter and we recently announced that we have halted all new investment in the country.\n\nAdditionally, sanctions from the U's U K and the EU continue to evolve and are making ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more difficult.\n\nAs a result, we expect erosion of our russia-related revenues over the course of 2022, particularly in Os. However, the pace and magnitude of this is difficult to predict, given the dynamic nature of the situation. Therefore, there is a range of possible outcomes we are preparing for across our product companies.\n\nOn broader supply chain. While we did see some areas stabilize in the first quarter, there continues to be pressure on electronics, challenges in logistics and an evolving understanding of implications due to global and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nWe remain focused on being adaptable to deliver for our customers and on our commitments.\n\nNow I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward.\n\nIn oilfield services, the team delivered a solid quarter despite some of the global challenges. Os revenue and the quarter was $2.5 billion, down 3% sequentially. International revenue was down 7% sequentially, led by declines in the North Sea Russia Caspian, the Middle East and Latin America. North America revenue increased 6% sequentially, with solid growth in both North America land and offshore.\n\nOperating income in the quarter was $221 million, down 14% sequentially.\n\nOperating margin rate was 9%, with margins declining 110 basis points sequentially driven by lower volume, less favorable mix and continued inflationary pressure in the chemicals business.\n\nYear-over-year margins were up 230 basis points.\n\nAs we look ahead to the second quarter, underlying macro fundamentals continue to improve and we expect to see strong growth in growth, international and North American activity, as well as improvement in pricing. This is likely to be partially offset by weakness in Russia.\n\nWe estimate that our second quarter revenue should increase sequentially in the mid- to high single-digit range. With this revenue framework, we would expect our margins to increase by approximately 100 to 200 basis points sequentially.\n\nFor the full year 2022, we see an improving outlook across most major markets, which is partially tempered by global supply chain and geopolitical factors.\n\nIn the international market. We expect the continuation of a broad-based recovery, with industry-wide activity growth in the low to mid-double digits.\n\nIn North .america, we expect continued activity increases, with the broader market set to experience strong growth in excess of 40%, and.\n\nGiven this macro backdrop and some of the headwind considerations I noted earlier, we would expect Os revenue to increase in the low to mid-double digits. The largest variable to this range is the number of potential outcomes in Russia.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, we still expect margin rates to increase throughout the year and continue to target 20% EBITDA margins by the fourth quarter.\n\nMoving to oilfield equipment, orders for the quarter were $739 million, an increase of over 100%, were 394 million year-over-year.\n\nThe strong orders. Performance was driven by sp, supported by a large subsea tree contract in Asia, along with growth in flexibles, surface pressure control and services.\n\nAs a reminder, we removed Subsea drilling systems from consolidated OFE operations when we completed the merger with MH worth in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nRevenue was $528 million, down 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by sp, SPC and the removal of DS, partially offset by growth in services and flexibles.\n\nOperating loss was $8 million down $12 million year-over-year, primarily driven by lower volume in the quarter. ose's lower revenue and operating margin in the quarter were driven by lower equipment backlog conversion in sp.\n\nFor the second quarter we anticipate revenue to be approximately flat to up mid-single digits sequentially, depending on the timing of backlog conversion. We expect operating income to be around breakeven or slightly positive.\n\nFor the full year 2022, we expect to recovery in offshore activity and project awards, which should help drive a solid increase in orders when adjusting for the removal ofds.\n\nWe expect oe revenue to decline double digits, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of DS, and oe margin rate to be in the low single-digit range.\n\nNext I will cover turbine machinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution.\n\nOrders in the quarter were $3 billion of $1.6 billion year-over-year, a new quarterly record for TPS equipment orders were up $1.5 billion year-over-year, driven by a significant award to provide an LNG system for the first phase of vg's plmen's LNG project in North America.\n\nService orders in the quarter were up 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in contractual and transactional services, partially offset by lower order volumes in upgrades.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $1.3 billion, down 9% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was down 26%, driven by timing of project execution.\n\nServices revenue was up 6% year-over-year, driven by higher volume in upgrades, pumps and valves.\n\nOperating income for TPS was $226 million up 9% year-over-year. Operating margin was 17% up 280 basis points year-over-year.\n\nMargin rates in the first quarter were favorably impacted by higher services mix and strong cost productivity, especially on projects at or near completion.\n\nFor the second quarter we expect revenue to be flat to up mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher equipment volume from planned backlog conversion.\n\nWith this revenue outlook, we expect TPS margin rates to be roughly flat to slightly higher versus the second quarter of 2021, depending on the ultimate mix between equipment and services.\n\nFor the full year we expect strong growth in TPS orders versus 2021, driven by increasing LNG awards. We also continue to see a solid pipeline in our onshore offshore production segment, along with opportunities in pumps, valves and new energy areas.\n\nWhile we expect very strong growth in orders, revenue growth should likely range between high single digits to low double digits.\n\nOn the margin side, we continue to expect operating income margin rates to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2022, depending on the mix between services and equipment.\n\nAs we mentioned last quarter. Included in this framework is an expected increase in investments and rnd expenses that relate to our new energy and industrial growth areas.\n\nFinally in digital solutions, orders for the quarter were $567 million, up 3% year-over-year. Ds continues to see a strengthening market outlook and delivered growth in orders across most end markets.\n\nSequentially, orders were down 6%, driven by typical seasonality.\n\nRevenue for the quarter was $474 million of 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher volumes in Precision sensors and instrumentation and way gate, partially offset by lower volume in ppps, Nexus controls and bentling Nevada.\n\nSequentially, revenue was down 15%, driven by typical seasonality and challenges in the global environment, particularly supply chain.\n\nOperating income for the quarter was $15 million, down 38% year-over-year, largely driven by headwinds from electronics shortages, some cost inflation and COVID-19 related lockdowns in chinasequentially, operating income was down 71%, driven by lower volume.\n\nFor the second quarter. We expect to see strong sequential revenue growth and operating margin rates back into the mid-single digits for the full year, following five quarters in a row of positive book. To Bill, we expect solid DS revenue growth as supply chain constraints begin to ease over the second half of the year and backlog conversion improves with higher volumes. We expect to see strong improvements in DS margins which should approach high single digits for the total year.\n\nOverall we have navigated a volatile environment during the quarter, delivering strong orders across the company and positioning to execute on our record backlog. Despite very troubling and challenging geopolitical events and broadly stressed global supply chains, we are confident in our ability to adapt and execute as the rest of the year unfolds. With that, I will turn the call back over to judd.\n\nThanks Brian operator. Let's open the call for questions.\n\nThank you, Ladies and gentlemen, if you have question at this time, Please press the sp and the one key on your touchdown te.\n\nPhone if your question has been answered.\n\nWisdom of yourself from the.\n\nPlease brress the pound key.\n\nIn the consideration of time. We as that you please limit yourself to one.\n\nQuestion and one related follow-up.\n\nNo first question.\n\nAnd coming from the lineup James West.\n\nwh ever quires I a lot of open.\n\nHey good morning. The rena grrime eight tings.\n\nSo there yes, some more detail on the LNG outlook. But I was wondering if you get a littlemore more color from your conversations, specifically with with customers, as things have clearly changed pretty dramatically in the last interon weeks as LNGs come into focus here, And if you could maybe provide us what they're saying, what their urgency level is, kind of just a little more detail on how those conversations are going and how accelerated this build-out cycle could be.\n\nSure James, and having it's clear the unfolding situation in Europe definitely accelerated the pace of discussions on the next wave of lnerg projects aiming to take F? Id. You know we've already started C market momentum pick up in 2021 as country, set net zero targets and also started to realize the role of natural gas and what it would play in energy transition. Now I'd say we're arguably in the early stages in work could be a multi year reorganizing of the global energy system and with that it will take time for the lnergy landscape to evolve. And, based on the discussions with customers, we see a significant step up in a number of customers looking to take earlier F ID. Would also increase long term supply agreements. We now expect 10.15 thousand M T P a to take F ID D overthe next two years, with the potential of more F ID in 24 and 2: 25. as you know, a lot of these projects are in the? U's, So this U's should be a big, better fishery at these redrawings of the global energy map. But also, as we look at other places such as East Middle East, Mexico and also Asia, we're seeing increasing interest from customers. I think we're very well positioned with some interesting concepts around flexibility and also speed to market and with our highly efficient moderorized refleion train system, which again was emfilized in V? G. we're helping to lower construction and operational costs with the plug and player approach that enables faster installation. So, feeling good about the lenergy outlook for the number of years.",
    "content3": "Sure no, no about that. Thanks for that. Learned though, and then maybe just a quick follow-up for me. You made this investment in April - a few, we see, or we could go with hhif global to expand, I think, E fuels. Could you maybe comment on what exactly is going on there, what that market looks like, how you see that, that plan out?\n\nYes James and F is a great opportunity and we're pleased to be involved with this customer, and it's another example of how collaboration can really help to drive the energy transition. hif global develops projects to produce E fuels by blending green hydrogen and co 2, and we've invested alongside amme EI, pors and gemstone, great partners, to really help F continue to develop carbon neutral E fuel projects in the United States, Chile and Australia with the small minority. Investment in this equity round will be providing compressors turbines pumps, valilves and another technology on future projects. And I think what's interesting here is again, as you look at electricity based fuels or E fuels. Their clean, carbon neutral fuels produce from renewable green hydrogen and carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere and they can be used by existing cars and trucks without any modification to the engines, and E fuels require no new infrastructure, transportation or filling stations. So a good opportunity and an expanding market for us.\n\nGot thanks for it.\n\nOur next question, coming from the line of Jason mvilield: withod Bank of America you want is open.\n\nyeah good morning everyone. 18 I trust.\n\nbro there was a- I guess, kind of a following question on James, you know, question around LNG and you know obviously you've taken up your guidance for LNG CY, for tpss orders, this here based on a strong LNG, So you've been guiding flat. You know now you expect kind of strong order growth momentum. So I don't know if you, if you'd want to, of quantify, you know what strong means and then you know we kind of all understand, you know what's happening in LNG and accelerated growth opportunities here. But maybe a step back a little bit and talk about, you know, your upstream, ownshore offshore order opportunities, because it ultimately looks like the base orders related to kind of some of lllenshore offshore stuff is taken a step higher as well.\n\nYes chaseon, TPS. Again we're seeing a continued order momentum that we saw start at the end of 21 and it's really accelerated in two twenty 2, primarily driven by LNG. Also the new energy opportunities, even though there'are smaller in nature, But when you look at you the LNG projects that are moving forward, as I mentioned before, and you think about the likely timing, it could translate in an order number of for T PS of eight to $9 billion in 2020 two and importantly, based on customer discussions, we'd expect our order levels to remain elevated in two and thousand and twenty three as well. As you can see, a lot of this on the LNG projects is a pull forward and also strong long term LNG fundamentals and we also see a continued traction in the new energy space and, as you saw again in the first quarter we booked some awards on the new ener space and we're still at the upper end of 100 to two hundred range as we continue to see new energy orders in 2020 two\n\nOkay right, that's helpful. They're nice to strong. Orders are going to continue in the 2: 23 for P's. The follow-up is really. Obviously the Russia euk conflict is causing Europe , and in other countries, to focus on energy security. Obviously this is positive, the LNG front- But what does it ultimately mean for the energy transition? Do you think that it actually slows the pace of adoption? Does it speed it up like? What does it mean for energy transition?\n\nYes So said, a question that many opposing them. I think the focus right now, in the near term, has switched to energy security, reliability and diversity, but we don't believe that sustainability goes away. In fact, if you look at some of the policies, even introduced in Germany, their twoythousand and 35 energy plans- still continues the focus on sustainability. We think the current environment will actually accelerate clean energy initiatives, particularly for fuels like hydrogen, which E? U is making a large part of its long term energy PL. What we're seeing from the current situation is that you cannot become to reliant on one country or one source of energy. So diversity of supply is critical and we think that pragmatism has come back into this discussion and the role of energy, not just for renewables but also, as we've mentioned before, gas playing a key critical role given the elevated commodity prices. Number of major oil companies and N? O C's are going to report good profits and free cash flow. We think they'll use this to continue actually developing, accelerating their carbon carbonization plans as well as healthy shareholder returns, and you can see that also with an example like a ramco with its CapEx plans. That includes significant hydrogen. So know, we think bacer use is very well positioned then, with gas L N G hydrogen C, C? U's oil and pipelines, and we've got the technologies that are going to continue to drive this transition.\n\nAll right perfect thanks, lindzo.\n\nThanks.\n\nOur next question, coming from the line of connell and esestwood, Morgan Stanley LL, let us open.\n\nYes's, I was something. Maybe we could ttalkck a little bit more about Russia, So just wanted to understand. First off, the data point on the 4% of revenues: is that already fully accounting for any riuble depreciation impacts? And so is what you're basically guid to. Actual activity declines. And I'm curious further to that.\n\nIs it at this point you have received notification from your customers that your activity will decline, or is that just your expectation based on what you're seeing in the market?\n\nCon to hit the first part. This does, you know, include the impact of what was going on. You know, with the ruble And as you know that' that's been down and up again and is relatively stable at this point in time and you know you, it represented roughly about 4% of revenues in the first quarter. And look, I'd say, in terms of how we're thinking about it, you know, for the full year you got to take a step back and know, realize that sanctions from U's U, K and E? U continue to evolve and are evolving and are making ongoing operations increasingly complex and and a bit more difficult. And kind of, to give you some perspective on the first quarter, we did see decremental impact on ebitd. About the same level on EBIT does the as Russia represented in terms of revenue of the total company and and it was really driven from, you know, lower volumes, from not being able to move people and assets into the country. I'd say there're also some logistical delays and delivery challenges which largely impacted o F? E in both equipment and and services. And then we also saw some logical delays and delivery challenges in T P's, primarily in services, as well. So those were the two areas that we saw the most significant impact: the quarter from Russia. And if you take a st back and look at what we talked about going forward and kind of the framework that we tried to provide you for the year, we did contemplate everything that we know today and the anticipation that things are going to continue to evolve there. So So, based on what we talked about, terms of the revenue outlook for o F's, you know, low to mid double digits. The low end really assumes that our o F's Russia operation declines over the course of the year to basically and material level, So by the end of the year really really low there are. We do have inventory in the country but you know, given the sanctions, are unable to import key technologies for some of the services. So there will be a drop off over the course of the year, barring something on perscseen, and there will be some impact in T P's associated with that. But look as as we get more clarity on the situation, will clearly react and take the appropriate cost actctions to offsetting the declines and volume which we also included in the framework that we proved you. And then you know, as you think about Russia and the impact on, you know, global environment 'reviously working through supply chain challenges that you know come with things coming out of Russia and ukraine- or not, as the case maybe- and then con you got to takea look to there's going tobesome offsetting activity increase to soak up the supply, you know, to meet the demand that goes away from. You know, potential declines and rsian output and, as you know, that's not going to be one for one in terms of timing. So we are seeing creased activity in North America. You you've seening increased plans, particularly in the Middle East: invest more to, you know, bring more supply to market. So we will see some impacts from that, but there's likely to be a delay versus the impact you see in Russia.\n\nYes thanks for all that. The last portion you were talking about there was was my follow up. So basically, at this point, have you seen any of your major international customers alter plans or accelerate plans or indicate that they're planning to accelerate? Certainly it seems like there is going to be some loss of Russian oil volumes to the market and curious how some of these bigger companies going to respond to thatyes, you know yes, we are seeing customers talked about increincreasing there, increasing their spend plan. I'd say particularly we've seen that in the Middle East and it started to seeawards increase and I think'll tosee some of that flow through here in the second half of the year and into into 23. obviously we talked about the outlook in North America. That's clearly reaction to what's going on in the market, what's happening in rushsi and look, you know Lorenzo talked about what we're seeing in T P's orders. You know for the year and the situation has current certainly had an impact on that and ironically, a little bit Connor, as I look at you know everything we're seeing right now, 23 is is shaping up with some pretty good visibility. You know, maybe even a littlebetter than 22 because the volatility right now. But you know, you know with the backlog that we're building on the backup potially eight to $9 billion of orders and T P's with some service tailwind. You saw service orders up in T P's 8% this quarder with strong returns and cash flow with a lot of operators. I think you're likely to see see that continue. And then you know we talked about what you're seeing in the upstream space and, and I talked about that timing disconnect and things coming in later, I think 23 is is shaping up with pretty good visibility and is looking to be pretty strong based on on what we're seeing today. So local manage through the volatility in 22. But I I think we're positioning things to be able to to take advantage of the broader context of things going on in the marketplace across the portfolio.\n\nGot it. Thanks very much.\n\nNow next question. Com from a lot of thought group, I would see the group you us open.\n\nYes for just building upon Connor's last question. There it sounds like the visibility in 23 is improving. What's the potential for the international OFS market? It's actually seen an acceleration and spending 23, given the fact that budgets for this year were set before the surgeon oil prices and some additional color, if you will on you a longer cycle projects building, building in the queue to support growth in in 23 and beyond.\n\nyesscot just done. internnational look based on the conversations with our customers, we expect broad based recovery internally with all major geographies, an overall internnational growth in the low tomid-teens. We believe Middle East could be one of the strongest markets in two and twenty two and is likely in the early stages of a growth cycle as the ocs in the region look to add production capacity on a gradual long term basis- a good outlook going into 2020 three as well. We also expect to see another strong year of growth in Latin America, led by Brazil and Mexico, and then, as we go forward we would expect North Sea and Asia, Pacific todisseease a solid growth in 2020 two and not a strongest Middle East or Latin America, but solid growth and largely West Africa is also seeing some incremental activity and strong growth as we go forward. I think on the offshore side, we'd say at a macro level, the trends in the Subsea and offshore markets continue to improve and as you look at our first quarter as well, on an orders perspective you can see that and the subsea tree and flexible pipe market. We expect to see a solid increase and industry awards this year and see it coming back for the foreseeable future.\n\nGot and with some of the international operators point forward some projects and responding to oil prices, you providide some color on the pricing trends you're seeing on the international side of Os market. imagagine things are getting better, but do you foresee sufficient momentum there to propel above normal incrementals in 23 and continue to expand your margins? Know beyond the 20% thcial? it'sgott, generally speaking, with starting to get good pricing leverage and getting net pricing, particularly in North America but also some of the international markets. Right now it varies by market but we're having more success and better discussions around higher pricing levels.\n\nyeah and look, I'd say particularly, you know, from an o's perspective, as the chemicals business recovers, I would expect to see some improvement in incrementinals there. And then, you know, the only thing I wouldsay: it's got. You know we're all dealing with inflation in the market and and you know we're working hard to get surcharges in and price increases in. But that's something you ve gotTa take into sideration as you think about the next, you know, 12 months or so.\n\nThanks for shaate the code.\n\nNo next question coming from the line up.\n\nA ruined gyram with J P Morgan chase you'll. Lot is open.\n\nGood morning. You book platamus, the LNG system, this quarter with venture global and I believe calasssu pass was was booked in the third quarter of 2019. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the margin potential of this project relative to calus su pass and obviously a much more challenging supply chain in the flationary environment, and what are you doing in order to protect your margins from those inflationary pressures?\n\nyeah look, we we're very pleased that you know we've got in the second phase of you know our work with V G here, with with plaammans ight. Look, I think it's fair to assume that you know margins will be similar to what we saw on calc. I mean, there's a there's a couple of things going on here. Obviously we've got experience with this type of project with this customer before, So there's some natural synergies that come through and this project that we didn't have in in the you know the first one you did mention inflation there. Obviously we- we priceed that in and you know' have worked on productivity to to help offset that as well. And look, you can imagine, as we've said before, know when we you know when we quote and when we win orders we go out and we place, you know, orders for a long lead items, certainly have a view of what we believe is happening in the market today and what will happen and take the appropriate actions to to protect ourselves and the customer from that inflation as as much as possible. But look, there's a great order for us. You know's similar to what we did with calc and you heard lrenzo talk about. You know we delivered all these modules ahead of schedule, which was very helpful for you know V G getting to first cargo and in record time. So our track record here is pretty good and and we're really excited about this, this space and this order and our, our partnership with the G.\n\nGreat and I just had a follow up. I think you deliver calcus, you pass and lessen than 30 months or so, which is very, very impressive. one of the questions we've been getting from clients is given up. What's going on in LNG is this fast LNG concept which is offshore? These are generally a third of the size of some of the the onshore facilities, but could you talk a little bit about that does? Does Baker have it a toolkit that can participate in the offshore LNG market? How do you see this playing out and is this a Sandbox? You don't want to play plan.\n\nSo I think well, we have capability and capacity to handle many different types of LNG equipment orders. At the same time, we've got great capability in our facilities and as you look at the 30 years we've been in LNG, we've always been looking at new technologies to reduce the cycle time and also to plug in play. So this new modernized approach of fast LNG can be applied both to onshore and offshore, and the number of customer discussions are intensifying around this speed to market. So I think again, with the technology enhancements we've made, we're well positioned to capture the market here.\n\nGreat Thanks a lot.\n\nOur next question, coming from the line of stevensonjar with st, want us open?\n\nThanks good morning gentlemen. ning ning, can you you going back to your prepared comments on the oilfield services side and some of the changes you've made there, can you talk about sort of the path to 20% EBITDA margins by the end of the year and maybe with some color around the impact, some of these changes you've made?\n\nYes you know, look So say overall we still feel confident even in and hitting our margin arget rates, getting F's to a 20% EBITDA marg rate, you know, on a consistent basis. And I'd say from here, you know there's a couple things that should drive mar margin improvement. The biggest driver will be better profitability in our cheicals business which is, you know, is been squeezed by higher input costs, higher logistics and shipping costs and some raw material shortages. You know, as lorenza mentioned, we've put in pricing increases and surcharges to help offset that. You know chemicals had about 170 basis point drag on o F's margins in the first quarter, know. So you know, normalization of broader logistics and supply chain issues that have disrupted shipment schedules, you know here in the quarter should also should also help with with that these two issues if you you know, combined with the volume improvement that we're we're expecting should be enough to get us to the the 20% level. In addition, you know we're set to bring on new chemical plants and Singapore and Saudi and 20, two and 20, three which are lower the cost for chemicalses, get us closer to some of our customers and give us some advantages for our Eastern Hemisphere delivery. You we're also continuing to work other productivityinitiatives with Maria cloudy in the team, primarily around service delivery with our remote operation continuing to drive margin improvements there and we have been executing on, you know, supply chain rationalization as well. As you know, sourcing from some lower cost countries that that's been partofa multiyear PL. So we've got a lot of things that we have been working and are continuing to work to get marg rates to that 20% level. As I said you, sort of broader supply chain and logistics and normalization of the chemicals margins which we think have trough here in the first quarter will will get us there and there should be some isicing on top and Stephen. Just to add the new organization that we announced. It's going to improve the speed of decision making and also be able to capitalize on the growth opportunities in the market. So it's very much custommer of focus and allows us to be more responsive and more comprehensive in integrated solutions and capture more of the market share of operatinging cost related to spend. So it's what our customers have been asking for. And we're deliing.\n\nAnd as a quick follow-up on the chemicals on the supply chain side and mean mean clearly Russia kind of disrupted what looked like, I think, a stabilization. But what's your visibility and sort of confidence that things will sort of start to normalize here as you get into the second half of the year?\n\nyeah look, I'd say, you know we started to see some encouraging signs and you know, in the latter part of the fourth quarter, as you know, chemical prices started to stabilize and logistics started to look a bit better. But obviously with everything going on in Russia and the increase in and commodity prices that that's created some more headwinds. We have seen stabilization in the broader you know base chemical spase But I'd say where're inflation is still toughes in the specialty chemical market and you know, as I mentioned, we had some unique issues with the lier who had a facility that was basically shut down and getting that facility back up and running has Ta them a bit longer. So we've been having to get some alternative supply that starting to normalize as well. So we should see some, some recoveries come through and then look, we've made some. We've made some changes. We recently changed out leadership and chemicals. We're doing some specific things and supply chain to deal with the current environment. We broadened our sourcing relationships, just given what we experience with this large supplier that we had. We've actually Ta a look and have eliminated some products where you know volumes were low and margins were relatively low, to free up the capability to focus on some areas where we make more money and deal with some of the supply chain challenges and focus the team there. And then, you know, with the new factories coming on, it's allowed us an opportunity to take a step back and look at the overall supply base, how we're contracting and we've made some changes there that we should start to see come through here in the second half. But you know, good visibility to what's what's going on there, the team understands it just working through. You know, a little bit of a perfect storm here that seems to be abating.\n\nVery good, Thank you.\n\nAnd our next question coming from the lineup David Anderson with Berkeley if you let us open.\n\nGood morning Lorenzo. So question: a global push to build out LNG capacity. I have heard ancability was a minimum of four years to.\n\nBring new train on tostart to finish your time talking main in closer to 29 months. Its modular design. Is this the new sstandard that we should be thinking about? These projects and I guess related to that, is there a limit to how much equipment you can provide a given year in terms of your manufacturing capacity if these projects are accelerate?\n\nYes Dave, then I think you have to go back to the tenure we've had in the LNG cycle and we've always said that there's going to be small scale, mid scale, large scale and we're going to be participating in all of those and also looking at modular as well as stick bubuild and, depending on the customers' needs, we're going to be providing them. Clearly, the modular is a faster the market. It is a plug-and play model. So we're seeing increased interest from some of the independent players and I'd say also within North America, globally with some of the larger projects. They still continue. On the stick bubuild, we don't have a challenge on capacity. Again, we've had big flows of LNG projects in the past and we feel good about being able to manage it and our facilities that are set up in florence and masass and events in Italy well prepared for the LNG project wave.\n\nSo if we think about the? U's buildout or export capacity, what are? Are there any other kind of areas where you think there are bottlenecks that need to be freed up and would you expect most of the awards going forward to in this modular category? Just curious how you think about that kind of supply. You're just one part of it, of course. I'm just wondering, looking out the rest of that, are there other areas that are at bottlenecks that could eitherto speed up or slow down these projects?\n\nI think the area that people are looking at and also reacting to is on the EPC side, and that's one of the areas that I think it's a focus right now. I'd say also, the moduular approach reduces some of the dependence on the full aspect of epcs, And so it's a faster approach from that respectctive, but labor continues to be constrained, And so that's something that's being looked at.\n\nOk Thank you.\n\nA next question coming from the line of Roger Reed.\n\nWith monte' bargo, you'll on to sopen.\n\nyeah Thank you. Good morning. How are you a Roger?\n\nJust a couple of quick questions. The first 1: as you made the comment about supply chain easing up as a year goes on and understand chemicalsis a little different than some of the others, But as we think of some of the pieces that will go into these LNG orers some of the issues going over in china- is there any risk of that affecting?\n\nve ahead. You cut a little bit but you know, on on that's all right. On supply chain, it tends to be, you know, challenging and obviously with everything going on in the global, you know, geo political space, it's been, youit's been, a little more challenge. But look, ID say, from how it, how it impacts us and how we're dealing with it. We're managing, you know, the price increases in various metals like copper and steal and nickel. There's there's no supply issues, just managing through those pricing. And you can imagine that that's going into our quotes. And to deal with all of this we have taken down you know timing and validity of our quotes to be able to to deal with this. So So customers know what's going on and we can have good visibility into what the cost of these projects are going to be. Look, from casting and forgaging standpoint, still able to get, you know, supply we're dealing with, you know, scarcity in Europe and higher pricing there. So we're seeing, you know, what we're doing with our customers. Our suppliers are doing as well, with quotes are only valid for, you know, a shorter period of time, given the raw material pricing and the unique energy challchallenges in Europe . But look, that's the beauty of being part of a global company like Baker use. I mean. We've been able to sht supply to china- we focused on Northwest china- be able to deal with some of the court issues and things we're seeing. And COVID-19- we had really good experience there. We've also moved some supply to to Mexico and India. So we are able to pivot because we've got a large supply base and can direct that demand, you know, to different places. So we feel good about what we're doing there. On supply in, we expect to see some stilization come through but have a great sourcing team you know, working with the pros team to make sure we can fulfill. On the demand that we see coming through. From a logistic stand, ID say the team is done an outstanding job of managmanaging that. Our inflation we've seeing in logistics is well below the headline. You know prices that you've seen we've changed know ports that we're using in North America and China. So we've been incredibly reactive here. I don't see it being a big constraint today for the, for the L N G cycle, that' seeing, but that's something that will. We'll have to watch as it evolves.\n\nOk great thanks, and that the follow up is we think about. Just, you know we had one of your competitors yesterday. Talk about exceptional tightness, North America. I was just curious your view on availability and of equipment labor et CEA, as we think about the international markets ramping up and at what point you would see, you know, significant tightness really helping out on the pricing side. There I understand, think you get better is this year, goes along, given the guidness. But you know what we could see things get very, very good on the o, F's and F side. yeah look, I'd say broadly tightness you're seeingoutside the U's, it'sits ilar. What're seeing inside in North America. You know some, some labor tightness you know around the globebal in some markets not is as much as you're seeing in in North America. And look, just given the overall increase in activity you are are, see tightness and supply of equipment. I think we've all got capability and that we've got capability to ramp up and have been planning on that. But but look, when you've got demand up is as much as you're seeing in North America and globally general economic tendencies come back into play and you start to see the ability to, you know, have more constructive pricing discussions, deal with you know some of those supply demand issues and I'd say you know the international market, as you know is more. You know longer term contract base versus spot market, like you see in North America where you see some, you know real opportunity here is on on on some of that spot business and and I'd say we're being very constructive with our customers, taking into account what we're seeing on the supply chain, what we're seeing in overall demand and you know it's it's a constructive backdrop for for o F's at the moment.\n\nGreat Thank you.\n\nAnd I'm showing now further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to laloreno. im in for any closing remarks.\n\nYes Thank you very much, and thank you to everyone for joining our earnings call today. Just before we end the call wanted to leave you with some closing forts. Despite some of the challenges this quarter, we are optimistic on the outlook across both of our core business areas and excited about the new energy investments we're making for baic use. We believe that our upstream oil and gas businesses are poised to capitalize on our strong multiyear recovery, while our industrial businesses are poised to benefit from a strong LNG cycle growth in new energy orders and the development of our industrial asset management capabilitieswhile we benefit from these macrotel wins, we expect to generate strong free cash flow and return 60% to 80% of it back to shareholders. So thanks for taking the time. Look forward to speaking to you all again soon and operator, you may close out the call.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, up con call conference for today. Thank you for participating in today's conference.\n\nYou may all disconnect."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jud Bailey, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Baker Hughes Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Here with me are our Chairman and CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli; and our CFO, Brian Worrell. The earnings release we issued earlier today can be found on our website at bakerhughes.com.\nAs a reminder, during the course of this conference call, we will provide forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and assumptions. Please review our SEC filings and website for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. As you know, reconciliations of operating income and other GAAP to non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Lorenzo.\n\nLorenzo Simonelli\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThank you, Jud. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results as we generated another quarter of strong free cash flow, solid margin rate improvement and strong orders performance from TPS. During the quarter, TPS continued to operate at a high level. OFE successfully executed on its cost improvement initiatives and OFS performed extremely well despite continued pressure on supply chain and commodity inflation.\nFor the full year, we were pleased with our financial performance. We took several steps in 2021 to accelerate our strategy and help position the company for the future. Last year proved to be successful on many fronts for Baker Hughes, with key commercial successes and developments in the LNG and new energy markets as well as record free cash flow generation and peer-leading capital allocation. After a quiet start to the year, LNG activity played an important role in helping TPS book almost $7.7 billion in orders in 2021, which was just below the record levels achieved in 2019.\nPerhaps more importantly, we believe that the step-up in LNG order activity provides a solid indication that a new LNG cycle is beginning to take shape. We also believe that the uptick in orders along with other recent policy movements, particularly in Europe, confirms that natural gas is gradually gaining greater acceptance as a transition and destination fuel for a net zero world.\nIn new energy frontiers, we started to see more pronounced commercial successes from our energy transition efforts, generating approximately $250 million in new orders across our TPS, OFS and DS product companies, primarily in the areas of hydrogen and CCUS. We remain confident in our ability to grow this business over the next decade to ultimately total $6 billion to $7 billion of orders by 2030.\nI'm also very pleased to report that Baker Hughes delivered its strongest ever free cash flow year, generating over $1.8 billion in 2021, which represents almost 70% conversion from adjusted EBITDA. We are pleased to see this performance as our cash restructuring and separation payments wound down, and we continue to make progress on improving our working capital and broader cash processes.\nOur strong free cash flow profile provides the company with ample flexibility and optionality when it comes to our broader capital allocation strategy. As evidence of this, we returned almost $1.2 billion back to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in 2021 while also making multiple acquisitions and investments across the industrial and new energy spaces.\nOn the industrial front, we completed the acquisition of ARM's reliability and a major investment in Agri, which will help Baker Hughes continue to build out its industrial asset management platform and deliver an expanded set of asset performance capabilities.\nOn the new energy front, we were active this year in pursuing early-stage technologies in CCUS and in hydrogen. In CCUS, we acquired a position in Electric, a biomethanation company and also entered into an exclusive license with SRI for the mixed salt process. In hydrogen, we made an investment in Ekona, a growth stage company developing novel turquoise hydrogen production technology as well as Nemisys, a technology company focused on a range of early-stage hydrogen technologies.\nWhile 2021 saw many positive achievements, the year was also not without its challenges. We saw continued disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, which continued to impact our operations. Supply chain and inflationary pressures also drove higher cost and delivery issues, primarily across our OFS and DS product companies.\nOur teams have continued to work to offset some of these pressures, but we expect to continue to see some level of tension and disruption in these areas potentially through the first half of the year.\nAs we look ahead to 2022, we expect the pace of global economic growth to remain strong. However, growth rates are likely to moderate from 2021 levels as central banks are expected to begin tightening monetary policy in order to reduce COVID-related stimulus plans and well growing inflationary pressures. Despite the expected slowdown in the pace of growth, we believe the continuing broader macro recovery will translate into rising energy demand in 2022. With oil demand likely recovering to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.\nPairing this demand scenario with continued OPEC+, IOC and E&P spending discipline, we expect the oil markets to remain tight for some time. We believe that this will provide an attractive investment environment for our customers and a strong tailwind for many of our product companies. We also expect continued momentum in the global gas markets in 2022, building on a strong 2021. A combination of demand and supply factors converged in 2021, pushing natural gas and LNG prices to record-breaking levels in both Europe and in Asia.\nThe gas price spikes also highlighted the fragility of the global energy system as the world transitions to net zero. Looking ahead, we expect a number of additional LNG FIDs in 2022 and beyond, supported by the growing appetite for longer-term LNG purchase agreements. As we have previously mentioned, we see significant structural demand growth for LNG in the coming decades. Our positive long-term view is also supported by the recent improvements in policy sentiment in certain parts of the world towards natural gas' role within the energy transition.\nAgainst this constructive macro backdrop, Baker Hughes remains focused on executing our strategy across the 3 pillars of transform the core, invest for growth and position for new energy frontiers. Importantly, we also continue to work towards aligning Baker Hughes across the 2 business areas that we outlined in the third quarter of last year. Oilfield services and equipment and industrial energy technology or OFSE and IET.\nSince we unveiled our vision of ultimately executing across these 2 broad business areas, we have been evaluating all aspects of the company in order to determine the most efficient organizational and corporate structure. Our goal is to find the right structure that properly aligns our internal resources and helps accelerate growth in key strategic areas while also enhancing our profitability and returns and increasing shareholder value. We have reached some early conclusions and have started to implement changes internally. Most notably, we recently created the Climate Technology Solutions Group and in the (inaudible) Asset Management group, which will both report to Rod Christie, Executive Vice President of TPS. Climate Technology Solutions, or CTS will encompass CCUS, hydrogen, emissions management and clean and integrated power solutions. Industrial Asset Management, or IAM, will bring together key digital capabilities, software and hardware from across the company to help customers increase efficiencies, improve performance and reduce emissions for their energy and industrial assets.\nWe believe that the creation of these 2 groups will help accelerate the speed for commercial development for solutions-based business models across our new energy and industrial asset management offerings. Importantly, it will not change any of our reporting structure today. Overall, we are very excited with the strategic direction of Baker Hughes and believe the company is well placed to capitalize on near-term cyclical recovery and well positioned for the long-term structural change in the energy markets.\nNow I'll give you an update on each of our segments. In Oilfield Services, activity levels ended the year on a positive note in both the international and North American markets, and all signs point to a strong year of growth in 2022. Additionally, the RFS team had to navigate an increasingly difficult supply chain environment over the second half of 2021 and ended the year on a high note with a strong fourth quarter margin performance.\nLooking into 2022, we expect a strong broad-based recovery across the international markets, led by Latin America and the Middle East. While Latin America should see the second consecutive year of double-digit growth, the Middle East is in the very early stages of what we expect to be a multiyear growth cycle. Capital is being deployed in the region to restore near-term production levels and lay the foundation for longer-term capacity expansion.\nIn North America, we expect another year of impressive growth in the U.S. land market as well as recovery offshore. Based on conversations with our customers, we expect the underlying trends in North America to remain the same as 2021, with public E&Ps and IOCs remaining disciplined in deploying capital while private E&Ps will remain more active.\nWhile we were pleased to achieve 10% operating margin rates in OFS in the fourth quarter, margins are still below our broader objectives, mainly due to the recent negative impacts of commodity price inflation and supply chain disruptions. That being said, our OFS team is working extremely hard to offset these headwinds with successful pricing increases across multiple product lines and continued progress in mitigating some of the logistics constraints.\nBased on the actions being taken by our OFS team and assuming the gradual normalization of the current state of supply chain disorder, we remain focused on achieving 20% EBITDA levels in OFS by the end of 2022.\nMoving to TPS. The outlook remains constructive, driven by opportunities in LNG, onshore/offshore production and new energy initiatives. I'd like to thank Rod and the TPS team for an exceptional year in 2021, which exemplifies the strength of the TPS business. TPS booked almost $7.7 billion of orders, which included 22 MTPA of LNG orders across 4 projects and 9 FPSOs and offshore topside project awards.\nOn the execution side, TPS generated over $1 billion of operating income, representing over 16% in operating margin rate despite revenue growth in equipment, significantly outpacing services. We are excited about what the future holds for TPS across multiple fronts. In LNG, we were pleased to book 2 awards in the fourth quarter. We announced a major LNG award for the 5 MTPA Pluto Train 2 project in Western Australia, which is operated by Woodside and also received a large-scale LNG equipment award in the Eastern Hemisphere.\nAdditionally, we were awarded an order to deliver power generation equipment for a major LNG project in North America. We continue to be optimistic on the outlook for LNG and remain confident on the potential for 100 to 150 MTPA of awards over the next 2 to 3 years. Based on the continued pace of discussions with multiple customers and the positive fundamentals in the global gas market, we have a general bias towards the upper end of this range.\nFor the non-LNG segments of our TPS portfolio, we see multiple opportunities for continued growth, and we were pleased to book a number of awards in new energy during the quarter. In hydrogen, we booked an award for advanced compression technology for the NEOM carbon-free hydrogen project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, building on the announcement we made with Air Products in the second quarter of 2021.\nWe will be providing our HPRC solutions to the NEOM project, which will enable a lower cost of production and accelerate the adoption of hydrogen as a zero carbon fuel. Our collaboration with Air Products will be critical for a net zero future, and the award is a good example of how Baker Hughes proven technology is helping to accelerate the hydrogen economy.\nIn CCUS, we received an order from Santos to supply turbomachinery equipment for the Moomba Carbon Capture and Storage project in South Australia. Baker Hughes will provide gas turbine compressor and heat recovery steam generator technologies to compress the carbon dioxide. The project will serve as a gas processing plant and permanently store 1.7 million tons of carbon dioxide annually in the depleted natural gas reservoirs in the onshore Cooper Basin. Even though 2021 order activity came in well ahead of our expectations, we still expect to see a similar level of orders for TPS in 2022, driven primarily by LNG.\nNext, on Oilfield Equipment, we are pleased with the overall trends in this business as order activity is becoming more favorable, and we continue to show progress in taking costs out. At a macro level, trends in the subsea and offshore markets are anticipated to continue to improve in 2022 after gaining modest traction over the course of 2021. In the subsea tree market, we expect industry awards to take another step higher in 2022, but likely remain below pre-pandemic levels for the foreseeable future.\nOutside of the tree market, we continue to see a strong pipeline of flexible order opportunities. We are also seeing improving market conditions in our international wellhead and subsea services businesses. In the fourth quarter, we were pleased to announce a major 10-year contract for surface wellheads and tree systems in the UAE. As part of ADNOC's largest ever wellhead award, this important win will further enhance our partnership with this key customer as well as strengthen our footprint in the region.\nOur subsea services business saw some good traction in the fourth quarter with a strong orders performance, driven by increased activity in the North Sea and Sub-Saharan Africa. Although OFE is showing signs of a path to recovery, we still believe the offshore markets will remain structurally challenged as the energy markets and our customers' budgets evolve. As a result, we remain focused on rightsizing the business, improving profitability and optimizing the portfolio. The merger of our subsea drilling systems with MHWirth to create HMH is an excellent example of how we're continuing to transform the OFE portfolio.\nFinally, in Digital Solutions, overall market conditions are improving. We experienced solid growth across our industrial end markets through 2021 and are starting to see a pickup in markets that lagged, particularly the oil and gas, transportation and aviation end markets. Additionally, the DS business continues to be impacted by the supply chain challenges and chip shortages that began earlier in the year. During the quarter, DS continued to secure important contracts with key customers for condition monitoring and industrial asset management solutions. Bently Nevada secured a contract with Yara to enable digital transformation and improve asset reliability and efficiency.\nThe enterprise-wide contract will enable data availability between Yara's plant operations and the cloud across 23 sites using Bently Nevada's latest System 1 EVO asset management software. Bently Nevada also secured a contract with a major oil company to deploy System 1 asset management software as a standardized platform for enterprise-wide conditioning monitoring across 28 facilities worldwide. In addition, Bently Nevada secured a 5-year services agreement to support the operator's digital transformation by providing maintenance services and supporting the customer's goal to move condition monitoring data out of its localized futilities network into a cloud environment.\nGoing forward, DS will play an important role in the growth of our industrial franchise and the overall success of our strategy in industrial asset management. Key to the build-out of IAM were the investments we executed in 2021 that I previously mentioned, the acquisition of ARM's reliability early in the year and more recently, the alliance we formed with Orgreen, both complement our Bently Nevada's Systems One cloud-enabled condition monitoring and protection platform and deliver on our strategy of expanding our presence to noncritical assets and developing software capabilities to allow us to cover the entire balance of plant.\nAs the world strives towards a net zero target in the coming decades, enterprise-level industrial asset management capabilities will be a key driver by enabling better operating efficiency lowering energy consumption and reducing emissions across multiple industries.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the progress we made in 2021 in navigating the many challenges presented during the year, while also executing on the commercial opportunities across our portfolio. At the same time, we were able to convert almost 70% of our 2021 adjusted EBITDA into free cash flow. We returned almost 2/3 of this free cash flow back to shareholders and made good progress on transforming our company into an energy transition leader. As we enter 2022, we expect to benefit from solid macro tailwinds across both of our major business areas, with cyclical recovery in OFSC and our longer-term structural growth trends in LNG and new energy and industrial asset management. We look forward to further developing our corporate strategy, building on our commercial success and focusing on a range of capital allocation opportunities.\nI want to conclude by thanking all of our Baker Hughes employees for their hard work in overcoming another year of challenges surrounding the pandemic, and I look forward to their continued commitment to our success in 2022 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian Worrell\n\nCFO, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Lorenzo. I'll begin with the total company results and then move into the segment details. Orders for the quarter were $6.7 billion, up 24% sequentially, driven by TPS, Digital Solutions and OFS partially offset by a decrease in OFE. Year-over-year, orders were up 28%, driven by increases in TPS, Digital Solutions and OFS and a decrease in OFE. Remaining performance obligation was $23.6 billion, up 1% sequentially. Equipment RPO ended at $8.2 billion, up 9% sequentially, and services RPO ended at $15.3 billion, down 4% sequentially. We are pleased with our strong orders performance in the quarter, particularly in TPS, which provides a good level of revenue visibility into 2022 and beyond.\nOur total company book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.2, and our equipment book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.4. Revenue for the quarter was $5.5 billion, up 8% sequentially, driven by increases across all 4 segments. Year-over-year, revenue was flat, driven by an increase in OFS and and offset by decreases in TPS and OFE.\nOperating income for the quarter was $574 million. Adjusted operating income was $571 million. Adjusted operating income was up 42% sequentially and up 23% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income rate for the quarter was 10.3%, up 240 basis points sequentially and up 190 basis points year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $844 million, up 27% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rate was 15.3%, up 130 basis points year-over-year. We are particularly pleased with the margin improvement in the fourth quarter, which was largely driven by increased productivity, higher pricing and mix. All 4 of our segments experienced strong improvements in adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA rate sequentially.\nCorporate costs were $106 million in the quarter, for the first quarter, we expect corporate costs to be roughly flat with fourth quarter levels. Depreciation and amortization expense was $273 million in the quarter. For the first quarter, we expect D&A to increase slightly from fourth quarter levels.\nInterest in the quarter was $95 million, which includes a make-whole premium relating to the debt refinancing we completed during the fourth quarter. We expect interest expense to return to historical levels in the first quarter. Income tax expense in the quarter was $352 million, which includes $103 million in charges that relate to liabilities indemnified under the tax matters agreement with General Electric. These tax expenses are offset in the other nonoperating line of our income statement.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.32. Included in GAAP diluted earnings per share is a $241 million gain from the net change in fair value of our investment in ADNOC drilling and a $131 million loss from the net change in fair value of our investment in C3.ai, both are recorded and other nonoperating income.\nAs a reminder, in 2018, we formed our strategic partnership with ADNOC Drilling and invested $500 million for a 5% stake. In October 2021, ADNOC drilling completed their IPO, which requires us to mark our investment to fair value. Since our investment is recorded as a marketable security on our balance sheet, the change in fair value will be reflected in the other nonoperating income line on a quarterly basis going forward. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.25.\nTurning to the cash flow statement. Free cash flow in the quarter was $645 million. The sequential improvement was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, strong cash collections and modestly higher proceeds from disposal of assets due to increased real estate sales. We also continue to execute on our $2 billion share repurchase program during the fourth quarter repurchasing 13.2 million Baker Hughes Class A shares for $328 million at an average price just under $25 per share.\nFor the first quarter, we expect free cash flow to decline sequentially primarily due to seasonality. When I look at the total year 2021, I am very pleased with our financial results, particularly with regards to our free cash flow performance and broader margin rate improvements.\nOrders for the full year were $21.7 billion, up 5%, driven by TPS, Digital Solutions and OFE partially offset by OFS. Total company book-to-bill was 1.1 for the year. Total year revenue of $20.5 billion was down 1%, driven by declines in OFS and OFE partially offset by increases in TPS and Digital Solutions.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.6 billion was up 52% in the year with total company adjusted operating income margins improving 270 basis points, mainly driven by productivity improvements in TPS and cost-out programs and productivity improvements in OFS. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion was up 14% in the year. Total company adjusted EBITDA rate improved 170 basis points in 2021.\nCorporate costs for the year were $429 million. For 2022, we expect corporate expenses to be approximately in line with 2021 levels. For the full year, we generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow. Free cash flow includes $175 million of cash payments related to restructuring and separation activities. Our strong free cash flow performance was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower CapEx and increase in cash flow generated from working capital and a significant reduction in cash restructuring and separation charges. Not included in free cash flow are over $200 million of proceeds from asset or investment sales during the year, which include the sale of a small portion of our C3.ai stake and the proceeds we received from the formation of the HMH joint venture with Akastor.\nAs Lorenzo mentioned, we returned almost $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and also deployed over $250 million in tuck-in acquisitions and investments in the industrial and new energy sectors. Our free cash flow in 2021 resulted in 68% conversion from adjusted EBITDA. While our free cash flow conversion was positively impacted by the large cash generation from working capital, we believe that Baker Hughes should be able to generate free cash flow conversion at or above 50% on a multiyear through-the-cycle basis.\nFor 2022, we expect free cash flow conversion from adjusted EBITDA to be around 50% as working capital should be a use of cash due to expected revenue growth. Going forward, we expect our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation to continue to provide us with attractive flexibility and optionality to return cash to shareholders and invest in tuck-in M&A and technology on an opportunistic basis.\nNow I will walk you through the segment results in more detail and give you our thoughts on the outlook going forward. In Oilfield Services, the team delivered a strong quarter. OFS revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, up 6% sequentially. International revenue was up 7% sequentially, led by increases in Sub-Saharan Africa, the North Sea, Russia and Latin America. North America revenue increased 4% sequentially, with similar growth in both the land and offshore markets. Over 55% of OFS revenues in North America were in our production-related businesses of chemicals and artificial lift in the fourth quarter.\nOperating income in the quarter was $256 million, a 35% increase sequentially and a 210 basis point improvement in margin rate. The improvement in margin was driven by better operating productivity, pricing gains in certain product lines and favorable product mix. For the total year of 2021, OFS improved operating income margin rate by 320 basis points.\nAs we look ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see continued growth in international and North American activity, offset by typical seasonal softness in the international markets. As a result, we expect our first quarter revenue to decline modestly on a sequential basis, along with a modest decline in margin rates.\nFor the full year 2022, our expectations are largely in line with the view we shared in October on our third quarter earnings call. In the international market, we expect the continuation of a broad-based recovery with growth in the low to mid-double digits. In North America, we expect a continuation of the ramp-up in activity levels and believe that the broader market could experience strong growth in the 25% to 30% range. With this type of macro backdrop, we would expect to generate solid double-digit revenue growth in 2022 in OFS.\nMargin rates should also see solid improvement as some of the recent supply chain and cost escalation headwinds normalize, and we remain focused on achieving 20% EBITDA margin rates by the end of 2022.\nMoving to Oilfield Equipment. Orders in the quarter were $510 million, down 9% year-over-year. The reduction in orders was driven by SPS as well as the removal of subsea drilling systems from consolidated OFE operations as a result of the merger with MHWirth. These declines were partially offset by growth in services and flexibles.\nRevenue was $619 million, down 13% year-over-year. The reduction in revenue was driven by the removal of SDS and lower volumes in SPS and SPC projects, partially offset by growth in services. Operating income was $23 million, a 1% improvement year-over-year. This was driven by higher volume and services and cost productivity, partially offset by lower volume in SPS and the removal of SDS.\nFor the first quarter, we expect a double-digit sequential decline in revenue driven primarily by seasonality and lower backlog. We expect operating income to also decline sequentially with margin rates in the low single digits. For the full year 2022, we expect a modest recovery in offshore activity driven by higher oil prices and capital deployment into low-cost basins and projects. We expect OFE revenue to be down double digits primarily driven by the deconsolidation of SDS, but we expect OFE margins to remain in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by business mix and benefits from the recent cost-out actions taken.\nNext, I will cover Turbomachinery. The team delivered another strong quarter with solid execution. Orders in the quarter were $3 billion, up 62% year-over-year. Equipment orders were up $1.1 billion year-over-year. As Lorenzo mentioned earlier, orders this quarter were supported by an award to supply power generation for a major LNG project in North America, and order for the Pluto Train 2 LNG project and an award for a large-scale LNG project in the Eastern Hemisphere.\nService orders in the quarter were up 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in both contractual and transactional services, partially offset by lower volume and upgrades. Revenue for the quarter was $1.8 billion, down 9% versus the prior year. Equipment revenue was down 30%, driven by the timing of our equipment backlog conversion. Services revenue was up 16% versus the prior year.\nOperating income for TPS was $346 million, up 4% year-over-year, driven by favorable mix from a strong volume quarter in services. Operating margin was 19.5%, up 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher services mix. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year with higher service revenues offsetting a decline in equipment revenue. Based on this revenue outlook, we expect TPS operating income rates to increase slightly on a year-over-year basis.\nFor the full year, we expect TPS orders in 2022 to be roughly the same as 2021, driven by continued strength in LNG awards. We also continue to see a solid pipeline in our onshore/offshore production segment along with opportunities in pumps, valves and new energy areas. We now expect solid revenue growth in 2022 driven by growth in services and strong orders growth in 2021.\nOn the margin side, we still expect operating income margin rates to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2022, depending on the mix between services and equipment. Included in this framework is an expected increase in investments and R&D expenses that relate to our new energy and industrial growth areas.\nFinally, in Digital Solutions, orders for the quarter were $605 million, up 14% year-over-year. We saw improvements in orders across most end markets, most notably in industrial, transportation and oil and gas. Sequentially, orders were up 16%, driven by seasonality in oil and gas, power generation and industrial.\nRevenue for the quarter was $558 million, flat year-over-year with higher volumes in Waygate, Router Stokes and PPS, offset by lower volumes in Nexus Controls, Druck and Bently Nevada, Sequentially, revenue was up 9% with improvements across most product lines.\nOperating income for the quarter was $51 million, down 33% year-over-year, driven by headwinds from mix and higher R&D costs. Sequentially, operating income was up 97%, primarily driven by higher volume. For the first quarter, we expect to see modest revenue growth year-over-year, supported by a stronger opening backlog. We expect operating margin rates to be down slightly year-over-year, but to remain in the mid-single digits.\nFor the full year, we expect solid growth in revenue as supply chain constraints begin to ease and orders pick up across digital solutions. With higher volumes, we expect strong improvements in DS margins, which could approach double digits for the total year. Overall, I am very pleased with the execution in the fourth quarter and the total year across all the key financials. We are confident in our strategy and our ability to continue to execute as we head into 2022.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Jud.\n\nJudson Edwin Bailey\n\nVP of IR, Baker Hughes Company\n\nThanks, Brian. Operator, let's open the call for questions.",

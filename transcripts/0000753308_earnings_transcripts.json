Ketchum\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer-NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, NextEra Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing 9.7% year-over-year. In addition, through the first 9 months of the year, our adjusted earnings per share has increased 9.3% year-over-year. The continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources positions our company well to meet its overall objectives for the year.\nAmerica is in a golden age of power demand. The country needs more electricity than ever. New electrons can't get on the grid fast enough. NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to help lead this pivotable moment for our sector. We develop, build and operate all forms of energy infrastructure. At our core, we're a development company. We have a world-class platform that enables us to quickly build low-cost generation in electric and gas transmission. We're not just recontracting around existing assets. We're also building new energy infrastructure needed to power America. Our 2 world-class companies, Florida Power & Light Company and NextEra Energy Resources are the perfect complement to 1 another. Day in and day out, we are powering today and building tomorrow.\nImportantly, we are in a terrific position to continue delivering near-term and long-term value to our customers and shareholders. As we discussed with you earlier this month, our long-term earnings growth drivers are extensive, both inside and outside Florida. Simply put, we have many ways to grow across our platform, both this decade and the next. We are excited to discuss this in much more in greater detail with you at our investor conference on December 8.\nThe Florida economy continues to see significant economic growth and Florida Power & Light Company continues to make smart long-term investments to serve that growth while keeping bills low and reliability high. We put our customers first and the results speak for themselves. FPL customers experienced top decile reliability that's nearly 60% better than the national average. -- and typical FPL residential bills are 20% lower than they were 20 years ago when adjusted for inflation. And that's not by accident. FPL's nonfuel O&M costs are 70% lower than national average and over 50% lower than second best in our industry. And approximately 90% of FPL's power generation comes from the nation's largest gas-fired fleet and 4 nuclear units.\nThis baseload powers the backbone of our system, giving us the flexibility to meet our customers' needs with the lowest cost forms of energy right now, solar and storage. Remember, a robust gas and nuclear fleet means we don't necessarily need nighttime electrons. We need more low-cost electrons to meet our daytime peak, which is why solar and storage are the perfect complement and choice for FPL system and customers today.\nFPL is also preparing for the future, which will require even [Audio Gap] 5.3 gigawatts in solar, 3.4 gigawatts in battery storage and a gas peaker plant that is pending regulatory approvals. We look forward to continuing the successful multi-decade approach of adding low-cost generation to meet Florida's growing need for power, while also increasing reliability and keeping customer bills low. This approach is at the heart of our new 4-year rate proposal. As a reminder, on February 28, we initiated FPL's 2025 base rate proceeding for new rates effective in January 2026.\nWe reached a proposed settlement agreement in August with most of the interveners in the proceeding, reflecting a broad set of constituents across our customer base. The 4-year proposed agreement would provide an allowed midpoint regulatory return on equity of 10.95%, with a range of 9.95% to 11.95%. There would be no change to FPL's equity ratio of 59.6%. The proposed agreement also includes a rate stabilization mechanism similar to what we filed in February. The proposed settlement also includes 2 new large low tariffs that are designed to ensure large load customers pay for the incremental generation needed to serve them.\nWe believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade. If the proposed agreement is approved, typical residential customer bills would increase only about 2% annually between 2025 and 2029. This means bills would remain well below the current national average, providing our customers with the economic certainty that comes from a 4-year rate agreement. We completed evidentiary hearings earlier this month and expect the Florida Public Service Commission to provide a final decision on the proposed settlement agreement on November 20.\nThis summer, we received a constructive outcome on federal tax credits, providing policy certainty for our renewables build at Energy Resources. We expect to receive tax credits for our renewable development plan through 2030, while our suppliers are positioned to be FIAC compliant. We've also been able to reduce development risk for a large part of our planned build, that's because Energy Resources has approximately 1.5x coverage of the project inventory required to support its development expectations through 2030. This provides us the runway we need to continue delivering low-cost power solutions to our customers, who need power today and tomorrow.\nRenewables are just the start. We also plan on delivering power through battery storage, gas-fired generation and nuclear. Over the second and third quarters alone, we have originated 2.8 gigawatts of new battery storage opportunities as we continue to grow the world's leading storage business backed by domestic supply base with batteries made in America. We're also leading the much-needed development of linear transmission infrastructure, both electric and gas, and our customer supply businesses proven integral to serving data center customers. We're tying it all together through our AI-driven world-class development platform and decades of experience. And we are doing it at a time when the combination of development capabilities and a strong balance sheet are more important than ever. It's why we are ideally positioned to work with hyperscalers who are increasingly looking to power their business by bridging -- by bringing their own generation.\nWe are unique, in that we combine a national footprint, a strong balance sheet, supply chain capabilities and experience in building all forms of generation and transmission, together with unmatched customer relationships and an industry-leading team on a development platform, second to none. And that's what we believe it takes to serve this new customer class, which is investing tens of billions of dollars per project. Hyperscalers, data center operators and load serving entities continue to tell us they need solutions for large load today and tomorrow to address growing energy demand across America.\nAs a leader in serving this demand, I am pleased to announce that we have entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Google that pending regulatory approvals enables us to recommission our Duane Arnold Energy Center Nuclear Plant in Palo, Iowa just outside of Cedar. The 615-megawatt plant is just the beginning and will help power Google's growing cloud and AI infrastructure in Iowa once it returns to operation, which we expect to occur no later than the first quarter of 2029 and perhaps as early as the fourth quarter of 2028.\nDuane Arnold shut down in August 2020 after safely and reliably serving Eastern Iowa for decades. And because we carefully and methodically went through the decommissioning process, we have confidence in the investment required to restart it. During our evaluation of recommissioning Duane Arnold, we collaborated closely with the plant's minority owners, Central Iowa Power Cooperative known as CIPCO, which provides power to the local community, and Corn Belt Power Cooperative. As part of that collaboration, CIPCO will purchase 50 megawatts of the plant's output on terms and conditions consistent with the Google PPA. And we have signed definitive agreements to acquire CIPCO and Corn Belts combined 30% interest in the plant, which will bring our ownership to 100%.\nRestarting Duane Arnold marks an important milestone for NextEra Energy. Our partnership with Google not only brings nuclear energy back to Iowa, it also accelerates the development of next-generation nuclear technology. With the support of the Trump administration, Google and NextEra Energy are creating more than 1,600 jobs and adding more than $9 billion of local economy, creating a win for the U.S., a win for both companies and a win for Iowa.\nAs a demonstration of the pride of working at Duane Arnold and for NextEra Energy, a significant number of Duane Arnold's previous workforce are looking to return to work at the facility. And our team working to recommission Duane Arnold includes many of the same employees, who decommissioned the plant 5 years ago. Beyond the nuclear plant, we have ample land available to provide additional power and capacity solutions, including battery storage to support data center build and potential future expansion.\nAs part of the agreement, NextEra Energy and Google have also signed an agreement to explore the development of advance nuclear generation to be deployed in the U.S., which will help power America's growing electricity needs. Of course, to move that forward, we'll be certain to appropriately mitigate and limit our financial exposure as new nuclear technologies continue to advance. We expect Duane Arnold will be eligible for nuclear production tax credit with a 10% energy community bonus. And once restarted, we expect Duane Arnold to contribute at the same -- data center hubs we are developing across the country.\nWhen you put it all together, our opportunity set is not contained to a single utility service. Bottomline, we have many ways to grow, and we remain well positioned not just for the rest of the decade, but into the next decade as well. We look forward to sharing many more details with you in December.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to walk you through detailed results from the quarter.\n\nMichael H. Dunne\n\nTreasurer & Assistant Secretary\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2025, FPL's earnings per share increased by $0.08 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 8% year-over-year. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPLs -- full year capital investments to be between $9.3 billion and $9.8 billion. For the 12 months ending September 2025, FPL's reported return on equity for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.7%. During the third quarter, we reversed approximately $218 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of roughly $473 million.\nLooking forward, we expect to use a portion of the remaining reserve amortization balance for the remainder of the year. FPL's third quarter retail sales decreased 1.8% from the prior year comparable period due to milder weather. On a weather-normalized basis, from the prior year comparable period, retail sales increased by 1.9% due to an increase in customer growth and underlying usage.\nNow let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 13% year-over-year. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.09 per share, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Contributions from our existing clean energy portfolio remained unchanged year-over-year despite weaker wind resource due to better performance at our nuclear fleet. Wind resource for the third quarter of 2025 was approximately 90% of the long-term average versus 93% in the third quarter of 2024. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business increased by $0.06 per share, primarily driven by timing origination activity during the quarter.\nAll other impacts decreased by $0.09 per share, driven by asset recycling during the third quarter last year as well as higher financing costs, mostly related to borrowing costs to support our new investments. Energy Resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding 3 gigawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals nearly 30 gigawatts after taking into account more than 1.7 gigawatts of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call. We expect that backlog additions will go into service over the next few years and into 2029. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter that Energy Resources has added -- three or more gigawatts to its backlog.\nWe continue to see strong customer demand for ready now capacity solutions as we had our strongest quarter ever. From 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call for NextEra Energy.

With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing 9.4% year over year. In addition, through the first six months of the year, our adjusted earnings per share has increased 9.1% year over year. The continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources positions our company well to meet its overall objectives for the year. America continues to be at a unique moment, and our industry remains front and center.\nAfter decades of stagnant electricity demand, we're now seeing growth across sectors of the US economy. Artificial intelligence and reshoring of manufacturing grab most of the headlines, and for good reason. But that doesn't tell the full story. Demand for more electricity is also coming from all sectors, including residential, commercial, industrial, and oil and gas, to name a few.\nA new study from ICF released this month described demand growth as both sudden and sharp. The report says demand growth over the next decade is expected to exceed the last three decades combined, just the latest data point putting into perspective how unique this moment truly is. Bottom line, America needs more electricity, not less. Importantly, America needs it now, not just in the future.\nWe are firmly aligned with the administration's goal to unleash American energy dominance, and to do so, we need all of the electrons we can get on the grid. There's truly no time to wait. We see this every day from our customers who aren't just saying they need power, they're signing contracts with us to build energy infrastructure because we can do it quickly and at a low cost. Again, the need for more electricity is real.\nWe must do more than just plan for what's on our doorstep. We must act. As I've said many times, we're going to need all forms of energy to meet this moment. New gas and nuclear are on the way and will be critical to meeting demand over the long term. Renewables and storage can bridge the gap and will play an important role in an all-of-the-above future. Storage, in particular, is a game changer. It's low cost, all forms of energy can charge it, and the grid can rely on it for capacity. Storage is also flexible and can utilize excess transmission capacity. That means it can quickly be deployed to where customers need it most. Importantly, renewables and storage are ready now and can provide much-needed electricity and capacity.\nBut in order to achieve our objectives, we will need to continue to navigate a challenging regulatory and policy environment. The one big, beautiful bill was tough but constructive, providing for a phase-out of wind and solar tax credits over time, together with a longer runway for nuclear and storage. Although there is more certainty with the passage of the bill, we will need to manage that against a backdrop of executive orders, agency rulemaking, tariffs, and trade actions. While there are risks to be managed, we believe there are also significant opportunities given the steps we've taken to prepare for this moment, as we expect a natural pull forward of demand.\nWe are in a constant state of construction, and over the last few years prior to the enactment of the OBBB, made substantial financial commitments to begin construction on renewable projects that we believe are sufficient to cover the projects we plan to place into service through 2029. We have a large pipeline of early and late-stage projects. We have a supply chain capability that I believe is the best in the sector, and we are leveraging artificial intelligence across our business, including in customer origination. We have the balance sheet scale, experience, and technology. While no company is immune from all risk, we've proven time and again what I firmly believe: that there is no company in our sector better positioned to execute through the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead than NextEra.\nAs the quintessential all-of-the-above energy company, we believe more energy infrastructure than anyone. We build more energy infrastructure than anyone in the United States. From renewables and storage to gas and nuclear, we do it all. We will continue to build what customers need, including the critical transmission to bring power from plants to communities. At FPL, we are going to continue to do what we have done so well for customers over the past two decades. Florida's long-standing constructive regulatory and legislative environment enables infrastructure investment to serve Florida's growing population. In fact, just last week, the Florida Supreme Court concluded that state regulators properly approved our 2021 settlement agreement by affirming the Florida Public Service Commission's final and supplemental final orders.\nFPL continues to invest in infrastructure to keep reliability high and bills low, and we continue to operate and invest in the nation's largest gas-fired fleet, along with four nuclear units in Florida, which provides us the flexibility to leverage cost-effective solar and storage to meet the significant demand from our state's growing population. FPL is doubling down on what we've proven benefits our customers, investing in generation to meet growing electricity demand while driving fuel costs out of the bill.\nFPL plans to add more than 8 GW of reliable, cost-effective solar and battery storage by 2029. It's the perfect complement to our existing natural gas and nuclear fleet in Florida. Together, it's how we serve our customers with a diversified energy mix. This not only further secures Florida's energy independence. It also improves system reliability and resource adequacy by delivering energy when customers need it most.\nFPL continues to be America's blueprint for utilizing all forms of energy to keep reliability high and electric bills low. Outside of Florida, Energy Resources continues to be the nation's leading energy infrastructure developer. The team originated 3.2 GW of new projects since the last earnings call, including over 1 GW serving hyperscalers to help enable their AI build-out and further drive America's leadership in the space.\nOur backlog alone now includes approximately 6 GW of projects intended to serve technology and data center customers. If you include our operating portfolio together with the expected build-out of our backlog, we will have over 10 and a half GW serving technology and data center customers across the United States. We continue to make progress toward the potential restart of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility while also working to advance new gas-fired generation opportunities.\nAnd we continue to build what's essentially a stand-alone rate-regulated utility within Energy Resources through NextEra Energy Transmission. With our scale, experience, and technology, including our supply chain capability and balance sheet, we are positioned to meet the opportunities that increased power demand will provide. I firmly believe no one has a better team, a better culture, or a better track record of execution than NextEra Energy. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to walk you through detailed results from the quarter.\n\nMike Dunne\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. For second quarter of 2025, FPL's earnings per share increased by $0.02 year over year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of nearly 8% year over year. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full-year capital investments to be between $8 and 8.8 billion.\nFor the 12 months ending June 2025, FPL's reported return on equity for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6%. During the second quarter, we utilized approximately $19 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of roughly $254 million. FPL's Q2 retail sales increased 1.7% from the prior year comparable period, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth. Overall usage per customer grew by 0.1% year over year, which includes a decline of 0.8% due to milder weather.\nAs a result, FPL grew retail sales in second quarter by roughly 2.6% on a weather-normalized basis. On 28 February, we initiated Florida Power & Light's 2025 Base Rate Proceeding. The four-year Base Rate Plan we have proposed has been designed to support continued investments in cost-effective generation, long-term infrastructure, and advanced technology, which improves reliability and helps keep customer bills low. Today, FPL's typical residential bill remains well below the national average and among the lowest of the top 20 investor-owned utilities in the nation. With the proposed Base Rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL's typical residential bill is expected to be approximately 20% below the projected national average. A technical hearing at the Florida Public Service Commission is scheduled next month. We expect a final decision in Q4.\nIf state regulators approve our plan, a typical FPL residential bill will grow at an annual average rate of just 2.5% from 2025 through 2029. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported an adjusted earnings per share increase of $0.11 year over year. As you'll recall, the prior comparable quarter reflected higher-than-expected and one-time expenses. Contributions from new investments increased $0.14 per share year over year, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewable and storage portfolios. Our existing clean energy portfolio decreased $0.02 per share, primarily reflecting weaker wind resource during the quarter. Wind resource for second quarter 2025 was approximately 97% of the long-term average versus 104% in second quarter 2024. Our customer supply business increased $0.06 per share compared to second quarter last year, which was impacted by higher depletion expense and certain non-recurring items.\nAll other impacts decreased by $0.07 per share, driven by higher interest costs of $0.06 per share. Energy Resources had a strong quarter of newer renewables and storage origination, adding 3.2 GW to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals nearly 30 GW after taking into account more than 1.1 GW of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call. We expect the backlog additions will go into service over the next few years and into 2029.\nThis marks the sixth time in the past eight quarters that Energy Resources has added more than 3 GW to its backlog. We have now originated approximately 12.7 GW of new renewables and battery storage projects over the last 12 months. Roughly 30% of our current backlog comes from storage, which demonstrates our customers' demand for a low-cost, ready-now solution to meet their capacity needs.\nTurning now to our second quarter 2025 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.04 per share. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2025, 2026, and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2026, off a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that, we will open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press Star, then two. At this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, hi. Good morning, thanks. So I guess first, just on the OBBB and then also the Trump executive orders, could you maybe talk to, I guess, the safe harbor start of construction issue and how much OBBB has effectively maybe codified that and what can really the administration change at this point? And then also just how to think about some of the recent permitting kind of updates that came out and just your exposure to federal lands in your backlog. Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, thank you, Steve, for your question. This is John. So let me just start with your question around the tax provisions of the safe harbor in particular. I think as most folks know by now, the way the OBBBA was drafted, it basically provides that wind and solar facilities have to be placed in service by 31 December 2027. However, there is a very important exception in that that says that projects that begin construction before 4 July 2026 are not subject to that placed-in-service requirement. So the issue is what is meant by begin construction. And our view is pretty simple and pretty straightforward. The begin construction term has been around for well over a decade. It has a settled meaning within the industry. That meaning is informed by long-standing Treasury Department guidance.\nIt's been relied upon not only by NextEra, but the solar and wind industry for years. So I start with the fact that it has a plain meaning. It's also a term that's defined in the OBBA and the FEOC provisions, and that definition is consistent with the settled meaning and the long-standing Treasury guidance that I just spoke about. And importantly, the term beginning construction has certain safe harbors for what actually constitutes starting construction. And it also has a four-year continuity of service safe harbor.\nSo when I look at the steps that we've taken in reliance on the settled meaning and the long-standing guidelines around the term beginning construction, we've made significant financial commitments over the last few years, including in the first half of 2025, to begin construction under these rules that were in effect at the time those commitments were made.\nIn doing so, we believe that we've begun construction on a sufficient number of projects to cover our development expectations through 2029. Of course, look, while we can't provide any guarantees, this is our interpretation, and this is our belief as to what the statute provides based on our experience in this industry over the last couple of decades.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nJust on the siting permitting issue in the federal lands, yeah.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, and on the permitting on federal lands, first of all, I'll say there was an EO and I think a response made by the Department of the Interior a couple of months ago just articulating that solar and wind projects would not be prioritized. The Executive Order itself that came out on 7 July directed the Department of the Interior to come up with new procedures on how it would handle wind and solar permitting to not favor them.\nAnd so they instituted an additional layer that would require Secretary or Deputy Secretary review. It's new. Obviously, we're working with the Department of the Interior. Let's just see how it actually is applied in practice. But again, I think this letter is being responsive to the EO. When I look at it and I look at our backlog, most of our backlog already has secured federal permits.\nLet's also just see how this gets applied. I continue to feel comfortable with where we stand in terms of being able to navigate the federal permitting issue.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOne other question. Just, you mentioned natural pull forward. Maybe could you give any sense on just, have you started seeing signs from what have been the reaction of customers from the bill? Have you started seeing any kind of sense of natural pull forward and just your market share expectations and thoughts given all the different things that have occurred?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, I think, Steve, customers are still digesting it. They have different levels of understanding of what's come out. Obviously, we spent a lot of time on it. And so I would expect to see a reaction from customers over time. Obviously, we'll inform them through our origination process. But I see some natural breaking points that could create significant opportunities for us to ramp pull forward.\nI mean, one is if you break down the statute, certainly with the 2027 placed-in-service requirement, you could see projects that are accelerated into that year. Then it comes down to who safe harbored, right? Who safe harbored before the enactment date? It's hard to know with any precision who did. We know we compete against a lot of really small developers who don't have the balance sheet, the construction financing to do things around safe harbor.\nSo you could also look and say, based on that, we would expect the pull forward naturally in the 2028 and 2029 as well, where there might be less competition from folks that have not safe harbored, that could create bigger opportunities for folks like NextEra that are in a perpetual state of construction and are safe harboring all the time based on the rules that were in effect, that could create potentially bigger opportunities for us in those years.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Julien Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nJulien Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much for the time. I appreciate it. Maybe to follow up on Steve's questions earlier, I mean, just to crystallize our understanding under the existing OBBB that was passed here, how do you think about your EPS growth and sort of the waterfall, if you will, of credits? And especially given the dynamics you talk about, whether it's the pull forward or otherwise having an opportunity to step in and enable other projects that you might not necessarily have envisioned today, how do you think about the ability to sustain your growth through the decade in as much as now you have visibility that's been effectively crystallized under this legislation? Obviously, barring changes with the EO, we're not ready to go there given this backdrop.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. I mean, first, I'll start with that last piece, right, which is, as I said in the prepared remarks, I think the One Big Beautiful Bill, while tough, was constructive. I think it does create some opportunities for us going forward for some of the reasons that I laid out with Steve on the EPS growth point. I'll hold off on that until our next analyst day, which we'll hold sometime later this year, beginning of next year. But as I think about the waterfall opportunity and that pull forward that, again, Julien, that you were hitting on, again, the uncertainty that could be created with the 2027 placed-in-service and then you come down to who safe harbored for 2028 and 2029, obviously that favors large developers like NextEra that planned ahead, right?\nIf you're in a market where you have folks drop out, right, because they didn't plan ahead, they don't have the ability to get construction financing, they don't have the ability to safe harbor, it obviously creates bigger opportunities for us in these natural pull forward points. I'm going to come back to a point that I think is important for you to make and for investors to understand.\nI think if you look at our track record over time, not just the last three years, but going back over time, whenever there's a little bit of uncertainty, a little bit of risk, a little bit of complexity, that typically favors our business, right? Because I firmly believe that we have the capability to navigate and to plan the business in a way that helps mitigate these risks going forward.\nAnd look, I mean, no company is immune from everything. But I think we do, if you look at the track record, have demonstrated an ability to really figure out how to mitigate these exposures on a go-forward basis. And the last piece I'll make is don't forget if we do see some small developers kind of fall away, there'll be more projects that could potentially hit the market and come up for sale, creating more not only on our organic greenfield opportunity set, but perhaps some opportunities to step into projects that other developers have tried to advance but for whatever reason might struggle to get it across the finish line given some of the backdrop of some of the challenges that we're addressing in the industry that I think we're best equipped to address.\n\nJulien Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. Thanks, John. Just a quick follow-up if I can. Smaller detail here, but non-trivial at all. How is progress going on the nuclear contracting front? I mean, it is certainly the theme of the day. You guys have two different bites of the apple potentially, it seems. Duane, progress just from an engineering perspective, just to kind of get a little bit of a sense on where that could land and when. And then separately here, Point Beach, obviously spoken for, but it seems like there could be some opportunity there. I mean, two different bites of the apple seem to be coming ripe here in the medium term.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. No, thanks for asking the question, Julien. Duane Arnold just continues to advance. I mean, I think anytime you have a, there's only three of them in the country, right, between Palisades and the one facility in Duane. I mean, these are unique opportunities because you don't face the new build cost associated with nuclear. And so these are really unicorn-type opportunities. And so we continue to advance, Duane.\nI'm very pleased with the way things are going on the on-site reviews and some of the engineering analysis that we've done. But more importantly, we continue to advance discussions with customers. So feel good where we sit now about how things are progressing on the Duane front. And look, with Point Beach, it's not only the Point Beach facility, but also the opportunity to do some things around SMRs. We have the same opportunity set at Duane.\nIf we're successful in bringing Duane forward, that obviously creates a hotbed of data center activity around that facility, the same as what you've seen in Wisconsin with Cloverleaf and the Fox facility that Microsoft is behind as well. And so I like the potential longer-term options there in addition to just the recommissioning efforts that we potentially have at Duane. And look, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that not only do we have an active gas-fired generation development effort at our company, we are also very active in the development of small modular reactors and the potential that nuclear could provide going forward. And again, that goes back to my comments of being in all of the above energy company.\nOur goal is to provide the customer with what it wants, when it needs it, at the right price to help address the power demand that we see in this country. Look no further than the PJM capacity auction yesterday. I mean, there's a lot of demand out there, and there are very few companies that have the development capability that we do. A lot of companies that have an existing asset position. Very few companies can develop new generation assets or have the skill sets on their teams to do it. That gives us a unique advantage in this market.\n\nJulien Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome. Thank you. All the best, all right? Speak soon.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nHey, thanks, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for all the updates. Hey, I just wanted to ask maybe just for an update on FPL. We've seen some testimonies in the rate case at this point. You kind of pointed to the fact that hearings will kick off in mid-August. Just, is a settlement still on the table in any way, or are you expecting this to go right to hearings if you can comment at all? Thanks.\n\n[Company Representative 2] (NextEra Energy)\n\nCompany Representative 2, NextEra Energy\n\nWell, that's a great question. We always prepare like we are going to hearings because we want to be as prepared as possible. And they're about three weeks away at this point. It doesn't mean that there is not the opportunity for discussions that would lead to a settlement. I think the notion should be that those discussions probably can happen at any time. And if it makes, from our perspective, if it makes sense for our customers, that's something that we would obviously move on as we have for the last three rate cases. So I'm still confident that we have a great rate case to present to the Public Service Commission in the middle of August. That has been my focus really for the last six months.\nIf there is the opportunity, if the opportunity pops up, I am going to absolutely make myself available to make sure that we can put our best foot forward for our customers in a settlement.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nMakes a lot of sense. Appreciate that. And I just wanted to take one of Julien's questions a step further just on the financing side and kind of thinking about the comments about the safe harbor visibility through 2029. As I understand the current plan, 2024 through 2027, roughly about half of the funding is tax equity and project finance. And I'm just wondering, because you have this commentary around safe harbor visibility through 2029, is that kind of the same mix that we should be expecting in financing the business through the late decade? Are there other sources of financing that you're thinking about leaning on? And I guess maybe you can kind of talk about what's been contemplated at this point.\n\n[Company Representative 1] (NextEra Energy)\n\nCompany Representative 1, NextEra Energy\n\nSure. So as we look at where we sit today and as we look at what our renewable build looks like, it is a lot more of what we've done over the course of the last 20 years. And that has been building good projects that are very attractive to our tax equity providers, that are very attractive to our project finance providers. And those parties, looking at the quality of those projects, providing the financing for them. As we look today and as we look over the last two years, we have increased our tax equity providers by 50%. Just last week, I was talking to one of our long-term tax equity providers who was asking and mentioned they wanted to increase their exposure to us.\nSo we feel very good about where we sit in terms of accessing both the tax equity and the project financing market as an attractive low-cost way for us to finance our renewable and storage facilities.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, team. I just have one quick one. You talked about maybe the company's gas strategy going forward. You talked about it on development day. Just curious, you've seen some recent sales in the country already in service gas assets at attractive multiples. Just, is that an avenue the company would pursue or more of with the GEV partnership in building new build gas?\n\nBrian Bolster\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSure. It's Brian. On the gas strategy front, listen, we're going to look at new build. We'll look at opportunities in the market. I think what we need to do if we're going to look at the market is obviously the value has to make sense. I think we have to feel very good that we're going to be able to do something with that on the contracting front in the near term. So I don't think we want to just go spec long merchant generation. But we're turning over kind of every rock as we look at that, everything from are there assets that are going to be interesting to fit nicely that we think we can offer back to the market, and we're going to look at greenfield opportunities. So we're pursuing it on all fronts.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nJust a quick clarity, did John say earlier that maybe an analyst day end of the calendar year or beginning of next calendar year? And I apologize if I did not hear that correctly.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThat's what I said.\n\nAnthony Crowdell\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. First question, I want to follow up a little bit on the big, beautiful bill. How are you thinking about the foreign entities of concern, the FEOC clause? Are you confident that you won't face exposure to that given your safe harbored equipment position?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nFeel very confident about the FEOC provisions. Again, the way they work are as long as you've begun construction by 31 December 2025, you're not subject to those. So with the continuity safe harbor, add four years on, you get to the end of the taxable year 2025, that takes you through 2029. And then when you start looking at compliance beyond 2029, we feel very comfortable with our ability to comply with those provisions.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nGreat. Thanks for clarifying. Next on Duane Arnold, I know there's a lot of ifs and nothing has been decided yet, but if you were to move forward with a potential restart, would I be correct in thinking the timing might be such that the earnings contribution would maybe mitigate or offset the loss of renewable tax credits as they're phased out? Could that be a way to smooth out the earnings and offset a potential cliff in five years or so? I know that's far off, but people are already thinking about it today.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. I mean, that's obviously pretty far off, but sure. I mean, that is, you add Duane Arnold to the mix, and that's one of many ways that we have to continue to grow the business in the future.\n\nBrian Bolster\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nJust one thing I comment because this is the second question that's kind of got this concept of a cliff. And I just want to remind everyone, while the tax laws may be changing, the demand picture that we've been talking about, now going on four or five quarters, is not. The customer dialogue, whether it's in 2027, 2028, 2029, or 2030, is as robust as it's ever been.\nAnd so while the framework may be changing for some of these projects, the overall demand picture is very important to remember. Our job at Energy Resources is to build energy infrastructure for our customers. There is an outrageous amount of need for energy infrastructure in this country that's going to go well past the end of this decade. And so we feel well-positioned. Duane would be an example of one of the things that we'll be looking at.\nSo Duane is another example of one of the things that we can bring to bear. Storage is another element of something that we're seeing a lot of focus on. So I just think there's this view that the one big, beautiful bill is creating a sunset and a cliff. And I think the answer is it's just changing the rule set, and we'll continue to build the energy infrastructure that this country needs.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nAgreed. Thank you for clarifying and framing that up. One last one.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. One other point I want to add on to that too is don't forget about storage too, right? I mean, storage is a massive opportunity for this company and for this country given the capacity that it provides. So don't lose sight of storage in addition to all the other opportunities that we have around the demand picture, the ability to build gas, the ability to build nuclear, the contributions from Duane. There's a lot that goes into that.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nThank you very much. Just one last brief one on the quarter. At FPL, the earnings growth was pretty modest, only less than 3.5%, despite the capital employed growing at your typical 8-ish%. Can you just talk to the delta there? What was weighing on the earnings growth, and how are you thinking about the rest of this year of utility?\n\n[Company Representative 1] (NextEra Energy)\n\nCompany Representative 1, NextEra Energy\n\nSo if you look at the $0.02 that offset the $0.04 of regulatory capital growth, there's a variety of factors that can move that across. Recall that in 2024, the return on equity was at 11.8%, and for this year, it was at 11.6%. So that is one factor, and there's other puts and takes that can drive that $0.02 differential. However, as we look on a go-forward basis, I wouldn't expect that differential to continue throughout the rest of the year.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nManaging Director, Scotiabank\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nMorning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nNot to belabor the point here with IRA post One Big Beautiful Bill, and I guess tax credits transitioning towards the end of the decade here. But just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the dynamics in the power markets at that point in time, particularly renewable PPA pricing, and just see how you think that shifts at that point and how that, and any impacts on margins for participants across the value chain, and maybe what sets NEE apart from others.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. I mean, first of all, we've got a large pricing advantage and two advantages on renewables. First of all, they're very fast to build, right? I mean, you can get a renewable project up and built in 12 to 18 months. Don't forget about our early and late-stage inventory of projects. That's very important to keep in mind. And so when you think about all this demand for power that's here right now, we have a lot of pricing power, right, in the market, and we have a significant cost advantage over other resources that will show up later. And we need more capacity from nuclear and gas. It's just given the development timeline being a little bit longer than what you see on renewables. That's why you've seen so much demand for renewables today.\nAnd then don't forget too, we have a lot of renewable projects that continue to roll off of contract, right? And not a whole lot of attention gets paid to that. But when we're out in the market and able to recontract power purchase agreements that were entered into a decade or more ago into this new higher-priced power market, there's a lot of embedded value in the existing portfolio.\nAnd then you start thinking about layering in not only on top of renewables the ability to continue to develop around gas-fired generation, and nuclear as it comes along, and our transmission business, right, where we made some comments today about how we're basically building a rate-regulated utility inside of NextEra. We've had an enormous amount of success around the competitive transmission business. So a lot of things to feel very good about as we look to the future.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful there. And then just want to continue, I guess, with the PJM capacity auction results yesterday. How do you think about the current price backdrop now as enough to incent generators at this point? How do you think about NextEra's opportunity set with gas builds at that point given that data point?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that data point suggests that, first of all, you look at where new build gas prices are in order to build and make them economic. I think you see the PJM capacity market reacting to that because don't forget, right, and this is why I keep emphasizing development skills and capabilities and the ability to add new infrastructure to the system. Existing assets are already there to accommodate the demand that exists today, right? What you're trying to do with the capacity market is incent generation that does not exist today. Somebody's got to go out and develop and build that.\nNo matter what you do with the existing generation today, it's got to be, if that's going to be used to serve new demand, that generation has to be replaced by something, whether it's renewables, whether it's storage, whether it's gas fired generation, whether it's new nuclear. So what I would be focused on as well is who has the development skills and capabilities and who doesn't because we are going to have to build new generation. There's only so much you can do around existing assets.\nThey already exist today to accommodate the power demand that exists today. When you look to the future, you've got to start adding incremental generation. We are uniquely advantaged and have a unique capability set in that regard because we're one of the very few companies in this country that have been building for the last two decades.\nWe have a development team that is up and running in 49 states across this country. I'd put our development team up against anyone. We need new incremental generation. The existing stuff isn't going to get us there.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Just one last quick one, if I could. You touched on SMRs briefly before. Just wondering, any updated thoughts in terms of your assessment of SMRs at this point in time for when this resource could be widely deployed.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nWe've been advanced. We've been, like I said, we have a whole development team on SMRs. We've been advising corporate clients. So I think our knowledge curve is probably higher than most in the market today as a result of that. And we continue to evaluate. There's 95 OEMs in SMRs and really trying to focus on the technical reviews of who are going to be the winners and losers, and how we think about cost structures against competing generation types, and then cost sharing, particularly on the first few out of the gate, how we will continue to work with this new administration around supporting nuclear.\nSo it's something that is a point of emphasis and focus for us, and look for us to continue to advance those efforts in that regard, on top of what we're doing on gas-fired generation development and all the opportunities that we have around renewables and storage, and storage being truly a terrific capacity resource for a long time to come, given how quick it can be deployed and given that it doesn't need a gas connection to make it work.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nResearch Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, thanks so much. Good morning. I was thinking or I was wondering as you book out, well, I'm curious if you're booking 2029 volumes at this point. And if you are, do you have contingencies that you're incorporating into contracts for any potential tax credit risk that might arise just depending on the safe harbor provisions and the clarity from Treasury?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. So first of all, we feel good about our 2029 build. In all of our contracts, we have some limited protections around tax and trade measures, as well as we've talked about on some of our prior calls. But we feel very good about where we stand around our 2029 program.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. I guess looking out even farther, I'm just curious if you're having any discussions on 2030, kind of a no tax credit conversations around pricing, what does demand look like, just any early indications or feedback from your customer base if they're looking out that far, and any feedback you're getting on what the reduction in tax credits on the renewable side could be.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. It's still a little too early on 2030. I mean, most of the focus from our customer base is '29 and in just given their need for power and electrons right now. That's where the demand is. And you can see that just in our originations this quarter about 3.2 GW. So I think we'll naturally see 2030 start to become more of a point of focus probably as we move forward over the next 12 to 24 months. But right now, it's been a lot of attention paid around '27, but '28 and '29 in particular in terms of the need for new generation.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe just on the origination, this quarter, you highlighted 1 GW of backlog adds tied to the hyperscalers. Are you able to share any detail on those particular additions in terms of resource mix, timing, or geography just to get a sense of what's resonating with that customer base?\n\nBrian Bolster\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nHey, Carly. It's Brian. So without going into details with regard to the specific customers or the timing, I mean, it is, you literally kind of need to go customer by customer, region by region. They all have different needs depending on how they're looking at their demand when they're trying to bring that on. There is a lot of focus on the next couple of years, but there's also folks who are looking to build out at the end. So I hate to say it, but it's kind of a mixed bag of really depends by the customer and where they are. And I guess that's why we're able to spend and do well with them because we can meet the customers kind of with their need.\nWe've got a broad pipeline and portfolio that allows us to give them a little bit of every flavor that they're interested in. So there is no kind of common theme other than engaging in dialogue on a national basis over multiple years.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Okay. Great. Thank you for that. Then just back to the comments earlier on the natural pull forward in demand, I guess. Are there practical limitations to the degree to which you could accelerate development plans, whether labor, supply chain, or connection, that could be pain points on the kind of ability to get projects online by that 2029, 2030 timeframe?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nI think all those things you just listed are actually competitive advantages and why we would do really well in a pull forward market because we have each of the things that you listed, whether it's sites, interconnects, engineering, construction, supply chain, balance sheet. All of those things are massive competitive advantages for us compared to the rest of the industry, and I think create substantial opportunities for us in a pull forward scenario.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question. Two questions. On the gas generation front, what regions of the United States are you seeing more traction, and does the FERC ERIS decision from yesterday impact your outlook and MISO?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. I mean, I think, first of all, we're seeing gas generation demand really across the country. So if you look at our gas development pipeline, it's not focused in any one region. I mean, if you're looking at getting gas online quicker, obviously, there are states that are more accommodating to be able to do that. Texas, obviously, is one that comes to mind in that regard.\nWhen I think about the ERIS decision yesterday by MISO, sure, that could create some additional opportunities, but you're going to have to be able to also monitor through where is their gas supply, how long will it take to get the turbine, and, more importantly, aside from gas supply and the turbine, the labor, some of the skilled labor constraints that we've seen in that sector, what does that do to timing in terms of being able to bring those assets in line? But certainly something that we are focused on. And that's why I think, given the timing of some of those projects, we're going to continue to need an all-of-the-above solution to accommodate the demand that we are seeing in those regions.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks. And then what are the key technical milestones remaining on Duane Arnold, and would you expect any ramp in the labor force in the coming months in order to hit the reiterated guidance around execution?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. I mean, it's the typical work that you would expect on a recommissioning, right? Doing work across the site, looking at what the condition of the site is in, looking at containment in particular, looking at the equipment, all those things we feel good about based on what we have seen so far, and things continue to progress well.\n\nRyan Levine\n\nEquity Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude our question-and-answer session as well as our conference call for today.

You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is once again off to a strong start for the year, delivering solid Q1 results. Adjusted earnings per share increased by nearly 9% year-over-year, reflecting solid financial and operational performance across FPL and Energy Resources. FPL placed into service 894MW of new solar, and Energy Resources originated approximately 3.2GW of new renewables and storage projects. We continue to see strong demand for new sources of generation across all sectors of the US economy.\nFor perspective, we expect more than 450GW of cumulative demand for new generation between now and 2030 in the United States. To meet this demand, we believe it's important to exercise what I describe as energy realism and energy pragmatism. Let me explain. Energy realism is about embracing all forms of energy solutions and understanding the demand for electricity in the United States is here now, and it's not slowing down. Frankly, it's unlike anything we've ever seen since the end of World War II.\nEnergy pragmatism is about recognizing some technology is ready at scale today and other technology needs more time to get there, and there will be significant trade-offs with regard to the timing and cost of each. Today, renewables and battery storage are the lowest cost form of power generation and capacity, and we can build these projects and get new electrons on the grid in 12 to 18 months. We should be thinking about renewables and battery storage as a critical bridge to when other technology is ready at scale, like new gas-fired plants.\nWe expect 75GW of new gas to come online between now and 2030. That is significant for sure, but nowhere close to meeting the over 450GW of total generation we believe are needed. It's also important to understand that gas-fired plants will come online at a higher cost than renewables and storage. That's because gas turbines are in short supply and in high demand. It's also proving difficult to reestablish the highly skilled workforce required to build these complex power plants.\nGas-fired combined cycle plants rely on approximately 1,000 workers across dozens of niche trades. We've learned EPCs are hiring thousands of extra people to address high washout rates, with some workers leaving earlier for higher-paying jobs building, for example, LNG terminals, data centers, semiconductor chip manufacturing facilities, and other industrial facilities. Other workers are showing up to job sites without the necessary skills.\nAll of this puts upward pressure on prices and the time to build gas plants. It's why the cost to build a gas-fired plant has tripled in the last few years and is poised to increase even further due to tariff exposure. We believe nuclear will continue to play an important role in meeting demand, but again, we need to be practical about when that will happen. There are limited opportunities to restart shuttered nuclear units. Two are underway in our sector, and we continue to evaluate bringing our own Duane Arnold facility in Iowa back online.\nBeyond those limited opportunities, SMR technology is still 10 years away at scale in the best of scenarios and at a much higher price point than gas-fired generation. There's also an option to defer coal retirements to meet demand, but even if we kept online every coal plant in America slated to retire, it would only add approximately 40GW to the grid, and many are months away from retirement or are already slated to be converted to gas, again, far short of the over 450GW needed between now and 2030. Bottom line, don't take this as picking winners and losers. It's not, nor can it be.\nAmerica is going to need all forms of energy to meet this enormous demand, but we need to be practical about when technologies will be available at scale and how much they'll cost when they show up, all of which factors into how Americans pay how much Americans pay on their electric bill each month. This is why energy policy in Washington is so important and why we cannot isolate ourselves to just a couple of technologies like gas and nuclear, which are much more expensive than they've ever been and take far longer to build. We say all this as a company in our space that does it all.\nNextEra Energy is the quintessential all-forms-of-energy company. We know renewables and storage because we're a world leader in the space. We know gas because we operate the largest gas-fired fleet in America and have built more gas-fired generation than anyone over the last two decades. We know nuclear because we operate one of the largest fleets in the United States, and we know how to serve growth because we've been doing it for decades across the United States and in Florida, which brings me to Florida Power & Light Company.\nFPL is proof that embracing all forms of energy works, especially during periods of growth. Florida is the nation's third largest state, and people continue to move here. In fact, we've added more than 1.3 million new customer accounts in the last 20 years, making us roughly 30% larger than we were in 2005. Despite the incredible growth, FPL consistently delivers high reliability while having customer bills significantly below the national average, and we continue to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition.\nAs we celebrate our 100-year anniversary at FPL, our vision remains the same: to continue making smart capital investments for the benefit of our customers, be an industry leader on cost, and deliver high reliability and outstanding customer service while keeping bills low for our customers. To continue driving customer value and to power Florida's growth, we've been deploying the most cost-effective option for customers: solar and storage, and now have approximately 8.4GW of solar and batteries installed across Florida.\nIn all, our generation strategy has saved customers more than $16 billion in avoided fuel costs since 2001. Looking ahead at FPL, we continue to see growth on the horizon, and we are projecting to add roughly 335,000 customer accounts through 2029. To continue to meet growth and reliably serve customers, FPL plans to invest nearly $50 billion from 2025 to 2029 and add more than 25GW of new generation and battery storage by 2034. On 28 February 2024, we submitted testimony and detailed information for FPL's 2025 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2026 through 2029 base rate plan is consistent with the test year letter filed in December.\nThe stability of multi-year plans has allowed FPL to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills low, and has enabled FPL to maintain a strong balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills and high reliability for Floridians and our plans to build an even more resilient energy future for Florida.\nWe believe FPL is strategically positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest-growing states in the US, and we plan to meet Florida's long-term growth outlook with investments in generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure, which we believe will further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. Energy Resources had a strong quarter originating approximately 3.2GW of new renewables and battery storage projects.\nThis marks the fifth time over the past seven quarters that Energy Resources has added more than 3GW to its backlog, a sign of the continued strong demand for new generation. Energy Resources also had its largest solar origination quarter and largest solar and battery storage origination quarter ever, again demonstrating the strong demand for renewables and storage because they are low cost and can be deployed now.\nAssuming we achieve the midpoint of our development expectations range, Energy Resources will be operating a more than 70GW generation and storage portfolio by the end of 2027. Taking FPL and Energy Resources together, we believe NextEra Energy has the most comprehensive power generation business in the world and is well positioned to capitalize on long-term growth prospects. There has been ample discussion about tariffs these last few weeks.\nWhile this has forced some companies to look at their supply chains for the first time, we've spent the last three years diversifying and domesticating ours to strategically position our supplier relationships to manage potential disruption. For perspective, we've dramatically diversified where we source our solar panels. As a result, we don't source solar panels from countries impacted by the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty tariff rates announced earlier this week. Plus, we source our wind turbines from the US with manufacturing in Florida.\nbecause of our buying power, we have been able to significantly shift tariff risk to suppliers. After discussion with our suppliers, we currently estimate Energy Resources has less than $150 million in tariff exposure through 2028 on over $75 billion in expected capital spend. That's less than 0.2% of potential impact to our capital spend before exercising contractual trade measure protections in our contracts with customers.\nSize and scale matter more than ever in today's environment. Suppliers want us to be repeat customers, and our customers want certainty, certainty that comes with doing business with an industry leader like NextEra Energy that has a long track record of delivering on its commitments. Once we work with our customers, we expect our $150 million tariff exposure to be significantly reduced, potentially down to zero. Still, we continue to look for ways to further mitigate trade risk and use our supply chain management capabilities to create new opportunities.\nOur team had the foresight last year to secure arrangements to purchase US-made batteries for a significant portion of our backlog, with the remainder of the batteries sourced outside of China where tariff exposure is contractually allocated to the supplier. Batteries are already more than two times cheaper than gas-fired plants available now and much more flexible to interconnect to the grid. Taking most tariff exposure off the table for our customers in need of battery storage solutions is a big win and a way for us to meet demand while keeping bills low for customers. Our battery sourcing strategy gives us optionality and favorable pricing through our already secured domestic battery supply contracts.\nIn short, our tariff exposure on batteries is expected to be negligible, and we expect our domestic sourcing options to create significant competitive advantages for us and our customers going forward as we originate new battery storage projects. Finally, we now have nearly $37 billion of interest rate hedges in place that allows us to flexibly manage interest rate exposure over the coming years, including interest rate hedges on 100% of our backlog and a large portion of our upcoming maturities. In fact, we entered into swaps as part of our programmatic hedging strategy when interest rates sharply declined in early April after reciprocal tariffs were announced, putting our hedged risk-free rate at roughly 3.9%.\nOur interest rate sensitivity is included in the appendix of today's presentation. Before I hand it over to Mike, I want to briefly touch on last month's planned leadership transition announcement. As we announced in March, after 18 years of service to NextEra Energy, Rebecca Kujawa will be retiring. Rebecca has had an incredible career at our company and has brought a strong strategic perspective and leadership approach to everything she's accomplished.\nBrian Bolster will succeed Rebecca as president and CEO at NextEra Energy Resources. Brian has done an amazing job as our CFO and has the ideal combination of capabilities, experience, and customer relationships to lead one of America's largest energy infrastructure development companies. Mike Dunne has been promoted and will succeed Brian as CFO of NextEra Energy. Mike has deep financial acumen and vast knowledge of the energy industry, having spent his entire career in this sector. Both Brian and Mike are effectively transitioning into their new roles. We believe we have the best team in the industry with a track record of delivering day in and day out.\nThere is no team better equipped or better positioned to help meet this unique moment. That's not to say it will be easy. The enormous electricity demand in the United States creates challenges, and not getting this right risks higher power prices. This is where NextEra Energy shines. We thrive when the stakes are high. We lean into complexity. It's what differentiates us.\nMany companies are approaching this moment from a standing start. We've been running this marathon for decades, and I couldn't be more optimistic about our prospects to deliver for our customers with the outstanding team we have in place. With that, let me turn it over to Mike, who will review Q1 results in more detail.\n\nMike Dunne\n\nTreasurer, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, John. For the Q1 of 2025, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.07 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 8.1% year-over-year.We continue to expect FPL to realize more than 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreement's four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.4 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full-year capital investments to be between $8 and $8.8 billion.\nFor the 12 months ending March 2025, FPL's reported return on equity for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6%. During the Q1, we utilized approximately $622 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of roughly $274 million. As we previously discussed, FPL historically uses more reserve amortization in the first half of the year. We expect this trend to continue this year. This quarter, FPL placed into service 894MW of new cost-effective solar, putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at over 7.9GW, which is the largest utility-owned solar portfolio in the country.\nIn April, FPL filed its annual Ten-Year Site Plan, which continues to indicate that solar and storage are the most cost-effective options for customers to add reliable grid energy and capacity over the next decade. The 2025 plan projects the need for over 17GW of cost-effective solar generation across our service territory over the next 10 years. As a complement to FPL's planned solar additions, FPL is planning to deploy over 7.6GW of battery storage, which provides cost-effective capacity.\nWith this plan, we expect to increase FPL's solar mix from approximately 9% of our total generation in 2024 to approximately 35% in 2034, while continuing to provide customers with low-cost and reliable energy. As John mentioned, on 28 February 2024, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for FPL's 2025 base rate proceeding.\nWe are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.5 billion starting in January 2026, $927 million in January 2027, and a Solar Base Rate Adjustment, or SOBER, mechanism to recover revenue requirements for solar and battery storage projects in 2028 and 2029. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential customer bill will grow at an average rate of about 2.5% from January 2025 through the end of 2029, which is expected to result in FPL's typical residential bill being approximately 25% below the projected national average and more than 20% lower than our typical bills 20 years ago when adjusted for inflation.\nThe Florida Public Service Commission has established a schedule for this proceeding, beginning with quality of service hearings in May and technical hearings in mid-August. The proceedings would likely conclude in Q4, with staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and are focused on achieving a balanced outcome that supports continued smart investments for the benefit of our customers. Key indicators show that Florida's economy remains healthy.\nFlorida continues to be one of the fastest-growing states in the nation and had three of the five fastest-growing US metro areas between 2023 and 2024. FPL had a strong quarter of customer growth, with the average number of customers increasing by nearly 108,000 from the comparable prior year period. FPL's Q1 retail sales increased by approximately 1.8% year-over-year. After taking weather into account, Q1 retail sales increased by roughly 0.6% on a weather-normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued favorable underlying population growth.\nNow let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of nearly 10% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our power generation portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.03 per share during the quarter, associated with various puts and takes in the business. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business decreased by $0.01 per share. Contributions from NextEra Energy Transmission increased $0.01 per share year-over-year.\nAll of their impacts decreased by $0.05 per share, driven by higher interest costs of $0.06 per share, half of which are related to new borrowing costs to support our new investments. As we previously disclosed and as we de-emphasize the business, we have reclassified gas infrastructure to include gas pipelines in existing clean energy and upstream gas infrastructure in customer supply. Gas pipelines and upstream gas infrastructure each had a $0.01 decline in the quarter. Energy Resources originated approximately 3.2GW of new renewables and storage to the backlog.\nWith these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 28GW after taking into account 0.7GW of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call. This highlights the continued strong growth for renewables and storage. We're also excited to announce our first solar repowering project, which we expect to be completed in 2026. Going forward, we plan to include both wind and solar repowering megawatts in the newly updated repowering line of our development expectations.\nOur backlog additions represent the diverse power demand that we are seeing across industries. Roughly 40% of our backlog additions are driven by commercial and industrial customer demand, while 60% are driven by demand from power companies. As evidenced by our nearly 1GW additions, our customers continue to choose battery storage as the lowest-cost, ready-now solution to meet their capacity needs. Turning now to our Q1 2025 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.03 per share year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged.\nWe will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2025, 2026, and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2026, off of a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that, we will open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Steve Fleischmann with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Fleischmann\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, good morning. Thank you. first, just related to the tariff disclosure you provided, which sounded very good, the battery portion where you're moving a lot domestic, I assume that means you're also getting domestic battery cells as part of that? Is that right?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThe way the contract works, we get certain components. Steve, sorry. I cut off there for a minute. Let me start over.\n\nSteve Fleischmann\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nNo worries.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nWith the domestic battery contract that we have entered into, it is assembled here in the United States. There are certain components that come in from outside the United States, but because it's assembled here and it has enough concentration here in the US, it qualifies for domestic content. We have contractual protections in the agreement in place regarding the qualification for domestic content.\nAlso, to the extent that there is any tariff exposure related to any imported parts or components related to those batteries, those are protected as well and backstopped by substantial credit so that is a domestic contract, and that's the way investors should think about it.\n\nSteve Fleischmann\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Thanks for that. Then just in terms of the tariff exposure, which you've talked for a long time about making sure that you're protected there with your suppliers, obviously, one of the issues can be making sure that the suppliers still supply while they absorb tariffs. Just how do you feel about the supplier health to kind of meet the commitments as well?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nI feel good. I feel very good for two reasons. One, given the buying power that NextEra has, suppliers don't want to disappoint, and they want to make sure they follow through. They're looking at this as a long game for their business. Second, the way our contracts are set up with our credit protections in the agreement, there's a very strong incentive to follow through on those commitments and then the third point that I would make is that the US still remains an extremely attractive market to suppliers across the globe, being that they have a lot of margin when they deliver into the US. We put those three things together, I lose no sleep over whether or not our suppliers will fall through on their commitments and deliver into the US.\n\nSteve Fleischmann\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Got it. Makes sense. Then just on the switching to a lot of focus these days on IRA, obviously, and changes, and specifically on transferability. Maybe just one clarification on transferability is, in the event, hypothetically, if it were to go away in the future in a bill, would it still be applicable for existing assets that were done under transferability as well as safe harbored assets on transferability?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. There was a recent piece of legislation that was brought forward that basically the Fedorchak bill, I'll use that as an example to answer the question. On the Fedorchak bill, the way it was structured is that you'd see tech-neutral eliminated through a phase down, but with transferability of eventually being phased out there. However, under the non-tech-neutral portion, there would be an ability to continue the safe harbor for four years, and transferability is left in place there. It all comes down to the drafting, Steve, at the end of the day.\nThat's how that bill was drafted. It would depend on the ultimate outcome and drafting of future bills. Let me just make a couple of comments on transferability. We spent a lot of time, obviously, advocating for tax credits and transferability for good reason. The reasons are, I think, well-known by investors. Gas has its limitations in terms of availability. For the reasons I went through in the prepared remarks, they're a lot more expensive. Gas turbines have been hit by tariffs too, and a lot of folks don't talk about that, which is actually going to, I think we had put the proxy at 2,400kW at our development day. It's probably closer to 2,600 to 2,800 today.\nWhen you factor in tariffs, gas turbines have actually been hit harder than, I think, solar or wind or storage in that regard and so we need a bridge, and that bridge has to come from renewables and storage because we have all this demand today. It's got to be met by something. The ability to transfer credits, it goes hand in glove with the credit itself. You have to be able to monetize the credit to be able to get the benefit back to the customer.\nI'll use a couple of examples. Utilities, for example, right? This is one of the things that we continue to stress in Washington. Utilities, historically, have struggled to use tax equity financing. Commissions won't approve it. You have to sell half the plant to qualify for tax equity financing. How do you get the benefit, which we calculate to be a 12% increase in household income to the ultimate utility customer without the ability to transfer the credit? Nuclear, I'll use as an example.\nWith nuclear, a tax equity structure doesn't work, right? There's no bank that's going to take a 50% ownership interest in a nuclear plant and so you have to have transferability for nuclear as well. Nuclear is going to play an important part of our future. It's definitely a focus of this administration. 45X as well. If you didn't have transferability on credits for wind, solar, storage, nuclear, 45X becomes very difficult, right? How do you stimulate all these investments, 80% of which are going into Republican jurisdictions, when you're trying to convince the CEO to build a manufacturing facility under 45X?\nIf the credit's not there with the ability to transfer it on the back end for wind, solar, battery storage, the demand for the product is not there either. What's the incentive to invest billions of dollars in the manufacturing facility under a 45X credit? When you put all these things together, credits and transferability go together. You can't have one without the other. That's a message we're bringing to Washington. It's one that's being well understood. I think the evidence lies in the fact that we just had 21 House representatives, Republican House representatives sign on to a letter saying, \"Don't touch the credits. Don't touch transferability.\"\nWe had four senators sign on to a very similar letter. They get it. They get the two go together. Will it be a little bit of a bumpy ride as we maybe see some proposed bills? Sure. I think at the end of the day, folks in Washington understand that transferability and tax credits are hand in glove and go together. You have to have an ability to monetize the tax credit.\n\nSteve Fleischmann\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, John, team, thank you all very much. Congrats again on all the new roles here. Very well deserved. Hey, John, maybe just to start with a little bit of a more mundane question. You're talking about going to the higher end of the range here at NEER. Do you want to talk a little bit about what the contributing factors are there for 2025? Then I've got a quick follow-up on what you just said there.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. When I think about higher end of the range, I start with the Q1 results, right? We're already out of the gate at 9%. We have a business plan that we feel good about, feel good about executing against. I don't think there's a whole lot more to say about that.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nAwesome. Thank you. Look, really appreciate the details on transferability. I know folks have been very keen to hear from you guys on that. Related here, can you speak a little bit on the timing dynamics on when and how that ultimately will work? You say in your remarks, \"Once we work with our customers.\" How do you think about the impact $150 from a timing perspective on 2025 versus is that really going to get to that zero in 2026?\nIt seems like this is sort of an assumption that principally the tariff impact is going to impact customers with higher PPAs, and you're going to go back to them today, perhaps like what we saw before with maybe some of the COVID impacts.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nJulien, your question's on tariffs, right? Not transferability?\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. No, I thank you on the transferability.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nLet me make sure I got focused on transferability. You pivoted tariffs, can you clarify your question on tariffs just so I understand the transferability question?\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Sorry. The timing of that, right? You talk about supply chain. You say once you work with your customers, how do you think about the timeline for working with your customers? Is the reason for your tariff exposure to be fairly low principally because you are passing along those costs to your customers in revised PPAs, or do you have existing contractual terms?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Let me take those in pieces. Let's just start with the supplier first. When we look at our entire backlog, right, and we look at our projected Q2 originations, and we look out at development expectations that we've told investors, we think that we're looking at around $150 million of exposure on tariffs. That is based on the contractual protections we have in our existing contracts with suppliers and the discussions that we have had with them since liberation day on 2 April so that's the first piece. That works you down to 150.\nThen the point we were making in the prepared remarks is that not only do we have the ability to shift tariff risk to suppliers and supply contracts, which I just covered, we also have trade measure protection provisions in our customer contracts. we believe we got a really good shot at working with our customers to take that $150 million exposure down significantly, and perhaps even down to zero if we use the track record we had around circumvention, a lot of lessons learned there. These are rights that we already have embedded in our agreements. When I think about where we stand, I feel very good about tariffs. It's just not going to have much of an impact at all on our business.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nIf I can clarify quickly, the reason there's 150 is because you have to go back and clarify the contracts?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThe reason that it is 150 is that there are certain risk-sharing mechanisms in contracts. Most of the contracts, the supplier takes all the risk. Some of the contracts, they take almost all the risk except for a small sliver that we work through with them.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. All right. Thank you guys very much. Thank you, John\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nHey, and Julien, I want to make one more point, and I want to make sure folks understand this from the remarks. That's $150 million on $75 billion of CapEx. That's less than 0.2%. We feel like we've got a good shot at getting that to zero. Incredible, honestly. Final point I'll make is, and Steve asked me a little bit about it, but there's been a lot written about battery exposure. We don't have battery exposure. Full stop. We do not have battery exposure. We are really well positioned. We entered into a domestic contract. We have actually a real opportunity rather than a risk around batteries.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to close the loop on the tariff discussions, just where do you think returns are from an IRR perspective or an ROE perspective? These protections that you have in place versus your competitors could make you more competitive, I would think. Does that boost your returns, or do you see these kind of remaining flat in the post-tariff world? Maybe you could address that.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nHey, that's a great question, Nick. I look at it a couple of different ways. First of all, we're in great shape on our returns for all the obvious reasons we just covered. I don't think I need to spend time on that. I look at this as a huge opportunity for us because we compete, again, against a lot of small developers, and they don't have the buying power, the leverage in contracts to be able to shift risk like we can. We started looking at this three years ago. We've been at it. We didn't just wake up on 6 November and say, \"Oh my God, what do we do about our supply chain?\" We've been thinking about this for years and so we put the right things in place.\nThis is going to create a lot of opportunity for us. If circumvention is any example, what happened in circumvention is a lot of small developers blew themselves up, couldn't satisfy their commitments with their customers, and a lot of demand came our way. I would expect that's my point around opportunity, that given the position that we're in around tariffs, I expect a lot of opportunity to come our way as small developers just aren't in the position we are. They're trying to absorb a significant amount of risk, particularly those that have entered into contracts for batteries because they probably are buying from Chinese manufacturers and don't have domestic contracts and don't have the position that we have.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks for that. Then just maybe a quick update on where you stand in the Duane Arnold contracting opportunity. I think you were working through an engineering study beforehand. How is that kind of progressing and how have discussions been in terms of getting a contract for this site? Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nIt's going great. We continue to make a lot of progress at Duane Arnold. We have seen no showstoppers there and continue to see a lot of demand for generation from the project so I think it continues to be an opportunity that's exciting for us. Look, we continue to work at it as we move forward.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nI just want to touch base, I guess, on the GEV partnership and if there's any updates that you can provide to us. Granted, it's recent since you talked about the Developer Day, but just wondering any updated thoughts to share there?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Things under the framework agreement continue to advance. We've been doing work together on the customer origination side. As a matter of fact, we hosted an event last week that we called Deploy following Development Day, where Scott and I jointly hosted a number of companies across various sectors, and very fruitful. We continue to try to advance opportunities on that front, particularly around large-scale load.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. Maybe just kind of continuing with this a little bit more, just wanted to see, I guess, as you talked a lot about gas development timeline for new turbines, but just as we look in the outer years here, just wondering how you think, I guess, gas power factors in for hyperscalers specifically, I guess. How conversations are going there given decarbonization goals, but the attributes that gas can offer as well. Just any updated thoughts there would be great.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. It's interesting because we talked a lot about this at Development Day. There's three things we shoot for, right? One is just achieving the development expectations. I'll call it kind of the status quo plain vanilla business that we advance every quarter. The second is large load, and that kind of falls in the two camps. One is behind-the-meter discussions, and the second is front-of-the-meter discussions and we continue to see a strong preference by hyperscalers for front-of-the-meter solutions, which means ultimately a three-way conversation, right, between us, investor-owned utilities, and the hyperscaler because the hyperscaler wants two things, right?\nThey want the reliability that comes with being interconnected to the grid that you don't get from behind the meter. Two, they want the optionality of being able to monetize power if need be, which also comes by being interconnected to the grid, so that's kind of how I see the market moving forward. We also do continue dialogue around behind the meter. There's a premium, obviously, that has to be paid for the additional redundancy you have to build on the generation side.\nFor some, that's worth pursuing because the grid can be difficult to access in certain parts of the United States, can take five, seven years and is the additional premium for redundant generation worth the avoided cost of not having to go through trying to get interconnected? Even in those situations, they're looking for a path ultimately to be interconnected to the grid.\nFrom a gas standpoint, which is really your question, definitely something that they are looking at as part of the solution but they also remain observant and cautious about wanting to understand what the carbon offset is to the emissions off the plant, which is, I think, where our skill set comes to bear perfectly because we can, through VPPAs and other arrangements, provide a nice combination of gas fired generation together with renewable solutions that provide a nice large-scale fix that can leave the site essentially carbon neutral or close to carbon neutral at the end of the day, which is very attractive to these customers.\nI think that's why we are uniquely positioned to serve that market in partnership with the terrific relationships that we've been able to build with investors in utilities over the last 20 or 30 years, and with the strong relationships we have with the hyperscale market. More to come on that.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much. Wanted to go back to transferability just for a quick follow-up there. Wondering what the contingency plan might be if there were changes or restrictions on the use of tax credit transfers. What would the financing alternative be as you think about your overall kind of holistic financing plan?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYep. Great question. As we look, and if you think about our company over two decades before 2022, we used tax equity to finance our tax credits, and we were able to do that in a very programmatic and good basis. If we look today, we are seeing a flight to quality from tax equity providers coming to us where they're looking because our projects get done on time because they perform and what we've seen over the course of the last two years is essentially a doubling of the tax equity providers looking to work with us.\nAlso, a key piece of our transfer program allows us to pick the best project returns between transferability and tax equity. When it comes to PTC projects, the returns can be higher in times of transferability, but from a credit perspective, essentially the same outcome. As we work through, we've done this for 20 years. We're seeing tax equity come to us, and so we're not saying that there will be no impacts. We feel very good about where we sit from a financing perspective for transferability.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Okay. That's helpful. Then I appreciate the comments you gave to Jeremy's question. I was wondering, maybe a bit higher level, what are you seeing in terms of renewable demand trends from tech customers specifically and data center opportunities? Has there been, I guess, any change in the interest there or the load growth or demand growth that you're seeing from the data center side of things?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nShort answer is no change. We continue to see a lot of appetite for renewables and it fits perfectly with the discussion that we continue to have on the GE Vernova side around providing gas fired generation as a potential solution as well but they remain very focused too on renewables, right? They're ready now. They're low cost. They're an offset for gas if they ultimately decide to go that route in a part of the country that doesn't have excess grid capacity and load studies taking too long to complete.\nWhen I look at the demand and the outlook in the renewable sector going forward, and we always are looking a quarter out or so, I mean, we just continue to see strong demand across the board and with hyperscalers being a nice sized part of that.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Excellent. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe a higher level one. Just as you think about the backlog additions, can you talk a bit about the 2024 to 2027 plan relative to the additions for post-2027 delivery? Do you see any risk around project slippage beyond the current plan into 2028 plus just given the more uncertain macro environment and potentially more complex contract discussions, or do you still feel confident in the execution there?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, Carly, I mean, good question. Maybe I'll start just with circumvention and remind folks that when we saw circumvention, we did see some shifting out in demand, right? That's impacted, I think, some of the near-term development expectations with us forecast to come in the low end of the range on the 2024, 2025 numbers. You can see that in the development forecast write-up, but then we were also able to push those projects in the 2026, 2027, 2028, and some of the out years.\nI think that dynamic was more specific to circumvention than it is here. I think here there's just so much demand and a need for electrons right now where customers just can't afford to wait and gas is such a long-term solution. We've gone up from four and a half years to build a combined cycle unit to six or longer and so needing the electrons now, I think that is forcing more near-term demand. Obviously, some of the impact too will ultimately, depending on where we come out with Washington, but you've heard my comments there.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. That's really helpful. Thank you. I'll leave it there.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bill Appicelli with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. Just a couple of questions on the utility. The Ten-Year Site Plan that you guys filed, how should we think about that impacting the capital expenditure program relative to the $34 to 37 billion? Does that have any impact on that, or is it sort of post that, and should we assume a higher run rate than the sort of 8.8% to 8.9% that you've outlined for 2026, 2027?\n\nArmando Pimentel Jr.\n\nPresident and CEO of Florida Power & Light Company, NextEra Energy\n\nIt's Armando, Bill. Good morning. I don't think you think about it any differently. The CapEx plan that we filed in our rate case for the next four years is roughly $50 billion of CapEx, right, over the next four years. The 8.8% or so that you just highlighted is roughly in line with what our expectations would be over the next four years. And it's driven by making sure that we continue to do the best thing for our customers.\nWe expect 335,000 new customers over the next four years in the FPL area, and that drives a lot of investment, and then the additional investment, part of that $50 billion, is to make sure that we can continue to make our customers' value proposition better. I think it's more of the same.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Then regarding the rate case, is settlement still a preferred outcome here, and is that window of time ahead of those technical hearings in August?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nI think settlement's always something that's on the table. Obviously, it takes two sides to, in our case, since there's a number of intervenors, more than two sides to come together to get to, for us, a conclusion that's good for our customers, right? This is all about our customers and making sure that we can get the best outcome for them long-term. If you look at historically, excuse me, where we've had settlements, they've generally been anywhere from six weeks before the rate case is supposed to start, which in this case would be mid-August, to right before or right after the actual rate case.\nIf there is going to be a settlement, then that's the likely outcome. Certainly, it could happen outside of that time. It could happen at any time. Our focus right now is really on putting together the best case that we can for our customers starting mid-August.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Then just one last quick one. The 11.6% ROE, given the amount of surplus amortization that was utilized, I mean, should that trend a little bit lower over the balance of the year, or is the expectation that that can be maintained?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nWe're required at the beginning of the year to file with our commission and let them know what our expectations are for the year. Obviously, that can change. You saw that change last year when we lowered it but our expectation is the 11.6% is about right based on the expectations that we have for normal weather this year. We'll obviously take a look at that every quarter, but 11.6% is our expectation for the year right now.\n\nBill Appicelli\n\nAnalyst, UBS",

With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy had strong operational and financial performance in 2024, delivering full-year adjusted earnings per share of $3.43, up over 8% from 2023, once again at the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. Since 2021, we have delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of over 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. In fact, if you looked over the last five, 10, 15, and 20 years, you will see the same absolute and relative performance. Our consistent financial outperformance is due, first and foremost, to the efforts and execution by our team.\nI couldn't be more proud of how our team has continued to deliver, and I firmly believe that our track record of execution positions us to lead the build-out of energy infrastructure across the country in the coming years.\nNextEra Energy offers a unique value proposition with two strong businesses that we believe are strategically well-positioned to meet the growing needs of our customers with outstanding prospects for future growth. FPL is the largest electric utility in the US, and Energy Resources is the world's leader in renewables and storage. Together, we operate the largest natural gas-fired generation fleet in the country, are one of the largest nuclear operators in the US, and are widely viewed as an industry leader in transmission.\nWe are one of the top five infrastructure investors in the United States, and we have invested more than $150 billion in our nation's energy infrastructure over the last decade, building everything from nuclear uprates, natural gas pipelines, and natural gas-fired generation to battery storage and renewables.\nOver the next four years alone, we plan to invest roughly $120 billion across the country, which would allow us to grow our combined fleet to roughly 121GW. FPL and Energy Resources individually have executed well, delivering value for our customers and shareholders. We have one of the sector's strongest balance sheets, and between the two companies, we placed into service approximately 8.7GW of new renewables and storage projects in 2024. Let me start by giving you an update on each of our businesses and then provide you with some comments on the state of our industry.\nFPL continues to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition in one of the fastest-growing states in the US.\nAs we approach our 100-year anniversary at FPL, our vision remains the same: to continue making smart capital investments for the benefit of our customers, be an industry leader on cost, and deliver high reliability and outstanding customer service while keeping bills as low as possible for our customers. In 2024, we continue to see the fruits of that smart capital spend. For nearly two decades, FPL has invested in building a stronger, smarter, and more storm-resilient grid. The performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening, undergrounding, automation, and smart grid investments are providing significant benefits to our customers.\nOur investments in smart grid technology enabled us to avoid more than 2.7 million outages in 2024, and those investments paid off as our team responded exceptionally well in response to hurricanes Debbie, Helene, and Milton.\nWe are able to deliver this performance and keep our bills 40% below the national average because of our focus on capital and operating efficiency, and innovation. FPL continues to make smart capital investments in low-cost solar generation and battery storage, further reducing our overall fuel cost. During the year, we placed into service more than 2.2GW of new, cost-effective solar, and we expect to add more than 15GW by 2033. When combined with generation modernizations, these additions have saved customers more than $16 billion since 2001. We also continue to focus on running the business more efficiently.\nIn 2024, we improved upon our best-in-class non-fuel O&M cost per customer, which was already 70% better than the industry's national average, saving customers over $3 billion per year versus an average-performing utility. Innovation has been one of the keys to our operating efficiency.\nFPL is the only utility in the nation to remotely operate its fossil fleet. Our Fleet Control Center is one of the world's largest monitoring and diagnostic centers and the first in the industry to remotely operate a more than 20GW natural-gas combined-cycle fleet from a single location, providing real-time troubleshooting with engineering, maintenance, and operation support, and delivering world-class predictive analytics and diagnostics. This is just one example of the innovative efforts by FPL to reduce costs for our customers while continuing to provide exceptional service.\nLate last year, FPL filed a test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2026.\nThe stability of multi-year rate plans has allowed FPL to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills as low as possible, and has enabled FPL to maintain a strong balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills and high reliability for Floridians and our plans to build an even more resilient energy future for Florida.\nWe believe FPL is strategically well-positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest-growing states in the US, with a population growth rate that is expected to grow 60% more than the national average by 2030. We plan to meet Florida's long-term growth outlook with investments in generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure, which we believe will further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.\nEnergy Resources had another record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 12GW to our backlog, which includes approximately 3.3GW since our last call, a sign of the momentum of demand for new generation, renewables, and storage in particular. These additions to our backlog increased 30% from the 9GW we originated in 2023, our second best year ever. To put that into context, 12GW is the size of a large utility in the US.\nEnergy Resources also had a record year in solar origination and a record year in battery storage origination, again demonstrating the strong demand for renewables and storage because they are low cost and can be deployed now. Focusing for a moment on battery storage, we have deployed more than 3.4 GW in total and currently have more than 7.2GW in our backlog.\nOur extensive portfolio of existing operating sites, which have excess transmission capacity and are nearly 30GW of standalone storage interconnection queue positions, means we can dramatically speed up our deployments, a distinct competitive advantage that no one else in this industry has. We also continue to be a leader in serving data center customers with our total renewables portfolio, including assets in operation and in backlog, at 8.3GW.\nHowever, one point that I believe is being overlooked is that power demand is everywhere, across all sectors and increasingly across utilities, municipalities, and electric cooperatives, as our 12GW-year of backlog additions reflects. And as demand for power increases across all customer classes as we advance our domestic economic agenda, so does the potential price of power unless we bring new generation online quickly to meet that demand.\nCustomers of all types are looking for low-cost ways to meet their growing power needs while reducing their exposure to higher power prices over time. Given the current power demand environment, it is more important than ever to unleash all forms of electric generation, starting with renewables, which are ready now, as I will discuss more in a minute. There is no better example of this than our own portfolio. We have originated more than 3GW in three of the last five quarters, and assuming we achieve the midpoint of our development expectations range,\nEnergy Resources will be operating a roughly 75GW renewables portfolio by the end of 2027, which would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but seven countries. In 2024, we continue to demonstrate our leadership as a supplier of choice for buyers of new generation.\nWe announced two framework agreements with two Fortune 50 companies that have the potential to develop renewables and storage projects totaling up to 10.5GW between now and 2030, as well as a joint development agreement with Entergy. When combined, our announced framework agreements total up to a potential 15GW, demonstrating our unique position in the market and our customers' confidence in our ability to help meet the nation's need for power. We are not sitting still as we think about our value proposition for our customers. We are constantly looking to make sure we have the most comprehensive solution set.\nThat is why today we are pleased to announce a framework agreement with GE Vernova, where we will partner to build natural gas power generation solutions.\nThis agreement has the potential to support multiple gigawatts for data centers, the reshoring of manufacturing, and the electrification of industry, as well as serve investor-owned utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial and industrial customers. Nobody has built more gas-fired generation over the last decade than NextEra Energy, and nobody has sold more gas turbines than GE Vernova.\nThis collaboration brings together the nation's leading operator of natural gas-fired generation and NextEra Energy, and the world's leader in natural gas and electrification technology, and GE Vernova, to jointly develop opportunities that we believe will enable significantly more renewables to meet growing power demand by pairing low-cost renewables for energy with gas-fired generation for capacity.\nOver the next four years, the companies plan to collaborate to identify key locations on the energy grid that would benefit from new generation.\nGE Vernova will incorporate its world-class natural gas generation technologies and critical electric electrification solutions while leveraging its financial service capabilities. NextEra Energy expects to provide customers with integrated renewable, storage, and gas-fired solutions for large loads, something we can uniquely deliver with our scale, experience, technology, and unmatched development skills. This framework agreement is just another example of why we believe Energy Resources has the most comprehensive power generation business in the world and is better positioned than ever to capitalize on long-term growth prospects.\nBefore I turn it over to Brian, I want to take a moment to make some comments regarding the industry as we look to the years ahead. The need to add to the country's power infrastructure is no longer in doubt. Our industry's mandate is to deliver new generation and capacity solutions at the lowest cost possible in order for the US.\nto achieve the new administration's energy dominance agenda. As a leading American energy producer, this is an agenda that we support and believe we are well-positioned to deliver on. At NextEra Energy, we know all forms of energy will be required to meet that mandate. If we don't build new generation to keep up with increasing demand for electricity, power prices are going to go up. Or perhaps worse, new technology or manufacturing load won't be able to connect to the grid, which would slow economic growth, and we could miss opportunities to further our leadership in AI.\nRenewables and storage are ready now to meet that demand and will help lower power prices. Gas-fired generation is moving forward but won't be available at scale until 2030, and then only in certain pockets of the US.\nIn addition, gas-fired generation is more expensive than it's been, with costs having more than doubled over the last five years due to the limited supply of gas turbines, a constrained supply chain, and much higher EPC costs. Nuclear continues to be a much longer-term option, in our opinion, due to first-of-a-kind risks and uncertainty, with near-term opportunities centered on recommissioning and upgrade projects. Nuclear plants across the country are already serving existing demand, and there are only a few nuclear plants that can be recommissioned in the near term in an economic way.\nWe are continuing to make progress in evaluating the recommissioning of our Dwayne Arnold Energy Center in Iowa.\nRecently, we filed notice with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to request a licensing change, an important first step in establishing the regulatory pathway to restore the facility's operating license and potentially restart plant operations as early as the end of 2028. While this is just one part of our broader efforts with regulators, government officials, potential customers, and other stakeholders, we are encouraged by the positive responses we have received so far from all parties involved. We also continue to evaluate alternatives such as SMRs.\nHowever, due to the risks and uncertainty, the practical reality is we are unlikely to add multiple gigawatts of new nuclear to the grid over the next decade.\nThat means we need renewables and storage to meet demand that is here today, and as we move towards the next decade, we can supplement renewables and storage with natural gas-fired generation and, to a more limited extent, nuclear, given the time it will take to develop and build. We know this because we have experience across the entire energy value chain. Our mission is to provide our customers with the lowest cost, most reliable energy, no matter where they are located. We've been doing it for decades in Florida and across the country and are positioned to keep doing it for years to come.\nOur scale and experience tells us that all forms of power generation and capacity will be needed as the US tries to keep up with demand.\nThat same scale and experience also tells us that renewables and storage should continue to be a critical source of new energy and capacity across the country because they are lowest cost and can be deployed now. With that, let me turn it over to Brian, who will review the 2024 results in more detail.\n\nBrian Bolster\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, John. Let's begin with FPL's detailed results. For the full year 2024, FPL's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.12 versus 2023. The principal driver of FPL's 2024 full-year performance was regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 10%. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 10% over the four-year term of our current rate agreement, which runs through 2025. For the full year 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.4%.\nDuring the full year 2024, we used $328 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2024 balance of $895 million. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.8 billion in the Q4, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $8.2 billion. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains strong, and Florida's population continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country. Its GDP is now roughly $1.7 trillion, an increase of approximately 7% over last year. For the Q4 of 2024, FPL's retail sales increased 1.1% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth.\nIn the Q4 of 2024, we added nearly 119,000 customers as compared to the prior year comparable quarter, bringing our total customer accounts to over 6 million.\nFor the full year 2024, FPL's retail sales increased 1.9% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, also driven primarily by the strong customer growth in our service territory. As John mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate case proposal that would cover the four years beginning 2026 through 2029 and provide customers longer-term visibility to the cost of electricity. As a reminder, for the period 2022 through the end of 2025, FPL plans to invest approximately $36 billion, with additional significant investments expected in 2026 and beyond, to continue to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy.\nThis capital will allow FPL to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs as low as possible.\nWhile the benefit of building a stronger, smarter grid and a cleaner, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills, we must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments through base rates. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.55 billion starting in January 2026 and $930 million starting in January 2027.\nWe also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of low-cost generation and capacity additions, and the continuation of our solar and battery base rate adjustment, or SOBRA, mechanism to recover the revenue requirements of these cost-effective projects. FPL plans to propose an ROE midpoint at 11.9%, with an allowed ROE band of ±1%.\nThe 11.9% estimated cost of equity reflects appreciably higher interest rates and other capital markets factors we have experienced since our last rate case, and which we expect to continue during the term of the proposed four-year rate plan. FPL also expects to propose maintaining FPL's long-standing equity ratio approved in prior base rate cases, which is intended to keep it in a position to continue to access capital as needed through 2029.\nWe continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, which starts with an appropriate equity layer and which supports strong credit ratings, remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets, even in times of significant market disruption. It also allows us to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer customers.\nFPL estimates that its proposal, along with the projections for fuel and other costs, will grow a typical residential customer bill by an average annual rate of approximately 2.5% from January 2025 through 2029. If the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal, and assuming other utilities experience bill increases only at their historical rates of increase, we expect FPL's typical customer bills would continue to remain significantly lower than the national average through 2029.\nTo put this proposal in context, it would result in a typical customer bill in January 2026 that is nearly 21% less than it was in real terms 20 years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in February.\nThe timeline for proceeding will ultimately be determined by the commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in Q3 and a final commission decision in Q4 in time for new rates to go into effect in January of 2026. We're open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into five multi-year settlement agreements that have provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty, and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition.\nOur core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we plan to continue to provide updates throughout the process.\nNow let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported full-year adjusted earnings growth of more than 13% year-over-year. For the full year, contributions from new investments increased by $0.48 per share, reflecting continued growth of demand for our renewables and storage portfolio. Contributions from existing clean energy assets increased by $0.03 per share, primarily reflecting improved wind resource during the year and the impact of certain revenue and PTC escalation benefits inherent in our existing assets. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business decreased by $0.08 per share, most of which was recognized in Q2.\nAs we discussed at the time, a combination of higher depletion expense related to an expectation for lower production, certain non-recurring items, and the sale of The Texas Pipeline portfolio resulted in lower relative earnings in that quarter.\nContributions since that time have been effectively flat, consistent with the expectations we provided in the Q2. Our customer supply and trading business, which you'll recall had strong earnings in 2023, decreased results by $0.04 per share, driven by normalization of origination activity and margins, which is consistent with our expectations. Other impacts decreased results by $0.24 per share year-over-year. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.13 per share, nearly half of which is new borrowing to support our build, and half of which reflects increased borrowing costs on existing debt.\nEnergy Resources, again, for the third year in a row, delivered our best year ever for origination, adding more than 12GW of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog, which includes approximately 3.3GW since our last call.\nOur 2024 origination performance reflects continued strong demand from power, commercial, and industrial customers looking for the least cost alternative to serve load and meet increasing demand. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 25GW after taking into account roughly 2.4GW of new projects placed into service since our Q3 call. We believe our more than 25GW backlog provides terrific visibility into Energy Resources' ability to deliver attractive growth in years ahead. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy.\nFor the full year, adjusted earnings per share from our corporate and other segment decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. We successfully supported the growth in our underlying businesses from our strong operating cash flows and grew 2024 cash flow from operations by more than 17%, well in excess of adjusted earnings.\nWe also continue to focus on protecting our project economics at Energy Resources, as well as minimizing the cost of refinancing at the parent. We now have $28.5 billion of interest rate hedges in place. To put this all in perspective, NextEra Energy's sensitivity for an immediate 50 basis point upward shift in the yield curve has, on average, one to three cents of expected adjusted EPS impact in 2025, 2026, and 2027, which is equivalent to less than 1% of our adjusted EPS expectations. The sensitivity, of course, assumes we do not implement other offsetting initiatives, including, among others, our normal process of cost reductions and capital efficiency opportunities.\nAs a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. Overall, our funding plans for 2024 through 2027 remain consistent with the information we shared previously.\nFor each of the last 15 years, NextEra Energy has met or exceeded its financial expectations, which is a record we're proud of. Once again, our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2025, 2026, and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We will also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2026, off a 2024 base.\nAs always, our expectations assume our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that, we will open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies, and gentlemen, at this time, we will open the line for questions. If you have a question, please press star and then one using a touch-tone telephone. To withdraw your questions, you may press star and two. If you are using a speakerphone, we do ask that you please pick up the handset prior to pressing the keys to ensure the best sound quality. Once again, that is star and then one to join the question queue. Our first question today comes from Steve Fleischman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nSteve Fleischman\n\nStocky Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple of high-level questions. So on the GEV framework agreement announcement, could you maybe give a little more color on, would you co-own projects with them?\nAnd also, just would you only be doing contracted projects, long-term contracts, or would you consider doing kind of new build merchant, like an ERCOT or PJM? Thanks on that.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSteve, thanks for the question. First of all, we're very excited about this framework agreement with GE Vernova. Again, as I said in the prepared remarks, nobody has built more gas-fired generation in this country, really, not only over the last decade, but the last two decades than NextEra. So we've got significant experience. We have an 80-year relationship with GE, just a terrific relationship, not only on the renewable side, but also on the gas-fired generation side with all that build that we have historically done. So I think you're bringing two powerhouses together with experience in gas-fired generation.\nThe idea would be to go after and target large load customers and do it in an integrated way where we can combine gas-fired generation with renewable battery storage solutions. Each party would bring the expertise that you would expect to the table. In terms of the ownership, yes, they would be co-owned as part of a 50/50 joint venture. These would be long-term contracted assets as well. We could contemplate, in the right situation with the right customer, also potentially a build-own transfer on gas-fired generation as well if it was part of a larger transaction that included renewables and other growth opportunities.\nWe're very excited about this. I think it enables us to bring a comprehensive solution set that is right down our alley.\n\nSteve Fleischman\n\nStocky Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. No, it makes a lot of sense.\nI assume it gets you access to turbines kind of relatively quickly as well. Just one other question on, I think we call it the elephant in the room, the new administration and just the kind of, I guess, the announcement on the wind limits on wind leases on federal lands, and then also views on kind of where things stand on IRA risks. Would love any commentary on those topics. Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSure, Steve. Let me go ahead and take that. First of all, with the executive orders as a whole, very consistent with our beliefs that we need electrons. We need electrons right now, and we need to unleash the American energy industry and achieve energy dominance. So we embrace the new administration's mandates that have come out in these executive orders. And as part of achieving energy dominance, we're going to need all of the above solutions.\nWe can't afford to take any options off the table. We're going to need gas. We're going to need nuclear. We're going to need renewables. We're going to need storage as well. But we can't wait because that demand is here today. I mean, if you think about it, power demand is higher than it's ever been in this country. The only close analogy you could draw is to the last industrial revolution. We're expecting load demand to increase over 80% over the next five years, six-fold over the next 20 years. If you think about generation types and needing all of the above, they're not all created equally in terms of timing, which is one of the things that I hit in my prepared remarks.\nRenewables are here today.\nYou can build a wind project in 12 months, a storage facility in 15, and a solar project in 18 months. With gas-fired generation, we're pleased with our announcement with GE Vernova. With gas-fired generation, the country is starting from a standing start. We've got to go find the sites. We've got to develop these sites. We've got to get gas to those sites. We've got to get hands-on gas turbines. If you take all those things together and you think about when is gas really going to be able to contribute at scale, I mean, we're looking at 2030 in nuclear later than that. We need shovels in the ground today because our customers need the power right now.\nI mean, if you think about it from a customer standpoint, they have already built new manufacturing facilities that are well down the road that are going to need electrons. Our utility customers have already shut down existing generation. They're counting on these renewable projects, some of which include wind, to show up to be able to provide the electrons. So we don't have reliability issues with their customers because right now we are short power in this country. And so when I think about wind and I think about our own portfolio, we don't have any offshore wind, as you all know. We've never been in the offshore wind business.\nAnd all of our onshore projects are on private land except for one. And that's a very positive fact. And the permitting process is rather limited for onshore private land solutions.\nI go back to our customers need the power right now. They're building new manufacturing. Utilities have already planned for it. I know this administration; they support low-cost energy. They support domestic job creation. So I remain very optimistic that we're going to be able to work through any issues that may come up along the way and feel good about the future of our program.\n\nSteve Fleischman\n\nStocky Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSteve, on IRA, let me hit your last one on IRA. That's really a lot of the same points. I mean, obviously, we've been spending a lot of time in Washington on advocacy around IRA. And what I will say there is, again, it's all about electrons and needing electrons right now. The power demand is here today. We need to serve it.\nRenewables play a very important role in all forms of energy solution. We're going to need gas to back up renewables. We'll have nuclear later next decade. But right now, we need solutions that are going to deliver electrons to the grid so we don't have a power crisis. And that is the thing that is not being overlooked at all by folks that we are meeting with in Congress. And then there's the other factor that, look, this is a terrific American industry. We are creating a substantial number of jobs right here in our backyard. And 80% of those jobs and investments are occurring in Republican states.\nTake our own CapEx. We've been the top five infrastructure investor over the last five years. Fully expect that to be the case over the next four years. NextEra is going to invest $120 billion over the next four years.\nThat's our expectation. And again, 80% of those dollars is going into Republican states. There's a lot of manufacturing, a lot of job creation, a lot of property taxes, a lot of economic benefits. So those are the messages that we're trying to make sure we get across in Washington around the IRA discussion.\n\nSteve Fleischman\n\nStocky Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Very helpful. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nGood morning, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nMorning. Just real quick, John, I know you noted the time to market for nuclear is between the 2027, 2030 timeframe. I guess, where does Dwayne Arnold fall within that timeframe? And also, there's obviously one restart out there, and there's a cost estimate. Is there anything you can provide just directionally for Dwayne Arnold restart versus the comp that's out there?\nAnd would you potentially look to expand the site if there's support from a counterparty or the federal government? Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks, Shar, for the question. So happy to say that we have made our filing with the NRC around the licensing to recommission that facility. We have more work to do. Some of that work includes work with customers. I'm certainly not going to put the cost estimate out there that would hurt our negotiating position in those discussions. And you can rest assured that we are in active discussions with customers today. There's a lot of interest in the plant as we look forward. But my comments around nuclear are really, look, as one of the largest nuclear operators in the country, we obviously know a lot about it.\nI think the near-term opportunities are around the recommissioning with Palisades of Crane, of Dwayne Arnold as well.\nAnd those are really the ones that I think I would confine to the timeframe of being over the next three, four, five years. As you think about next decade and my comments around next decade, those are really more around the small modular reactors, which are still a first-of-a-kind technology, have some uncertainty in terms of developing, permitting, and the ability of them to be able to be delivered to market on time and on schedule.\nAnd so as we think about small modular reactors, and we have a team internally at NextEra Energy that is focusing on nothing but small modular reactors. We'd love to be able to develop them. But as we get into them, there are some practical limitations.\nSo if we're thinking as a country about their ability to contribute to all the power demand that we see that's here right now, my only comment is that I would think about them more as a next decade solution, probably middle of the latter part of the next decade if we're thinking about small modular reactors at scale, and cost continues to remain a wild card.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. Maybe just I'll just ask it a slightly different way. Just what's the condition of the plant right now, I guess, on Dwayne Arnold?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThe Dwayne Arnold plant is really in good shape. I mean, the only issue that we had, if I think about the facility and the condition that it's in, I mean, I think about the reactor itself and the very good condition.\nThe only damage that we ever sustained at Dwayne Arnold was the derecho that took down the cooling tower. But building a cooling tower is run of the mill. I mean, you build them at gas plants. You build them at nuclear facilities as well. So that's pretty conventional construction, so not a whole lot of risk there.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. All right. That's perfect. And then just lastly, just to follow-up on Steve's gas question there, 2030 plus just to me seems a little far out just given the hyperscalers' needs, including just the trends around additionality and speed to market. I think supply chains should start to ease in the next couple of years. I guess just directionally, this could be pretty, I guess, a sizable opportunity for NextEra. I guess, when can this sort of start to become accretive to growth and hit the backlog? Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah.\nHey, thanks, Shar, for the question. So my comments on gas are when you look at finding a site, getting it permitted, getting gas to the facility, getting it interconnected, and then the equipment limitations of actually getting a turbine slot, getting access to that turbine, and then the EPC labor. Remember, this is an industry that really hasn't seen any active development or construction in years. And so that's my comment earlier about really beginning from a standing start.\nAnd so all of that puts pressure on cost. I mean, we've seen enormous demand, as you know, from GE Vernova's commentary for gas turbines. And it's not only domestic. It's international. And that's more than double the cost of a gas turbine. And EPC labor is in such short supply that the costs there have tripled.\nI look back to just our last gas fired facility that we built here in Florida, Dania Beach. If we take the cost we paid for that facility on a $ per kW basis to today, I mean, the cost has tripled in price. So those are some of the sensitivities. It's not only time, but it's money as well, and making sure that we can put an economic solution in front of the customer in terms of when it contributes consistent with that timeframe. I mean, I think it's that 2030 and beyond timeframe. Don't get me wrong.\nThere are probably some pockets of the country that would be an exception. ERCOT, you can build more quickly than you can in other parts of the country. Other parts of the country are just more difficult, right, because you have to deal with the ports.\nWe know from our own experience with what it took to get the MVP pipeline built in the Mid-Atlantic region, if you think about PJM in particular, it's just not easy to get the gas to those facilities and to get gas infrastructure built. This new administration certainly is undoubtedly going to move forward with reforms that will make that easier to achieve. But there could be litigation over those things as well. So as we put all the pieces together, we're just being practical. We're just being realistic. We see it more as a later this decade solution.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nFantastic. Thanks again, John. Send my best to the team. Appreciate it.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYou.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it.\nHey, so maybe to follow-up a little bit on some of the core questions here, how do you think about getting into this gas business? I know you talk about development kind of in the 2030 plus. Any thoughts about strategically entering into it in a proactive way from an acquisition perspective to create some origination prospects, right, to leverage off of? And then related, how are you thinking about this Explore pivot and having sort of a development sell-down partner?\nI note, for instance, your comment earlier about a 50/50 development effort with GV using their financial services effort. How do you think about the renewable side of that equation in terms of no longer having the same sell-down vehicles you did before? Thoughts about the monetization vector?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Well, let me take those in pieces.\nSo if I think about the gas business and your question about whether or not we would look to do something through acquisition, I don't think we need to do that. And here's why we don't need to do that, Julien, is we are a giant development company, right? That is our business. We are a massive development company that's been up and running for the better part of a couple of decades. We have all the pieces in place already. We have a land team. We have a permitting team. We have gas infrastructure capability to build gas pipeline laterals, to build new gas pipelines.\nWe have a transmission business. There wouldn't be a whole lot to be gained for us adding a piece through an acquisition. Given that we already have all those components in place internally, it's an easy pivot for us to move into gas.\nAnd we've already been up and running in that and already have put together a nice pipeline. We'll continue to grow that as we move forward. On the XPLR side, I really don't want to answer any questions about XPLR on this call, given that we have a call scheduled for Tuesday. But I will answer your question about sell-down vehicles and recycling capital generically for NextEra Energy.\nI think, as you can see with our reaffirmation of our capital recycling plan and our equity plan that we've included in today's call, there are no changes, right? No changes at all. So we feel good about where we are in terms of our ability to recycle capital and has no impact, again, on our equity needs.\nAnd we have plenty of outlets available to be able to do that, whether that would be through XPLR or some other avenue, as we've talked about in the past.\n\nBrian Bolster\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nJulien, I just remind you that over the past 18, 24 months, we've recycled several billion dollars of capital that had nothing to do with Explore. So not only are we very comfortable with our expectations, we've been recycling capital now for a good several years through other avenues.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. All right. Indeed. All righty. Well, best of luck here. Appreciate it. Talk to you soon.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nJulien, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for all the updates. So hey, just a 2% change to customers for FPL in this upcoming rate case definitely stands out in a positive way.\nJust wanted to see if you had any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the surplus reserve mechanism. Then also just how are you kind of thinking about earned ROEs at FP&L in 2025? Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nGreat. Thank you. So the growth that we saw this last quarter, the growth that we saw in the year was certainly positive. But it's not just this past year. We've been seeing it really since the pandemic. Our expectations going into the next rate case over the next four years is that growth may come down a little bit over the next four years because of what we saw during the pandemic. But we still believe it's going to be fairly strong growth in our service territory.\nThat's why our expectations for the 2026, 2029 time period for capital investing in the business would be above the roughly $36 billion that we are going to put in over the four-year settlement agreement that ends at the end of 2025. So a lot of that detail will come out here in the next, it's probably about six weeks now because we expect to file our rate case at the end of February. Your question regarding the reserve mechanism, we're sitting at roughly $800 million after using $400 million or so in 2024. So we feel good. We're certainly not going into 2025 believing that all of the risks that we use as the surplus mechanism are behind us.\nWe've had to tap that reserve mechanism for a lot of inflation, higher interest rates, a lot more growth in our area, and therefore a lot more CapEx expenses that we expected. So with the 11.4 ROE at the end of 2024, I expect there might be a little bit of upside to that 11.4 in 2025, but it's obviously early. We want to make sure that we get through this year in good shape. And we feel really positive about the case that we are going to present to our regulators in February because we've been doing the right things for our customers. So as long as we do that, I think we'll be okay.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks for all that information.\nAnd then I'm sorry, but just to follow-up on XPLR, just you're still including the proportional share of EBITDA and earnings in your own outlook from a need perspective. And I just wanted to confirm that you just continue to see that income stream consistent and preserved kind of regardless of the outcome. Thanks.\n\nBrian Bolster\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nJust say the accounting's unchanged around Explore, and we'll discuss the outlook for that business on Tuesday.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just wanted to throw in a couple of follow-ups. The first one just on some of the renewables conversation. Is there anything you can share on how this is or is not impacting the conversations that you're having with customers?\nAre they seeing any concern about the ability to build these projects or the economics of them going forward if you see some change on the policy side?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSo Carly, the answer to that question is no, it hasn't hurt any of our discussions with customers. The only thing customers are concerned about is making sure that these projects get built because they need them. They have made decisions to already shut down existing generation. If these projects were for any reason to be delayed, which we don't believe they will be, that would have a significant impact on their ability to provide power to their own customer base. I'm talking about utilities, co-ops, and municipalities who need these electrons right now.\nAnd then also with our C&I customers. I mean, these commercial industrial customers have made investments in manufacturing facilities, semiconductor chip facilities, their chemical companies.\nI mean, you name it across the board. They've invested in infrastructure and are counting on the electrons to show up. So I think it's actually quite the opposite.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nI'd echo that. We've had quite a number of conversations just this week with customers across the board that John just mentioned. Top of mind to them is time and money. They don't have time to get other resources available to them in the time frames that they need. They know that without these renewable resources, storage resources, or other things that they have in the queue, it would cost more money and cost more money for their end customers.\nSo top of mind to them to make sure that we meet the demands of the day. We're excited to work with them and all the stakeholders to make sure that happens.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Really appreciate that caller.\nThen maybe just one on the rate side. It's become a little more topical in our conversations. Can you just refresh us on the broader interest rate hedge program? It looks like some of the interest rate sensitivities moved just a bit relative to prior disclosure. So just can you refresh us on the strategy to manage rates exposure?",
    "content2": "John Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. So Carly, we put $32 billion of interest rate swaps in place with an average coupon of around 3.9%. So we feel very good about our hedge position. And that shows up in what we communicated today. So if you look at our sensitivities for 2025 and 2026, it's about $0.01 to $0.03 on an EPS basis. If you look at 2027, it's $0.03 to $0.05. So very manageable.\nAnd we keep a very close eye on interest rate risk exposure around the portfolio, but feel good where we are with the $32 billion of interest rate swaps in place.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the time.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Carly.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nJust wanted to continue with some of the themes you talked about before. But regarding your conversations with hyperscalers at this point, just wondering if you're seeing any kind of changes in the tone or thoughts as far as renewables clearly still carbon-free premiums there. But as far as openness to gas, just wondering if there's any change in tone there or thoughts from your customers when you're talking about what they're looking to achieve.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. I certainly appreciate it.\nAnd I think there's a lot of discussion about how do we get the resources that we need in the time frames in which we need it and matching that with some of the other goals that they may have either at corporate levels or certainly state levels. I think top of mind continues to be what John highlighted, which is speed to market with the resources that are available today at the lowest cost with highest confidence and be able to meet those commitments, including the commitments of those customers. So we see demand across the board.\nWhere we've seen a lot of increase in demand for natural gas, it really is to enable that capacity value where energy still can be met in many places least cost in terms of resource availability from wind and solar resources.\nSo there's a great pairing there that many of our customers are really interested in. So it's a real pragmatic view. I think it can't be underestimated how much this industry has changed in a very short amount of time in really the last 15 to 18 months realizing that demand is significant. You all are well-versed in knowing that it takes three to five years to develop resources.\nAnd we've talked a lot about demand, but it takes time to build all this back up. So what's available, as John highlighted, the renewables and storage is top of mind. What will be needed longer term are making sure that the capacity resources are there.\nAnd of course, we and others are very interested in seeing continued diverse supply options available to our customers, including small modular reactors and other technologies that we hope to be more relevant and at bigger scale in the 2030 mid-time frame and beyond.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nGot it. That's very helpful there. I didn't know if behind-the-meter gas was coming up in conversation at all versus prior conversations.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nIt does, Jeremy. I think there's a novelty to that about whether or not that can work and speed through some of these other issues. But you got to think about what does it take to produce reliable energy supply behind the meter without the benefit of a grid? And it's significantly more capacity and other things you need to add to it in order to ensure that you have that uninterrupted supply that these customers are looking for.\nSo in mega-scale projects, we certainly see the possibility that some of these could be developed. And we've had some conversations with customers along those lines. But I don't know that that's going to be the prevalent way that resources are met across the country for a variety of different customer scenarios. There's a huge value to the existing electric grid. There's no place better to see that than here in Florida and the low-cost power supply solutions that we can offer to our customers. So there's a place for it.\nI don't think it's the ultimate place where all demand is met, but customers need options. They need them now. And we're here to provide that broad set of solutions to make that happen.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nVery helpful. Thanks. And if I could, just one last quick one on XPLR. Thank you for your thoughts so far.\nJust wondering if you could provide incremental thoughts from an NEE perspective, non-XPLR perspective. We would expect to hear that on Tuesday. But just as far as NEE views XPLR, is there any change in the strategy, how it fits into NEE strategic outlook going forward at this point?\n\nBrian Bolster\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nJeremy, we're going to have a full conversation around XPLR on Tuesday. So why don't we plan on having that conversation then?\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nFair enough. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd ladies, and gentlemen, with that, we're going to end today's question and answer session as well as today's conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong Q2 results with adjusted earnings per share increasing more than 9% year-over-year. In addition, through the first six months of the year, our adjusted earnings per share has increased 9.4% year-over-year. The continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources position our company well to meet its overall objectives for the year. At FPL, we have continued to deliver for our customers on multiple fronts since the start of our most recent rate settlement in 2022. We are making smart capital investments in low-cost solar generation and battery storage, which are continuing to reduce our overall fuel cost, and combined with generation modernizations have saved customers nearly $16 billion since 2001.\nWe are delivering best-in-class non-fuel O&M, where we're 70% better than the national average, saving our customers $3 billion every year compared to the average utility. A big driver of our outperformance has been our team and culture of continuous improvement and productivity. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than through our annual company-wide initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call Project Velocity. This year, we identified a record $460 million of run rate cost savings opportunities through 2027, part of which benefits FPL and its customers. By finding opportunities to take cost out of the business and making smart capital investments to reduce its fuel costs, FPL has kept residential bills nearly 40% below the national average and by far the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities.\nFPL's reliability also ranks among the best in the industry, where we are 66% better than the national average in the number of minutes a customer's power is interrupted per year. I'm most proud of the fact we continue to deliver on our customer value proposition during a period of unprecedented growth in Florida. Florida continues to be one of the fastest-growing states in the US, with roughly 1,000 people moving to Florida every day. It's not just the residential sector. We're seeing the commercial and industrial sector growing too. As a result of this accelerated growth, FPL's regulatory capital employed has grown at a 12% compound annual growth rate since the beginning of 2022, compared against an estimated 9% compound annual growth rate that was originally anticipated for the four-year settlement period.\nWe have shouldered this additional growth through our reserve amortization mechanism, which enables FPL to absorb the cost for these capital investments without increasing customer bills in the interim. While these efforts have helped us to meet customer growth and deliver for our Florida customers, our reserve amortization mechanism has been utilized faster than expected. FPL fully expects to seek recovery of these increased expenditures in its rate case filing next year. FPL ended Q2 with a remaining reserve amortization balance of $586 million, which is expected to be sufficient to support FPL's capital investment plan and its ability to earn an 11.4% regulatory ROE this year and next. An 11.4% regulatory ROE is expected to have a $0.06 EPS impact in each of 2024 and 2025, which has already been taken into account in our financial expectations.\nWe will be disappointed if we are unable to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges each year through 2027 at NextEra Energy. We expect to continue to demonstrate the benefits and protections that the Reserve Amortization Mechanism provides customers when we file our rate case next year. Our vision is for FPL to be the best utility franchise in the country by doubling down on what we do best: delivering low bills and high reliability for our customers by making smart capital investments and being an industry leader on cost. These attributes are important to our customers and regulators, and they are important to us. We look forward to continuing to deliver on what we believe is an outstanding customer value proposition at FPL. Growth is not only occurring inside Florida but outside Florida as well.\nAt Energy Resources, we are benefiting from two types of demand: replacement cycle and growth cycle demand. With regard to the former, we have long been a beneficiary of a replacement cycle where higher cost, less efficient generation has been retired in favor of low-cost renewables and battery storage. We expect this to continue. And while replacement cycle demand has been around for a long time, growth cycle demand is new. With the exception of a few states such as Florida, power demand from new growth has been static in our industry for decades. That's changing as power demand is projected to grow 4x faster over the next two decades compared to the prior two. That growth is being driven by demand across multiple sectors, which is expected to create a long-term opportunity for fast-to-deploy, low-cost generation.\nAs we highlighted at our Investor Conference, we expect the demand for new renewables to triple over the next seven years versus the prior seven to help meet this increased power demand. Energy Resources couldn't be better positioned, as it has a 300GW pipeline, half of which is in the interconnection queue process or is already interconnection ready. Our scale, experience, and technology, coupled with our ability to build new transmission where required, enable us to meet the growing demands of our power and commercial and industrial customer base. Underpinning these competitive advantages are our decades of data, analytical capabilities, and experience with system operators and relationships with utilities that position us well to get the power to where it needs to go. Our continued ability to drive origination results speaks for itself.\nEnergy Resources added over 3,000MW of new renewables and storage projects to the backlog this quarter, 860MW of which come from agreements with Google to meet their data center power demand. This marks our second-best origination quarter ever. These results support our belief that the bulk of the growth demand will be met by a combination of new renewables and battery storage. The importance of renewables and storage to help meet our economy's growing demand for power has never been more evident. As data center growth accelerates to facilitate our economy's shift to artificial intelligence, and as we continue to re-domesticate and electrify across multiple sectors, our nation must embrace an all-of-the-above strategy to meet increasing electric demand. Renewables and storage are energy independent as they rely on American wind and sunshine.\nThey also are extremely fast to deploy compared to alternative forms of generation, making them vital to our country's success going forward. Importantly, the country has stood up a significant domestic industry to support their growth, which is driving investment in factories and is creating good-paying jobs and a tax base that is revitalizing rural communities across America. As customers increasingly demand smart, clean energy solutions, we are the company with experience in every part of the energy value chain and are uniquely positioned to help them make the right decisions for their business. As the owner and operator of a large natural gas-fired fleet in Florida, we are also conscious of the importance of natural gas-fired generation as a bridge fuel. Yet, we also are well aware of the realities of new-build gas-fired generation.\nIt's more expensive in most states, is subject to fuel price volatility, and takes considerable time to deploy given the need to get gas delivered to the generating unit and the three- to four-year waiting period for gas turbines. Low-cost, fast-to-deploy renewables help keep power prices down, making our economy more competitive globally. Ultimately, our country needs all forms of energy as we move forward, and the future has never been brighter for the power generation sector as a whole, and renewables in particular. As I've been saying, NextEra Energy was built for this moment, and our future outlook has never been stronger. Our strategic focus is to deliver low-cost, clean energy and storage for our customers both inside and outside Florida while building new transmission where required to support new generation.\nWe have the playbook and the platform to win in any environment, and most importantly, we have the team. Our competitive advantages continue to grow every day, providing industry differentiation that is over two decades in the making and difficult to replicate. I firmly believe we will continue to expand that strategic distance, creating value for customers and shareholders. Nobody is better positioned to meet the demands of the energy customer of tomorrow than NextEra Energy, and I wouldn't trade our opportunity set with anyone. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian to cover the detailed results, beginning with FPL.\n\nBrian Bolster\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThank you, John. Good morning, everyone. For Q2 2024, FPL increased earnings per share by $0.03 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 10.7% year-over-year.\nWe continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreement's four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full-year 2024 capital investments to be between $8 and 8.8 billion. Over the current four-year settlement agreement, we expect FPL's capital investments to exceed $34 billion. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 3.7% from the prior year comparable period due to warmer weather, which had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 2.6%. As a result, FPL grew retail sales in the second quarter by roughly 1.1% on a weather-normalized basis. For the 12 months ending June 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%.\nThe 11.4% regulatory ROE mentioned previously is expected to be realized in Q4 for the 12 months ending December 2024. Now, let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 10.8% per year at 10.8% year-over-year. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.03 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio increased $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting an increase in wind resources during the quarter. Wind resource for Q2 2024 was approximately 104% of the long-term average versus 88% in Q2 2023. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business, which you'll recall had strong earnings last year, decreased by $0.03 per share.\nContributions from our gas infrastructure business decreased by $0.07 per share due to a combination of higher depletion expense related to lower production estimates, certain non-recurring items, and the sale of the Texas pipelines by NextEra Energy Partners. While we may see a few pennies impact again next quarter, we expect gas infrastructure's earnings growth to be effectively flat going forward as we continue to allocate more capital on a relative basis to renewables, storage, and transmission. Similar to what we saw this quarter, the increased contributions from new investment driven by the strength of our renewable development program are expected to more than offset any slowing in gas infrastructure growth going forward. All other impacts reduce earnings by $0.05 per share. Energy Resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding 3,000MW to the backlog.\nWith these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 22.6GW after taking into account more than 1,600MW of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call, providing great visibility into Energy Resources' ability to deliver on our development program expectations, which we recently extended at our Investor Conference. We expect the backlog additions will go into service over the next few years and into 2028. Energy Resources' 300GW pipeline is years in the making and ready to respond to customer demand. We have competitive advantages understanding transmission and grid constraints. We have strong relationships with utilities serving the growing power grid. We can build system solutions across stakeholders and customer needs, and we can leverage our proprietary technology to site and deploy the best projects for our customers.\nA great example is our collaboration with Entergy, where we are targeting to build 4.5GW of renewable storage solutions to help them meet both their new increased load demand and energy transition goals. We couldn't be more excited to work with a long-term established customer in order to help them execute on these goals. Another example is our collaboration with Google. As John said earlier, this quarter's backlog additions include 860MW signed with Google to support their data center needs. That brings our total renewables portfolio with technology and data center customers, including assets in operation and in backlog, to 7GW. Our competitive position is even further advantaged by our existing portfolio.\nWith interconnection timelines for new sites stretching for three to seven years or beyond, we can dramatically improve our speed to market by utilizing the existing interconnection from our operating footprint to deploy co-located solar and storage, as well as execute on wind and potentially solar repowers. This optionality provides a unique resource to meet our customer needs while also capitalizing on the embedded option value from the existing portfolio. Beyond renewables and storage, we're excited to say that Mountain Valley Pipeline is now in service. Turning now to Q2 2024 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year. During the quarter, NextEra issued $2 billion of equity units, and recently, NextEra Energy Resources entered into an agreement with Blackstone to sell a partial interest in a portfolio of wind and solar projects for approximately $900 million.\nOur long-term financial expectations, which we extended last month at our Investor Conference, remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectations range in 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Turning next to NextEra Energy Partners, yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.905 per common unit or $3.62 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 6% from a year earlier.\nTurning to the balance sheet, since our last earnings call, the partnership completed the next NEP renewables-to-equity buyout of roughly $190 million in June 2024 and paid down our 2024 convertible maturity with cash on hand. After repayment of a $700 million holdco debt maturity earlier this month, the partnership now has approximately $2.7 billion of liquidity. Let me now turn to the detailed results. Q2 Adjusted EBITDA was $560 million, and cash available for distribution was $220 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 780MW of new assets that either closed in Q2 2023 or achieved commercial operations in 2023, contributed approximately $39 million of Adjusted EBITDA and $9 million of cash available for distribution.\nQ2 adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects grew by approximately $62 million year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable wind resource during the quarter and partially offset by lower solar generation. Wind resource was approximately 103% of the long-term average versus 88% in the Q2 2023. Finally, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $46 million and $43 million, respectively, from the divestiture of the Texas pipeline portfolio, which is partially offset by the interest benefit of the remaining cash proceeds received from the sale of these assets. From a base of our Q4 2023 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.52, the partnership continues to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026.\nNextEra Energy Partners expects the partnership payout ratio to be in the mid to high 90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the Q4 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. In terms of next steps for NextEra Energy Partners, as we have discussed with you previously, the partnership is continuing to look at all options to secure a competitive cost of capital and to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts. At the same time, the partnership's 6% distribution growth target remains for now. NextEra Energy Partners does not need an acquisition or related financing in 2024 to meet its 6% target and does not need growth equity until 2027.\nNextEra Energy Partners owns a large portfolio of high-quality, long-term contracted clean energy assets, and the partnership has attractive organic growth from the repowering of its existing portfolio. We expect to share more in the coming quarters as we address these objectives. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution from its forecasted portfolio at 31 December 2024, to be in the ranges of $1.9 to 2.1 billion and $730 to 820 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2024 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2024. As a further reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that, we'll open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, then two. The first question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Excuse me. Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYes. Steve, we can hear you.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Hey. Just first on the comments on the kind of update on the reserve amortization and earned ROE, could you just go back through that again, John, in terms of just what's driven the increased usage? Is it just that you've ramped up capital a lot quicker than initially planned, or just maybe give a little bit of color on a little more color on that comment?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. No, absolutely, Steve. We've had a lot of population growth in Florida. A lot of that has impacted our service territory. When we first entered into the settlement agreement back in 2021, we thought our regulatory capital employed would be around 9%. It's actually been around 12% as we have accommodated that growth. We've got surplus that's right around $586 million today as we look forward for this year and next based on where we are, the capital plans that we have for the FPL business, which are still very strong to take into account the further growth that we see. We believe that with that amortization balance and those CapEx plans, we'll probably be right around an 11.4% ROE for the full year 2024 and for the full year 2025.\nAnd that has about a $0.06 impact here this year and a $0.06 impact next year. It's already folded into our financial expectations and not a concern in terms of our ability to cover it. And a big plus from this, Steve, is it really, I think, is a good fact heading into a refiling in 2025 because it demonstrates how the surplus mechanism can really help customers. And the last point that I'll make is don't forget these additional capital investments that we've made; we would expect to see full recovery of in our next filing. So remember that the surplus mechanism is intended really just to deal with the regulatory lag as we make new investments at FPL to accommodate the additional growth. So we're not worried about this.\nThis is something that we feel very comfortable about addressing in our financial expectations, and doesn't impact where we feel like we will end up this year and next.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Thanks. And then on the Blackstone financing that you mentioned, the $900 million, any information on just the size of the portfolio that was sold or the stake in that portfolio?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. It was a 1.6GW portfolio, just a mix of renewable assets. And I think the real positive takeaway here for investors is there's a real demand for NextEra assets. I mean, we are recognized in the private equity market as being really the top developer. And given all the growth, and this quarter is a great example of the 3GW that we were able to do, we have a strong trajectory going forward. And as private equity has opportunities to work with us, and we've had a long history of working with private equity going back the last five or six years, it really is a good potential win-win for us and for them. And with the Blackstone organization, we really like the capability that they bring to the table. And there's a lot of crossover between our two organizations in terms of what we do.\nThis was a good fit for us.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nJust what's the percent stake? A piece of the 1.6, or their stake is 1.6?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThey invested capital alongside us, and so they have a partial interest in that portfolio of 1.6GW.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nAnd then last question, just on the recent issue. I know you're not doing offshore wind, but just this recent issue with the GE turbine at Vineyard Wind, and I know there was a lawsuit filed by AEP. Can you just maybe talk to your turbine performance with them, and just are you seeing any issues, and how you're feeling about that?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. For us, I mean, look, first, I'll start with the fact that we are a top decile operator of wind. I think really recognized as the best operator of wind in the business. We have a real partnership with GE. So, look, wind turbines have moving parts. They'll have issues from time to time. But our partnership with GE runs 20 years, and so we've really never had any issues in getting things fixed. We're always able to structure win-win arrangements with them. So as any problems arise through the portfolio, they've always been well managed and addressed in a conciliatory way with GE and future.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Good morning, John.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nGood morning. How are you, Shar?\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood. All good. So just real quick, I want to start on NEP. I mean, obviously, you guys have the standard language around continuing to evaluate all options. I mean, Brian obviously reiterated the current CAGR, but also used the word for now, quote-unquote, which is somewhat new language, believe it or not. Can we get a sense on timing, what range of options you're thinking about, and I guess how confident are you we can get something done at favorable pricing before the dividend goes under some level of pressure in 2027? Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Hey, thanks, Shar. Obviously, NEP is getting a lot of our attention in terms of looking at what the alternatives are to both improve the cost of capital, which really requires us to be able to successfully address the back-end SEPIFs. And as we said in the prepared remarks, all options are on the table. And what we really are spending time on, and we're looking at various solutions around this, is how do you tackle those back-end SEPIFs in a constructive way that makes sense in terms of the cost of capital that would be required to do that? And then how do we put NEP in a better position for success going forward? So as part of that, we are obviously exploring all alternatives. We've mentioned private capital as one potential avenue there as well. The good thing is that we have time.\nWe have time in 2024. We've said to the market we don't have to do anything. We don't have any drops planned for 2024. Don't have growth equity needs until 2027. And so we are being thoughtful about our approach around NEP.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. I think Brian, just to take words out of his mouth, but mentioned in the next couple of quarters, is this something maybe we'll get to some sort of a definitive direction this year?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Yeah. Sure. I don't want to put a firm deadline on it, but I think the language we use is over the next few quarters. And once we have identified a solution that we think makes sense, then obviously we will share that, but not until then.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Perfect. And then just on NEER, obviously, just congrats on a very strong, rich-issuing quarter. It was definitely on the higher end. Google was a key contributor. I guess, do your sort of existing contract protections and supply chain, maybe strategy like, to kind of navigate some of the challenges in the space as you're continuing to expand development to maybe much higher levels, right? So can supply chain kind of these bottlenecks that we've seen become a governor around backlog additions as we look through 2025 and beyond, especially as you're trying to meet the needs of these large energy-intensive customers, right, like the hyperscalers? Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Good question, Shar. So here's how I think about supply chain. Number one, there's been some attention around the AD/CVD filing and tariffs and those things. We're not impacted. And I made the comment, and we spent a lot of time with this both in March and then at our Investor Conference in June. Still matters more than ever in this business. So the way I would think about it from an investor perspective is the bigger our program, the more leverage we have over our supplier. And in the last couple of years, we have really spent a lot of time and made investment around the data and analytical capability that we have around our supply chain. And we have also made a very conscientious effort around risk transfer and making sure that we have adequate security to provide incentive to perform.\nSo we are in a position where we have really been able to transfer any tariff or AD/CVD or related risks over to our suppliers. And why is that? The reason for that is when you're putting numbers up like 3GW a quarter and have the type of build that we have and expect to have going forward, contractors and vendors want to work with us. And they've also seen a lot of smaller developers that ultimately haven't been able to arrange financing or, for whatever reason, haven't had terrific follow-through on their projects. That's not the case with our company. And so there's been even a greater emphasis, I would say, by our suppliers to want to work with us more than ever.\nBut what that means is making sure that we are always left in a position where we are not taking risks around the obvious things that you might put on your list. And so I really feel better than ever about where we stand from a supply chain perspective, and very happy with the job that our team has done. And the lessons that we've learned over the last couple of years have all been folded into how we contractually approach risk in our agreements going forward.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nAnalyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nTerrific. Thank you, guys, so much. Congrats, and we'll see you soon. Appreciate it.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Julian Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, good morning. Thank you so much, team. Appreciate it.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nAbsolutely, Julian. Good to hear you.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Pleasure. Yeah. Likewise. Can you speak to how you're thinking about asset recycling here? I mean, I'm curious specifically on the latest portfolio sell-down, right, with Blackstone as mentioned earlier. But how do you think about other assets here? As you think about, for instance, some of these headlines on transmission or gas infra as being in focus, it's notable after the FCG sale last year. How do you think about continued monetization of renewable assets or portfolios relative to sort of the ongoing streamlining and focusing back to the core renewables business, if you will? And then related, how do you think about that 70/30 mix as you pare back, as you pare these different asset sales through the forecast period?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. No. Good question, Julian. So from a recycling standpoint, I feel better than I ever have in terms of the options that we have going forward for the portfolio. In terms of asset mix and how we think about that, obviously, we've always had a history of being able to recycle capital around renewables, which are terrific assets, which I think we have a great reputation in the market around, and our ability to attract capital on the renewable portfolio. But look, we are also making a conscientious effort. I think I made these comments at the Investor Conference that we're looking at our core business, right? Our core business is wind, it's solar, it's battery storage, it's transmission, both inside Florida, outside of Florida.\nAnd so to the extent we can do some targeted capital recycling around our gas infrastructure business, that will continue to be top of mind. Transmission, you raised as well. We are having a lot of success in transmission. And the team has done a terrific job, I think, on the competitive transmission side of identifying new opportunities. And just based on the return structure that we could target, there's good sense to bring in a partner on some of those deals. And so those have been opportunities that we have been targeting as well as we think about the future. But obviously, it puts us in a position where we continue to manage those assets and those opportunities as we think about how they contribute to the future. But those certainly are two things that we look at in addition to the renewable portfolio.\nThe numbers that we gave at the Investor Conference, I certainly don't lose any sleep over in terms of the ability to meet those capital recycling targets. From a business mix perspective, I think, which was your last question, you know, and I think most folks on the phone know that we are very rigorous about looking at our five-year forecast and even go beyond that. And so we're constantly looking at our mix and what our obligations are and undertakings are with the agencies. And we have a lot of headroom, a lot of headroom on our business mix. So that is not an issue. That is not a concern. And the capital recycling plan, I think, fits well with what our undertakings are there. But plenty of headroom on business mix.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. Just clarification on the last question. Just with respect to getting that 3GW milestone for the quarter here in terms of booking, is that kind of a good new run rate here? Or again, given the size of these new counterparties, is it going to be fairly lumpy moving up and down quarter to quarter here? Just trying to set a little bit of an expectation there.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nAbsolutely. I'm going to turn that one over to Rebecca.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nGood morning, Julian. We couldn't be more excited about the origination, not only that we've been able to produce over the last couple of years, each of them being a record in their own right, and then the first two quarters being each of them, ironically, the second-best quarter, obviously this quarter topping last quarter that we've ever had. I'll caveat it that origination can be a little bit lumpy. I've consistently said that in quarters where it's a little bit lower than where we are today. I think I even said it the day that we set the top quarterly additions a couple of quarters ago. So there's always a little bit of bumpiness in there.\nWhat we continue to see is consistent with the comments that we all made at the Investor Conference just last month, and John talked about in his opening remarks today, that the combination of the replacement cycle and the growth cycle is a tremendously positive outlook for us over the very long term. Some of this is going to take a little bit longer to materialize on the growth side, as we also highlighted last month. So you'll see some of those stronger additions of the 3GW that we added to our backlog, particularly notably strong in years 2026 and 2027, and even some MW added to 2028 and beyond. But overall, what we see today and the execution of our team and the value proposition that we bring to our customers is a very bright outlook.\n\nJulian Dumoulin-Smith\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nExcellent. Congrats, guys.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Julian.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning, team. Thanks for all the information today. I just wanted to follow up on Shar's comments. You talked about being able to kind of pass through some of these higher tariff costs to the extent they kind of materialize. Just, there's also a projection for two rate cuts this year. I'm just curious if you can kind of talk about how that changes the returns for NEER that you kind of communicated at the Analyst Day and previous quarters. If you could just update us on that.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSure. Yeah. First of all, as you know, we are always looking to manage risk around our capital investment decisions. One of those risks is it's not only locking in equipment costs, it's not only locking in labor, but it's also locking in our cost of capital. As we approach our renewable portfolio, we've been very mindful of making sure that we are locking in our cost of capital through interest rate hedge products, swaps in that regard. As I think about the future and the one, the two rate cuts, who knows where we ultimately end up on those fronts? Obviously, given the financing plans that we have moving forward, those would be tailwinds for the business.\nBut at the same time, if those don't materialize, we have already taken those into account in our financial expectations, and we're very prudent and on top of managing the interest rate risk exposure that we have across the business.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHey, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. And then, John, I think you've been pretty clear about the ability to supplement this power demand inflection with new renewables. And you also have this nuclear portfolio. I understand a lot of that's kind of contracted, but there were headlines about potential Duane Arnold restart. I guess, how realistic is that? Is that something you'd even kind of consider at this juncture? And how do we kind of think about the strategic positioning of your nuclear portfolio?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSure. Thanks, Nick, for that question on nuclear. With regard to Duane Arnold, I think there would be opportunities and a lot of demand from the market if we were able to do something with Duane Arnold. Obviously, bringing back a nuclear plant into service is not something that you can do without a lot of thought. It is something that we are looking at, but there is a lot of thought that has to go into it and obviously a real assessment around risks associated with that as well. Sure, we're looking at it, but we would only do it if we could do it in a way that is essentially risk-free with plenty of mitigants around the approach. There are a few things that we would have to work through. Yes, we are looking at it.\n\nNick Campanella\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThanks. Have a great day.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Nick.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nJust wanted to get a little bit more color on the renewables market right now. As you've discussed, very strong demand in the market. And just wondering, going back to some of the comments at the Analyst Day, what trends do you see in PPA pricing at this point, and how could that potentially benefit NextEra going forward?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Appreciate the conversation and question. We've continued to see very strong returns with respect to what we think we need in order to be highly confident that we're adding shareholder value. And I would think about the returns that we laid out at the Investor Conference is almost minimum thresholds that we have at this point. And there are opportunities where there's significant customer demand. We have unique positioning in the marketplace to make sure that we get even more attractive returns. I'd say it's a very positive dynamic. It was a very difficult market over the last couple of years when we were seeing the supply chain disruption and increasing pricing, both on the capital equipment side and the rate side in our returns.\nFortunately, we've either seen slightly declining or at a minimum stable backdrop, which is certainly helpful for decreasing our risk and also providing an attractive price and attractive product to our customers. So between the attractive price, the speed to market, the clean attribute of renewables and storage, as well as the fact, as we talked about last month, in the queue across the United States today, all of the projects that are getting to be connected, 90% of those megawatts are renewables and storage. And we have a healthy portion of those. And I couldn't be more excited about our position. So I think we're in a great shape to continue to add a lot of shareholder value in the many years ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Sounds good. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThanks, Jeremy.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. We're hearing utilities around the country now with fast-growing pipelines, thousands of megawatts of data center requests. It seems to be moving rapidly, just month by month. They seem to be learning more, getting more demand. I'm wondering, just, do you think that's already in your numbers, in your renewables targets here, or could we potentially see another wave of demand as some of these utilities nail down just how much load is really coming into their service territories?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nHi, David. It's Rebecca. I'll chime in here. Yeah, we certainly are hearing from our power sector customers a lot of interest from various data center customers, whether it's the data center operators or the hyperscalers. It is a little bit challenging to see how much of that is potentially multiple requests for ultimately the same data center. But there is no escaping the fact that these are very large numbers and numbers that I don't think any utility across the industry has seen before. And so it's going to take some time not only to rationalize that and figure out how you address it, but also to procure and bring online the megawatts and the transmission over the long term that is going to be required to serve this demand if it ends up being as strong as we see it and we think it might be.\nFrom our perspective, consistent with our comments from last month, we are seeing a lot of interest both from the power sector customers as well as hyperscalers and data center customers. You're clearly seeing some of that show up in our origination. But you're also seeing some of that, more of that show up in this 2026 and 2027 timeframe, and now even 2028, as we are lining up these projects to support when they will come online for our utility customers. So I think we all are very excited. It is very interesting for our sector to see this growth that we haven't seen in a couple of decades. But I do think from a practical standpoint, it's going to take a couple of years for this really to materialize and the utilities to be able to absorb it and serve it. But that's a terrific backdrop for us.\nSome of these challenges are going to be difficult to solve. I believe there's no better company to partner with our customers to help solve them.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, understood. Thanks for that color. And then I was curious on hyperscaler deals. Are there any other details you would be able to provide around the Google relationship here, just maybe the location or timing of when these projects are coming on? Is it a single location or multiple locations? Are you embedding wind, solar, storage, multiple technologies in terms of what product maybe makes sense for these hyperscaler deals? And then just along those same lines, would you be interested in some kind of a multi-gigawatt, multi-year framework? Is that an idea that you're pursuing with these bigger hyperscaler customers?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nSure. Well, David, I'll answer it more broadly than just specific to one customer, certainly for a variety of reasons, including sensitivities. Some of these comments would otherwise be sent for them for their own competitive positioning. But those specifically were new contracts, and they were to support data center demand that our customer had. And then more broadly speaking, from a hyperscaler's perspective, they are interested in a variety of technologies: wind, solar, and battery storage. And I would say probably the biggest change for many of them is a shift or certainly an increasing percentage of these projects that are very specifically associated with the data centers that these hyperscalers are trying to build.\nSo it's less interest in just a pure virtual power purchase agreement where the project could be anywhere in the US to, \"I want to make sure these resources are there to support my data centers as they are getting connected to the utilities in those local jurisdictions and can come online at the same time.\" So very much becoming a more physical market and one in which it's really important that their partners show up and perform and deliver as expected because they are the load on the other side of that. So that's a very attractive proposition from our perspective. As it relates to the structured agreements, listen, we are most focused on making sure that we add value for these customers. That could come in a variety of different forms and factors, but our primary focus is being there and delivering for them when they need us.\nWe'll update you as those structures evolve, but it's really focused around creating value with and for them.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Very helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThanks, David.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start, a lot has obviously changed in the US election landscape since your last earnings call. So can you just talk us through your latest expectations on potential implications on the IRA and what impact any modification to that legislation might have on your renewable development plans?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy",
    "content2": "Sure, Carly. I'll go ahead and take that. I start with we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle in the 22 years that I've been at NextEra. I don't think this time around is any different, and I'm going to kind of go through why. Let's not forget that in that time, we've invested hundreds of billions of dollars in American energy infrastructure across almost every state in the country who are benefiting from those investments. We invest in American energy dominance every single day and are the quintessential all-the-above energy company. That doesn't change from one election to the next, and I think really helps when we are working with both sides of the aisle. That said, let's look at where the incentive money is going. The incentives favor Republican states.\nWe've seen an increase in the number of Republican lawmakers that are embracing the clean energy credits within the IRA as they see the positive impact to their states and communities, which is hard to turn away from. The tax laws are very difficult to overturn. We're very likely to have thin margins in the House and the Senate, particularly in light of some of the recent developments. Let's not forget the important role that renewables play. I made some remarks about that in my script today. But renewables create jobs. They create a property tax base that transforms rural communities. Renewables are energy independence. It's electricity generated from the sun and the wind. It's not subject to fuel price volatility.\nLow-cost renewables are also bringing power bills down, which attract new investment from data centers, semiconductor chip manufacturers, and other sectors that are looking to invest in the US. And low power bills can really dictate which states they select to make those investments in. And tariffs are going to further drive investment in the US. And with industrial growth across sectors, some of that driven by tariffs, power demand is only going to go up from here. And our country is going to need low-cost, fast-to-deploy electricity more than ever. And renewables are the quickest to market, and they're the lowest-cost option in almost every state. Otherwise, we're going to slow down and curtail economic growth in our own country. And the credits all flow directly to customers in the form of lower power prices.\nSo when you look at all that, why would you cut credits that are creating jobs, creating a much-needed property tax base in rural America, that flow to customers, that result in lower power prices, that attract new investments, and that provide a much-needed fast-to-deploy resource at a time when demand is accelerated? It just wouldn't make sense. And for all these reasons, we expect the credits to remain in place: the wind, the solar, the battery storage. So all in all, while we would expect to hear heated rhetoric through the fall campaign, we feel good about where things stand. Again, we have a long history of constructive engagement with both sides of the aisle.\n\nOperator\n\nAwesome. Appreciate all of that color. It's really helpful. The follow-up was just on the backlog. Wind saw a bit of an acceleration this quarter from being a bit weaker in the last several. Anything in particular you'd point to in sort of driving that? And do you think that's a potential sign of an inflection on the wind demand side?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nHi, Carly. It's Rebecca. We were very pleased to add these projects to the backlog, and excited about the partnership with the customers with whom we're going to contract them. I wouldn't necessarily draw any additional lines, as kind of consistent with the prior comments I made around backlog. Things are going to be lumpy over time. It's terrific that we were able to add some additional wind projects to the backlog. And right now, our expectations remain consistent with what we laid out last month, and obviously have again in our presentation materials today in terms of the targets over the next four years. But I did say, as part of our comments last month, I am optimistic, hopeful maybe, that as we look back after this four-year period, that is potentially the area where we may have been too conservative and maybe on the lower side of it.\nIt is early in this cycle to make that conclusion. But we strongly believe that wind, solar, and battery storage, as complementary technologies and low cost and fast-to-deploy, as John just highlighted, are immensely valuable to our customers. And so having the availability of all three, we think will continue to create value for our customer base over a long period of time.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Thanks so much for the time and the comments.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Carly.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning, everyone. Just a quick one to clarify, please. If I heard you right, I think you said you have 7GW in total with tech and data center customers. Can you just give us a sense of the pace, maybe roughly round numbers, how many megawatts per year you've been adding or expect to add? And then if you could also just clarify, is that purely in terms of wind, solar, and storage, or does that also include transmission?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nHi, Andrew. It's Rebecca. So that is just projects with technology companies. Roughly 3GW of those are already in service, and roughly 4GW now are the ones that are in the backlog that we plan to build over the coming years. It is a mix of technologies, probably trend-wise fairly consistent with what we have seen for overall trends for renewables development. So the projects that are already in service are likely to be more heavily weighted towards wind as we've entered into those relationships over a longer period of time. And then in terms of the backlog, for now, they're more weighted towards solar and storage, but I expect that to even out over time, particularly as these projects get more deliberately balanced with new data center demand as these hyperscalers and data center operators are starting to put projects in service.\nBroadly speaking, roughly consistent with overall development trends. We certainly are seeing a lot of demand both directly with them as well as in kind of these three-way collaborations with the utilities that ultimately will need to serve them as they are and will continue to be adding these new data centers and bringing them on themselves.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Great. Do you see much of an opportunity on the transmission side working with data centers, or is your focus more on what you were describing?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nI would say from a transmission perspective, all of this demand, whether it was the historical replacement cycle demand and now further accelerated by the growth demand, particularly as it gets served with renewables and storage, it is incredibly important that new transmission get built in order to be able to get the resources from which they're most optimally generated to where they're most optimally consumed. And that's changing a little bit. But what's not changing is the need to build transmission. We see interest from the hyperscalers and the data center operators to understand transmission and be supportive of it getting built. But it is very technically complex, and you need to understand transmission and how to interact with the system operators and the transmission owners and operators themselves.\nSo I don't see them necessarily wanting to build transmission, but they are very interested in having us and others ensure that it gets built to support their own long-term objective.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nSounds good. Thank you.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, team. Good morning. Really, really appreciate you taking the time and answering my question here. Just all my other questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up on Carly's questions on election and potential repeal of IRA risks. How much of that, you had a really strong quarter on renewable origination, but how much of that political instability is actually impacting your ability to sign contracts? Does that come up in your negotiations? Is that keeping your customers away from signing contracts into the future? Any color on that is appreciated. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Durgesh, the short answer is absolutely not. If anything, if they really did believe that there were going to be modifications, it would only accelerate demand, which is certainly not something that we believe for the reasons I went through. But it's not curtailing demand at all.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Durgesh.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Please go ahead.\n\nKristin Rose\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Drew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q1 2024 combined financial results conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our Q1 results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexterapartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Kristin, and good morning. NextEra Energy delivered strong Q1 results, growing adjusted earnings per share by 8.3% year-over-year based on FPL and Energy Resources financial and operational performance. We are once again off to a solid start for the year. In addition, FPL placed into service 1,640MW of new solar, while Energy Resources added 2,765MW of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. This quarter marks Energy Resources second best origination quarter ever, as well as its best solar, and best storage origination quarter.\nAs we highlighted at our March Renewables Development day, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned for the expected strong power demand growth through the end of the decade and beyond. After years of relatively flat US power growth, numerous reports now highlight significant future load growth being driven across industries such as oil and gas, manufacturing, and technology. The redomestication of industry in the US supported by public policy will drive the need for more electricity, and the tech industry is going to need data centers to support the expected cloud capacity demands that come with artificial intelligence applications.\nOf course, increased load demand will not come all at once and will take some time to materialize, but it is clear that many new customers are concerned about power availability to meet their plans and consider power supply as a significant obstacle to business expansion.\nWe believe renewables and storage are a key enabler to help meet this increased demand. In fact, we believe the US renewables and storage market opportunity has the potential to be three times bigger over the next seven years compared to the last seven, growing from roughly 140GW of additions to approximately 375 GW-450GW. We believe no one is better positioned to address these power supply challenges and capitalize on this demand in NextEra Energy. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables, storage, and transmission for the benefit of customers while also providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. Our enterprise-wide scale, decades of experience, and technology investments are key competitive advantages that allow us to drive value and meet this expected power demand. Scale is one of our key differentiators, and it matters more than ever.\nScale allows us to buy and build with better pricing, better protections, and better positioning to navigate disruption. Scale provides access to capital and cost of capital advantages, allowing us to leverage one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, and worldwide banking relationships to finance projects at beneficial terms. Scale has driven top decile operational performance throughout our generation fleet. Today, NextEra Energy's roughly 74-GW operating fleet, comprised of 35GW at FPL and 39GW at Energy Resources, provides significant operational scale as FPL continues its solar and storage buildout and Energy Resources brings new renewables and storage projects online for customers, the operating fleet could grow to over 100GW by the end of 2026. This would further extend our scale advantages and create value for customers and shareholders.\nOur scale has enabled greater supply chain diversification and flexibility, and the good news is the solar supply chain is much improved from two years ago. Inflationary pressures are alleviating, and manufacturing capacity is significantly expanding in the U.S. Manufacturing incentives are expected to support increases in domestic module manufacturing capacity to over 50GW by 2026 from just under 8GW at the end of 2021. We have greater supplier diversity and flexibility than ever before, strengthening our ability to bring low-cost solar to American consumers and businesses.\nOur decades of experience is another key competitive advantage. Our experience allows us to navigate power demand challenges, delivering cost effective reliable generation for our growing FPL customer base and designing clean energy solutions to help our energy resources customers. We understand every part of the energy value chain with deep expertise in all technologies, the power markets, and transmission. Our team embraces continuous improvement that drives innovation. We recognized the changing landscape and secured land, interconnects, and transmission equipment years in advance.\nTechnology is the next frontier for the power industry, and we believe our two-decade head start on the rest of the industry is a significant competitive advantage. Today, NextEra Energy captures 560 billion operational data points each day and has dozens of proprietary artificial intelligence tools to drive analytical, real-time decision making. We use these tools to analyze over 100 attributes of our own data to secure and develop the best sites in Florida and across the country. We use our tools to iterate millions of site layout designs based on proprietary resource data and assessments to maximize value, and we use our tools to operate nearly all our renewable, storage, and fossil generation fleets around the clock.\nFrom our headquarters in South Florida, we are leveraging this combination of enterprise, wide scale, decades of experience, and investment in technology to better position both businesses to capitalize on what we believe will be years of demand to drive long-term value for customers and shareholders.\nToday, electricity represents just 20% of overall U.S. energy consumption, and wind and solar generation represents only 16% of the U.S. electricity mix. In short, we believe the US will need a significant and growing amount of electricity over the next decade and beyond, a large part of which will be powered by new renewables and storage. At FPL, as more people move into Florida, we are focused on extending the customer value proposition by keeping our bills as low as possible and delivering clean, affordable energy by investing in solar, battery storage, and transmission. At Energy Resources, our business is focusing on building low-cost wind, solar, battery storage, and transmission. We are using our data and proprietary technology to help power customers balance supply and demand while keeping customer bills affordable.\nWe also use our tools with commercial and industrial customers to identify the best locations based on their physical preferences and most important variables for both power and commercial and industrial customers. We leverage our 300GW development pipeline, transmission, and market expertise to help design the lowest cost clean energy solutions. Both businesses complement each other, deepen our skill sets, advantages, and foster innovation, and we leverage our greatest asset, our people who have decades of experience to drive value for our customers and shareholders. When I consider current energy demands, the long-term electricity needs, and our competitive advantages, I wouldn't trade our opportunity set with anyone. I look forward to telling more of our story and explaining why NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to lead the electrification of the US economy at our investor day on 11 June in New York City.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kirk to cover the quarterly results.\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, John, for the first quarter of 2024, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.5% year-over-year. We now expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreement's four year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investments to be between $7.8 and $8.8 billion.\nFor the 12 months ending March 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During Q1, we utilized approximately $572 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of roughly $651 million. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year. Earlier this month, FPL received approval to reduce customer bills due to projected 2024 fuel savings. As a result, FPL's typical 1,000kWh residential customer bill is expected to be roughly $14 lower in May than the start of the year and approximately 37% lower than the current national average. Over the current four-year settlement agreement, we now expect FPL's capital investment to be slightly above our previous range of $32 billion-$34 billion.\nThis quarter, FPL placed into service 1,640MW of new cost-effective solar, putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at over 6,400MW, which is the largest utility-owned solar portfolio in the country.\nFPL's annual Ten-Year Site Plan continues to indicate that solar and storage are the most cost-effective answer for customers to add reliable grid capacity over the next decade. The 2024 plan includes similar levels of new solar generation capacity, 21GW across our service territory over the next 10 years, compared to our 2023 plan. But our 2024 plan doubles the expected deployment of battery storage to over 4GW, some of which we expect to be needed earlier than forecasted in our 2023 plan. With this plan, we expect to increase FPL's solar mix from approximately 6% of our total generation in 2023 to 38% in 2033 while continuing to provide customers with clean, affordable energy.\nFPL believes battery storage will play an increasingly valuable role for customers, serving as an attractive capacity complement to our growing solar generation. From providing system balancing needs in critical parts of FPL service territory to supplying energy during any time of day or weather condition, battery storage acts as a key resource to the system that is both valuable and cost effective for customers.\nKey indicators show that Florida's economy remains healthy. Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing states in the nation and had four of the five fastest growing U.S. metro areas between 2022 and 2023. FPL had its strongest quarter of customer growth in over 15 years, with the average number of customers increasing by more than 100,000 from the comparable prior year period. Although FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased by approximately 1.3% year-over-year, we estimate that weather had a negative impact on usage per customer approximately 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. After taking weather into account, first quarter retail sales increased roughly 4.1% on a weather normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued favorable underlying population growth, and usage per customer. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 13.1% year-over-year.\nContributions from new investments increased $0.15 per share year-over-year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.02 per share primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the quarter.\nThe comparative contribution from our customer supply business increased results by $0.04 per share. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.07 per share, half of which related to new borrowing costs to support new investments.\nEnergy Resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2,765MW to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 21.5GW after taking into account 1,165MW of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call. This highlights Energy Resources' ability to continue to identify an attractive and accretive investment opportunities, which provide strong growth visibility in the years ahead.\nWe recently placed 740MW of new solar and storage projects into service, which are being used to support data centers located in Arizona and New Mexico. Both of these projects are now one of the largest battery storage facilities in their respective states, and in combination with their co-located solar, each project enabled the local utility to serve their customers' need for new reliable clean energy to grow their own business operations. We are proud to continue to support our power and commercial and industrial customers to meet their growing power and capacity needs, create jobs, and provide economic development in these local communities. Our origination activities across our power and commercial and industrial customers are beginning to reflect the rising power demand.\nWe are seeing it manifest with our power customers in their state RFP processes and bilateral discussions where we deliver cost-effective renewables and storage to their grid. We are also observing it through interactions with our oil and gas, and manufacturing customers where we utilize our data and technology to help them make better siting decisions. Our technology customers have been a consistent driver of demand for many years reflected by our roughly 3GW operating portfolio and over 3GW project backlog as we partner with them to provide various clean energy solutions based on their key business variables. We are a partner with both our power and commercial industrial customers trust.\nWe can leverage our 3GW development pipeline, our 35GW operating renewables and storage portfolio, and our transformer and switchgear procurement covering Energy Resources build through 2027 to deliver projects for customers. As John said, the power demand growth is expected to be strong through at least the end of the decade. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for new renewables and storage origination. This is on the heels of two consecutive record origination years at Energy Resources. We continue to expect to remain on track for our overall renewable development expectations of roughly 33GW-42GW from 2023 through 2026. Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmission was recently selected by the California ISO to develop a new 82-mile 500kV transmission line in Southern California.\nWith a capital investment of more than $250 million, we believe this project could unlock over 3GW of new renewable generation capacity, supporting California's ambitious clean energy goals. This award follows a record year for NextEra Energy Transmission in 2023, and we remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this growing business. We continue to believe our ability to build, own, and operate transmission is a key advantage for our renewables business. Turning now to our Q1 2024 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. This quarter we entered into an agreement to transfer approximately $1 billion of tax credits throughout 2024, representing the bulk of our expected transfers for the year.\nOur long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024-2025, and 2026. From 2021-2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And as we announced in February, the Board of Directors of NextEra Energy approved a targeted growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats.\nTurning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the Partnership's transition plan and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. We bought out the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing in 2023 and have sufficient proceeds available from the Texas Pipeline Portfolio sale to complete the NEP Renewables II buyouts due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the ME natural gas pipeline asset is expected to be addressed in 2025. With a plan for the near term convertible equity portfolio financings. Well understood. We remain focused on the Partnership's cost of capital improving, which is critical for its success. With that objective in mind, we continue to evaluate alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financing with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond.\nTurning to the partnership's targeted 6% growth in LP distributions per unit. NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition this year to achieve its 6% targeted growth rate, and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners' growth plan. As a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically repowerings of approximately 1.3GW of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 100MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 1,085MW of repowers. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8925 per common unit or $3.57 per common unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its Q4 2023 distribution per common unit.\nLet me now turn to the detailed results. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $462 million and cash available for distribution was $164 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 840MW of new projects that either closed in the second quarter of 2023 or achieved commercial operations in 2023, contributed approximately $32 million of adjusted EBITDA, $7 million of cash available for distribution. First quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $37 million year-over-year driven primarily by unfavorable wind resource during the quarter, and lower generation at Genesis Solar project as a result of a planned outage for major maintenance. Wind resource was approximately 97% of the long-term average versus 102% in the first quarter of 2023. The incentive distribution right fee suspension provided approximately $39 million of benefit this quarter for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.\nFinally, adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution declined by approximately $44 million and $38 million, respectively, for the divestiture of the Texas Pipeline Portfolio. From a base of our Q4 2023 distribution for common units and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5%-8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit. With a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to expect the partnership's payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the Q4 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit.\nNextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31st, 2024 to be in the ranges of $1.9 billion-$2.1 billion and $730 million-$820 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2024 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, we will open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, then 2. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Steve Fleischman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, hi. Thank you. Just first question, just there's been press reports about potential. Another AD/CVD case to be filed related to solar panels. And, you know, Biden also talking about getting rid of the protection on the bifacial. Could you just talk a little bit more about how you're positioned to deal with those cases if they do arise? Changes if they arise. Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSure. Steve, this is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Let me take those in order. Let me talk about, first of all, the speculation around AD/CVD filing which, you know, may or may not occur, and then the bifacial exemption. But first on the AD/CVD.\nThe bottom line takeaway for folks is that we expect that any trade actions that would occur this time around will be very manageable. For several reasons, I'm going to go through them. This is not like circumvention. This is not circumvention 2.0. The solar panel market is in a very different spot. The first point I want to make is we don't expect any trade action, if it were to occur, to result in delivery stoppages. In any event, our panels are delivered well in advance of construction, which gives us a lot of time and opportunity to be able to troubleshoot any issues should they arise. Why do I think no stoppages are going to occur this time around? The main reason is the U.S. is the most expensive solar panel market in the world.\nAnd so there's a lot of economic reasons for deliveries to continue to occur. The second point I want to make is that given our scale, we have appropriate incentives and contractual protections that are in place in our agreements with our suppliers to ensure that delivery occurs timely. And we also don't put all of our eggs in one basket. We have a diversified set of suppliers, as you would all expect, and the ability to pivot from one supplier to another should any issues occur. So I feel like in very good spot there.\nThird point I want to make, and it's one that I hit in my prepared remarks, is that the U.S. and the global.\nSupply of solar panels is bigger than ever and it's growing. Let me talk, for example, about the U.S. market. Specifically, the U.S. domestic solar panel industry is getting stronger and stronger than it's ever been. One of the points that I made also in the prepared remarks is at the end of 2021, solar panel module capacity in the U.S. was about eight gigawatts. That's expected to be about 50 gigawatts by the time we get to 2026. The U.S. market is in a much different spot. There's already been 150 gigawatts of new U.S. solar panel factory announcements that have been made. If you talk to most U.S. domestic solar panel manufacturers, they're sold out through 2026, so they're certainly not having any trouble with demand, which is the other point that I want to make.\nSo now let's speculate a little bit. If a filing is made around antidumping, let me deal with that first. We find it hard to believe that any panels are being dumped into the U.S. market under the law that would be applied. As I said, the U.S. is the most expensive solar panel market in the world. It's two to three times higher than any other market in the world. If panels were being dumped, that could not be the case.\nThat's the first point I want to make on antidumping. The second point I want to make. If there were a countervailing duty claim filed, the Department of Commerce would first have to look into to see if the price of solar modules in Southeast Asian countries, for example, were being subsidized. We don't really have any way of knowing that until we see what gets filed. But, you know, after we see those arguments, we'll be able to make a better assessment. But countervailing duties, historically, I mean, if you look at examples for countervailing duties that have been applied in the past against China suppliers, they've typically been around, you know, 10%-15%. So even if those were to be applied in this case, you know, quite manageable.\nAnd the other point I want to make is that what's different is tariffs in this situation would be prospective and not retroactive. And so for all of these reasons, even if something were to move forward, we still have no way of knowing if it will. We are very well positioned to manage through this like we always do. Our inventory position and the contractual protections that we have in place are expected to give us strong coverage for our backlog through 2027. And by that time, as more and more U.S. production comes online, as expected, these trade issues will fall away. So that's AD/CVD. Let me just turn quickly to.\nA couple of minor comments on the bifacial exemption. The bottom line, the bifacial exemption, even if it's removed, really has no impact on NextEra. Why is that? We've contracted all of our panel needs through 26 February. And you know, we have very minimal exposure to the bifacial exemption being removed. And once, once that bifacial exemption, even if removed, it would expire at the end of February 2026 and it can't be brought again and reinstated for another eight years. So we feel like we're in a very good spot. And the last point I'll make is as more and more U.S. production capacity comes online and it's actually available by, we will continue to source from U.S. suppliers. So look, when you put all those things together, feel like this is very manageable and feel like we will be fine.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat was very thorough and helpful. Thank you, John. And then I guess one other question on the data center. So you talked about the backlog edge you had this quarter. Just as we go into this year and think about this, is this going to continue to be more kind of one-off or two-off quarter-by-quarter updates, or should we see more kind of potential for more like long-dated partnerships or kind of larger-scale agreements? How should we think about how that might develop?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nI think kind of all of the above, Steve. You know, our opportunity set is significant around data centers, is the point, first point that I'll make. I think if you look historically on what we've been able to do with data center customers, I don't think anybody's had better results than we have. I mean, if you look at just our gigawatts in operation, we have 3.5GW in operation. Today we have another three close to 3.5GW in our backlog with technology providers, we really understand their business, we really understand what it is they need. Part of that is because we spend a lot of time with them. We do business with all the, you know, what I would call the top five hyperscalers in this country.\nAlso doing business increasingly with some of the developers of data centers as well. We've owned data centers, and so we understand how they work, how they operate.\nWhat the CapEx and OpEx is and how it's driven by energy and power, and what the right locations are for them. We've developed tools to address them. And so what do we see? We see about a 15% CAGR through the end of the decade for data center demand. I think data center developers are really focused more than anything on three things. They want low cost energy. They want to be able to say that they've accomplished additionality from a decarbonization standpoint, which requires a new facility to be built, not an existing facility. And third piece is it's got to be in the right location and it's got to have speed to market. And you know, there's obviously been a lot of talk about renewables and nuclear. And I do want to. I'm a little more of a skeptic about nukes.\nAnd let me explain why that is. They're already in the ground, you can't move them. And if you look at the nuclear fleet, there's only 15 nuclear plants in this country that are west of the Mississippi. When you think about the 15 that are west of Mississippi, most of them are already rate regulated or long term contracted. So that really is just creating maybe an East Coast opportunity for those that aren't rate regulated and that aren't contracted. I think that's a small subset of nuclear units that could perhaps satisfy East Coast demand. But in our discussions with data center providers, you know, getting access to cloud capacity for Silicon Valley, Santa Clara in particular, is critical. I mean, we can all count on one or two fingers how many nuclear plants are located.\nIn those regions. Not many. You just can't move a nuclear plant. So the thing we bring to the table is a lot of flexibility and speed to market. We can put the renewable project exactly where it needs to be. And SMRs, I hear a lot of talk about SMRs. SMRs are still, you know, a decade to 15 years away. Not only do you have, you know, nine OEMs that are really struggling to access capital, you know, if we pass a sanctions bill against Russia, a nuclear fuel that's going to limit conversion and enrichment capacity in the U.S. for sourcing of nuclear fuel for these SMRs, which also is going to require a real step up in technology to get them done. And you're also dealing with undercapitalized fuel providers.\nI'm a real skeptic on SMRs really coming into the picture to satisfy data center demand anytime in the near future. So when you put all that together, I think the right answer is renewables. Our discussions with data center developers and providers, their first focus is renewables, and I hear a lot about the reliability concerns and well, what do you do when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine and the four hour battery is not enough? We can overbuild the battery. We can also help work with them to design a clean energy solution where if they do have a grid tie, we can green it up with RECs from our green desk.\nWe have technology and tools which we showcased back in March where we can identify parts in the country that not only the best resource areas but also the best fiber connectivity, the best water resource, and those are the areas that we're locking up. And we have the sites and we have the relationships. And so I don't think anybody's better positioned to capitalize on data center demand than NextEra is. And I'm very excited about what the future opportunities hold for us there. But the other thing I would say, and we'll talk a lot more about this at our investor conference in June, is this electricity demand is real. We've been in a period of static demand for decades, and the demand is not only coming from data centers, it's coming from decoupling from China, creating more domestic manufacturing around industry, around chip manufacturing.\nOil and gas industry continues to electrify. We continue to, even beyond data centers, see significant electric deployment demand. We have the tools, we have the sites, we have the relationships, and we are chasing those opportunities. And look, we're coming off our second best origination quarter ever. I think the results speak for themselves.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nWarren Sharp.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Guggenheim Partners\n\nJust maybe starting off on NEP, sort of given the continued pressure from capital markets and kind of the benchmark rates, are you sort of advancing any longer term resolution plans for the CEPFs? I mean have existing holders and maybe other infrastructure players showed any interest in transactions to fund and maybe simplify the capital structure for longer term growth? What could that look like? And is this sort of an analyst day disclosure? Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYes, sure. Thanks for the question. A few comments that I'll make on it. One is we have talked about private capital raise potentially being a solution to address back-end CEPFs for NEP. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in that, just given NextEra's stature in the market. NextEra Energy Partners stature in the market.\nAnd so those discussions continue to move forward. We don't have anything to say about them right now. We may not have anything to say about them at the analyst day. I wouldn't expect us to make a whole lot of comments at the analyst day about NEP. When we do have something to say about NEP, you know, as these discussions continue to evolve, we will address them at that point.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, perfect. So we'll stay tuned. And then lastly, John, on sort of the FEC, since the process disclosures have been made and obviously showed, you know, FPL was clear of any kind of wrongdoing, there were some kind of disagreements with the FEC commissioners on the nonprofit matters. Is there an appeals path and would there be any further kind of information request to FPL or NextEra or should we just close the books here?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, I think the way I look at it, Char, is plain and simple, FEC voted. They voted to close the matter. We're now moving on, and I think this is behind us.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Power, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay, perfect. That's it. Very comprehensive. Thank you, guys, and congrats on the results.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mr. Arcaro, your line is open.Is your phone muted accidentally?I'm sorry, we'll need to go to the next questioner. The next questioner comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the questions today. Appreciate it. Wanted to just ask John on the backlog. Good strength in the additions this quarter, and we continue to see a lot of strength in the solar and the storage piece of it. Wind's been a little bit weaker. So I guess just as you think about the difference in the returns on those projects, are there any sort of implications for your financial guidance and your plan as you think about the mix that you've seen actually evolve versus what is in that base plan?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nHi, Carly, it's Rebecca. I'll take that question. Good morning. Let me start with probably the most important takeaways first. Obviously, Kirk and John highlighted our continued expectations and expressed the fact that we'd be disappointed if we didn't meet the top end of those expectations as we've outlined. So that's most important. Secondly, we continue to be comfortable with the overall development expectations as we also highlighted in the prepared remarks. And that's consistent with what we've seen over time as we've long stated obviously there's a mix in technologies. We four years in advance are not always going to be predicting exactly where we're going to be able to develop and what our customers are going to be interested in. And notably since we laid those expectations out for the first time, a lot did change, including the passage of the IRA.\nThat had both an impact on changing dynamics for our customers, buying wind which was largely in advance, the expectations that the incentives would ultimately wind down and in the IRA, the introduction of the production tax credit for solar, which made solar more attractive than it was even before, as well as a standalone ITC for storage. So that really spurred demand for solar and storage. But if I can kind of take a step back and kind of pile into the question that Steve answered and some of the comments that John made earlier, we are seeing significant demand across the entire U.S. economy. That of course includes data centers, technology, AI-driven compute demand.\nBut it is also manufacturing the redomestication of the important industries in the U.S., and it is also oil and gas and chemicals companies looking to get lower cost energy solutions into their mix that spurs a need for a lot of build. So as we look at our 300GW of products that are in development and the integrated solutions and solutions that we're designing for our customers, I remain very optimistic about all of the technologies in various parts of the country. Wind is most economic in parts of the country. It's going to be solar and storage, et cetera. So I love the portfolio approach, and, from returns perspective, I think we continue to realize very attractive returns for all the technologies and, of course, adjusted for the types of risks that we think we take.\nSo mid-teens for solar and above 20% fully levered returns for wind and storage technologies. I think from an investor standpoint that's a very attractive.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nAwesome. Thanks for that, Rebecca. And then you mentioned in the prepared remark or the last question, 15% CAGR for data center demand growth through the end of the decade. I guess as you think about some of these other drivers that you've mentioned of increased power demand in the U.S. how do you think that will drive kind of overall load growth? Do you have expectations there through the end of the decade?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nWe'll have a lot more to say in terms of our expectations and certainly in context of a number of third party views at the investor conference. But I think it's safe to say at this point that we see strong drivers for a long period of time, decades into the future driving renewables penetration in electricity and electricity penetration into overall US and energy consumption, which sets up terrific dynamics for us to continue to compete and create opportunities to invest capital for our shareholders at very attractive returns. So I love our opportunity set.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you for that color.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. Thank you for giving me time. Maybe just Rebecca, on the topic of electricity demand growth, one of the questions we consistently get, I think John hinted on this, the 15% data center growth driving it is how quickly can you ramp up? So maybe can you just talk to that. Are there any constraints whether it's equipment, whether it's sites, how quickly can the generation side of this, the renewable generation, can ramp up?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nYeah, Durgesh, I appreciate the question. You know, I think a little bit of context is important. I think all of us, ourselves included, have really started talking about the significant change in load growth really over the last year, maybe even the last six months. You all very much appreciate that a development business, anything connecting to electrical infrastructure, usually talks in terms of years and sometimes a lot of years depending on the market to get something into place, in the ERCOT market is maybe a couple of years. Some markets in the Midwest that have had congested queue and some transmission constraints that could be five to seven years. Obviously we've been working for a period of time. I think we're the least behind of anybody with our 300GW portfolio. But some of this will take some time to materialize.\nI feel very confident in long-term trends. I feel really excited and pleased with our team's preparedness in terms of the development of that pipeline. I very much think our competitive advantages that John highlighted on scale, experience, and technology really position us well in the types of conversations we're having with our customers, creating this long-term visibility into demand dynamics. You guys asked John the question about data centers and how competitive we are with them. They are not looking for projects anymore. They are looking for integrated solutions that solve long-term problems for them, and we are a perfect partner for them with which to work.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat's very helpful, Rebecca. And then maybe just a quick follow up. I think you made comments around very healthy returns. Are you seeing higher returns, higher margins with your data center clients versus your other clients? I mean some of your peers have highlighted high returns there. Maybe just comment on that.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nI continue to believe we have very attractive returns across the board. Consistent with the comments that I've made today, as well as the comments we made at our Developer Day and included in our monthly updates for the investor materials. So mid-teens in solar and above 20% for both wind and storage. Of course, as we talk with customers and we have unique solutions that solve particular problems that they have, we design the solutions to meet those needs and, you know, always stay focused at the end of the day on what's the attractive value proposition from an investor standpoint, and we remain disciplined around that. So I love the portfolio, I love the positioning, and I believe what we ultimately deliver for investors is very attractive.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nThat is very helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.Excuse me, Mr. Tonet, your line is open. Is your phone.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGood morning.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nJust want to start off on storage. Originations coming in quite strong, and if there's any.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nHey Jeremy, it's Rebecca. I'm going to go for the presumptive close on the answer. Hopefully it's the question you actually asked. Storage origination is very strong, as Kirk highlighted in some of the prepared remarks and John commented in Q&A. As we 5think about our customers' need for energy and capacity, it remains a very attractive value proposition to incorporate storage to firm up renewables either co-located or separate. So we're seeing terrific origination from an energy resources perspective. And we've also talked today about the attractiveness of storage for FPL. So I'll hand it off to Armando to give some additional color.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Rebecca. So I would add, if you recall John and Kirk's comments, we filed our Ten-Year Site Plan which we do every year. Our Ten-Year Site Plan this year had the same amount of solar that it did last year which is a lot of solar, 21 GW over the next 10 years. But we doubled the amount of storage up to 4 GW of storage that we have in our plan. We increasingly see storage as an economical addition in our service area. My expectations are that as time goes on that we would likely add more storage to our plans going forward because it is that attractive in the overall economics especially as we add solar which again continues to be the best proposition from a cost standpoint for our customers.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you for that. Just going back to the renewable development day. Or for people that weren't able to make it. Any particular points wanted to highlight?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nJeremy, you broke up a little bit, so I'm going to again guess a little bit on what the question was, but I'm assuming it was what were some of the key takeaways from the Development 101 Day, and I hope it was a worthwhile time for our investors. We certainly were so proud of our team and talking about what it is that we believe differentiates us as we talk to our customers. It really was around that scale, experience, and technology, not just individually, how all of those are important, but also how they interact with one another. So as John highlighted, with the scale advantages comes the ability to deploy technologies that are unique, and with experience we actually are able to invest in capturing that data that we get from scale and put in technologies to actually get some really cool insights.\nSo I think the key takeaway from my perspective is significant load growth, certainly some opportunities to deploy that scale, experience of technology to deploy unique and compelling solutions to our customers. So I love our growth prospects. I love the position that we have, just as John highlighted in his comments, and look forward to telling you more at the investor conference in June.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session, and the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, LP earnings conference call.

Please go ahead.\n\nKristin Rose\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q4 and full year 2023 combined financial results conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy, Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy, Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources, and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our Q4 and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com.

With that, I will turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Kristin, and good morning. NextEra Energy had strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources in 2023. NextEra Energy delivered full-year Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $3.17, up over 9% from 2022, exceeding the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. From solar supply chain challenges to higher inflation and interest rates, NextEra Energy navigated through a challenging environment the last two years, delivering compound annual adjusted EPS growth of roughly 11.5% since 2021. These were unprecedented events for our sector and clear headwinds for renewables, but disruption often presents opportunity. At NextEra Energy, we relied on our 25 years of renewables experience and our culture of execution to navigate this tough environment.\nOn the strengths of our scale and competitive advantages, our world-class supply chain capabilities, customer relationships, access to and cost of capital advantages, the strength of our balance sheet, our data-driven development playbook, and our team, just to name a few, we successfully managed through the disruption. Our scale and competitive advantages served as key differentiators and allowed us to continue to deliver for our customers and extend our long track record of earnings and dividend growth. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of roughly 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. Over that same period, the remaining top 10 power companies have achieved, on average, compound annual growth in adjusted EPS of roughly 2%.\nNotwithstanding the strong adjusted EPS results, we recognize and are disappointed by the underperformance in the share price, and as we start 2024, we remain steadfast in our continued focus on execution and creating long-term value for shareholders. We believe the disruption over the last two years has made NextEra Energy an even stronger company. Our business model is more resilient, our development platform is even more advanced, and our supply chain is more diversified than it has ever been. Bottom line, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned headed into 2024, and there is good reason for optimism at NextEra Energy. Although nobody can predict with certainty what 2024 will bring, inflation and interest rates have declined from their peak, and NextEra Energy has taken steps to mitigate its exposure to interest rate volatility through its interest rate hedging program.\nThe Commerce Department has provided the final determination around circumvention, providing solar suppliers with more certainty around the rules and expectations of importing solar equipment. New solar supply chains have been established in the US and internationally, leading to lower solar panel prices, and we see the continued longer-term push towards EVs as being incrementally positive for continued reductions in battery prices. Solar panel and battery prices have already declined by roughly 25% from their peak over the last 24 months heading into 2024. We have proactively procured critical electrical equipment to complete our renewable projects, securing enough transformers and breakers to cover our expected build through 2027. Due to our scale and construction partnerships, we have not experienced any labor shortages impacting project timelines.\nUltimately, all these tailwinds are great for customers, and we believe should drive greater renewables demand in 2024 and beyond, all on the heels of consecutive record years for new renewables originations at Energy Resources in 2022 and 2023, totaling over 17GW. NextEra Energy offers a unique value proposition with two strong businesses that we believe are strategically positioned with outstanding prospects for future growth. FPL, which represents more than two-thirds of our company, is the nation's largest electric utility and continues to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition in one of the fastest-growing states in the US. Energy Resources, the world's renewables leader, has differentiated itself in an industry in which scale, experience, and being well-capitalized matters. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple.\nOur two businesses are deploying capital in renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers, providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we identify investment opportunities that drive value for customers and support Florida's growing economy while keeping bills approximately 30% lower than the national average. We focus on running the business efficiently and continue to lead the industry with the lowest non-fuel O&M per MWh of any large utility in the nation. Our emphasis on modernizing FPL's generation fleet to improve efficiency and reduce fuel costs has saved customers over $15 billion since 2001. We continue this trend in 2023 by placing into service approximately 1,200MW of cost-effective solar and expect to add roughly 4,800MW over the current rate agreement. By 2032, we expect to increase FPL's solar from 5% of our total generation today to roughly 35% by adding over 15,000MW.\nWe are also continuing to invest in FPL's grid to make it stronger and more resilient for our customers. Almost all of FPL's transmission system has been hardened with concrete or steel towers or poles, and we continue to invest in undergrounding our distribution system to further enhance reliability and resiliency for customers. The capital plan and the current rate agreement of $32 to 34 billion extends our customer value proposition and provides clear visibility for growth through 2025. Beyond 2025, we continue to believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest-growing states in the US, with a population growth that is expected to roughly double the national average through 2030. Florida's economy is also growing and is now the 14th largest in the world if Florida were a country.\nFPL is responsible for keeping the lights on for approximately $2 billion per day of Florida's GDP. These long-term growth prospects, coupled with investment opportunities in renewables, transmission, and distribution infrastructure, enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition and support our belief that FPL is the highest quality rate-regulated utility in the country. Energy Resources' deep expertise in renewables and transmission serves as a key differentiator with customers. As a result of our data-driven development playbook, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 9,000MW to our backlog. Driven in part by the roughly 5,600MW placed in service in 2023, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings almost 13% versus 2022. Energy Resources continues to see strong demand and is well positioned to realize its development expectations over the four-year period ending 2026.\nAssuming we achieve the midpoint of the range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 63GW renewable portfolio by the end of 2026 that would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but nine countries. Energy Resources also is extending its excellent track record of optimizing our existing footprint to create additional shareholder value. To date, we have repowered 6GW of our existing 24GW wind operating fleet, investing roughly 50 to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources' wind footprint could be roughly 32GW, and with over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering, it represents a great opportunity set.\nWe believe there are multiple opportunities to drive value from the existing footprint: multiple wind repowers, adding solar underneath existing wind, and co-locating battery storage with existing wind and solar. We have dedicated teams leveraging our development playbook to optimize our existing and future fleet. We can maximize existing land, permits, interconnection capacity, and operations to provide enhanced value to customers and shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources could operate up to 53GW of generation with the potential to co-locate battery storage, which represents a great long-term opportunity, especially considering the likely future capacity needs of customers. Throughout 2023, Energy Resources also continues to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business. As growth in renewables occurs throughout the US, there is a growing imperative to build additional or upgrade existing transmission. 2023 was a record year for our competitive transmission business.\nNextEra Energy Transmission was awarded projects to construct transmission in PJM, CAISO, and SPP that would roughly double the investments made in the existing business. We anticipate deploying approximately $1.9 billion of capital through 2027 to complete these transmission projects, which we estimate could enable up to 12GW of new renewables. Beyond 2026, Energy Resources is strategically positioned to benefit significantly from the irreversible shift towards electrification. With renewables only comprising roughly 16% of the US generating mix, Energy Resources is just getting started. Renewable penetration is expected to double to over 30% by 2030, and Energy Resources is ready. We have a substantial development pipeline, including roughly 150GW of interconnection queue positions for new renewables and storage projects. We believe Energy Resources has the most comprehensive renewable energy business in the world and is better positioned than ever to capitalize on long-term growth prospects.\nFPL and Energy Resources individually have executed well, delivering value for our customers. Both businesses complement each other, push one another to be better, and together create scale and foster innovation. We have one of the sector's strongest balance sheets and constructed and placed into service roughly 6,800MW of new renewables and storage projects in 2023. To put that into context, 6,800MW of installed US renewable generating capacity is enough on its own to rank as the fourth-largest US renewable energy company and the 14th-largest utility. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnership's transition plans and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. Last September, we made the tough decision to reduce the target distribution growth rate to 6% when NextEra Energy Partners no longer benefited from a competitive cost of capital.\nWith a growth rate now comparable to its peers, we are focused on the partnership's cost of capital improving, which is critical for its future success. Towards that end, we are evaluating alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financings with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond. We are executing against the transition plans, and with the closing of the Texas Pipeline Portfolio sale, the partnership has addressed two of the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings. The STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing has been extinguished, and we have sufficient proceeds available to complete the NEP Renewables II buyouts that are due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025.\nLooking ahead to 2024 and beyond, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth in LP distributions per unit target. The partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. We are executing against the growth plans and have identified approximately 985MW of wind repowers through 2026, making progress against our expectations. As we turn the page on 2023 and head into 2024, we are optimistic about the renewable sector, about our opportunity set, about customer demand, and about NextEra Energy's future. Demand for renewables has never been stronger, and yet the challenges have never been more complex, making the stakes even higher for customers. Our scale and competitive advantages are enabling us to be the partner of choice with both power and commercial and industrial customers.\nOn 14 March, we will discuss Energy Resources' development process in greater detail at our development investor event in Juno Beach and illustrate how our proprietary tools differentiate Energy Resources with customers. Then on 11 June, we will hold our NextEra Energy Investor Day in New York to discuss our long-term plans for both Energy Resources and FPL. Our optimism for NextEra Energy's future flows from the strength of our two world-class businesses, FPL and Energy Resources, that leverage our scale and competitive advantages to differentiate themselves as leaders. Our optimism is driven from our proven playbooks of deploying capital in renewables and transmission to create value for customers. But I am most optimistic because we have spent the last two decades building a world-class team at NextEra Energy, and it is by far our greatest competitive strength.\nOur team lives and breathes a culture of continuous improvement, working together to solve the tough challenges of the day. We drive innovation relying on data analytics and automation to make better decisions, and we have developed and deployed smart, low-cost, clean energy solutions that lead our industry. Most importantly, our team remains hyper-focused on continuing our long track record of execution, serving our customers with excellence, and providing long-term value for shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Kirk, who will review the 2023 results in more detail.\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Sean. Let's begin with FPL's detailed results. For the full year 2023, FPL's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.22 versus 2022. FPL's adjusted earnings results exclude the approximately $300 million after-tax gain on the sale of Florida City Gas, which closed on 30 November 2023.\nThe principal driver of the 2023 full-year performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.5%. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four-year term of our current rate agreement, which runs through 2025. For the full year 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the full year 2023, we used approximately $227 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2023 balance of roughly $1.2 billion. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in Q4, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.4 billion. These capital investments supported the successful commissioning of roughly 1,200MW of solar in 2023, continued hardening of the grid, and our efforts to underground our distribution system.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, our 25-MW hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center successfully achieved commercial operations. As a reminder, we plan to utilize this facility together with adjacent solar projects to create green hydrogen and blend it with natural gas at our Okeechobee plant. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains strong, and Florida's population continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country. Florida's economy continues to trend upward, and its GDP is now roughly $1.6 trillion, an increase of 9.3% over last year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, FPL's retail sales increased 1.6% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth, which increased by nearly 81,000 from the prior year comparable quarter.\nFor the full year 2023, FPL retail sales increased 0.6% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, also driven primarily by the strong customer growth in our service territory. Now, let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported full-year adjusted earnings growth of approximately 12.9% year over year. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.35 per share due to strong growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. Contributions from our existing clean energy assets decreased results by $0.11 per share, driven primarily by the impact of weaker wind resource. 2023 was the lowest wind resource on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.16 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses. Other decreased results by $0.26 per share year over year.\nThis decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.22 per share, of which $0.10 was driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 9,000MW of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog, which includes approximately 2,060MW since our last call. Our 2023 origination performance reflects continued strong demand from power customers looking for the least-cost alternative to serve load and to replace uneconomic generation, and commercial and industrial customers looking to help decarbonize their operation or meet their data center and AI demand. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 20GW after taking into account roughly 2,470MW of new projects placed into service since our Q3 call. We believe our 20GW backlog provides clear visibility into Energy Resources' ability to deliver for shareholders through 2026 and beyond.\nTurning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the full year, adjusted earnings from our corporate and other segment decreased by $0.08 per share year over year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. We successfully supported the growth in our underlying businesses from our strong operating cash flows, including the sale of tax credits, as well as our historical funding sources. In 2023, we grew cash flow from operations well in excess of our adjusted earnings. We transferred approximately $400 million of tax credits, establishing relationships with numerous counterparties. We believe this will prove to be a competitive advantage as buyers look first to NextEra Energy given its size, experience, and the overall quality of its tax credit program. Overall, our funding plans for 2024 through 2026 remain consistent with the information we shared on the third quarter earnings call.\nWe continue to believe NextEra Energy is well-positioned to manage the interest rate environment. While the recent decline in interest rates is encouraging, we remain committed to managing the business to deliver value for customers and shareholders. Overall, we believe we are well-positioned with $18.5 billion of interest rate swaps, and we will continue to closely monitor the interest rate environment as declines in rates certainly represent a tailwind for our sector and customers. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, and 2026. For the last 14 consecutive years, NextEra Energy has met or exceeded its financial expectation, which is a record we are proud of.\nFrom 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate, and we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. In terms of the transition plans, NextEra Energy Partners closed the sale of the Texas Pipeline Portfolio in late December, providing net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. NextEra Energy Partners expects to complete the NEP Renewables II buyouts of roughly $190 million and $950 million on their stated minimum buyout dates of June 2024 and 2025, respectively, as the partnerships continue to benefit from the low cash coupon through 2025.\nIn terms of NextEra Energy Partners' growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically repowerings of approximately 1.3GW of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today, we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 245MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 985MW of repowers with strong Cash Available for Distribution yield. While the partnership does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024, the LP distribution growth target of 6% is supported in part with roughly 175MW of wind repowers, which are expected to generate attractive Cash Available for Distribution yields. Finally, we were pleased with the high-yield note issuance of $750 million, which was completed during Q4 2023. This opportunistic refinancing allowed the partnership to pay off its corporate revolver in mid-December.\nLet me now turn to the financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $454 million, and Cash Available for Distribution was $86 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions, and the Incentive Distribution Right fee suspension, while Cash Available for Distribution was also impacted by incremental debt service. For the full year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.9 billion, up 13.6% year over year, and was primarily driven by the contribution from new projects acquired in late 2022 and during 2023, and the Incentive Distribution Right fee suspension. New investments added approximately $228 million, and the Incentive Distribution Right fee suspension added approximately $113 million of Adjusted EBITDA year over year. This growth was partially offset by a decline from existing projects driven primarily by weaker wind resource.\nCash Available for Distribution was $689 million for the full year and primarily driven by contributions from new projects of approximately $42 million and the Incentive Distribution Right fee suspension of $113 million, while being partially offset by the weaker wind resource. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.88 per common unit, or $3.52 per unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its Q3 2023 distribution per unit. The partnership grew its LP distributions per unit by more than 8% year over year. From an updated base of our Q4 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026.\nWe continue to expect the partnership's payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the Q4 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners is introducing 31 December 2024 run rate expectations for Adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.9 to 2.1 billion, and Cash Available for Distribution in a range of $730 to $820 million, reflecting calendar year 2025 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that, we will open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys.\nTo withdraw your question, please press star, then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. Our first question will come from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nMorning, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning. Just starting on NEP, if it's okay, just on the higher repowering opportunities you announced, I guess, how are you sort of thinking about funding? And really, more importantly, is there any specific status on the money pool that could be looking to buy in directly into projects, whether it's dropdowns or organic growth at the NEP level? Could these sort of equity investors help solve the 2026 growth and financing issues? And I guess, when do you plan to update on that?\n\nKristin Rose\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, NextEra Energy\n\nSure. So with respect to repowering, Shar, we look at that as on the project level, there's really two options there.\nWe can look at it from a project financing standpoint and pair that with transferability, or we can look at it as tax equity. So we will look at both of those options and decide that at the time of the repowerings. With respect to your second question, we're looking at all options right now, as John said in the prepared remarks. We are exploring a number of opportunities and alternatives for addressing the convertible equity portfolio financings that are coming due in 2027 and beyond. There's really not a time frame in terms of the update now, but we are looking at all options with the goal of really maximizing unit holder value.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. Got it.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nAnd Shar, Shar does a job just adding on to that, again, on the repowers, just like we do at NEE.\nI mean, just think about it as tax equity and project finance. Got it. Okay. And again, the private capital raises provide us with a number of options, but we're looking at a lot of different alternatives, that being one of them.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nOkay. Perfect. And then lastly, John, we haven't had any updates from the FEC. Has anything sort of been communicated to you regarding sort of the investigation, how quickly you would look to settle, assuming they take up the case? And as we're kind of thinking about the process, right, it's confidential. So curious on how you're going to update investors. Would we see a press release or an 8-K from you confirming the FEC process and that you'll update investors in the future on next steps, or could we see a single communication on the FEC pickup and a concurrent settlement, let's say?\nI'm just trying to assess how long this could be an overhang, assuming the case moves forward, and whether you've already laid the groundwork for all options to get this kind of past this quick when a ruling comes out. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question, Shar. So let me just take those in order. First of all, there's no update. We have not been contacted by the FEC. And I think just to remind investors of the timing, first of all, these are just guidelines I'm going to give you. I mean, there is no prescribed timeline in terms of the FEC providing a response to us. But as you may recall, we originally received the FEC complaint, I guess is what you would call it, that had been filed by a group called CREW back in November 2022.\nAnd if you follow the historical precedent of the FEC, it's usually 12 to 18 months after you first are notified of a complaint having been filed that you would learn whether or not the FEC decides to find that there's reason to believe that they ought to conduct an investigation. We have not heard anything from the FEC in that regard. The second thing I would remind investors of is this is not material. Again, these were five allegations totaling political contributions of roughly $1.3 to $1.5 million. So we're talking about smaller dollar amounts. And how and when we would update investors would depend on what exactly we hear from the FEC.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it, guys. See you soon, and congrats on the results. Appreciate it.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Shar\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I guess a couple of big picture questions. First, obviously, a lot more focus in the elections now as we're in 2024. And curious your thoughts in the event of Republican trifecta, so to speak, just how you're thinking about the sustainability of IRA provisions.\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nSure, Steve. Let me go ahead and take that. This is John. First of all, in the 21 years I've been at the company, as we've changed administrations and we've seen changes in Congress, we've never seen a change or repeal of tax credits, no matter what form they've taken. IRA is the form we're talking about here. So that's the first point I would make. Second, it's really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It's just very difficult no matter what the political winds are.\nThe third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it's flowing to Republican states, and it's flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. We're talking about rural communities in these states. So when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it's a complete turnaround for these communities. We're providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We're providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community.\nWe're providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward. Just think about hospitals, staffing doctors at county hospitals, or paying teacher salaries. I mean, the property tax revenues have significant benefits. And so for those reasons, we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle. So see any repeal of IRA as being unlikely.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. I guess two other big picture questions on the renewables business. Just any kind of new thoughts, caller, on your data center strategy and also your thoughts on hydrogen based on the proposed rules that came out?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CFO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nGood morning, Steve. It's Rebecca.\nFirst, on the data centers, clearly, there's an enormous amount of demand being driven across the US economy by the growth in data centers, driven by a lot of things, of course, but specifically Generative AI, and that growth is pretty explosive at this point. And I think the characteristics of that demand are a little bit unique and driving different ways in approaching the marketplace for a number of these technology companies, where it is imperative that these projects get built on time, on budget, and produce the energy that they're expecting because the opportunity cost for these customers is so significant if they aren't able to power them and, of course, meet the commitments that they've made to their own stakeholders.\nSo we're seeing those relationships expand and also deepen, where it's not just signing the megawatts of the day, but also working with them collaboratively over a long period of time to ensure that they get the energy and capacity that they need where they need it to support their projects. Just alone in our backlog, not even counting what we have installed, we have over 3GW of projects that we're building in the coming years for these customers. And I do believe that's the tip of the iceberg. And again, not even talking about what we already have installed. So it's pretty exciting, and our team is very ingrained in working with these customers, and we're excited about the years ahead.\nThen turning to hydrogen, obviously, the guidance that first came out, the draft guidance in December, is really steering towards hydrogen projects that will be essentially from day one needing to match on an hourly basis. And that, of course, increases the ultimate cost of hydrogen. And unfortunately, I think if it stands as currently drafted, would limit to an extent how much will be built for the US market. We're obviously advocating for more of a relaxed matching requirement, so more of an annual match for a period of time and then transitioning to hourly over time so that you can kickstart a hydrogen market. And hopefully, the administration will hear that and know that having a kickstarted hydrogen economy will certainly further their ambitious goals, which, of course, we are very excited about meeting to see the full decarbonization of the US economy over time.\nSo more work to be done, and we're excited to pursue the marketplace. Regardless, these are probably end-of-the-decade type projects, so more of an investment in the near term for opportunities in the long term.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nStock Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you very much.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CFO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nGood morning, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nMaybe on the renewables demand side of things, could you give a little bit more detail on the origination trends that you're seeing? I guess it looked like solar and storage quite strong in the quarter, but then wind a little bit lower in terms of the new bookings added. Maybe what's your latest confidence in achieving those 2025 and 2026 targets, particularly on the wind side of the business?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CFO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nHey, David. It's Rebecca. I'll take a first cut at that.\nWe're obviously excited about the origination, as John and Kirk have highlighted, originating 17GW over the last two years and both years serving as a record. So this year topping last year's record is very exciting. We also, of course, see the mix being more focused towards solar and storage. And as I've commented in the past, I think some of this is an aftereffect of the strong demand that we saw going into 2020 when we and others thought that the production tax credit would ultimately phase down and then ultimately go to zero over a period of time. So there was a pull forward of demand. And then the second dynamic that I think has impacted the short term is that the solar production tax credit clearly stimulated near-term demand and deployments for our customers. And obviously, we're very excited about that.\nStorage is growing at least as well as we thought, perhaps exceeding even our expectations in terms of adoption, not just in the Western markets, but now really spreading in a very constructive way through the Midwest. We've got, as John highlighted in the prepared remarks, a really advantaged position to be able to respond quickly to the demand characteristics that we're seeing where our customers need capacity quickly, where they hadn't anticipated the demand that they would see in their underlying business. So getting to market quickly is very much a premium and a priority, and we're there to serve them well. That storage market, as we've talked about from a returns characteristic standpoint, is an awful lot like wind and is certainly complex to deliver the value that our customers are looking for in the various streams.\nI'd say the other part that is at least as strong as we anticipated when we laid out the expectations is repowering. And we're excited about the economics of that, and economics specifically in context to the value that it brings to our customers, bringing some incremental generation and extending the life of these projects, often extending the contracts with our customers at the same times that we do repowering. So overall, with all those comments in context, I feel really good about meeting our development expectations in aggregate. We'll continue to look at the mix in individual technologies over time. But at this point, we're obviously leaving the ranges as we've had them now for a couple of years, in part to reflect what I'm sure you recall. Wind is a very short development cycle.\nMaybe not the actual laying the groundwork to be able to build a project, but when we enter into a contract and acquire the terms and put it into service can be as short as nine months. So there's still a lot of time left between now and the end of 2026 to add more wind to not only the backlog, but ultimately commission. And when I look at the forward couple of quarters, there are a couple of chunky opportunities that our teams are working on, and I feel good aboutnging some of those to fruition.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. Thanks for that. Very helpful.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CFO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThanks, David.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nAnd then maybe secondarily, just it sounds like the backdrop has gotten more challenging for small developers in the renewable space.\nWondering if you're seeing opportunities for market share gain as a result and potentially any development pipelines to pick up from developers that might be struggling right now?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CFO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nSure. We always are out in the development rights acquisition market. In the recent couple of years, we've really prioritized our greenfield portfolio in part because of our ability to work so closely with our customers and make sure that we're building the projects over the long term where they need them. But we will always be opportunistic in the development project market to be selective and create opportunities where it may be particularly attractive. The dynamic from a couple of years ago where a number of the development portfolios were acquired by folks looking to, I would say, compete with us, but certainly have a bigger presence on the development side. We haven't seen those holistically come back to market.\nI think that may change over time. I know the private equity cycle of wanting to be able to turn over capital quickly and realize isn't necessarily completely aligned with the development cycle, where sometimes things are a little bit faster, a little bit slower than you anticipated, and you need to be patient. So I'm optimistic there'll be opportunities. But most importantly, and this is one of the things that we'll focus on in March, is we want to keep our fate, our development opportunities in our own hands.\nI am super excited about what our team is working on from a greenfield development standpoint and the competitive advantages that we're investing in to make sure that we can serve our customers well, not just in the next two or three years, as we often talk about with you all, but the next five, seven, ten years plus down the road.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks so much for all the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Wanted to just ask about transmission. You highlighted the $1.9 billion of capital through 2027 at NEER. And as we look at the EBITDA contributions at NEER for 2024, that piece is moving higher as well.\nSo could you just talk a bit about what sort of growth you could see at NEER over the next several years and what that EBITDA contribution could be over time?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CFO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nGood morning, Carly. So from the pipeline perspective, as no doubt you appreciate, transmission opportunities take a couple of years to come to fruition. So we're thrilled with the awards that the team has been able to secure in the last year. On one part of it, building on investments that we already have, so expansion opportunities that are significantly enabling new renewables development headed into the California market, and then other parts of the US, competitive opportunities that we run through competitive processes. In terms of timing, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, the in-service dates are out to 2027. So as we invest capital, obviously, that'll start to become more of a material contribution over time.\nWe'll give more color as we get into the investor conference, as we typically do, to give more of a breakdown by business and what those contributions will look like over time. But the momentum is terrific. As we've highlighted, everybody understands, maybe not to the extent that we think it's going to happen, but in order to unlock the renewables opportunity that we and others see across the United States, transmission needs to be built. We stand ready to be a part of the solution wherever we can be and bring cost-effective solutions to customers.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. Then maybe just one more on the financing side for this year.\nJust based on what you've seen so far in the markets, how are you thinking about the mix of the different avenues that you can use to monetize tax credits, whether through tax equity or transferability? How do we think about the sort of magnitude of each of those in your financing plans for 2024?\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Carly, this is Kirk. The financing plan, as we shared in our prepared remarks, is consistent with the information we shared on the third quarter call. And as we approach those options, we will use the historical approaches, project finance and tax equity. But we're also very encouraged by what we're seeing with the transferability market. We are having really good progress. In those conversations, we're seeing really good demand for the NextEra Energy tax credit.\nUltimately, we look at all those as options and will optimize between project finance, transferability, and tax equity. We'll use those within the ranges that we shared in the 2024 to 2026 funding plan that we provided between the disclosure that we provided. But we are seeing really good demand for the credits and expect to continue to utilize transferability as an option going forward.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVice President and Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Appreciate that color.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi. Good morning.\nGood morning, Jeremy.\nJust wanted to build off that a little bit as what you're talking about before. How do you balance, I guess, looking forward, the wealth of growth opportunities and associated funding needs relative to dividend growth? Do you look at industry trends for dividend growth at all and how that might change as utility CapEx increases?\nJust a final point there. Just wondering how the E&P business competes for capital against everything else that you have in a lower gas price environment.\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nSure. So when we look at capital allocation, and you look at, we shared on the third quarter call, the returns that we see within the renewable business. And as we shared then, at Energy Resources, within, for wind, we see returns in the low 20s on a levered ROE basis. In solar, we see returns in the mid-teens, and then storage is also in the low 20s. And so it's great returns, and we look to get capital allocated to the renewable business. And that, as John discussed in the prepared remarks, we are allocating capital across both businesses and renewables and transmission. And so that is the priority with the way that we allocate capital.\nAnd then in terms of the funding of that, again, it's the way that we've traditionally funded the business. It's tax equity, it's project finance, and then we also use the transferability provisions.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Thank you for that. And then maybe just pivoting a little bit towards the backlog. A lot of additions in the quarter, but there was a little bit that fell out, I think, 350, and there was a little bit more in the post-2026 timeframe that's in the backlog. So just wondering if you could talk a bit more on kind of some of the drivers, the puts and takes within the portfolio addition composition over time.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CFO, NextEra Energy Resources",
    "content2": "Sure. I'll take that. In terms of the, obviously, the backlog additions are quite strong, and we're thrilled about that. And for this quarter, in terms of the removal that we had, it's really project-specific items.\nIn one part, it was really related to higher interconnection costs for a particular project where we need to go back and do a little bit more work. Very likely, these project megawatts will come back into the backlog. They're good projects, but in the near term, we're removing them while we work through the issues. I think it's important to keep in mind that as we add something to the backlog, it's tremendous visibility, and we're really excited about moving forward with the projects based on what we know at the time. But this is still a development business, and there are things that you have to work through before you commit significant capital to a project. Occasionally, some of those things that we work through are better.\nSometimes they're a little bit worse, and we need to make the decisions that are ultimately right for our shareholders at the time that we need to make them. So in context of a 20-plus GW portfolio, I think it's de minimis for what is kind of the normal run rate for development-type issues. And fortunately, we've worked through the issues that we had talked about over the last two years around anti-dumping, countervailing duties, and the significant changes in the marketplace related to the inflationary pressures and changes in the interest rates. So at this point, I think we're in kind of normal development. Every once in a while, there's something that changes our view on a specific project, and we're going to do the right thing from a shareholder perspective and only commit capital where it makes sense.\nGot it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect."

Growing adjusted earnings per share approximately 10.6% year-over-year. In the quarter, FPL continued to deliver outstanding value to its customers in what we believe has been one of the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the nation. FPL's bills are well below the national average, and we are relentlessly focused on reliability and running the business efficiently. Energy Resources extended its leadership position in renewable energy during Q3 with strong adjusted earnings growth and its best renewables and storage origination quarter in its history. NextEra Energy has clear growth visibility through FPL's capital plan and Energy Resources' over 21 GW renewables and storage [backlog].\nWith the strongest balance sheets in the sector and worldwide banking relationships, we believe NextEra Energy has both significant access to capital and cost of capital advantages and is well-positioned to continue to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Now let's turn to FPL's detailed results. For Q3 of 2023, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth, approximately 13.6% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year 2023 capital investments to be between $9 and 9.5 billion.\nFor the 12 months ending September 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes or will be approximately 11.8%. During Q3, we reversed roughly $245 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of over $1.2 billion.\nOver the current four-year settlement agreement. We continue to expect FPL to make capital investments of between $32 to 34 billion. Our capital investment plan is well established and focused on enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry.\nKey indicators show that the Florida economy remains healthy, and Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing states in the country. FPL's Q3 retail sales increased 3% from the prior year comparable period due to warmer weather, which had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 2%. As a result, FPL observed solid underlying growth in Q3 retail sales of roughly 1% on a weather normalized basis.\nNow let's turn to Energy Resources which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 21% year-over-year.\nContributions from new investments increased $0.11 per share year-over-year, while our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.02 per share, which includes the impact of weaker year-over-year wind resource. The comparative contribution from our customer supply and trading and gas infrastructure businesses increased by $0.04 per share and $0.01 per share, respectively. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs by $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments.\nEnergy Resources had a record quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 3,245 MW to the backlog, which is the first time we have exceeded 3 GW in a single quarter. Although we will remind you that signings can be lumpy quarter to quarter, we do believe this is a terrific sign of strong underlying demand for new renewable generation. With these additions, our backlog now totals over 21 GW after taking into account roughly 1,025 MW of new projects placed into service since our Q2 call. We also removed roughly 1,180 MW from our backlog, including roughly 800 MW of projects in New York following an adverse decision by NYSERDA two weeks ago. We are optimistic that these projects will ultimately move forward but are removing them from backlog for now. The remaining megawatts were removed due to permitting challenges.\nOverall, we remain on track to achieve our renewable development expectations of roughly 33 to 42 GW through 2026.\nThis quarter's backlog additions include roughly 455 MW to repower existing wind facilities, which includes Energy Resources' share of approximately 740 MW of repowers within the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, which I'm going to discuss in a few minutes. As a reminder, in a repower we invest roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build, are able to refresh and enhance the performance of the turbine equipment, and start a new 10 years of production tax credits, collectively resulting in attractive returns. Energy Resources has previously repowered roughly 6 GW of its approximately 23 GW operating wind portfolio, and we believe we will be able to repower much of our existing wind portfolio in the coming years.\nAlso included in the backlog additions are roughly 250 MW of standalone battery storage projects co-located with existing wind and solar facilities. The combination of the stand-alone storage tax credit and the ability to utilize existing interconnection capacity from our operating renewables and storage footprint positions us well to serve our customers' growing needs for capacity.\nTurning now to our Q3 2023 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year.\nOur long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 through 2026. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range, and we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year for at least 2024 off the 2022 base. As always, our expectations are subject to our caveats.\nGoing forward, we plan to fund the business in a manner similar to how we have historically done so at both FPL and Energy Resources. This includes utilizing cash flow from operations for roughly half of our funding needs. In addition to tax equity, project finance, and corporate debt. Sale of tax credits is serving as a new source of capital funding for NextEra Energy. We expect to transfer roughly $400 million in tax credits in 2023 and expect this amount to grow over the next couple of years to approximately $1.6 to 1.8 billion in 2026. This dynamic has reduced NextEra Energy's capital recycling needs, including those previously met via sales to NextEra Energy Partners, which has historically averaged roughly $1 billion of annual cash proceeds.\nLet me address future equity issuances specifically. Our balance sheet and financial discipline remain core to our strategy as we find attractive investments for our customers and shareholders. We expect to fund those investments in a way that maintains the strength of our balance sheet. As a reminder, over the last five years we have issued roughly $1.5 billion annually on average of equity in the form of equity units. We do not expect to issue any equity for the balance of 2023 and expect our year-end credit metrics to exceed those specified by the agencies to support our credit ratings. Our current ratings.\nFrom 2024 through 2026, we would expect our total equity needs to be no more than $3 billion in total. With continued reliance on equity units to satisfy our equity needs, which have no dilution for the first [three] years.\nWe believe FPL and Energy Resources are well-positioned to manage interest rate volatility in the current environment. At FPL, we primarily rely on the surplus mechanism to offset higher interest rates for the benefit of customers. In addition, FPL's rate agreement already provided for an ROE adjustment to 11.8%, enabling it to earn a higher ROE in the current higher rate environment. We expect that FPL will be able to absorb much and potentially all of the cumulative effects of the current interest rate environment through the use of the surplus mechanism over the remaining settlement period. Consistent with the expiration of the current rate agreement, FPL expects to file a rate case in early 2025 for new rates effective 2026.\nFor Energy Resources and Corporate and Other, we now have $20.5 billion of interest rate hedges in place.\nWhile the amounts vary as we add and settle hedges, the tenor of the swaps are between five and 10 years and have a weighted average rate of roughly 3.75%. Swaps allow us to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on Energy Resources, backlog return, and capital holdings, $12.8 billion of debt maturities from 2024 through 2026. Specifically, these swaps allow us to hedge the project-level debt funding we expect to issue on our renewables backlog as well as a portion of the $12.8 billion of near-term maturities.\nTo put this all in perspective, NextEra Energy sensitivity for an immediate 50 basis-point upward shift in the yield curve has essentially no expected adjusted EPS impact on 2023 and 2024 and has on average $0.03 to $0.05 of expected adjusted EPS impact in 2025 and 2026, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of our adjusted EPS expectations. This sensitivity of course assumes we do not implement other offsetting initiatives, including among others, our normal process of cost reductions and capital efficiency opportunities.\nOur backlog is in good shape and is benefiting from our interest rate swaps, global supply chain management capabilities, and the ability to procure equipment, materials, and balance of plant services at scale across our portfolio. The expected returns on equity for our backlog are mid teens for solar and over 20 for wind and storage. As we have done historically, we price our power purchase agreements commensurate with current market conditions, including our current cost of capital, in order to maintain appropriate returns. In addition, at the time of our final investment decision, before we commit significant capital to our backlog projects, we are utilizing interest rate swaps on contracts that were entered into when rates were lower to maintain our return expectations.\nWe remain financially disciplined and pass on projects that don't meet our return expectations. Going forward, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in lower equipment pricing for solar panels and batteries given increased competition globally and declining prices for materials, which we believe will help offset the impacts of higher interest rates on power purchase agreement prices. We are optimistic that demand will remain resilient due to the factors you all know well, including the continued cost competitiveness of renewable energy relative to alternative forms of generation. Importantly, to date demand has remained strong as evidenced by our substantial new additions to backlog this quarter.\nNow let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. As a reminder, the partnership is a financing vehicle that grows its distribution by acquiring assets with long-term contracted, high-quality cash flows and financing those acquisitions at low cost. Over the years, NextEra Energy Partners has been able to rely on low-cost financing to help drive its distribution growth. To meet its financing needs in recent years, the partnership has relied primarily on convertible equity portfolio financings that have a low cash coupon during their term and convert into equity over time. A significant amount of the equity required to be issued to buy out these financings began coming due this year and over the next several years, which we believe contributed to the partnership's trading yield almost doubling at the same time interest rates were rising.\nConsequently, the partnership's cost of capital increased, which made it difficult to support a 12% growth rate in a way that is sustainable and in the best interest of unitholders over the long term. By reducing the growth rate to 6%, NextEra Energy Partners LP distribution rate is now comparable to its peers and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. In order to meet these objectives, the partnership is focused on first executing against this transition plan. As a reminder, the transition plans include successfully entering into agreements to sell the Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio and Meade natural gas pipeline assets this year and in 2025 respectively.\nDoing so will enable the partnership to address the equity buyouts associated with the STX Midstream, the 2019 NEP Pipelines, and NEP Renewables, two convertible equity portfolio financings due through 2025 through the period of our current financial expectations. That would leave a small equity buyout of roughly $147 million on the Genesis Holdings convertible equity portfolio financing in 2026. The partnership is continuing its process to sell the Texas Pipeline Portfolio and expects to have an update on or before our Q4 call in January. NextEra Energy Partners is focused on executing against its growth plan for unitholders. That plan involves organic growth, specifically repowerings of approximately 1.3 GW of wind projects, as well as acquiring assets from Energy Resources or third parties at favorable yields.\nImportantly, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth in distributions per unit target. Today, we're announcing plans to repower approximately 740 MW of wind facilities through 2026, which require the final approval of the Customer's Board of Directors, which is expected to be received in the near term. The repowerings are projected to generate attractive CAFDA yields, and the partnership expects to fund the repowerings with either tax equity or project-specific debt. Repowerings represent an efficient way to support the partnership's growth target. Overall, we are pleased with this progress and remain focused on executing additional repowering opportunities in the future across NextEra Energy Partners' roughly 8 GW wind portfolio.\nTo minimize the volatility associated with changes in interest rates and support the growth plan, the partnership also executed roughly $1.9 billion to hedge refinancing costs for the 2024 and 2025 maturities. The resulting expected refinancing costs of the maturities are factored into our expectations.\nTurning to the detailed results, NextEra Energy Partners Q3 Adjusted EBITDA was $488 million and cash available for distribution was $247 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 1,100 net MW of new long term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2022 and the approximately 690 net MW of new projects that closed in the Q2 of this year, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted EBITDA and $32 million of Cash Available for Distribution. The Q3 Adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects increased by approximately $5 million year-over-year. Q3 results for Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distributions were positively impacted by the Incentive Distribution Rights fee suspension and provided approximately $39 million of benefit this quarter, more than offsetting the Cash Available for Distribution.\nImpacts of Lower PAYGO Payments Driven by Lower Wind Resource at Existing Projects. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8675 per common unit or $3.47 per common unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its Q2 2023 distribution per common unit. From a base of our Q2 2023 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.42, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. For 2023, we expect annualized rate for the Q4 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to $3.52 per common unit.\nNextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at 31 December 2023 to be in the ranges of $1.9 to 2.1 billion and $730 to 820 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024. Contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. The adjusted EBITDA and related cash available for distributions associated with the Texas Pipeline Portfolio have been excluded from these run rate financial expectations.\nAs always, our expectations are subject to our caveat. While NextEra Energy Partners navigates through this current environment, it's important not to lose sight of the value of the underlying portfolio.\nNextEra Energy Partners is the seventh largest producer of electricity from the wind and the sun in the world, with over 10GW of renewables in operation. The partnership owns renewable projects that deliver high quality cash flows in 30 states serving 94 customers with an average counterparty credit rating of BBB+ via contracts with an average remaining contract life of 14 years. We remain optimistic the partnership can be an attractive vehicle to own existing renewable assets over the long term. We want the partnership to be successful and separately to address a question we've been receiving from some investors, NextEra Energy has no plans to buy back NextEra Energy Partners. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Kirk. Let me briefly address NextEra Energy Partners. It's been a difficult year, and we have a lot of work to do. As Kirk shared, we are focused on executing against our transition plans and look forward to providing an update on the Texas Pipeline Portfolio sales process on or before the Q4 earnings call. We are also focused on delivering LP distribution growth of 6% through at least 2026, and the repowerings we announced today are a good start towards achieving that objective.\nAt NextEra Energy, our foundations are rooted in FPL, the nation's largest electric utility, and NextEra Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables. Both businesses have performed very well, complement each other, and push one another to be even better. This is validated by the solid financial and operating results both continue to deliver, and the excellent progress we are making against our development expectations. Over recent weeks, we met with many of our investors and have welcomed your feedback. In response, we addressed many of the questions we heard from you in our remarks today and in the presentation materials you now have. Along those lines, I want to reiterate the solid fundamentals on which NextEra Energy is built and our outstanding prospects for future growth having just completed our annual strategy review process with our Board of Directors.\nFPL remains among the best utilities in the United States, achieving top operational performance across key metrics while maintaining the industry's lowest cost structure, one of the cleanest emissions profiles, and a customer bill that is roughly 30% lower than the national average. It is located in one of the fastest growing states with what we believe is one of the country's most constructive regulatory environments. FPL has by far the lowest non-fuel O&M of any large utility in the nation. Over the last 20 years, our relentless focus on costs, efficiency, and low bills have saved customers nearly $15 billion in fuel cost alone year after year. FPL receives top accolades for reliability despite operating on a peninsula and historically facing a high probability for hurricanes.\nIt has plans to add approximately 20GW of solar over the next 10 years for the benefit of its customers while undergrounding its distribution system to lower operating costs and withstand the impacts of hurricanes. To help keep the Florida economy, which is now the 16th largest in the world, running on all cylinders. We believe FPL is the highest quality regulated utility in the country.\nAt NextEra Energy Resources, we are just getting started. Renewable penetration as part of the US generating mix currently stands at roughly 16% and is expected to double, reaching over 30% by 2030. As the world's leader in renewable energy with an approximately 20% market share in US renewables origination, Energy Resources stands to benefit significantly from the unstoppable shift towards electrification.\nExperience and scale matter and with over 20 years of renewables experience, a 31-MW operating portfolio, a development pipeline of roughly 300 GW of renewables and storage projects, and roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions, we are well-positioned for future growth. In addition to our scale and competitive advantages that you all know well, our ability to finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector provides us with an access to and cost of capital advantage. We believe all of this enables us to differentiate ourselves in a complex macro environment to build even more renewables at attractive returns. In short, we believe Energy Resources has built the most competitive and complete renewable energy business in the world and is better positioned than ever to lead the decarbonization of the US economy.\nWe have spent the last two decades building a world class clean energy platform powered by our greatest strength, our people and a culture of continuous improvement that drives innovation and smart clean energy solutions. I want to extend my appreciation to our team today as we remain committed to serving our customers and providing long term value for our shareholders. Thank you and now we welcome your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your headset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star, then 2. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nOur first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah, hi. Thank you. Just a couple questions. First on the slide on the tax transferability and the $1 billion dollars effectively creating $6.5 billion of equity content. Could you just talk to that more, and just I think if I do the backward math, that's about a 15% FFO to debt kind of calculation. Is that kind of what you're using to get to that or is there more nuance to it?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYes, Steve, on that slide, I'll take that. This is John. The example is $1 billion. You take $1 billion, you divide by the 18% FFO to debt that you about $5.5 billion, you add the $1 billion of cash that you receive, and that gets you the $6.5 billion of equity content on a $1_billion transfer.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Okay. And when you lay out your, that would seem to be a key part since you talked about the transferability numbers going from $400 million to $1.7 billion.\nThat's the key part. That would show up in your funding plan in the corporate debt issuances.\nNow, since it's not tax equity anymore, that might be kind of matched against that or would it be in the tax equity and project? How do we think about where it shows up?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThe way I think about it is it's going to show up in your cash flow from operations. That's the cash that you actually receive. There's also some equity content that benefits the rest of the sources, including corporate debt issuances.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Okay, helpful. Then, one other question on the —\nSo the tenor of the interest rate swap seems pretty long, which is helpful. Just when we think of how you're using the swaps to kind of basically limit interest rate risk of the projects, how much project, if there's $1 billion of a project, how much is project debt going forward, percent of that? Let's say that you might be using a swap against.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, the way to think about it, Steve, it's 70%. When you think about our backlog, just some rough math. If you take the $20.5 billion, I would think about roughly $15.5 billion of that or so going against the backlog, and then the balance going against near-term maturities that we have through 2026. The interest rate sensitivity that we have given you includes our exposure on everything. Right. On the project debt, you know, on the corporate debt issuance, and it includes it all.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just one overall question on the renewables environment. Maybe you could just talk to just a little more color on what you're seeing because there's been a general view that the higher cost of capital environment's really slowing, you know, renewables growth. Maybe just more color on what, you know, what you're seeing. And is there going to be a slowdown that comes, you know, next quarter because of the move up, or just more color on the overall environment would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYes, Steve, I'm going to turn over to Rebecca, but one thing I would say is the renewable business is increasingly moving more and more towards the scale players, and you can see reasons why. One of them is the ability to have a balance sheet to actually enter into the kind of interest rate hedges that we can enter into. If you can't do that, that really puts you at a significant disadvantage. Then all the other competitive advantages that you're all aware of, where we buy at scale, we build at scale, we operate at scale.\nThe last point I want to make is the cost of capital advantage in today's market environment. Having a strong balance sheet with an ultimate parent with an A- rating is really, really important and a super big competitive advantage that we have over the smaller developers that we compete against. I's a big part of our success. Let me turn it over to Rebecca to talk more about what she's seeing in the market.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nGood morning, Steve. We are thrilled with the fignings that we posted for this quarter. Obviously, Kirk highlighted that 3.2 GW is a record for us. It's specifically the first time we've been over 3 GW. It represents all the things that I think you would want to see, which is strong returns across the portfolio, a great mix of technologies, a good mix of customer type that we signed and entered into these agreements, and also a mix of signings in terms of the dates and across those technologies. You know, there were our first additions to the backlog in 2027.\nI actually think it is slightly disproportionate to what we're seeing in terms of our overall backlog and a strong pipeline of projects that we see going into Q4, which are far more weighted to a little bit in 2024, and a lot more in 2025 and 2026. We're really excited about it. Really strong and exciting development pipeline. I'll echo John's comments, and it's really what we're seeing on the ground, that after some weariness over the last couple of years, our customers are really drawn to us for our ability to execute. They understand the pipeline that we're building and the resources that we bring to bear to get projects successfully built. And I think that increasingly matters and we're going to continue to address accordingly. But all signs are very positive for what I've seen today.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nSenior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nMorning, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nMorning. Just maybe quickly touching on the embedded expectations for NEP, I guess in terms of the Texas pipeline sale, John, are there any more comprehensive updates on the process? And I guess are you anticipating any delays or challenges in light of the market conditions? Kind of the reason why I ask is there's obviously a theory out there or thesis that you're having a little bit of an issue offloading these assets. I'd love to maybe if you can give a little bit more color in anticipation of your full disclosures.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, sure. Thank you. Let me start by saying, you know, obviously, as we said in our prepared remarks, our focus is on selling these pipes growing at 6% and putting NEP in a position to succeed going forward. Along those lines, we continue to work very diligently on the sales process. We're working with counterparties to get it done. At the same time, you know, look, this is a little bit more of a challenging macroeconomic environment. These are very valuable pipes, and we are looking for a transaction that maximizes value for unitholders. We're going to continue to be disciplined, but in terms of the progress that we're making, things are continuing to advance and move forward, and we look forward to having a further update either on the Q4 call or sometime before that. In terms of where we are.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nDo you anticipate the repowering to sort of fully offset the Meade Pipeline sale in 2025?\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nHey, Shar. It's Rebecca. I'll take that one. We're super excited about repowers as part of the longer term growth plan within NEP. With such an extensive pipeline of renewable projects to pursue these repowers, it'll be a nice complement to continuing to acquire assets. It doesn't meet the entire growth plan, but certainly is a nice part of it. As we talked about in May, we have a total of 1.3 GW that we see in the near term, and obviously this is the first step forward.\nIn order to make progress on that so attractive CAFDA yields. As we noted, there's still some steps to finish, but we're also not done with the opportunities to repower other assets in the portfolio.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it.\nPerfect. Then just lastly for me, just on the sources and uses of cash, I think we all really appreciate the enhanced disclosures there. I guess obviously, given the capital intensive nature of the business, do you anticipate any incremental levers to potentially offset $3 billion of equity and $3 billion of asset sales? If the capital market conditions become a bit more challenged, I guess any reason to rethink around flexing the payout or the balance sheet metrics? Thanks guys.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, listen, thank you. Thank you, Shar. Obviously we are very, very focused as always on costs. We're very, very focused on capital productivity inefficiency as well. Those are two levers we always have. I think our shareholder base is very familiar with the success that we've had in our annual cost reduction processes that we run across the company, but those are certainly point focused for us. Look, you know, when I think about the $3 billion of equity and the $3 billion of asset recycling and look historically what we've been able to do, I'd be pretty disappointed if we can only do $3 billion of asset recycling. I mean not only through NEP, but third parties. As a reminder, over the last three or four years we've been very successful in selling renewable projects not only to NEP, but to third parties.\nThink about the OTPP transaction, the Apollo transaction, the KKR transaction. So we feel very good about our sourcing plan that we've laid out and.\nLook forward to executing against it.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Thank you guys, much appreciate it. Congrats.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\nThanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nMorning Dave.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nI'm wondering if you know you mentioned returns over 20% returns for storage and wind. I think that's higher than you've indicated in the past. Assuming that's driven by higher PPA pricing, was wondering if you're seeing, just given higher PPA prices, any impacts to demand in the renewables market here and how you think about that level of return in terms of whether it's sustainable given the competitive dynamics in those end markets. Thanks.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nDave, I'll take that. As you know, we've always characterized the backdrop for renewables as a competitive environment. I'm very proud of how this team, our team, has executed across an ever changing environment. I certainly think it's a strength of our team. Most importantly, the competitive advantages that John has highlighted, investment over a long period of time, the ability to work with our supply chain, the ability to work with the folks that we partner with to build the projects, and ultimately operate these projects well over time. That really contributes to our ability to maintain appropriate returns. I also think it reflects what you expect us to do, which is adjust to all of the current costs of both building, financing, and operating projects over time. We believe that we are successfully able to achieve that.\nIn terms of demand, obviously we can't fully predict the future, but I can tell you that the two data points that I think are really top of mind and illustrated from our report is 3.2 GW is a fantastic sign, I think, of demand and as I highlighted a minute ago to Steve's question, a good underlying foundation of technology, dates, locations, et cetera. I'm really pleased. Also in looking at the pipeline for Q4, you know, obviously this is a development business, things can change, but I believe that we're in good position to continue realizing strong demand, particularly in that 2024 to 2026 time frame. Based on what we see today, very exciting.\nI think it's founded on the things that you all know well, which is a backdrop of increasing electrification, so increasing demand for generation and capacity value across our sector and renewables continuing to be the least cost form of generation. I would hope you would expect what I would argue is the best positioned company to execute well against an environment like that.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks, that's really helpful. Was also curious on the tax credit transfers market, could you touch on what you're seeing in terms of demand and interest from counterparties? You know, how deep is that market and what level of pricing that you're realizing when you're transferring these credits as it becomes a more important source of cash flow over the next few years?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, Dave, I'll take that question. You know, first of all, you know, I would argue we have one; we have an outstanding tax department, and our tax department together with our treasury group started early, and you know, we've already reached out to 50 of the top US taxpayers and are building relationships and have had terrific execution against our 2023 plan. The demand is extremely robust for tax credit transfers. We're already working on 2024, you know, as we speak, and having 2023, you know, pretty much behind us. One of the things that really helps NextEra in the tax transfer market is the fact that we have a strong balance sheet. We have an A- rating from the parent, and we're able to underwrite the credit.\nBeing able to underwrite the credit is really, really important because we compete against a lot of really small developers that can't if you go to the top 50 taxpayers, they've never heard of these companies, they don't know who they are, they don't really know what they do. They know NextEra and we can provide an indemnity behind the tax credits that we transfer. It sleeves off our vest, so to speak, to do that. We get preferred pricing because of it. I feel great about where things stand in terms of our tax credit transfer program.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nI'd love to add one point on that. I think it's a great complement to our broader business, and particularly the CNI customers that we're working with actually buy some of the renewable energy. Some of the customers that are most active in the market in procuring renewable energy are also the ones that are most interested in buying tax credits from us. I think they really like the value proposition certainly of the economics, as John highlighted, but really like the value proposition supporting and enabling investment in renewable projects. We see a really deep market, a lot of interest, and really a lot of cross-selling opportunities across the portfolio.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, great. Appreciate all the color. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey team, good morning. Thanks for the time.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources\n\nMorning, Julien.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nMorning.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. Hey, just going back to the last question a bit. How do you think about the composition of the $25 to 35 billion of [project 5] tax equity and tax credit transferability? How do you think about your existing tax equity commitments, and how do you think about some of the impacts from a regulatory perspective on the tax equity market? Obviously you're talking about a robust start to the tax credit transferability. How much does it matter? How much does it play into that? $25 to 35 billion and ultimately how much TE is contemplated anyway in that range, if you will?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, I'll go ahead and take that, Juliae. You know, first of all, you know, when you look at our tax equity, you know, project finance split, things can move around. Let's just hypothetically think about it as kind of, you know, 50/50, you know, I think that might be a decent, you know, starting place to think about. You know, we feel very good about our ability to be able to access, you know, tax equity. You know, we, you know, the regulatory issues, I think that you pointed out, I think are going to get resolved. I think there were some unintended consequences around Basel III, and we have had significant discussions with folks involved on those issues. The administration certainly thinks this was an unintended consequence, as do I think, folks at the Fed.\nThe administration, I think, is very focused on trying to get a good resolution around it. But, you know, I don't worry about it too much at the end of the day for us. I think the Basel III thing gets fixed and, you know, worst case scenario, the banks will find other pockets to be able to issue tax equity. We'll be issued, you know. We'll receive our allocation off the top of the deck like we always do. You know, these relationships that I just spoke about with corporate parties, these 50 folks or so that we've been dealing with, there's no reason they can't step in and provide tax equity financing. We'll be talking to them about those structures as well, and then transferability, which we've already spent some time talking about this morning, can fill any gaps. Long story short, we feel terrific about our ability to source tax equity financing going forward.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it.\nThe transferability is not technically part of the $25 to 35 billion, but obviously it's a fluid conversation if I understand that to use.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nCan you say that again, Julien?\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThe transferability, the credit transfer, really technically not included in that $25 to 35 billion as it stands, but it's a fluid question of how you finance going forward.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, yeah. The tax transferability is not in that number. Again, it shows up in cash flow from operations, and then the equity content that's created really, you know, shows up in that core debt issuance line. Look at the corporate, the cash flow from operations in terms of the dollars that we're receiving for tax credit transfers.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Just quickly, if I can, on the interest rate question here, thank you again for the additional sensitivities and disclosures here. How do you think about sort of a baseline and the open impact as you roll to kind of 2026? I think it's notable for instance, you guys reaffirmed through that period with your usual commentary. How do you think about sort of the puts and takes as you roll into that longer dated 2026 period? Considering the roll off of the hedges here in that, I think, period, more specifically, if you will.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nIs there a way to kind of quantify the interest rate, what kind of headwind?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, yeah. So a couple of points I'll make. One is that you've seen the sensitivity, so zero impact in 2023 or 2024, $0.03 to $0.05 in 2025, in 2026 with the five to 10-year [tenors], you know, with the average coupon 3.375 basis points. You know, we feel very good about the protection, you know, that we have there. You know, we've talked about where FPL sits. Then you know, you think about the project financings, you know, that we, that we entered into. We use those hedges, those, those project financings are basically 20-year amortizing debt that have 20-year hedges that then get rolled into them that have the benefit of those swaps.\nSo when you think about our existing project finance portfolio that we have, there's another $4 billion of interest rate swaps that aren't even in the $20.5 billion that we mentioned to you today that protect and safeguard those as they roll and become. Long story short, between the $20.5 billion that we have against the backlog, the fact that our existing portfolio is already locked in and hedged, we feel very good about our interest rate exposure.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Excellent. All right, guys, thank you very much. I'll pass it there. Have a nice one.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Hey, thank you, Julien.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate the incremental disclosure on the funding plan and the asset sales. Just a follow-up there, are renewables the only element kind of embedded in that $3 billion in proceeds or are there any other non-core assets and energy resources that you'd consider monetizing?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. When I think about it, Carly, renewables come top of mind. We've had a history over the last several years of being able to recycle capital through renewables. Remember too, we're a large company. There are other assets that could potentially be available for capital recycling that are non-core. The FCG transaction that we just recently announced is a good example of that. We'll always look for opportunities. If there are situations where third parties value assets more than we do, then sure, we'll look to be opportunistic, but it's not a core part of the plan.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it.\nOkay, great, that's helpful. Just as you think about the timing cadence of the backlog additions and also the dispersion across the different technologies. I think Rebecca, you alluded to the fact that the Q4 pipeline is shaping up to be kind of more weighted to the 2024 to 2026 timeframe versus this quarter being a little bit longer dated. Can you also just talk about the split across wind, solar, and storage? It seems like there's been a step up in solar relative to wind. Just any thoughts on how you see that piece evolving going forward would be helpful.\n\nRebecca Kujawa\n\nPresident and CEO, NextEra Energy Resources",
    "content2": "Thanks, Carly. It's a great question. Yes, I definitely support that first part of your comment, and it's consistent with what I had said before that I think this quarter was a little bit anomalous in terms of the weighting to 2027, and the pipeline is very much more weighted for what I see today for 2024, 2025, and 2026 with much of it in the 2025 and 2026 timeframe. Just given the fact that we're entering into 2024. In terms of the technology, we had very strong signings for storage.\nAs Kirk highlighted in the prepared remarks, in terms of the, maybe not surprise is probably not the right word, but really pleased to see how we're starting to see adoption across a broader set of markets, not just California, but into the Midwest, where our utility customers and obviously some of the CNI are really valuing the ability to incorporate storage for capacity, value, and firming, and shaping the renewables products. That's really positive in my mind. On the wind side, I think we're still seeing a little bit of dynamics that shaped up as a result of the tax credits that we originally in the industry thought were going to phase down after 2020. We saw a significant amount of a pull forward of demand, and you know, I think that's still affecting the industry a little bit.\nThen obviously the PTC being extended for solar significantly improves the economics from a relative standpoint, which has been super positive for demand. We still see a lot of geographies where wind is incredibly attractive, and so I feel good about long-term demand for wind, and I also feel really good about long-term demand for repowering projects. Obviously we had a great start to the repowering initiative following the IRA extension with over 700 MW. We talked about today; obviously it's scheduled for next year, it's a little bit less than that, but when we look across the entire tens of GW now of renewable projects, there's lots of opportunities to repower as well overall across the board. Really excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's great. I appreciate the color.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSell-side Equity Research, Scotiabank\n\nHey, good morning everyone. First question. Hi. Can you talk a bit about supply chains? I'd be curious your latest thoughts on the availability and status of supply chains both for solar equipment as well as for grid level equipment, like transformers or switch gears.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSure, yeah. Let me take that, Andrew. You know, first of all, with supply chain, things are really improved a lot. As you know, Rebecca just mentioned, you know, we had the two issues right. Circumvention, which has been asked and answered, provided a lot of clarity around what can be done, what can't, and with the Presidential Proclamation so in very good shape there. Second was forced labor and making sure that our suppliers are working constructively with Customs and Border Protection to get their panels cleared for importation into the country. For the most part, all of our solar suppliers have been able to do that. And so we are in very good shape there. I think on grid power, actually the grid level issues that you just mentioned, we're in very good shape on. We had gone long on grid level.\nEquipment, including transformers. We have a significant supply in our inventory. We've also looked forward in a plan for this in terms of trying to make sure that we have equipment available where.\nIf our customers or the transmission owner in the places that we're building renewables are short on equipment, are short on grid level equipment, in particular, that we have it in our inventory and are able to offer that up as a solution. I think one of the big benefits that we have, given our scale and given our leverage and the ability to buy this equipment in very large quantities and really lock up a lot of the manufacturing lines for this equipment. It's a true competitive advantage, you know, for a renewable business, the way I think about it.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSell-side Equity Research, Scotiabank\n\nGreat.\nJust to clarify, NEER is buying this equipment or FPL, like do you keep those separate inventories?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nBoth are.\nBoth are. Because both need it.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSell-side Equity Research, Scotiabank\n\nOkay, great. One quick follow-up, if I may. I'm almost apologizing to bring this up, but the Florida Supreme Court asked the PSC for some details on their approval of the rate case settlement. Can you just share your expectations around timing of the process and maybe potential outcomes?\n\nArmando Pimentel\n\nPresident and CEO, Florida Power & Light\n\nHey, Andrew, it's Armando. You're right that the Supreme Court remanded the settlement agreement back to the Public Service Commission.\nOur view is that the Public Service Commission is going to take that up soon, and will likely be in a position early next year, I would say Q1 of next year, to be able to send that back up to the Supreme Court with the additional details that the Supreme Court is looking forward to receiving. That process would be very similar to the process, both the timeline and the materials, that the Public Service Commission went through with the Duke case that was remanded by the Supreme Court back to the Public Service Commission last year, where the Public Service Commission did not reopen the record. We don't expect our record to be reopened and made sure that they put together a conclusion that would be satisfactory in their view with the Supreme Court and sent it back to the Supreme Court.\nSo we think we're on the same process that Duke case was, and we look forward to having the Public Service Commission resubmit that again Q1 next year.\n\nAndrew Weisel\n\nSell-side Equity Research, Scotiabank\n\nSounds good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect."

To ask a question, you may press star then one in your touch-tone phone. To withdraw from the question queue, please press star then two. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kristen Rose, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKristen Rose\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Anthony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q2 2023 Combined Earnings Conference Call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.\nKirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during the conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on the websites www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com.\nWe do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nKirk Crews\n\nEVP and CFO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, Kristen, and good morning. NextEra Energy continued its track record of solid execution as reflected in our Q2 results. Adjusted earnings per share grew by approximately 8.6% as we deployed capital for the benefit of FPL customers and leveraged our competitive advantages to extend energy resources' renewable leadership position. As the fastest-growing state in the US, Florida has underlying population growth and an economy that continues to drive clear investment needs.\nFor years, FPL's strategy has been simple: keep bills affordable, the grid reliable, and our customer service exceptional. With our most recent settlement agreement, FPL has a well-established capital plan with clear visibility through 2025 to deliver on this strategy. This quarter, we executed our capital plan with new solar and transmission and distribution infrastructure investments, which led to a greater than 12% increase in regulatory capital employed versus the same quarter last year.\nAs a result, FPL's earnings per share increased by $0.07 year-over-year. We progressed these capital initiatives while keeping customer bills affordable. We continue to run the business efficiently, with multiple opportunities to reduce and manage costs. We deploy smart capital that reduces O&M and fuel costs. We embrace innovation and new technologies, and we identify cost savings through our various initiatives. Customers benefit from these actions, including bills that are among the lowest in Florida and well below the national average. FPL is uniquely positioned to extend its best-in-class customer value proposition and deliver long-term growth. Energy Resources' more than two-decade track record of originating, developing, constructing, and operating renewables remains as strong as ever.\nThis quarter, on the strength of new investments, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings by over 14% year-over-year. We continue to see solid renewables and storage demand. Since our Q1 call, Energy Resources placed over 1,800MW into commercial operations and has added approximately 1,665MW of new renewables and storage projects to our backlog, which now stands at roughly 20GW, keeping us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026. Given all of our competitive advantages, Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the decarbonization of the US economy and be the renewables partner of choice supporting power, commercial and industrial, and eventually hydrogen customers.\nWe are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2023. For over 18 months, we have operated in a challenging macroeconomic environment with various headwinds, and yet we have leveraged our competitive advantages to serve customers and deliver on our financial expectations. Through the first half of the year, both businesses have executed well, delivering adjusted EPS growth of approximately 11%. With FPL comprising more than two-thirds of NextEra Energy's business, our well-established capital plan through 2025 provides investors with long-term growth visibility.\nAt Energy Resources, we are leveraging our competitive advantages to continue adding new renewables and storage to our backlog, providing clear visibility to our future earnings growth through 2026. Combined, we believe we are well-positioned with strong visibility to deliver on our expectations and create long-term value for shareholders. With that, let's turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For Q2 2023, FPL reported net income of approximately $1.152 billion, or $0.57 per share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.1% year-over-year.\nWe continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current settlement agreement's four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter, and we now expect FPL's full-year 2023 capital investments to be between $8.5 and 9.5 billion. For the 12 months ending June 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%.\nDuring the quarter, we used approximately $78 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1 billion. Our capital projects continue to progress well. As we indicated in our recent 10-year site plan, solar continues to be the lowest-cost alternative for our customers. FPL placed into service roughly 225MW of cost-effective solar in the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date solar additions to nearly 1,200MW.\nOver the last two years, FPL has commissioned over 1,600MW of new solar generation. With two and a half years remaining under the current settlement agreement, FPL expects to add roughly 3,100MW of incremental solar through 2025. FPL's solar investments allow us to serve strong customer growth while providing clean, affordable generation and avoiding volatile fuel purchases. Over the current four-year settlement agreement, we continue to expect FPL to make capital investments of between $32 to 34 billion. Of that total, we anticipate investing approximately $10 billion in new solar generation and approximately $14 to 16 billion in transmission and distribution infrastructure. We remain confident in our total capital plan through 2025, as our cumulative capital investments of approximately $14 billion through June of 2023 are a little ahead of our original timeline.\nOur capital investment plan is well-established, and by executing on solar deployment and transmission and distribution investments, we are enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry. I'll turn now to the Florida economy, which continues to demonstrate strong growth. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 412,000 new private-sector jobs, and its unemployment rate continues to decline, currently standing at approximately 2.6%, which is nearly 30% below the US average. Florida consumer sentiment improved roughly 14% compared to the prior year and remains above the US average, while mortgage delinquency rates declined by 55 basis points compared to the prior year.\nFlorida's GDP continues to trend upward and increased over 9% versus a year ago. During the quarter, FPL had solid customer growth, with the average number of customers increasing by more than 66,000 from the comparable prior year period. FPL's Q2 retail sales increased by approximately 0.3% year-over-year. We estimate that weather had a slightly negative impact on usage per customer of approximately 0.3% on a year-over-year basis. After taking these factors into account, Q2 retail sales increased roughly 0.6% on a weather-normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued solid underlying population growth.\nNow, let's turn to Energy Resources, where Q2 2023 GAAP earnings were approximately $1.462 billion, or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the Q2 were approximately $781 million, or $0.39 per share, which is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.04 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.10 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.06 per share.\nThis decline was mostly due to a large swing in year-over-year wind resource. This quarter was the lowest Q2 of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.09 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses compared to a relatively weak contribution in the prior year quarter. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments, and half of which is due to higher interest rates.\nThe remaining impact is due to a combination of other factors, including additional costs to support early-stage renewable development investments as we plan for growth in the latter part of the decade. Energy Resources had a solid quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 1,665MW to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 20GW after taking into account over 1,800MW of new projects placed into service since our Q1 call, which keeps us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.\nHaving shared our new expectations just six months ago, we are already within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range and only need roughly 15GW over the next 3.5 years to achieve the midpoint of the 2023 to 2026 development expectations range. As part of our backlog additions, this quarter we signed our first contract for a standalone battery storage project co-located with an existing wind facility. This 65MW storage project is expected to serve our customers' growing capacity needs in the Southwest Power Pool and be available to monetize pricing arbitrage opportunities in this renewable-rich area of the country.\nAs we have highlighted, we believe there are many more opportunities to monetize the value of our existing 29GW operating renewables portfolio, including deploying co-located storage like we did here. We are excited to bring this facility into commercial operation. During the quarter, we continue to see solid demand for renewables and storage across power and commercial and industrial customers. After a period of underlying commodity price inflation, supply chain disruption, and trade policy risk premiums, we are finally seeing signs of stability, which will be helpful in our customer conversations.\nWe believe renewables remain economically attractive to alternative forms of generation and have positioned ourselves to meet long-term customer demand by expanding our significant pipeline of renewable projects. Today, we have a pipeline of roughly 250GWs of renewables and storage projects in various stages of development. This includes projects in early-stage diligence in our current backlog and is supported by roughly 145GWs of interconnection queue positions. When you combine our significant competitive advantages with our renewable pipeline, we believe Energy Resources is well-positioned for growth in our renewables business for years to come.\nWe also remain excited about the opportunity to serve hydrogen customers by leveraging our best-in-class renewables development expertise and early-stage development positions. Throughout the quarter, we continue to advocate for smart hydrogen policy that we believe would help the US establish a robust green hydrogen market and drive increased renewables penetration.\nWe also progressed our pipeline of potential green hydrogen opportunities by executing an additional memorandum of understanding to explore developing green hydrogen and related facilities that would integrate into our customers' operations and serve their energy needs. Hydrogen should be thought of as simply another renewables customer class, and as all our hydrogen-related projects could potentially translate into additional new renewables, and with the appropriate regulations begin to contribute to Energy Resources' growth later this decade.\nTurning now to our consolidated results, for the Q2 of 2023, GAAP earnings attributed to NextEra Energy were approximately $2.795 billion, or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy recorded approximately $1.777 billion of adjusted earnings and $0.88 of adjusted EPS in the Q2. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decreased results by $0.04 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs.\nWe continue to proactively manage interest rates in multiple ways. First, NextEra Energy has $16 billion of various interest rate swaps to help mitigate the impact of future increases in rates. Second, FPL has features in its settlement agreement to offset higher interest rates, such as reserve amortization and the ROE adjustment mechanism, which became effective on 1 September 2022, due to a sustained rise in the 30-year US Treasury yield. Finally, our focus on continuous improvement through our annual Velocity productivity initiative has yielded over $725 million in annual run rate savings ideas over the last two years, creating cost savings opportunities to help offset higher interest costs. As always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations.\nOur long-term financial expectations remain unchanged, and we will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our Adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 to 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our Adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.\nWe continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Now, I'd like to turn to NextEra Energy Partners. Q2 Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $486 million and $200 million, respectively, reflecting weaker wind resource.\nNextEra Energy Partners remains well-positioned to deliver on its 2023 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.854 per common unit, or $3.42 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 12% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit over 355% since the IPO. Since our last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of approximately 690MW of wind and solar assets.\nWith this acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners' renewable portfolio is over 10,000MW, further strengthening its position as the world's seventh-largest producer of electricity from the wind and sun. The partnership is well-positioned to execute on its simplification plans to become a 100% renewables-focused company. Regarding these simplification plans, in May, we launched the sales process for the Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio and are pleased with our progress as we remain on track to sell the assets by later this year. NextEra Energy Partners expects to use the proceeds from the planned Texas pipeline portfolio sale together with a Meade natural gas pipeline sale in 2025 to eliminate the equity buyouts on the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings: STX Midstream, NEP Renewables II, and 2019 NEP Pipeline.\nUpon successful execution of the Texas pipeline portfolio sale, the partnership does not expect to require equity through 2024 other than opportunistic equity issuances under our At the Market program to fund future growth beyond 2024. Now to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered Q2 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $486 million and $200 million, respectively, reflecting the adverse impacts of weaker wind resource. The adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $99 million and $49 million, respectively, primarily driven by a large swing in year-over-year wind resource.\nThis quarter was the lowest Q2 of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest. New projects contributed approximately $49 million of adjusted EBITDA and $5 million of cash available for distribution. Q2 results for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were positively impacted by the incentive distribution rights fee suspension, and provided approximately $38 million of benefit this quarter, partially offsetting the impact of poor wind resource performance.\nAs we previously shared, we expect strong double-digit growth in the second half of the year in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners' LP distribution per unit growth expectations range for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. From a base of our Q4 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. However, as we previously shared with you, we expect to grow at or near the bottom end of that range.\nFor 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the Q4 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA, and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at 31 December 2023, to be in the ranges of $2.2 to $2.42 billion and $770 to $860 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.\nIn summary, we believe that NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned to continue delivering long-term value for shareholders and unit holders. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers, providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we're executing on our well-established capital investment plan, which allows us to extend our customer value proposition.\nFlorida's strong population growth drives smart capital investment, and running the business efficiently allows us to manage costs for the benefit of both customers and shareholders. FPL comprises more than two-thirds of NextEra Energy's business and provides a significant amount of visibility into capital deployment and earnings growth. At Energy Resources, we're leveraging our more than 20 years of experience and competitive advantages to grow our market share and add to our now roughly 20GW backlog, providing terrific growth visibility through 2026. We believe these competitive advantages will enable Energy Resources to serve power, commercial and industrial, and eventually hydrogen customers.\nWith an opportunity set of $20 billion of capital investment requiring more than 15GWs of new renewables, Energy Resources is well-positioned to be the green hydrogen partner of choice, potentially creating new opportunities toward the end of the decade. At NextEra Energy Partners, we're executing on our plans to sell our natural gas pipelines and simplify the business. We continue to add to our renewables and storage portfolio, which now stands at over 10,000MW. With the sale of the Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio expected to be completed by the end of the year, NextEra Energy Partners remains on track to transition to a 100% pure-play renewables company while continuing to deliver LP distribution per unit growth for unit holders.\nWith that, we're happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw from the question queue, please press star then two. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question will come from Steve Fleischmann with Wolfe Research. You may now go ahead.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning. Thanks. Hope you're all well. So a couple first, just on the quarter, the customer supply trading business continues to do well, and you mentioned higher margins. I think Constellation's been talking about that too. Could you just talk more about what you think is driving that in the supply business?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, sure. Steve, this is John Ketchum, and good morning to you as well. In the customer supply and trading business, we've just seen a lot less competition, number one. And number two, remember, most of the business activity that we do in that group is customer-facing business, our full requirements business, for example, where we're working with municipalities and cooperatives to help provide their power needs and arrange the capacity, ancillaries, and other regulatory requirements they need to manage their business, particularly up in the Northeast.\nThat business, because it's had a lot less competition, has benefited from significant margins. And one of the points I want to make is these arrangements that we enter into in the full requirements business are typically two or three years, and we're immediately going out back-to-back hedging those positions. So feel great about the risk profile and, again, terrific margins that really match up well with our skill sets, our competitive advantages, and our core operations. So that's really the main driver.\nI also want to remind folks that when you think about our customer and supply business, we run it at a very, very low bar. For example, the last quarter, we ran that business roughly at a 2% bar. So it's very, very small business, risk exposure overall for NEE.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Next question just on.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nSteve, one other point I want to make too on the customer supply business is that that business, historically, you can go back 10 years, and the customer supply and trading business, including this year, has never contributed more than 10% of NextEra Energy's net income. I think that's important to keep in mind as well. We have a lot of complementary businesses. Obviously, FPL has done well. We have other complementary businesses at Energy Resources on top of our renewable business. But that business has always stayed under 10%, and that's one of the commitments that we make to the rating agencies. And that's true this year as well.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Maybe just the latest you're hearing on the green hydrogen rules from Treasury, both kind of timing and any color on where they are on some of the key issues like matching and additionality. Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. We have been very vocal around the hydrogen regulations that need to come together. And there's been a debate, for those that aren't familiar with it, between whether we have hourly matching or annual matching. And for us, it's very simple. As part of a hydrogen project, you buy an expensive asset called an electrolyzer, which everyone is familiar with. And if you have hourly matching, the net capacity factor, the number of hours a day that you use that electrolyzer are probably less than half a day in most parts of the country. If you have an annual construct, we're able to use that electrolyzer around the clock.\nAnd so it's really easy math. I mean, when you have an expensive capital asset and you can use it around the clock, the price of green hydrogen is going to be a lot lower if you can only use it less than half the time. And so the industry has come forward with a very constructive proposal, which would have the hourly matching construct not kick in until 2028. You'd have annual until that time period. And we also have supported the fact that you have to have additionality if you're going to qualify for annual.\nSo if you're qualifying for annual in the hours that the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, the power, the electrolyzer behind the meter, and you are buying off the grid, well, you're buying from an additional renewable asset that has been constructed and developed to provide electrons to that newly built hydrogen facility. So from an NGO perspective, you're getting additional decarbonization benefits on the grid. So we think we've been very constructive in what we have come forward with.\nWe think it's really important because we want to send the right price signal to OEMs to ramp up production on electrolyzers because electrolyzers being produced at scale is going to be critically important to declines in green hydrogen prices over time. And so that's where we are in terms of your question around timing. We expect Treasury to probably come out with regulations now.\nWe're hoping for August, but it's starting to sound more like September or October. But again, we have built a significant hydrogen pipeline. Parts of it work under either construct, and that pipeline is well over $20 billion. And we have the land team out, and we've had them out very aggressively lining up land positions for our hydrogen portfolio. That the nice thing about that, and Kirk said it in the remarks, that pipeline's about 250GWs when you include early due diligence sites. Nobody in our industry has a pipeline like that. Nobody. And what's terrific about it is it can be used for dual purpose because hydrogen customers are just a third customer class to sell renewables to. So if the site doesn't work for hydrogen, it will work for our power C&I customers.\nSo I feel like we're really well positioned, and hydrogen is one of those things that can really provide a nice boom to the development expectations that we've already laid out for you. So we're eager to see what the final regulations say. But I also want to remind folks that hydrogen has a long development cycle, so the contribution that we'll see from hydrogen investments, you would expect over the latter part of the decade.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Last question just on the Texas sale. So I think you said you still expect to get it done by year-end. When would you need to or expect to or need to kind of announce transaction to make the year-end? And just how should we think about the recent data points we've seen, like the TransCanada, the TC sell-down, Columbia sell-down, and Cove Point? I know they're different assets, but just in the context of views on valuation of NET. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Thank you, Steve. So let me take those in order. So in terms of timing, we would hope to be in a position end of Q3, early Q4 in order to support that end-of-the-year sales timeline that we have earmarked. In terms of valuation, we view these assets as unique. Again, as a reminder, the Texas pipelines provide 25% of the natural gas supply to Mexico through contracts with Pemex. And the other pipeline assets that support the Texas pipeline are fully integrated with that pipe. And they provide gas to Mexico through Agua Dulce, which is a very liquid trading point. And if you look around that area, these are very, very strategic for a number of players.\nSo again, as you all know, it's hard to compare one pipe comp to another. But again, we remain pleased with the progress that we continue to make on the sales transaction.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Steve. Oh, and Steve, I think I said 2% on the VAR. I meant 2 million on the VAR for PMI, just to correct that.\n\nSteve Fleishman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may now go ahead.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director for Energy/Power/Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nMorning, Shar.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director for Energy/Power/Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGood morning. Let me just, as we kind of look at the latest renewable portfolio transactions, the valuations have come in fairly noticeably. Do you guys see any opportunities to kind of leverage NextEra's platform and either picking up existing assets or developer books, especially sort of given what seems to still be a tight financing and supply chain position for some of your competitors while you're seeing improvements with yours, right?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah, we are. I mean, first of all, let me just comment on the valuations that you see. I mean, I think that, look, I'm not going to be critical of some of the assets that have come to sale. But if you read between the lines and into the details of the structures of those transactions, those are not what I would characterize as high-quality renewable assets. When you look back at what we have developed over the last 20 years and what we continue to develop are very high-quality renewable assets. Most of them are busbar.\nThey're with high-credit counterparty off-takers. They're well-situated in areas that benefit from our data analytics around transmission congestion, wind resource, solar resource. Because we have 20 years of experience, I like to believe, and look, we're not perfect, but we don't make some of the same mistakes that you see some of the other developers make. So I feel like we're much better positioned. Our portfolio is in much better position than some of the other players that you have seen.\nSo I'd be very, very careful in how you assess portfolio to portfolio because they're very, very different. The second thing I would say is we look at all third-party M&A opportunities that come available, and we feel like we do have all the competitive advantages, some of which you mentioned. We buy cheap, we build cheap, we operate cheap, we have a cost-to-capital advantage. We have a terrific team that really understands how to optimize the value of existing assets. That's the key piece. Repowering assets is something we've always had a very strong track record at. It's something that the rest of the industry has struggled with, and that gives us a real leg up in terms of being able to see value that others don't.\nAnd then, as Kirk mentioned on the call today, we have a benefit and an organic asset that nobody else has, which is the largest fleet in North America that we operate. And so we have the ability not only to repower those existing assets but to find ways to pair them up with storage and take advantage of the standalone storage ITC. As you all know, storage used to only be a unique opportunity to pair with solar. The rules have changed with the standalone storage ITC under IRA. So now we can pair it with wind. We can build it standalone. We're making a lot of progress in that area.\nWe announced one project today where we're starting to see an opportunity, particularly in MISO, SPP, and ERCOT, where capacity values and reliability are being priced higher than we've seen them in the past, given some of the shortfalls that they have in those markets. And that just happens to coincide with where most of our wind is. And given the massive existing fleet that we have, which very importantly includes an existing interconnection agreement, our ability to go and pair those assets up with solar or to repower them is unique in this industry, given the two-decade head start that we have. So that's a value that we try to bring to M&A opportunities as well when we exercise our other competitive advantages, including our cost-to-capital advantage.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director for Energy/Power/Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGot it. Perfect. Then, John, it's been a little bit quiet and hasn't really been a focus for a lot of investors. But is there any sort of updates around the FEC case as of today? Any change in stances indicated by the disclosures and the opportunities to settle? Thanks.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Thank you, Shar, for the question. No new developments. There's really no new news there. Again, we would expect, just based on historical precedent with the FEC, that we would hear back whether they have a reasonable belief that they should investigate probably sometime in Q1 2024.\n\nShar Pourreza\n\nSenior Managing Director for Energy/Power/Utilities, Guggenheim Partners\n\nPerfect. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks for the time. Fantastic. Appreciate it.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThank you, Shar.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, John. Good morning, team. Thank you, guys, very much. So I wanted to come back to the cadence of the backlog conditions and just looking at 2023, 2024 versus 2025, 2026 there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there in terms of the ability to execute in kind of the nearer-term sense to execute against that first bucket versus the latter here? And especially give us a little bit of an update on IRS clarity and what that means for the willingness to commit to close on contracts here, especially maybe now that you have that in hand on transferability, etc. How do you think about maybe biasing towards the later years there, just given where we stand already?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. Good question, Julien. So let me just start with take that in chunks because everyone knows our development expectations are 2023 to 2026. So let's just start with the first two years, and then we'll talk about the second two years. So for 2023 through 2024, we're in great shape. We're already within the range as we had expected to be. And then on 2025 and 2026, if you go back to the beginning of 2022 and you add up where we are today, we've already added 12GW just in the last six quarters. That puts us in great shape against 2025 and 2026 because now we have 15GW to get to the midpoint.\nAnd if you kind of work backwards from 2026, that's three and a half years to get 15GW. So we feel like we are really in great position and on track on that build. I think there's some real tailwinds that we're going to start to see come forward. I want to explain some dynamics just around what we've seen in the renewable industry, which was part of your question, Julien. Let's just go back to 2022. I mean, in 2022, we saw a lot of supply chain issues that started to surface. Then we saw UFLPA. We saw a circumvention.\nThat caused some delays. It also caused a shortage of supply because some developers were scrambling for panels that they thought they could get into the country, which I think for a short period of time drove prices up. The great thing is all those 2022 projects that got delayed in the 2023 are now starting to go into commercial operation. That's really good news for customers because those customers that were digesting that 2022 build and waiting for those projects to go COD in the 2023 are now coming back to the market. And so we're seeing really strong demand from those folks as we start to look forward.\nThe other benefit of that is, as you see UFLPA issues start to get worked through, we're not seeing the UFLPA holdbacks that we used to see. So we're making a lot of progress on that front. When you take that into account with the clarity that we're now seeing around circumvention, we finally have this bright line rule with the six-part test. And as long as you meet four of the six and you're importing from Southeast Asia, you're okay. And so what we've seen is a relaxation in pricing as a result of that.\nSo now the risk premium that was being charged last year by the import market is starting to come down. The other terrific phenomenon that we're seeing around solar pricing is that Southeast Asia still sets the price for panels in the US, but that risk price premium is starting to come down. And Southeast Asia really wants a big part of the US market. Why do they want a big part of the US market? They sell panels for $0.20 everywhere else, right? They've been selling panels for $0.40 roughly in the US. So they have a lot of room to move. And so as that risk premium comes down around UFLPA and circumvention, it's forcing prices down in the US.\nAt the same time, you're seeing a lot more US supply come online through new module facilities that are getting announced, also through cell facilities that will come along with it. And so the bottom line is, when you look at the solar picture, it's favorable from an equipment price standpoint because I think you're starting to see a lot of capacity come online that is going to force prices down over time, particularly as you see the US market evolve. And it's no secret with some of the economic data coming out of China that some of those Southeast Asian markets are under pressure with excess capacity positions. And so they've got batteries and panels they need to find things to do with. Battery prices are coming down as well.\nWe've finally seen a relaxation in battery prices, really struggling in the EV market in China, which has created very much an excess capacity around batteries. And so we're finally starting to see some relaxation there. I think there's been more of a movement around traditional lithium-ion and some of the rare mineral exposure you see there, sodium, and other battery forms. And so very encouraged about the landscape there. And then on the wind OEM side, the wind folks are really one of the only ones that can reap the full benefit of domestic content and the full manufacturer incentive. So feel really good about where wind sits as well.\nSo I think as you start to look forward, and we've started to move through these supply chain issues we saw in 2022 with these projects coming online in 2023, combined with excess capacity globally around the supply chain, feel great there. And let me talk about transferability for a second. There's been a lot of discussion, and I've heard a lot of questions about folks saying, \"Well, how's transferability going to be accounted for, and is it going to be part of the FFO and the FFO to debt metric?\" We feel very good, and we've told investors for a long time that we feel very good that it's in accordance with GAAP. It flows through the tax line for tax credits that get transferred to be included.\nAnd so we feel good about where that is heading, and that we'll end up in a good place there on that FFO to debt question that has surfaced around transferability. So when you put all those pieces together, as we've worked through some of these headwinds that we've had, feel very good about where things are heading. And let's just face it, we're just getting started. Renewables are here to stay. They're not going anywhere. And so while we might the development process isn't always going to be a straight line, we're in terrific shape and feel very optimistic about the future.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nRight. Thank you. And actually, John, to that point, though, a lot of the dynamics you just talked about are very real-time, if you will, versus kind of trailing into the quarter itself. How do you feel about just that contracting acceleration here in the back half? I mean, a lot of the points you made would really argue that you could see an uptick versus kind of something that was more on trend in the last quarter.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. A lot of it is going to depend on, as I said before, these 2022 projects continuing to come online in 2023 and those customers that had a little bit of fatigue, so to speak, around those delays coming back to market, which we're starting to see. And so that'll be the wild card. But we feel good about how the rest of the year continues to shape up.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Well, stay tuned on that front. All right. Excellent. Thank you, sir.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nAnd Julien, one other thing to add to that is Hydrogen. We get the right rules there. And again, I can't stress it enough. I mean, we've always only had two customer classes for renewables. It's been power sector. It's been the C&I sector. Now, with the right rules, we have the potential to add a third customer class, which is renewables for hydrogen customers. And that's exciting as well.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYep. Yeah. So stay tuned maybe a quarter or two after you get those rules to really see that flow through in that third customer class.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. I think that's right. And then remember, those projects have longer lead time development cycles. So in terms of the contribution that investors should expect, it's going to come in the latter part of the decade.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOh, hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe shifting a little bit to NEP, I was wondering. I know you don't in terms of the financing outlook, you don't need equity for some time here, but I was wondering if you could just give any latest thoughts on alternative financing approaches to hit longer-term growth projections at NEP?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. I mean, for NEP, first of all, the focus is on the simplification strategy, which we shared with the market back in May. And we have said that our expectation as a result of that is we don't assume a successful execution on that sale, that we don't expect to have equity requirements in 2024 other than opportunistic equity issuances under our ATM to help finance growth beyond 2024.\nBut if you look, and you can see in the slides here that we have a lot of flexibility under our current metrics with the agencies in terms of the ability to add additional, what I would call traditional debt-based capital market financing mechanisms to accommodate the growth going forward. And we are very busy looking at the back end three separates that we have and some ideas around how we are going to address those as well because when we move on from the simplification transaction, that's going to be the next point of focus. But we're not waiting. We're continuing to look at that.\nAnd look, there continues to be a strong bid for an interest in renewable assets long-term, particularly when you think about the opportunity to do that with the world's leader in renewable development with the competitive advantages that we have, the 20GW backlog, the growth visibility that NEP has going forward, all very promising. And so we continue to engage in those discussions as well as we think about the future.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Got it. Thanks for that color. Then also just had a question related to the transmission constraints that we've seen in the industry, but you made the comment about a very large interconnection position, 145GWs. I was just wondering if you could speak to the transmission queue challenges, and do you think that could potentially be a constraint on growth for the industry at any point, or how much visibility do you have into hitting longer-term growth targets with that massive queue that you've got in place?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYeah. So let me take that in two pieces. I mean, one is the 145GW that you're referencing, David, around the 250GW pipeline that we have, where we have the 145 interconnection positions secured. I would challenge you to find anybody in the industry that has even close to that number of projects with interconnection capacity. And don't forget, given the demand we're seeing in the market, if you have a site ready to go with interconnection capacity, that's the hard part. Finding the customer right now is not the hard part.\nAnd so that's why we have such a focus on making sure that an early-stage development program is right on track. And I feel just terrific about where we stand there today. Let me take the second piece, though, that you have, which is just about transmission in general. We are not waiting. We are taking the transmission and interconnect issues into our own hands. And we're doing that through NextEra Energy Transmission. We are laser-focused on competitive transmission build-out around where our renewable assets are going and where they are going to be built. We announced a project last quarter, another $400 million opportunity in CAISO. I'm not going to talk about them today, but we have a number of various other transmission projects on the board right now that we are evaluating. That business is going terrific.\nAnd again, the bottom line message for investors is we're not waiting. We're taking the game we're taking that into our own hands. That's why we bought GridLiance. That's why we continue to make investments in that space. And we intend to solve those problems ourselves as we go along.\n\nDavid Arcaro\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nExcellent. That's helpful. Thanks so much for all the color.\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nThanks, David.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP for Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to go back to the supply chain, and thanks for the commentary there in the earlier question. But just in terms of rate of change from a supply chain perspective relative to recent quarters, are you seeing any divergence between trends in wind projects versus solar projects?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy",
    "content2": "Yeah. I mean, in terms of wind projects, let me just make a couple of comments there. I mean, we do almost all of our businesses with GE. We've done a little bit with Siemens, and I know there's been some press on Siemens recently. We don't have any of the Siemens Gamesa turbines in our fleet. I just want to make that very clear. As we think about supply chain around wind versus solar, remember that wind turbines are made almost exclusively in the US. And so they'll be direct beneficiaries of the manufacturing incentives, and we hope domestic content.\nThey have a couple of paperwork things they have to work out with Treasury, which hopefully we'll get there on in terms of what kind of information they have to share with their ultimate customers, and giving away the secret sauce on margins and all those things. But they continue to work through those issues. But wind just doesn't have the same exposure and issues that we've had to deal with with solar or around EUFLIPA, around circumvention.\nBut again, as I said earlier, those issues around solar, which really plagued the industry back in 2022, have been things that we've been working through in 2023. And now we're starting to see a lot more capacity show up not only in the US but in other markets as well. And so we are capitalizing on all those opportunities and leveraging our buying power as you would expect us to do.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP for Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just a quick one on kind of the cost environment. Seems like it's starting to improve a bit, but still challenging for many. Can you just talk about how you're managing costs in this environment and kind of what levers exist that are available to pull if needed to continue to execute at a high level from an earnings perspective?\n\nJohn Ketchum\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, NextEra Energy\n\nYes. Thanks, Carly. So we spoke on our last call about, and I know you're familiar with this, we run a cost savings initiative every year at the company. This year, we called it Velocity. We ran it under the same name last year. And we challenge every one of our business units. It's a bottoms-up process to come up with cost savings ideas for how we run our company. And we've had amazing success through that program over the last 10 years, and the last two years. In fact, if you look at it, we've been able to identify over $700 million of cost savings initiatives both at FPL and energy resources.\nSo we're constantly looking for ways to continue to take cost out of the business, whether it's O&M, whether it's G&A, and how do we leverage technology. Technology is a big piece of it as well. We recently launched a massive generative AI program that we think, also leveraging all the skills that we have around technology that we've been able to build over the last 10 to 15 years, to really leverage AI in a way we never have in terms of how we run the business as well. And so all those things, I think, are going to contribute to cost declines over time for the business. But we're laser-focused on cost. And then the development business, when you're selling a commodity electricity, it's a game of inches.\nYou got to be better than the next developer in line in terms of buying equipment cheaper, building it cheaper, operating it cheaper, financing it cheaper. And we have, with the A-minus balance sheet, a terrific cost of capital advantage. And when we put all those things together, we feel great about our competitive position, our market share, and how we continue to progress through our renewable development program.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nVP for Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks for that color.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question. Pardon me. This concludes our question and answer session. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.\nWith me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners. As well as Armando Pimentel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.\nKirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nActual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. If any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of which can be found on our websites, www.nexteraenergy.com and www.nexteraenergypartners.com.\nWe do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nTerrell Kirk Crews\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, NextEra Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a strong start in 2023. Adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 13.5% year-over-year, building on the success of last year's strong execution and financial performance.\nDuring the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked #1 in our sector on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies for the 16th time in 17 years. We are extremely proud of the team and culture we have built that has enabled us to deliver low-cost, clean and reliable power to our customers while also providing long-term value to our shareholders.\nFPL is the largest electric utility in the U.S. and Florida is now officially the fastest-growing state in America. At FPL, our focus remains the same, deploying smart capital to deliver on what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in our industry.\nKey to that strategy is keeping customer bills affordable. And this quarter, we proposed using projected 2023 fuel savings to reduce unbilled fuel costs from 2022 to provide bill relief to customers.\nTo further manage fuel price volatility, we are also helping customers by adding more solar to the FPL grid. This quarter, we placed into service approximately 970 megawatts of new low-cost solar. Putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at nearly 4,600 megawatts, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country.\nWe believe solar is now the lowest cost generation option for Florida customers, but represents only about 5% of FPL's delivered energy. In order to extend the benefits of low-cost solar to customers, FPL's recently filed 10-year site plan now includes nearly 20,000 megawatts of new solar.\nEnergy Resources, the world's leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage remains laser-focused on executing a strategy of decarbonizing the power sector and helping commercial and industrial customers outside the power sector reduce their energy cost and decarbonize their operations by moving to low-cost renewables and other clean energy solutions.\nThis quarter, Energy Resources added approximately 2,020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. Energy Resources also closed on its previously announced acquisition of a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities, providing the foundation for our growing RNG business.\nWe are also excited to announce a new memorandum of understanding with CF Industries to create green hydrogen, establishing what we expect will be a long-term relationship with the world's largest ammonium producer. And finally, Energy Resources continues to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business to help support growth in renewables.\nWe are pleased to announce that the California ISO recently recommended for approval approximately $400 million in new transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission.\nWe believe NextEra Energy continues to be anchored by 2 great businesses that leverage each other's expertise to make them even better. We do not believe anyone in our industry has our set of skills, scale and breadth of opportunities. We believe NextEra Energy is able to buy, build, operate and finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector.\nWe also believe our best-in-class development skills, and unparalleled data set enable us to provide innovative technology and low-cost clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.\nThe opportunities and products demanded by the market are becoming more complex, requiring significant scale and a combination of skills that we believe few of our competitors can offer, further enhancing our competitive advantages and creating even more growth opportunities for our business going forward.\nWe have a culture rooted and continuous improvement, always striving to be better. Along those lines, we just completed our annual employee-led productivity initiative, which we now call Velocity.\nFor over 11 years, our employees have generated approximately $2.6 billion in annual run rate savings ideas as part of this process. In 2023 alone, our team generated ideas expected to produce roughly $325 million in annual run rate savings, which when combined with last year's results of over $400 million, is the most productive 2-year period in this program's history, and that's after doing it for over a decade.\nWe believe we have the best team in the industry, and these results are indicative of the breadth and depth of capabilities and the commitment to excellence that our team brings to our business every day and executing on behalf of our customers and shareholders. With that, let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL.\nFor the first quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of $1.07 billion or $0.53 per share, an increase of $0.09 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.2% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter.\nFPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter. We expect our full year 2023 capital investments at FPL to be between $8.0 billion and $9.0 billion as we continue to invest capital smartly for the continued benefit of our customers.\nFPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ending March 2023. During the quarter, we utilized $373 million of reserve amortization to achieve our targeted regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $1.07 billion. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year.\nEarlier this year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs from 2022, partially offset by projected 2023 fuel savings of approximately $1.4 billion.\nAmid high natural gas prices in 2022, FPL's decades-long modernization of its generation fleet has saved customers more than $2 billion in fuel costs in 2022 alone. The commission also recently approved recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of hurricane costs from 2022 over a 12-month period.\nTaking all approved adjustments together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills will remain well below the projected national average and among the lowest of all Florida utilities.\nTurning to our development planning and efforts. FPL recently filed its annual 10-year site plan that presents our generation resource plan for the next decade.\nThe 2023 plan includes roughly 20,000 megawatts of new low-cost solar capacity across our service territory over the next 10 years which would result in nearly 35% of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2032 coming from cost-effective solar generation, up significantly from roughly 5% in 2022.\nGiven the increasing customer benefits of low-cost renewables, FPL's post-2025 solar capacity additions and this year's plan are more than double last year's approved plan and also includes 2 gigawatts of battery storage over the next decade.\nWe believe the expansion of cost-effective solar and storage will provide a valuable hedge for our customers against volatile natural gas prices and meet the electricity demand of FPL's growing customer base with a low-cost generation source.\nFinally, construction of our green hydrogen pilot at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center is on track and projected to go into service later this year.\nTurning now to the Florida economy. Florida became the fastest-growing state in the nation in 2022 and its population continues to increase with over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day.\nOver the last 5 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 7% compound annual growth rate and is now approximately $1.4 trillion, which is up approximately 8% versus a year ago. Based on GDP, if Florida was a country, it would have the 14th largest economy in the world.\nFPL's first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% from the prior year comparable period, driven by continued solid underlying population growth with FPL's average number of customers increasing by approximately 65,000 even after removing roughly 15,000 inactive customers due to Hurricane Ian.\nFor the first quarter, we estimate that the positive impact of warmer weather was more than offset by a decline in underlying usage for our customers.\nAs we have often pointed out, underlying usage can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, particularly during periods when temperatures deviate significantly from normal as we experienced this winter with average temperatures greater than 4 degrees above normal. Our long-term expectations of underlying usage growth continues to average between 0 and approximately negative 0.5% per year.\nEnergy Resources report first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of approximately $1.440 billion or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $732 million or $0.36 per share, up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period.\nContributions from new investments increased $0.07 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing Clean Energy portfolio were lower by $0.03 per share, primarily due to less favorable wind and solar resource compared to the prior year.\nThe contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.06 per share, primarily due to higher margin in our customer-facing business and compared to a relatively weaker contribution in the prior year comparable quarter.\nGas infrastructure and all other impacts reduced earnings by $0.01 and $0.05 per share, respectively, versus 2022. Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination capitalizing on strong renewables demand environment.\nSince the last call, we added approximately 2,020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to our backlog, including roughly 1,370 megawatts of solar, 450 megawatts of storage and 200 megawatts of wind.\nWith these additions, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at over 20.4 gigawatts, net of projects placed in service and provides strong visibility into our future growth.\nWith more than 1.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we are now within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range. Given the volatility in gas and power prices over the last 1.5 years, we continue to see economics driving long-term decision-making and renewables remain the clear low-cost option for many customers.\nOn the supply -- solar supply chain front, we continue to take constructive steps to mitigate potential future disruption. Nearly every one of our suppliers has repositioned their supply chains to manufacture solar panels in Southeast Asia using [ wafers ] and cells produced outside of China and all our suppliers are expected to meet the criteria established in the Commerce Department's preliminary determination in the 2022 circumvention case by the end of 2023.\nAdditionally, we are focused on further diversifying our supply chain and are currently advancing discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Finally, we are encouraged by the improvement in the flow of panels into the U.S. as suppliers continue to provide the requested traceability documentation to U.S. customs and border protection.\nAlso, during the quarter, we closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities that I mentioned earlier.\nThe approximately $1.1 billion transaction represents an attractive opportunity for energy resources to realize double-digit returns on this investment while expanding its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and growing its in-house capabilities and rapidly expanding renewable fuel market.\nTurning to green hydrogen. We are excited about the role it is expected to play as a solution to help our customers cost effectively lower emissions.\nAs the world leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, we believe we are the logical partner for green hydrogen with significant interconnection and land inventory positions and deep market expertise to help our potential partners optimize some of the best green hydrogen sites around the country.\nAs a result, with the right regulations, we see hydrogen quickly becoming a significant technology for our customers and a new growth driver for energy resources given the number and size of the opportunities we are evaluating.\nEarlier this month, NextEra Energy joined a coalition of 45 other companies with a combined approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization and sending a letter to the Secretaries of Energy & Treasury and the White House advocating for programmatic policies for the implementation of the IRAs green hydrogen production tax credit.\nThis coalition is advocating for prudent policy that will foster investment in green hydrogen technology, paving the way for the U.S. to become the world leader in hydrogen technology.\nA key aspect of this policy is for the electricity consumed for green hydrogen production to be matched to its renewable power generation on an annual rather than an hourly basis.\nWe believe that an annual [ matching ] construct has several benefits over hourly including lower green hydrogen prices, more renewables being built, a significant reduction in carbon emissions and green hydrogen achieving cost parity with gray and blue hydrogen, both of which rely on fossil fuels for their production.\nThis viewpoint is supported by numerous third-party studies from respected entities such as Wood Mackenzie, Rhodium Group, Energy Futures Initiative, Energy and Environmental Economics and MIT Energy Institute.\nAs we continue to work with the industry and government representatives to progress a smart hydrogen policy, we are also advancing our green hydrogen development efforts including a recently executed memorandum of understanding for a joint venture with CF Industries, the world's largest producer of ammonia, to develop -- to deliver green hydrogen to an existing CF Industries ammonia production facility, which it intends to expand and incorporate green hydrogen into its production process.\nThe proposed facility includes an approximately 450-megawatt renewable energy solution, powering a 40 tons per day hydrogen facility. This project, combined with other opportunities we are pursuing represent significant momentum for green hydrogen, which we believe will continue to be a driver of new renewables growth going forward.\nOur team continues to engage with multiple potential partners and customers on hydrogen projects, representing over $20 billion of capital investments and requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables to support.\nAs we focus on leading the decarbonization of the U.S. economy, building additional transmission is essential to support long-term renewables deployment. We believe our ability to build, own and operate transmission as a key competitive advantage for our renewables business in addition to being a terrific investment opportunity.\nWe are pleased that the California ISO recently recommended for approval of approximately $400 million in transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission, subject to approval, by the CAISO Board of Governors in May.\nWe believe these projects, along with others, could unlock up to 11 gigawatts of new renewable generation that could be built to support California's ambitious clean energy goals.\nTurning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2023, GAAP earnings attributable to NextEra Energy were $2.086 billion or $1.04 per share.\nNextEra Energy's 2023 1st quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.678 billion and $0.84 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings for the Corporate and Other segment decreased results by $0.03 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest rates.\nIn March, S&P affirmed all its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operations or FFO to debt metric from the previous level of 20% to the current level of 18%.\nIn making this favorable adjustment, S&P acknowledged improvement in Energy Resources business risk following the passage of the IRA particularly noting the improved visibility and clarity into long-term cash flows.\nAt the same time, S&P adjusted its treatment of nonrecourse project debt associated with FERC regulated investments to bring it back on credit.\nWe believe this overall favorable adjustment, which creates roughly 50 bps of additional headroom against the downgrade threshold, highlights the attractive risk profile of renewables and acknowledges the long-term stable cash flows and Energy Resources business particularly given the benefits of the IRA.\nFinally, as we have discussed in the past, we actively enter into various interest rate swaps products to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuance.\nToday, we have $21 billion of interest rate swaps at NextEra Energy to help mitigate the impact of potential future increases in rates, which exceeds the notional value of our 2023 and 2024 maturities.\nAnd as always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. Our long-term financial expectations, which we extended earlier this year through 2026 remain unchanged.\nAnd we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 to 2026, while at the same time, maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.\nFrom 2021 to 2026, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.\nWe also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.\nTurning to NextEra Energy Partners. We believe we have never had more visible growth opportunities than we have today. We have the ability to grow in 3 ways: acquiring assets from Energy Resources, growing organically and buying assets from other third parties.\nWith significant tailwinds from the IRA, Energy Resources' operating portfolio, combined with its backlog of projects and development expectations through 2026 total approximately 58 gigawatts, providing terrific visibility for NextEra Energy Partners, and Energy Resources is continuing to grow in innovative ways, adding new technologies and clean energy assets to its portfolio such as RNG and hydrogen.\nIn addition to acquiring assets from Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners also has the ability to repower its existing assets with approximately 1,300 megawatts of potential wind repowerings already identified and many more opportunities expected to come as well as potential to locate storage at its existing renewable assets given the new stand-alone storage ITC.\nFinally, there are significant acquisition opportunities with renewable portfolios continuously being brought to market. NextEra Energy Partners also has numerous ways it can finance its growth, and we believe it can do so efficiently, given its ample liquidity and access to capital.\nAt the end of the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners had $2.8 billion of liquidity and approximately $6 billion of interest rate swaps to manage future interest rate volatility on debt maturities through 2026.\nWith regard to convertible equity portfolio financings, we can fund equity buyouts by delivering common units, or utilizing our at-the-market or ATM program or a combination of both, and we believe we have ample liquidity to fund cash payments.\nImportantly, we have flexibility and we expect to leverage this flexibility to manage future buyouts to select the most efficient option.\nUsing this flexibility, NextEra Energy Partners has now bought out 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing through funds generated from a combination of the ATM program where NextEra Energy Partners was able to be opportunistic and cash from a subsidiary's revolving credit facility.\nWith the buyouts of the 2018 convertible equity portfolio financing and 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing complete, we estimate that the convertible equity portfolio financing structure has resulted in approximately 55% and 64%, respectively, or 16 million fewer units being issued compared to raising capital with underwritten block equity, all for the benefit of unitholders.\nFor the balance of the year, files are now expected to be limited to the remaining 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing and 15% of the net renewables to convertible equity portfolio financing with the equity portion of these buyouts requiring common units of approximately $280 million and $130 million, respectively.\nOver the next 8 months, we have flexibility and time to opportunistically manage these buyouts in the most efficient way. For each buyout, we have the flexibility to deliver common units to the convertible equity portfolio financing investor, utilize the ATM program or some combination of the 2. Ultimately, we will select the most efficient option.\nIn any event, the potential unit issuance from these buyouts are not expected to exceed an average of 3 days of total trading volume per quarter, which we expect will make them quite manageable.\nMost importantly, NextEra Energy Partners' growth expectations through 2026 already factor in its financing plan, including convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts at current trading yields.\nTurning to distribution growth. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of 84.25 cents per common unit or $3.37 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit, up nearly 350% since the IPO.\nToday, we are pleased to announce that NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 690-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind and solar projects and attractive cash available for distribution yield.\nThe high-quality portfolio has a cash available for distribution -- weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 16 years, an average customer credit rating of BBB at S&P and Baa2 at Moody's Investors Service.\nNextEra Energy Partners is expected to acquire the portfolio for approximately $708 million subject to closing adjustments and is inclusive of the portfolio's existing project debt and interest rate swaps which are estimated to be approximately $142 million.\nIn addition to the approximately $708 million purchase price, NextEra Energy Partners is also expected to assume the portfolio's existing tax equity financing balance. The remaining purchase price is expected to be funded by a combination of new project finance debt and the corporate revolving credit facility.\nThe portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million to $130 million and cash available for distribution prior to the existing project debt service of approximately $62 million to $72 million, each on a 5-year average annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2023.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEnergy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation.\nNext Energy Partners will remain opportunistic, pursuing acquisitions in 2023. And with the closing of the transaction announced today, NextEnergy Partners expects to be well positioned to meet its year-end 2023 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run rate expectations.\nTurning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution results in line with management's expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $447 million increased by $35 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by favorable contributions from the approximately 1,200 net megawatts of new projects acquired in 2022.\nBoth adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions were negatively affected by lower resource from existing projects. Additionally, cash available from distribution was lower versus the prior year comparable period due to incremental debt service and timing of PAYGO payment.\nLooking forward, in the second half of 2023, we expect strong double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners LP distribution per unit growth expectation range of 12% to 15% for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.\nNextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023, to be in the ranges of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million, respectively.\nAs a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contribution from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense.\nAs always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.\nFrom a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to remain comfortable with these growth expectations.\nAnd in fact, even at the current trade yield, Energy Resources portfolio alone is just one way NextEra Energy Partners believes it can meet its growth expectations through 2026. For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of to $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. We also continue to expect to achieve our 2023 distribution growth of 12% to 15%.\nIn summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well positioned to continue delivering on their long-term growth prospects. At FPL, that means executing on smart capital investments to deliver on its customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service.\nAt Energy Resources, that means leading the decarbonization of both the power sector and non-power sector and leveraging its competitive advantages to capitalize on low-cost renewals and new emerging technologies like green hydrogen.\nAnd NextEra Eneregy Partners, we expect to capitalize on its unmatched growth visibility to further expand its best-in-class clean energy portfolio to provide long-term distribution growth for unit holders. With that, we are happy to address your questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Geoffroy\n\nDirector of IR, NextEra Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company.\nJohn will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nToday's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. And as a result, Gulf Power is no longer a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy.\nFor 2022 and beyond, FPL has 1 reporting segment, and therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to John.\n\nJohn W. Ketchum\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, NextEra Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn to discussion of our financial results and the future growth prospects, I'd like to make some comments on the status of our review. As a reminder, we reported last quarter that we were reviewing allegations of Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations raised in the media articles and a related complaint filed in October with the Federal Election Commission. Our review of information reasonably available to us is now substantially complete.\nRegarding the Florida allegations, based on information in our possession, we believe that FPL would not be found liable for any of the Florida campaign finance law violations as alleged in the media articles.\nWith respect to the FEC complaint, you may recall that it was filed by a special interest group and primarily relies on media articles that allege certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act by various parties, including by implication, FPL. The FEC process is a confidential civil administrative process with an investigation only commencing if the FEC votes to do so.\nWe plan to file a response seeking dismissal of the FEC complaint in the next few weeks and do not believe it is appropriate for a complaint such as this to move forward. The total amount of contributions referenced in the complaint is less than $1.3 million, and we do not expect that allegations of federal campaign finance law violations taken as a whole would be material to us.\nWith that behind us, I would like to now discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and future growth prospects. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year in 2022, and both businesses have never been better positioned. The cost and efficiency of new renewables have improved significantly over the last 2 decades, while natural gas prices have seen an increase over the past year with volatility likely to continue going forward.\nAt the same time, landmark renewables legislation was entered into law last fall. After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, we often said it was transformational for our industry and our business. Before IRA, we largely qualified for 2 federal incentives, wind production tax credits and solar investment tax credits.\nWe always had the challenge of planning the business with those federal incentives expected to phase down and expire in a few months or years. Some years, they were extended. Others, they were not. The uncertainty changed customer behavior and it changed our behavior.\nToday, the incentives are clear. They support a broader range of renewable technologies. They are in place for a much longer period of time, and they incentivize the domestic supply chain that will further reduce the cost of renewables that are made in the U.S.A., creating new American jobs.\nIn short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost, clean energy solutions in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders.\nSo today, I am excited to share that we are extending our financial expectations for an additional year at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners, and I look forward to sharing more details on those expectations in a few minutes.\nIn 2022, NextEra Energy continued its long track record of outstanding execution, delivering full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.90, up nearly 14% from 2021. As a result of strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources, we achieved the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range.\nOver the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10% for our shareholders, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. NextEra Energy outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 10% in 2022 despite a challenging year in the financial markets. In terms of total shareholder return, NextEra Energy has outperformed the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Utility (sic) [Utilities] Index on a 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year basis.\nOver the past 15 years, we have outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and more than tripled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we have outperformed 75% of the companies in the S&P 500, while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index.\nWe are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, but we remain intensely focused on execution at both FPL and Energy Resources, and we remain committed to delivering long-term growth for shareholders going forward.\nWe have a long history of executing and delivering on our commitments, even in periods of uncertainty and disruption, and 2022 is no exception. Despite a challenging macro environment, we invested more than $19 billion in American energy infrastructure, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.\nOvercoming supply chain challenges, we constructed and placed into service roughly 5,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our team's expertise and competitive advantages. While disruption created some near-term challenges, it also created opportunities, and I am extremely proud of our team's execution in 2022 and delivering adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14%.\nDuring 2022, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives while delivering on what we believe is the best customer value proposition in America. Despite inflationary pressures, we further reduced our already best-in-class nonfuel O&M cost per megawatt hour by approximately 8.6% versus 2021. We also continued our investments in solar generation that can reduce the variable fuel component of our customer bills.\nWe placed into service approximately 450 megawatts of cost-effective solar during 2022, and we anticipate commissioning another roughly 1,200 megawatts of low-cost solar in 2023 bringing our total solar build-out to roughly 1.7 gigawatts within the first 2 years of our current rate agreement.\nOur relentless focus on productivity and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers is a significant part of what has kept our typical 1000-kilowatt hour residential customer bills the lowest among Florida investor-owned utilities and more than 30% below the national average. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability and was recognized for the seventh time in 8 years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.\nOur team responded exceptionally well in response to hurricanes Ian and Nicole. And during the year of high inflation and high natural gas prices, FPL used its strong balance sheet to provide bill relief for its customers.\nLooking forward, we remain committed to providing clean, affordable and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2022, delivering adjusted earnings growth of nearly 11% versus the prior year.\nWith economics driving strong demand for renewables, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 8,000 megawatts to our backlog, as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring across the United States. Within -- with the significant net additions over the last year, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at a year-end record of approximately 19 gigawatts net of projects placed in service and provides strong visibility into the growth that lies ahead.\nOur continued execution, combined with the long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the strong market backdrop for low-cost renewables gives us more confidence in our long-term outlook at NextEra Energy. Last June, we laid out our vision and strategy to decarbonize both ourselves and the broader U.S. economy.\nIn August, the IRA helped provide more certainty and flexibility to plan for growth than at any other time in our history. Over the next 2 decades, we are well positioned to continue our track record of creating long-term value for shareholders through additional renewables and storage investments, expansion into new markets and products that enable even more renewables and organic growth opportunities to optimize our existing fleet by repowering assets and co-locating storage.\nAt FPL, our plan is to lower cost for customers by accretively deploying capital into low-cost solar, storage and eventually hydrogen. By transforming our generation fleet and continuing our decades-long strategy of fuel switching, we will not only help customers by keeping bills low but also help the state of Florida achieve energy independence.\nOur customers have already seen the positive impacts of the IRA on their bills. We estimate that solar production tax credits are expected to save customers roughly $400 million over the term of our current rate agreement. This month, those savings started with a onetime $36 million refund on customer bills for our completed 2022 rate-based solar projects.\nWith only about 5% of FPL's generation mix coming from solar today, we are still in the early stages of building out our low-cost solar portfolio. In April, FPL expects to file its annual Ten Year Site Plan which will present our generation resource plan through 2032.\nLast year's plan included roughly 9,400 megawatts of new solar capacity through 2031, including roughly 4,600 megawatts of additional solar after 2025. By incorporating the IRA benefits, we expect the post-2025 new solar capacity, and this year's plan will more than double what it was last year. We believe low-cost solar will also provide a valuable hedge for our customers against rising natural gas prices in the future.\nAt Energy Resources, the combination of low-cost renewables, higher natural gas prices and the broader push towards decarbonization across the economy, enables our strategy to serve both utilities and commercial and industrial customers with comprehensive clean energy solutions. These comprehensive clean energy solutions are often complex and in addition to new renewables can include renewable fuels, hydrogen and behind-the-meter projects, all of which are expected to ultimately create even greater demand for renewables.\nCustomers are looking for long-term partnerships with customized solutions at a scale unlike anything we have seen in the past. And we believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to serve these complex customer needs in a way that helps them both save money on their energy bills and meet their emissions-reduction goals.\nWe are particularly excited about the potential for green hydrogen and the role it will play as a solution to help commercial and industrial customers cost effectively lower emissions. We are building the algorithms and tools to identify and optimize the best green hydrogen sites around the country and leverage our significant interconnection and land inventory position.\nWe are using the skills and capabilities that we have developed over the decades that we have led the renewables industry to participate in emerging clean hydrogen markets in a big way. And we are already starting to see some of our early efforts materialize. Last week, we signed a term sheet for approximately 800 megawatts of new solar generation, which we have not included in our backlog that is expected to reach commercial operations in 2026 and is expected to support a green hydrogen related facility in development in the Central United States.\nAdditionally, Energy Resources is participating in the development of hydrogen hubs in the Southwest and Southeast. Earlier in the month, these hubs were encouraged to file full applications for federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy under its $8 billion program to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier.\nIn the Southeast, our plan is to support 140 tons per day clean hydrogen facility at our Gulf Clean Energy Center that would be powered by FPL solar projects. In the Southwest, our plan is to build a 120 tons per day electrolysis-based clean hydrogen project in Arizona in partnership with Linde, the world's largest industrial gases company and the largest liquid hydrogen producer in the United States, with whom we recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding.\nThe clean hydrogen produced by this facility would be used to support decarbonization of the West Coast mobility and industrial end markets. These are just a few examples of clean hydrogen opportunities our team is actively pursuing. We continue to work with various partners on hydrogen solutions, and we are excited by both the number and scale of opportunities in front of us.\nAt our investor conference in June last year, we announced Energy Resources development expectations of roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of new build renewables and storage through 2025. In sizing those expectations, we considered, among other factors, the expiration and phase down of production tax credits and investment tax credits under then existing tax law.\nTypically, when tax credits are near the planned expiration dates, we see a spike in demand in the immediate years prior. Then after-tax credits are extended, demand weakens in the short term. Even though tax credits were extended with the IRA, we are continuing to see tremendous demand for new renewables.\nIt is against that backdrop of strong market demand and the continued cost advantages of renewables, combined with our unparalleled competitive advantages, that today, we are extending our development expectations at Energy Resources through 2026. We now believe that we will place into service approximately 32,700 to 41,800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects from 2023 through the end of 2026.\nIf you compare midpoint to midpoint, our new 4-year development expectations at Energy Resources are approximately 15% higher than the previous 4-year development expectations range that we announced at our investor conference last year.\nTo put these numbers into context, just executing at the low end of our new development expectations through 2026, would more than double the size of our current renewables and storage operating portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete.\nDue to our long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the significant growth opportunities of both FPL and Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are extending our adjusted earnings per share growth expectations at NextEra Energy by an additional year through 2026. For 2023 and 2024, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively.\nFor 2025 and 2026, we expect to grow 6% to 8% of the 2024 adjusted EPS range. This equates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70 for 2025 and $3.63 to $4 for 2026. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in each of 2023, '24, '25 and '26, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.\nLet me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which had another terrific year of execution while delivering on its commitments to unitholders. For 2022, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by approximately 15% year-over-year and delivered more than 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. This growth is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2022.\nDuring the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,200 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. Our confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' long runway of growth has been further bolstered by the IRA, against a backdrop that we believe includes at least 2 decades of clean energy incentives. We expect NextEra Energy Partners' opportunity set for acquiring renewables from both Energy Resources and from third parties to continue to be robust.\nNextEra Energy Partners' organic growth opportunities have also expanded significantly, and we are currently evaluating repowering investments for roughly 1.3 gigawatts of wind assets owned by NextEra Energy Partners for 2024 through 2026.\nAdditionally, earlier this month, NextEra Energy Partners leveraged its cost of capital advantages to execute early buyouts of tax equity interest on 2 of its existing asset portfolios for approximately $190 million. These transactions are intended to enable NextEra Energy Partners to take advantage of the IRA's new transferability provisions, which allow for the sale of tax credits to third parties.\nWith the buyouts and subsequent transfer of tax credits, NextEra Energy Partners can now fully access 2 cash flow streams for unitholders, project cash flows and cash flows that result from the transfer of PTCs. Taken together, NextEra Energy Partners expect these early tax equity investor buyouts to deliver an attractive cash available for distribution yield for unitholders.\nThe significant tailwinds provided by the IRA and Energy Resources' future renewables outlook, combined with NextEra Energy Partners' third-party M&A and organic growth opportunities and continued ability to raise low-cost capital even in a challenging capital markets environment, provide us with long-term growth visibility.\nAs a result, today, we are pleased to announce that we are extending our financial expectations for NextEra Energy Partners by another year. We now see 12% to 15% per year growth in per unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We believe that NextEra Energy Partners' distribution per unit growth expectations are best-in-class versus any other company of its kind in the market and that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition.\nIn summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have never been better positioned. We anticipate a tremendous acceleration of growth in renewables and storage deployment across the U.S. due in part to the IRA, particularly in the latter half of the decade. And we believe that our substantial competitive advantages will allow us to continue delivering value to shareholders and unitholders for many years to come.\nBefore turning the call over to Kirk, I'd like to talk about the important organizational changes we're announcing this morning. After 20 years with NextEra Energy, Eric Silagy, has notified me of his intention to retire from FPL where he has led the team for 11 years. Eric has been a passionate advocate for continuous improvement. And under his leadership, FPL has been transformed into the nation's largest and most reliable electric utility.\nOver the last decade, Eric has led the efforts to modernize FPL's generating fleet, make it one of the cleanest, lowest cost and most fuel-efficient in the country. His commitment to putting customers first is demonstrated every day by FPL's award-winning customer service, bills that are significantly lower than the national average and the best reliability in the country.\nLast year during hurricanes Ian and Nicole, I saw firsthand Eric's dedication and compassion for our customers as he steered the FPL team to quickly restore power and quickly get the state of Florida back on its feet. Over his 20 years of dedicated service to our company, Eric has also been a tremendous supporter of the communities where we do business. His advocacy across the state has helped to foster Florida's economic growth, strengthen our state university system and grow the next generation of Florida leaders, just to name a few of his many accomplishments. I want to thank Eric for his service and wish him and his family all the best on this next chapter in life.\nWith Eric's departure, we are excited to welcome Armando Pimentel, back to NextEra Energy as FPL's President and CEO. As you know, Armando previously served as NextEra Energy's and FPL's CFO and the President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources.\nAs a lifelong Floridian, Armando is a proven leader that will be relentlessly focused on serving our customers. He is also a good friend and colleague, who I've worked closely with for many years. And I am confident that under Armando's leadership, FPL will continue its long track record of delivering outstanding performance to our customers.\nLet me now turn the call over to Eric, who will make some personal remarks.\n\nEric E. Silagy\n\nPresident, CEO & Chairman, Florida Power & Light Company\n\nThank you, John. I want to start by saying what an honor and a privilege it has been to work for NextEra Energy. This company's performance has been unprecedented in our industry, and I couldn't be more proud of the results that we have delivered for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.\nWhen I joined NextEra Energy in 2003, FPL relied more on foreign oil to generate electricity than any other utility in America. We knew that we needed to modernize our generation portfolio, and we recognized that building a clean, low-cost and fuel-efficient fleet was a great decision for our customers as it would save them money on their fuel bill.\nToday, that long-term vision has saved FPL customers a cumulative $14 billion over the last 20 years. That's $14 billion that never came out of our customers' pockets, helped them pay for their kids' education, take their families on vacation or pay for any other family expenses. These efforts began by thinking of ourselves more as a technology company than a utility, finding new and innovative ways to run the grid, and it led to improved reliability, reduced operating costs and a totally different way to approach hurricane restorations.\nUltimately, this new way of thinking led to faster restoration times, which has saved the state of Florida billions of dollars. These are just a few examples of how we've transformed FPL into one of America's cleanest, most affordable and most reliable energy companies.\nWhile saying goodbye to such a great organization is always difficult, I know that now is the right time for me to hand over the reins of FPL. The last year has been one of the most challenging of my career, given the number of distractions, including 2 hurricanes and significant supply chain and inflationary pressures, to name just a few.\nWhen John became CEO of NextEra Energy last year, I committed to him that I would stay in my role for at least 1 more year and have now satisfied that commitment. In April, I'll mark my 20th anniversary with NextEra Energy, at which point I will have led the FPL team for going on 12 years, which is well beyond the tenure of most CEOs.\nWe have 2 more years of execution before our next rate case proceeding, which is, as all of you know, an all-consuming process. And then I just wasn't sure that I could fully commit to. So I feel it's best for the transition to take place now and for new leadership to take the helm of FPL to ensure consistent management heading into a very busy next couple of years.\nIt's been the greatest honor of my career to lead the FPL team and I cannot thank our nearly 10,000 FPL employees, thousands more of our retirees enough for their hard work, for their dedication and for always putting the customers first. They have served our communities and our state with distinction and always challenged themselves to get better every single day.\nIn my opinion, and I'm a little biased, FPL is the best utility in the world. I'm so proud of what our team has accomplished and is extremely well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to both customers, shareholders and to the state. I wish John, Armando and the entire FPL team all the best in their future endeavors.\nAnd now let me turn the call over to Kirk for more details.\n\nTerrell Kirk Crews\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, NextEra Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $763 million or $0.38 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2022, FPL reported net income of $3.7 billion or $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.24 per share versus 2021.\nRegulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% for 2022. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the 4-year term of our current rate agreement. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.2 billion.\nFor the fourth quarter, FPL's net income was impacted by a number of factors, including favorable weather, as well as an approximately $40 million pretax contribution to charitable foundations that will allow us to continue to support the communities that we serve.\nFor the full year 2022, FPL's year-over-year net income growth of nearly $500 million was aided by favorable weather, increased customer growth and effective cost management that supported our ability to continue to deploy smart capital for the benefit of customers.\nFPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.74% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter, we did not use any reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2022 balance of $1.45 billion.\nOur overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and successfully met our solar deployment objectives at FPL in 2022. Beyond solar, construction on our green hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date later this year.\nEarlier this week, FPL filed with the Florida Public Service Commission its proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs incurred in 2022. Under our proposed plan, FPL utilizes its strong balance sheet to spread these unrecovered 2022 fuel costs over a 21-month period beginning in April '23.\nAdditionally, FPL's proposed plan would further benefit customers by offsetting the 2022 fuel costs recovery by approximately $1 billion this year based on the recent drop in projected natural gas prices compared to FPL's original 2023 projections made in the third quarter of 2022. We believe this proposal is a reflection of FPL's customer-centric strategy to navigate challenging environments for the benefit of customers.\nSeparately, FPL is also seeking recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of storm costs incurred in 2022. Under FPL's proposal, the storm costs would be recovered over a 12-month period starting in April 2023 to reduce the potential customer bill impacts that could result from the simultaneous recovery of charges related to future storms.\nTaking both proposals together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000-kilowatt hour residential customer bills as of April 2023 will remain well below the projected national average and the projected average for Florida investor-owned utilities.\nThe Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 6% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.4 trillion, which is up approximately 10% from 2021. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation.\nOver the past year, Florida has created roughly 600,000 new private sector jobs and Florida's labor force participation rate continues to improve at a faster rate than the rest of the country. Although we have seen the growth rates stabilize, 3-month average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 6%.\nOther measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior year, including an 11% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a roughly 2% decline in mortgage delinquencies.\nDuring the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 74,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 2.1% versus the prior year period, primarily driven by a favorable weather comparison. For 2022, FPL's retail sales increased 1% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth.\nEnergy Resources reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income of $996 million or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $402 million or $0.20 per share. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $285 million or $0.14 per share and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.44 billion or $1.23 per share.\nThe effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' full year GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Energy Resources' full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased by $0.11 versus 2021. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.04 per share due to continued growth in our renewables and storage portfolio.\nAs we previously highlighted, the Commerce Department's decision to investigate circumvention claims led to delays in the development of renewables, which effectively pushed out the completion of certain projects that we previously anticipated in 2022. As a result, contributions from new investments were negatively impacted in 2022. We anticipate that Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contributions from new investments will be much stronger in 2023, when we expect many of these delayed projects will be completed.\nOur customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.12 versus 2021, primarily due to high margins -- higher margins in our customer-facing businesses and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. Our existing clean energy assets also increased results by $0.02 per share year-over-year.\nAll other net impacts decreased results by $0.07 year-over-year, driven primarily by higher debt balances, reflecting growth in the business. Additional details of our full year 2022 results at Energy Resources are shown on the accompanying slide.\nAs John mentioned, Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, signing approximately 8,030 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects. Since the last call, we have originated approximately 1,700 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, including approximately 300 megawatts of wind, 730 megawatts of solar and 670 megawatts of battery storage.\nOur origination performance in 2022 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes, for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals, but perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save on energy costs by switching to lower-cost forms of generation like wind, solar and solar plus storage.\nToday, we are extending our renewables development expectations through 2026 as a result of our tremendous progress in 2022, strong continued origination success and the strong market demand for low-cost renewables driven in part by the IRA.\nOur revised expectations are by far the largest expected 4-year development program in our history and reflect our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position and the continued acceleration of renewables penetration across the country. The accompanying slide provides additional details on our new expectations and where our development program at Energy Resources, now stands.\nAs you know, the industry has faced significant supply chain challenges and disruption over the past year, and yet our integrated supply chain and engineering and construction teams demonstrated their resiliency by continuing to execute for our customers. And we have been working for over a year with our suppliers to manufacture wafers outside of China.\nWe believe the Commerce Department's preliminary determination on circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties late last year, clarified that solar panels manufactured in Southeast Asia, using wafers and cells produced outside of China, are not circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty laws.\nWe are confident that we can source panels consistent with these guidelines by the end of the 2-year waiver period. Finally, we continue to advance discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels.\nTurning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.52 billion or $0.76 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1 billion or $0.51 per share, respectively.\nFor the full year 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $4.15 billion or $2.10 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.74 billion or $2.90 per share. For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year were roughly flat compared to the prior year.\nAs John mentioned, we invested more than $19 billion in our businesses in 2022, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all sectors. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing strategy. And this year, we recycled more than $5 billion of capital through asset sales and tax equity financings.\nAdditionally, as we have often highlighted, our underlying businesses generate significant cash flow. And in 2022, our operating cash flow grew more than 9% year-over-year despite FPL being under recovered for fuel costs and incurring restoration costs for hurricanes Ian and Nicole. As a result of this strong cash generation, we proactively paid down nearly $3 billion in 2023 maturities.\nFinally, we ended the year with $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. As a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations.\nAs John discussed, today, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2023 through 2025 and introducing expectations for 2026. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges.\nFor 2021 to 2026, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.\nLet me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up approximately 12% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions. Fourth quarter cash available for distribution was $74 million. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners operating expenses and interest expense on project debt are typically higher in the fourth quarter versus the first 3 quarters of the year.\nFor the full year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.65 billion, up 21% year-over-year and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2021. Existing projects added approximately $13 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year with the benefit of higher net generation for both wind and solar, partially offset by relatively higher operating and maintenance costs versus 2021.\nNextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution was $634 million for the full year. Relative to the growth in NextEra Energy Partners' full year adjusted EBITDA, its cash available for distribution from existing projects was also impacted by relatively higher allocation of production tax credits to investors due to favorable wind resource versus 2021.\nOver the past 5 years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.\nYesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8125 per common unit or $3.25 per unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% year-over-year and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2022. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by more than 330% since the IPO.\nDuring 2022, NextEra Energy Partners executed several low-cost financings, continuing its successful track record of accessing attractive sources of capital to support growth for unitholders. During the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a new convertible equity portfolio financing for approximately $900 million, with a low implied cash coupon of roughly 2.8% for up to 10 years to be funded by the investors' share of ongoing portfolio cash flows.\nIn December, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new convertible notes with a 2.5% coupon which, along with a cap call entered into at the time of the financing, provides unitholders with dilution protection for up to 50% accretion versus the net unit price at the time of issuance.\nThe implied total cost of the convertible notes represents the most favorable spread to an alternative debt issuance in our history. These transactions executed during the fourth quarter were a continuation of NextEra Energy Partners successful financing execution throughout 2022.\nIn May 2022, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility to approximately $2.5 billion, nearly all of which is currently available. With this available revolving credit capacity and the final funding of approximately $180 million expected from the 2022 convertible equity portfolio financing, NextEra Energy Partners enters 2023 with significant financing capacity to fund future growth.\nAdditionally, NextEra Energy Partners still has $6 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps, which is more than enough to cover its corporate maturities through 2027 and will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuance, whether for maturities or net new issuances.\nTaken together, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners is extremely well positioned with significant interest rate protection and ample liquidity to finance future growth and to capture a meaningful share of the long-term opportunity set, which has expanded as a result of the IRA. The significant opportunity set and NextEra Energy Partners' meaningful financing flexibility provides us with confidence in our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for unitholders over the coming years.\nFrom an updated base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we now see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026, which is an additional year beyond our prior expectations, driven by the partnership's tremendous long-term growth visibility. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 and to $3.74 per common unit.\nNextEra Energy Partners' run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions at December 31, 2023, remain unchanged. Year-end 2023 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion, and cash available for distribution of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023.\nAs a reminder, all our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as operating expense.\nIn summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth, both in the near term and long term. Near term, the progress we made in 2022 reinforces our growth outlook and sets the foundation for continuing to deliver on our financial expectations. Long term, we believe that the low cost of renewables, combined with our -- with other clean energy solutions, enabled in part by the IRA provides us with unprecedented visibility to extend our track record of delivering long-term growth for our shareholders and unitholders, and we could not be more excited about our future.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJessica Geoffroy\n\nDirector of IR, NextEra Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nToday's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.\nAs a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power is no longer a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment. And therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nTerrell Kirk Crews\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, NextEra Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin today's discussion of our third quarter results, I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by the widespread destruction caused by Hurricanes Fiona and Ian over the last month. Hurricane Ian was the fifth strongest hurricane to ever make landfall in the Continental U.S. The powerful and destructive storm hit Southwest Florida as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, devastating storm surges and numerous tornadoes, tragically resulting in the loss of lives and causing more than 2.1 million FPL customers to lose power.\nIn preparation for the hurricane, FPL assembled a restoration workforce of approximately 20,000 workers. This preparation and coordinated response, combined with FPL's valuable hardening and smart grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to roughly 2/3 of affected customers after the first full day of restoration following Hurricane Ian's landfall. This represents the fastest restoration rate in our history for a major hurricane. Our dedicated and resourceful workforce was able to restore essentially all FPL customers who were able to safely accept power within 8 days.\nI would like to thank all of our employees who made personal sacrifices leaving their own homes to serve our customers, our communities and our state. It was because of their training, their preparation their dedication and their commitment that we were able to restore power to our customers so quickly. I would also like to thank other members of the restoration team, including the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts, for their dedicated assistance during this critical time.\nFinally, we are deeply grateful for the assistance provided by our industry partners who came from 30 different states to help support our customers.\nMutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of our industry, and this storm was no exception. For nearly 2 decades, FPL has invested significantly in building a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient grid. While no energy grid is hurricane-proof, the performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening and undergrounding investments are providing significant benefits to our customers.\nDespite sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, FPL did not lose a single transmission pole or tower during Hurricane Ian. Additionally, initial performance data show that FPL's undergrounding distribution power lines performed 5x better in terms of outage rates than existing overhead distribution power lines in Southwest Florida.\nOn a related note, we were pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission substantially approved our 2023 Storm Protection Plan earlier this month, which we expect will lead to an even stronger and more resilient grid for the benefit of our customers.\nFinally, we are proud to report that our generation fleet, including our solar sites, sustained almost no structural damage. Despite 38 of FPL's 50 existing solar sites or approximately 12 million panels being exposed to storm conditions, less than 0.3% of our solar panels were affected, and those impacted were mostly at our older fixed racking sites. Our battery storage sites, including one of the world's largest solar power batteries at our Manati Solar Energy Center, remained available throughout the storm. We believe these investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response, have improved FPL's overall reliability and resiliency, providing significant value to our customers.\nAlthough FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of Hurricane Ian restoration costs that we plan to recover from customers through a surcharge is approximately $1.1 billion, of which approximately $220 million will be utilized to replenish the storm reserve, subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm cost by the Florida Public Service Commission. Under its current settlement agreement, FPL is allowed to collect an equivalent of $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills but can request an increase to the $4 equivalent surcharge given the cost exceeded $800 million. We anticipate discussing the surcharge amount and timing with the Florida Public Service Commission in the coming months.\nLet me briefly comment on the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, and what it means for our customers, for our company and for our industry. At our investor conference in June, we announced our vision to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy, and we announced our industry-leading goal to deliver Real Zero emissions by no later than 2045. We discussed our strategy to get there and how every part of our strategy is focused on saving customers money on their energy bills.\nWe also said in June that achieving our goals would require constructive governmental policies and incentives. The IRA gives us those policies and incentives at the federal level. It also gives us visibility into what those policies and incentives will look like for what we believe will be more than 2 decades. We believe that the IRA will not only help reduce carbon emissions, strengthen energy independence and security and create jobs in our industry and in our domestic supply chain, but also and most importantly will reduce the cost of energy for everyone. We can already see some of the positive impacts of the IRA on customer bills at FPL.\nLast month, we filed with the Florida Public Service Commission our estimate that the solar production tax credits in the IRA are expected to save customers nearly $400 million over the course of our current rate agreement. Those savings start with a onetime $25 million refund through the capacity cost recovery clause in January 2023 to reflect the solar PTCs on our completed 2022 rate-based solar projects, subject to a review by the commission, which we expect later this year.\nLooking forward for our FPL customers, we believe that the IRA makes every solar project, every battery storage project, every renewable gas project and every green hydrogen project more cost-effective. And these solar, battery storage, renewable gas and green hydrogen projects are designed to reduce the impact that fuel volatility can have on customer bills. We believe the IRA will help make Florida an even better place to raise a family or build a business as we work toward our goal of delivering 100% carbon emissions free energy affordably and reliably.\nWe believe the IRA will also make clean energy cheaper for our customers at Energy Resources. We have never been more excited about our opportunity to partner with customers to decarbonize the power sector as well as broader parts of the U.S. economy. The IRA provides decades of visibility to low-cost renewables, and that visibility has already encouraged our power sector customers and customers outside the power sector to think big about how they can realize the value of renewables to reduce cost and emissions.\nAs a world leader in renewables with deep energy market expertise, we were having conversations with customers about large-scale opportunities unlike anything we have seen in the past. And while some will take time to develop, we cannot be more excited about the future.\nTurning now to our financial performance. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 13% year-over-year. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.07 year-over-year, growing regulatory capital employed by approximately 11% over the prior year period.\nWe have highlighted in the past our smart capital investments in fuel efficiency, combined with our best-in-class O&M performance and productivity initiatives, provide significant benefits to customers and have allowed us to continue to deliver residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all the Florida investor-owned utilities.\nAt Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. We continue to capitalize on a terrific environment for renewables development, originating approximately 2,345 megawatts of new renewables and storage since the last call. With economics as a significant driver, Energy Resources continues to capitalize on strong renewables demand from both power and nonpower sector customers, particularly in light of high power prices and high natural gas prices. Overall, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term financial expectations, subject to our usual caveat.\nFor the third quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of nearly $1.1 billion or $0.54 per share, which is an increase of $147 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the third quarter, and we continue to expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion.\nFPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ended September 2022. Largely as a result of warm weather, we have fully restored our surplus depreciation reserve, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1.5 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. As a reminder, our 2021 settlement agreement provided a mechanism whereby a sustained increase in 30-year treasury bond yields would trigger an increase in FPL's authorized ROE range. Accordingly, the Florida Public Service Commission approved an increase in FPL's authorized midpoint ROE from 10.6% to 10.8% with an allowed range of 9.8% to 11.8%, which became effective on September 1, 2022. Importantly, FPL will not increase base rates as a result of triggering the increased authorized ROE.\nFor the full year 2022, FPL continues to target an 11.6% ROE but is allowed to earn at the high end of the revised range, which may occur based on, among other things, warmer-than-expected weather.\nThe Florida economy continues to be healthy. Florida's unemployment rate of approximately 2.7% remains below the national average and at its lowest level in more than 15 years. Florida's labor force participation rate remains strong. In spite of significant inflationary pressures across many parts of the U.S., customer sentiment in Florida ticked up slightly in the third quarter. However, the August reading of the 3-month average of new building permits in Florida declined year-over-year, which is not a surprise given the significant growth we have observed since the pandemic and the recent increase in mortgage rates. We continue to believe that Florida offers a unique value proposition and will continue to show strong population growth over the coming decades.\nFPL's average number of customers increased by nearly 83,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued strong underlying population growth.\nFPL's third quarter retail sales increased 3.8% from the prior year comparable period. For the third quarter, we estimate that warmer weather had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 2.9% and that Hurricane Ian had a negative impact of approximately 0.4%. After taking these factors into account, third quarter retail sales increased 1.3% on a weather-normalized basis, with a strong continued customer growth contributing favorably.\nEnergy Resources reported third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $655 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $729 million or $0.37 per share, which is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of more than 19% year-over-year.\nContributions from new investments increased $0.02 per share versus the prior year primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing generation and storage assets decreased results by $0.02 per share, primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the third quarter, which was the third lowest wind resource quarter on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business contributed $0.06 year-over-year primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses. All other net impacts were roughly flat year-over-year. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another terrific quarter of origination, signing approximately 2,345 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects since our last earnings call. Specifically, we originated approximately 1,215 megawatts of wind, 965 megawatts of solar and 165 megawatts of battery storage projects. Included in these solar additions is approximately 270 megawatts of post-2025 delivery. With these new additions, net of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of projects placed in service and roughly 680 megawatts of projects removed from our backlog, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at roughly 20,000 megawatts and provides strong visibility into the significant growth that is expected at Energy Resources over the next few years.\nOur development expectations through 2025 are unchanged from what we disclosed at our investor conference in June and reflect a planned renewables and storage build that is, at the midpoint, more than 20% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at Energy Resources today. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at Energy Resources now stands.\nAs previously discussed, we believe Energy Resources is better positioned than anyone in our sector to benefit from the provisions of the IRA, particularly after 2025 when incentives were previously expected to expire or step down. With what we believe is over 2 decades of visibility for wind, solar and storage credits, the long-term growth opportunity set is expansive and [exciting.] Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to capitalize on battery storage colocation opportunities with wind and now has repowering opportunities across its existing renewables footprint. New markets and new investment opportunities are being created for renewables and renewable fuels that require wind and solar as their source. Transmission will be needed to support the significant renewables build-out, and all these opportunities support our vision of leading decarbonization of the U.S. economy.\nA key component of our vision is helping commercial and industrial customers meet their sustainability goals by providing them with comprehensive clean energy solutions, including providing renewable fuel alternatives such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas.\nTo that end, today, we are excited to announce we reached an agreement to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities, which will become a core part of our renewable fuels and potentially hydrogen strategies. This transaction represents an attractive opportunity for Energy Resources to expand its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and grow its in-house capabilities in this rapidly expanding market.\nEnergy Resources intends to purchase the portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, subject to closing adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $37 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in early 2023.\nIn the coming years, we expect to invest roughly $400 million net of the investment tax credit benefit of additional capital into the portfolio of projects, primarily to enable production of renewable natural gas. In our base case, we expect that the acquired portfolio deliver more than $220 million of adjusted EBITDA at Energy Resources by 2025, which is included in our financial expectations. Moreover, the acquisition is expected to deliver double-digit returns.\nWe are particularly excited about additional upside opportunities the portfolio may enable that are not included in our base case and look forward to potentially deploying additional capital and new ventures that may qualify for new federal incentives.\nTurning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was roughly $1.7 billion or $0.86 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.683 billion and $0.85 per share, respectively. Adjusted results for the Corporate and Other segment decreased by $0.03 year-over-year.\nA hallmark of our business is our financial discipline and forward planning as we grow the business, including the consideration of a range of scenarios to manage interest rate risk. In recent years, we've proactively engaged in liability management initiatives, which we expect to yield significant interest cost savings through 2025. Additionally, we have $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. With the swaps in place, we're in good shape to manage 2023 and 2024 maturities and new debt issuances despite the current interest rate environment.\nFinally, the recent increase in interest rates is taken into account in our financial expectations.\nOur long-term financial expectations through 2025 remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. For 2023 and 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70.\nWe will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges for 2022 through 2025 while at the same time, maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.\nInclusive of the increases in our expectations in both January and June of this year, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025. In addition, for 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.\nNow let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered strong financial performance for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up approximately 13% and 17%, respectively, against the prior year comparable quarter. Last week, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7875 per common unit or $3.15 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by approximately 320% since the IPO.\nNextEra Energy Partners continued to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of an approximately 67% interest in a 230-megawatt 4-hour battery storage facility in California from Energy Resources. This acquisition further diversifies NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio into battery storage. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners issued approximately $145 million in new equity through its at-the-market program and used these proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund this acquisition.\nConsistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2023 run rate expectations, which are built upon NextEra Energy Partners' strong existing portfolio and cash flow generation potential and continued ability to access low-cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects.\nAt the midpoint, NextEra Energy Partners new year-end 2023 run rate expectation ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 12%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2022 run rate expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward.\nTurning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $377 million, and cash available for distribution was $185 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution.\nThe third quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $18 million year-over-year driven primarily by unfavorable renewable resource. Wind resource for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately 95% of the long-term average versus 101% in the third quarter of 2021.\nThird quarter cash available for distribution benefited from higher year-over-year PAYGO payments from both new and existing projects after a relatively strong wind resource period in the first half of this year. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide.\nFrom a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. Additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide.\nNextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022.\nAt year-end 2023, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $770 million to $860 million. These new expectations highlight our continued confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' ability to deliver on its long-term distribution per common unit growth expectations.\nAs a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.\nNextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to manage financing costs in the current interest rate environment. Approximately 98% of NextEra Energy Partners' long-term debt, including current maturities, is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rate as it is either fixed rate debt or financially hedged. Moreover, NextEra Energy Partners has $6 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps, which will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for growth or maturities. NextEra Energy Partners also has no significant debt maturities in '23, and debt maturities over the next 5 years are manageable in -- with the forward starting swaps.\nFinally, I'd like to close with a few words about how we expect the IRA may benefit NextEra Energy Partners and its LP unitholders. In response to the extension and expansion of clean energy tax credits, we anticipate an acceleration of renewables and storage deployment in the U.S. over the next few decades. In turn, we expect that NextEra Energy Partners will continue to have ample opportunities to acquire assets from both Energy Resources and from third parties. Additionally, we believe that the long-term organic growth potential for NextEra Energy Partners has increased, with potential new opportunities to repower its roughly 8 gigawatt existing wind and solar assets and to pair battery storage with this nearly 7 gigawatt existing wind portfolio.\nConsidering the potential impacts of the IRA, our expectation regarding the overall tax position for NextEra Energy Partners remains largely unchanged, including that it is not expected to pay any meaningful taxes for at least the next 15 years. Combined with its current yield and the expectation of 12% to 15% annual distributions per unit growth through at least 2025, NextEra Energy Partners has the potential to deliver a total after-tax return of approximately 20% annually through this time frame.\nWith the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and all of the market tailwinds provided by the IRA, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue delivering on its unitholder value proposition.\nIn summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best execution track records in the industry, and we are extremely excited about the long-term growth prospects for both businesses and the value we can continue to create for both customers and shareholders.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note that today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nJessica Geoffroy\n\nThank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nToday's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.\nAs a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power will no longer continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment, and therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nTerrell Kirk Crews\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, NextEra Energy, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources.\nFPL increased earnings per share by $0.05 year-over-year. Average regulatory capital employed increased by more than 11% versus the same quarter last year. With residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities, FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments such as our planned solar expansion and T&D hardening and undergrounding projects to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy for the benefit of our customers.\nHaving saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs since 2001 and with the largest owned and operated solar portfolio of any utility in the country, FPL is well positioned to execute on its goal of achieving Real Zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045, which we announced last month at our investor conference, while continuing to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition.\nAt Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. We continue to capitalize on a strong environment for renewables development, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts to Energy Resources backlog since the last call. Included in these backlog additions is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of solar projects, which is the second largest quarter of solar origination in our history.\nAs we highlighted at our investor conference last month, we believe that a number of powerful tailwinds support continued strong renewables demand, particularly in the context of high power prices and high gas prices that are helping to make renewables the most economic form of generation. We expect these economic value drivers for new renewables, coupled with Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages, to translate into a tremendous opportunity set as we deliver clean energy solutions to our customers seeking to both lower their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions.\nWe are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2022 and heading into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.\nNow let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $989 million or $0.50 per share, which is an increase of $107 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of FPL's net income growth of approximately 12%.\nFPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.9 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2022.\nLargely as a result of warm weather during the second quarter, we reversed roughly $44 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1.37 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement.\nDuring the quarter, FPL successfully commissioned the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center. The approximately $900 million project, which was completed on time and on budget, is expected to generate nearly $350 million in net cost savings for FPL customers while reducing carbon emissions by roughly 70% compared to the previous Lauderdale Plant. Longer term, we expect to convert approximately 16 gigawatts of our highly efficient gas fleet to run on green hydrogen, which will play an important role in the decarbonization of FPL's generation fleet as part of our goal to achieve Real Zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045.\nLast week, FPL also placed in service the North Florida Resiliency Connection transmission line, which physically connects the FPL grid and the legacy Gulf Power grid. The new transmission line is expected to generate operational efficiencies and allow customers to benefit from both enhanced reliability and additional low-cost solar generation.\nFPL also filed its updated Storm Protection Plan, which is filed every 3 years. The plan provides details on the billions of dollars of capital investment anticipated over the next 10 years to continue hardening FPL's energy grid for the benefit of customers. These hardening programs, several of which have been in progress since 2007, collectively provide increased resiliency and faster restoration times for FPL's approximately 5.8 million customer accounts when severe weather, including hurricanes, inevitably affects our service territory.\nThe Florida economy remains strong. Florida's unemployment rate of approximately 3% remains below the national average and its labor force participation rate remains strong. The 3-month moving average for new housing permits is up nearly 9% year-over-year, outpacing the national rate by roughly 7%.\nFPL's new service accounts increased more than 15% year-over-year, demonstrating continued strong growth in Florida's economy. FPL's average number of customers increased by more than 87,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued strong underlying population growth as Florida's population continues to increase at one of the fastest rates in the nation.\nFPL's second quarter retail sales increased 3.2% from the prior year comparable period driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably.\nEnergy Resources reported second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $133 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $683 million or $0.35 per share. The difference between Energy Resources second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results is primarily the effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings.\nContributions from new investments were roughly flat versus the prior year driven by the timing of new solar and storage project additions. For the full year 2022, we anticipate the majority of our growth in new investments to occur in the fourth quarter.\nOur existing generation and storage assets added $0.03 per share primarily due to favorable wind resource during the second quarter. The second quarter adjusted earnings contributions from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.02 year-over-year driven primarily by the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts that negatively impacted adjusted earnings in the second quarter of last year. All other impacts increased results by $0.01 versus 2021.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog, which is the third largest quarter of renewables and storage origination in our history. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 815 net megawatts of new wind, 1,200 net megawatts of solar and 20 net megawatts of battery storage to our backlog.\nWith these additions, net of projects placed in service, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at approximately 19,600 megawatts and provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that is expected at Energy Resources over the next few years.\nWe remain confident in our long-term development expectations at Energy Resources, which we increased and extended last month. From 2022 through the end of 2025, Energy Resources expects to build roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects. To put these numbers in context, this expected renewables and storage build at the midpoint is approximately 30% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at Energy Resources today.\nWe were pleased that the Biden administration made the decision last month to direct the Department of Commerce to waive additional duties for 2 years on solar panels imported from Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. The 24-month time frame is particularly important as by the end of that period, we expect our suppliers to be making ingots and wafers outside of China.\nAs a reminder, the Department of Commerce staff already publicly stated that panels with wafers made outside of China are not subject to its investigation. The actions by the Biden administration have provided much-needed clarity to our suppliers to resume solar module production, recommence shipping of solar panels and for Energy Resources to restart its solar construction projects that have been halted due to the circumvention investigation.\nThese new developments since our last call reinforce our confidence in both our near-term and long-term development expectations at Energy Resources. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at Energy Resources now stands.\nBeyond renewables and storage, during the quarter, NextEra Energy Water entered into an agreement to purchase a rate-regulated Pennsylvania wastewater system for approximately $115 million. Subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, we anticipate this transaction will close in mid-2023.\nAdditionally, last week, NextEra Energy Water closed on its previously announced acquisition of a portfolio of rate-regulated water and wastewater utility assets in Texas. These strategic investments should allow us to leverage our world-class operating platform to unlock value for both customers and our shareholders as we explore potential opportunities in the regulated water utility business.\nAt NextEra Energy Transmission, we commissioned the Empire State Transmission Line earlier this month. This project is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expands NextEra Energy's regulated business mix through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets to our portfolio. It is expected to improve system reliability and deliver much-needed zero carbon emissions generation to New Yorkers while supporting the state's goals to decarbonize its grid.\nSo far, in 2022, NextEra Energy Transmission has completed roughly $500 million of greenfield transmission projects. The addition of high-quality transmission projects such as the East-West Tie and the Empire State Transmission Line furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider, both to accretively deploy capital as well as to enable further renewables development.\nTurning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.3 billion or $0.70 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were roughly $1.6 billion and $0.81 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from the Corporate and Other segment decreased by $0.01 year-over-year.\nAt our investor conference, we highlighted roughly $400 million in run rate efficiencies identified through Project Velocity that we expect to be recognized over the next few years. This represents the largest identified cost savings in the history of our company-wide productivity initiatives. In connection with Project Velocity, during the second quarter, we recorded transition costs of approximately $52 million pretax, of which $40 million was recorded at FPL and offset with the utilization of reserve amortization. The balance was recorded at Energy Resources and reduced adjusted EPS by roughly $0.01 per share.\nOur long-term financial expectations through 2025, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. For 2023 and 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively.\nFor 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.\nInclusive of the increases in our expectations in both January and June of this year, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025.\nBased upon the clear visibility into meaningful organic growth prospects across all of our businesses, we also remain confident in our near-term capital plan to deploy approximately $85 billion to $95 billion into new investments from 2022 through 2025. In addition, from 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.\nWe also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.\nAs a reminder, Energy Resources development expectations and NextEra Energy's financial expectations through 2025 do not assume any change in current tax law. We continue to see strong market demand for renewables, especially in light of the environment of high gas and power prices that we believe will persist going forward.\nRenewables are not just the most economic form of generation. They are deflationary and countercyclical. Renewable support energy independence help stimulate economic growth, including domestic job creation. Renewables offer low-cost energy to help customers reduce their bills, and demand is being driven by a number of factors, as we discussed at our June investor conference.\nWe continue to believe that NextEra Energy is better positioned than any other company in our industry to capitalize on these market conditions and deliver low-cost renewables and storage to our customers at both FPL and Energy Resources.\nLet me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up approximately 43% and 37%, respectively, against the prior year comparable quarter.\nYesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7625 per common unit or $3.05 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 300% since the IPO.\nLast month at our investor conference, NextEra Energy Partners announced a modification to incentive distribution rights fees, or IDRs, with NextEra Energy. The announced modification flattens IDR payments at $157 million annually based on a minimum annualized distribution rate of $3.05 per common unit. This modified IDR structure will be effective beginning in the third quarter of this year.\nWe expect both NextEra Energy Partners' unitholders and NextEra Energy shareholders to benefit from the IDR modification. NextEra Energy Partners will need fewer asset additions to achieve its growth objectives with reduced equity needs, among other benefits. NextEra Energy expects to benefit from the potential increased value in its investment in NextEra Energy Partners while retaining an attractive incentive distribution fee stream as well as the ability to continue to recycle significant capital through NextEra Energy Partners.\nPutting it all together, these benefits are expected to provide a longer runway of LP distribution growth and support NextEra Energy Partners' best-in-class distribution per unit growth expectations that we extended last month.\nNextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financings during the second quarter to further enhance its financing flexibility. In May, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility by approximately $1.25 billion for a total of $2.5 billion in capacity, which is consistent with NextEra Energy Partners' growth since the facility was last upsized in 2019.\nThe facility was approximately 1.6x oversubscribed, which we believe demonstrates the strong credit quality of the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio as well as the market confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' growth outlook. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners drew the approximately $410 million of remaining funds from its 2021 convertible equity portfolio financing. The strong demand for both the private investor and lending communities to provide NextEra Energy Partners with liquidity for growth demonstrates the partnership's continued ability to raise capital at attractive terms.\nWith another strong origination quarter at Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners' growth visibility is as strong as ever, and we remain on track to deliver on our best-in-class 12% to 15% annual distribution per unit growth expectation, which we extended through 2025 last month at our investor conference.\nFinally, last week, S&P favorably revised NextEra Energy Partners' business risk profile upward from satisfactory to strong to reflect its positive outlook on the partnership's continued growth and portfolio diversification while maintaining highly contracted revenue streams with highly rated counterparties.\nS&P also affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy Partners and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operations, or FFO, to debt metric from the previous level of 14% to the current level of 12%. We believe these favorable adjustments reflect the strength of NextEra Energy Partners' business and the stable cash flow generation profile of its portfolio.\nTurning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners' second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $500 million, and cash available for distribution was $207 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $106 million of adjusted EBITDA and $41 million of cash available for distribution.\nExisting projects added roughly $51 million of adjusted EBITDA and $26 million of cash available for distribution in the second quarter driven primarily by favorable wind resource. Wind resource for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 112% of the long-term average versus 93% in the second quarter of 2021. Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide.\nNextEra Energy Partners run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectation for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022.\nAs a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat fees as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025.\nWe expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. Additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide.\nIn summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, that means continuing to deliver our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. It also means pursuing our industry-leading Real Zero carbon emissions goal, which we detailed at our investor conference and in our Zero Carbon Blueprint to decarbonize FPL's operations by no later than 2045.\nAt Energy Resources, we believe that our best-in-class development and operating platform will allow us to maintain our leadership position as we help both power and nonpower sector customers save on energy costs and decarbonize operations with the adoption of new renewables and various forms of energy storage. And we expect NextEra Energy Partners to benefit greatly from the significant growth in renewables deployment across the United States, which presents terrific opportunities for acquisitions, both from Energy Resources and from third parties.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.",

All participants, be at ease.\n\nIf you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star.\n\nPlease note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Jeffrey, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nThank you Anthony. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for Nextera Energy and Nextera Energy partners.\n\nWith me this morning are John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nextera Energy, Kirk Cruz, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Nextera Energy, Rebecca Kiyava, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nextera Energy Resources, and Mark Hixon, Executive Vice President of Nextera Energy, all of whom are also officers of Nextera Energy Partners, as well as Eric Szilagyi, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power and Light Company.\n\nKirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your question.\n\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\n\nActual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, next-terraenergy.com, and next-terraenergypartners.com.\n\nWe do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.\n\nToday's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nYou should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.\n\nAs a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1st, 2022.\n\nAs a result, both power will no longer continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power and Light and next era energy.\n\nFor 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment and therefore 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.\n\nNextera Energy delivered strong first quarter results and is off to a solid start to meet its overall objectives for the year.\n\nadjusted earnings for share increased by 10.4% year over year reflecting successful performance across all of our underlying businesses.\n\nDuring the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked number one in its sector of Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies list for the 15th time in 16 years.\n\nOur culture of commitment to excellence in everything we do and our core values are what allow our team of approximately 15,000 employees to continue delivering best-in-class value to our customers and shareholders while helping build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean.\n\nSPL increased net income by approximately $98 million from the prior year comparable period, which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers.\n\nDuring the quarter, FPL successfully placed in service approximately 450 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects that are recovered through base rates as part of its new four-year settlement agreement, which, as a reminder, became effective on January 1st of this year.\n\nAs a result, FPL has now completed, on time and within budget, all of its planned solar build with 2022 in-service dates.\n\nFPL now owns and operates more than 3,600 megawatts of solar, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country.\n\nFPL's modernization investments since 2001 have saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs, and its customers have benefited from a 45% improvement in reliability over the last decade.\n\nFPL's other major capital investments are progressing well.\n\nincluding the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the highly efficient, approximately 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, both of which are scheduled for completion later this year.\n\nBy executing on smart capital investments such as these and running the business efficiently, FPL continues to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability, and outstanding customer service.\n\nAt Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by nearly 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable performance in our existing wind portfolio.\n\nIn terms of new origination, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 1,770 net megawatts to our backlog since the last call, bringing our backlog total to approximately 17,700 megawatts.\n\nIncluded in the additions this quarter is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of wind projects, which is the second largest quarter of wind origination in our history.\n\nIn the midst of inflationary pressures and uncertainty in solar supply chain, which I will discuss further in a few moments, our continued origination success in this environment is a testament to the strength of energy resources' competitive advantages and the ongoing demand from our customers for low-cost renewals and storage.\n\nAt this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our team's execution and progress at both FPL and energy resources.\n\nNow, let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $875 million, or $0.44 per share, an increase of $0.05 year over year.\n\nRegulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.3% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter.\n\nFPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion for the quarter.\n\nWe expect our full year 2022 capital investments at FPL to be between $7.9 billion and $8.3 billion.\n\nFPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12-months ending March 2022.\n\nUnder our rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. In this case, the 11.6 percent that I previously mentioned.\n\nWhile we initially expected to earn below our targeted ROE in the early part of 2022, a combination of warm weather, operational efficiencies, and outstanding execution by the team resulted in us achieving our targeted 11.6% ROE while using $124 million of reserve amortization available under our current settlement agreement during the first quarter.\n\nTurning to our development and planning efforts, FPL recently filed its annual 10-year site plan that presents our recommended generation resource plan through 2031.\n\nThe recommended 10-year site plan includes roughly 9,500 megawatts of new solar capacity across our service territory over the next 10 years, which would result in nearly 20 percent of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2031 coming from solar generation.\n\nThis planned solar buildout includes nearly 1,200 megawatts of base rate solar projects, inclusive of the approximately 450 megawatts placed in service during the first quarter that we plan to build over the next two years.\n\nIn addition, it includes approximately 1,800 megawatts under the SOBRA mechanism of our settlement agreement. Approximately 1,800 megawatts of solar together community solar projects that we expect to construct over the next four years, as well as roughly 4,700 megawatts of additional solar after 2025 that is subject to approval by the Florida Public Service Commission.\n\nFPL continues to deliver what is one of the largest ever solar expansions in the U.S.\n\nCompared to current levels, the recommended plan projects an approximately 65% increase in zero carbon emission electricity produced by the FPL system over the next decade, largely as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30 by 30 plan, which we now expect to complete by 2025 and the solar additions that I previously mentioned.\n\nThis projected increase in zero carbon emissions generation is significant for a utility system of our size, especially when considering that our total amount of energy delivered in 2031 is expected to be nearly 10 percentage points higher through customer growth and increased adoption of electric vehicles.\n\nOur green hydrogen pilot program plans are also reiterated in the site plan.\n\nAs we previously discussed, we intend to build an approximately 25 megawatt electrolysis system at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that will be powered entirely by solar energy from a nearby site.\n\nThe pilot is designed to test, in practice, the concept of replacing natural gas with green hydrogen as fuel for combined cycle unit use.\n\nThe pilot project is expected to be to guide the way for future use of hydrogen as a fuel source across FPL's fleet of highly efficient combined cycle units, thus lowering or eliminating carbon emissions from FPL's fleet in the future.\n\nThis pilot project is projected to go into service in late 2023.\n\nNotably, our as-file 10-year site plan recommends a total expected deployment of approximately 3,200 megawatts of new battery storage capacity by 2031.\n\nIncluded in this toll is approximately 1,400 megawatts of incremental battery storage to enhance readiness and reliability for our customers during potential extreme weather events.\n\nWe also plan to make other smart capital investments for winterization efforts designed to support potential increased customer load during extreme winter temperature conditions, while also providing additional day-to-day reliability benefits for customers.\n\nA hallmark of our culture is taking every opportunity to learn from events that happen in our industry, not just those that directly affect FPL, to ensure we continue to deliver the best possible value to our customers.\n\nOur planned targeted investments for winterization were identified as a result of our detailed assessment of our fleet following winter storm Uri last year that affected Texas and much of the South.\n\nWe will provide additional detail on these programs and other capital initiatives at our June Investor Conference.\n\nThe Florida economy remains healthy and Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the U.S.\n\nFlorida's job market continues to show healthy results with more than 700,000 new private sector jobs added over the last year, and Florida's labor force participation rate is up nearly 2 percent year over year.\n\nOther positive economic data across the state include the continued strength of Florida's real estate market, with a three month moving average for new housing permits up nearly 20% year over year.\n\nSPL's average number of customers increased by more than 91,000 or 1.6% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth.\n\nFPL's first quarter retail sales increased 2.6% from the prior year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 0.7% of this increase can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer.\n\nOn a weather-normalized basis, first-quarter retail sales increased 1.9 percent with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably.\n\nEnergy Resources reported a first quarter 2022 gap loss of approximately $1.5 billion or $0.76 per share.\n\nadjusted earnings for the first quarter were $628 million or $0.32 per share up $0.02 versus the prior comparable period.\n\nThe effect of the mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between energy resources, first-quarter gap, and adjusted earnings results.\n\nAs a reminder, this quarter's GAP results were also impacted by the ride-off of our remaining investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings.\n\nContributions from new investments were roughly flat year over year while our existing generation and storage assets added five cents per share due to favorable wind resource and the absence of winter storm URI impact.\n\nThe contribution from our customer supply and trading business decreased by $0.02 per share, and next-era energy transmission increased results by $0.01 per share year over year.\n\nThe comparative contribution from our gas infrastructure business decreased results by $0.02 per share following favorable performance in the first quarter of last year during Winter Storm Uri.\n\nall other impacts were roughly flat versus 2021.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, energy resources had another strong quarter of origination which is reflective of our ability to continue leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver clean energy solutions to meet the ongoing market demand for renewables.\n\nSince the last call, we added approximately 1,200 net megawatts of wind projects for 2022, 2023, and 2024 commercial operation dates to our backlog.\n\nOur backlog additions also include approximately 440 megawatts of solar projects and approximately 130 megawatts of battery storage projects.\n\nWith more than two and a half years remaining before the end of 2024, we have now signed more than 85% of the megawatts needed to realize the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectation ranges.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated a review of anti-dumping and countervailing duty circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from four Southeast Asian countries, which in recent years sourced over 80 percent of all solar panel imports into the United States.\n\nAs we recently highlighted, we are disappointed by the Commerce Department's decision to conduct this investigation.\n\nWe believe the Commerce Department already settled this issue when it concluded in 2012 that the process of converting solar wafers into electricity-producing solar cells is technologically sophisticated and the most capital-intensive part of the solar panel manufacturing process.\n\nAnd when that occurs outside of China, the cells are not subject to the 2012 anti-dumping and countervailing duties applicable to Chinese solar cell imports.\n\nThe Commerce Department's later rulings in 2014, 2020, and 2021 are consistent with this and have been relied upon by the solar industry as it continued to invest billions of dollars in new solar generating facilities in the United States over this period.\n\nIn light of these four prior rulings, the reliance on them by the industry and the substantial technologically sophisticated processing that occurs in the Southeast Asian countries, we believe it will be difficult for the Commerce Department to conclude under its circumvention standards that circumvention of the 2012 tariffs is actually occurring.\n\nIf the Commerce Department were to find circumvention in the current investigation, we believe it would be unwinding a decade of consistent trade practice across the past three administrations, including the current administration just last year.\n\nWe believe such a decision would create significant price uncertainty as additional tariffs on panels from the four Southeast Asian countries would likely remain unknown until close to 2025, as final tariff amounts are not determined for about two years after the year of importation.\n\nThis price uncertainty would likely result in the unattended consequence of U.S. solar panel supply once again being sourced significantly from China, because the tariffs applicable to imports from China are more certain based on 10 years of assessed duty history.\n\nUS solar panel assemblers are, for the most part, out of solar panels through 2024 and even at full capacity are only capable of serving 10 to 20 percent of the US solar panel demand in the first place.\n\nShould also be noted that nearly all of the large domestic solar panel assemblers in the U.S. do not support the efforts behind the circumvention claim or the Commerce Department's decision to investigate as they also primarily rely on imported cells from Southeast Asia to produce their panels in the United States.\n\nAnd all of the uncertainty from the investigation is occurring at a time when natural gas, coal, and oil prices have increased dramatically, leaving solar and storage as one of the few ways to alleviate inflationary pressures on electricity prices.\n\nFor these reasons, among others, we are optimistic that the investigation will ultimately be resolved favorably, and the Commerce Department will conclude not to impose additional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on sales and panels sourced from the Southeast Asian countries.\n\nWe believe that Nexera Energy is as well positioned as any company in the industry to manage these issues.\n\nHowever, given that a number of suppliers are not expected to ship panels to the U.S. until the Commerce Department makes a preliminary determination as late as August .\n\nWe continue to expect some of our solar and storage projects may be adversely impacted by this delay.\n\nWe are working closely with our suppliers and customers to assess the potential impacts of this investigation and are optimistic about our ability to arrive at acceptable mitigation measures.\n\nBased on what we know today, we believe that approximately 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts of our expected 2022 solar and storage build may shift from 2022 to 2023.\n\nDespite the delay, given our competitive advantages, including the strength of our supplier relationships and contracts, we remain comfortable with our current development expectations for wind, solar, and storage, which are to build roughly 23 to 30 gigawatts over the four-year period from 2021 through the end of 2024.\n\nWe run a diversified business at Energy Resources that includes multiple renewable energy technologies and provides a natural hedge against temporary disruptions, like the one our industry is currently experiencing.\n\nIn fact, in light of the uncertainty in the solar supply chain, we believe renewable demand will likely temporarily shift, in part, from solar to wind, and we believe energy resources has terrific competitive advantages in wind development. The accompanying slide provides an overview of the future of the solar system.\n\nFinally, during the quarter, Nexera Energy Transmission, along with its partners, completed the construction of the East-West TIE Transmission Line project.\n\nThe 450-kilometer, 230-kilovolt transmission line runs from Wawa to Thunder Bay, Ontario and is expected to address long-standing regional transmission constraints, thereby increasing much needed access to energy to support new economic growth in the region for years to come.\n\nTurning now to the Consolidated Results for NexEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2022, GapNet loss attributable to NexEra Energy were $450 million or $0.23 per share.\n\nNext, there are Energy's 2022 First Quarter Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS, where approximately $1.46 billion and $0.74 per share respectively.\n\nadjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment were roughly flat year over year.\n\nOur long-term financial expectations, which we increase and extended earlier this year through 2025, remain unchanged.\n\nFor 2022, Nexera Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85.\n\nFor 2023 through 2025, Nexera Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range.\n\nNext-Area Energy is in a strong position to meet its financial expectations through 2025, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit rating.\n\nA big part of Nexera Energy's culture is a focus on continuous improvement and productivity.\n\nTo that end, we are currently wrapping up our company-wide productivity initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call Project Velocity.\n\nProject Velocity built upon the success of Project Momentum and Project Accelerate, which were launched in 2013 and 2017, respectively.\n\nThe employee generated ideas implemented through Project Momentum and Project Accelerate are projected to deliver more than $1.8 billion in average annual run rate savings first or cost projections just 10 years ago.\n\nIn fact, the ideas generated this year in project velocity alone are expected to reach roughly $400 million in additional run rate efficiencies in the next few years, representing the largest identified O&M cost savings in the history of these programs.\n\nThis result is another example of the strength of our culture and team and highlights our continued focus on productivity and our team's willingness to embrace innovation and leverage technology.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2025, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cashflow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range.\n\nWe also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base.\n\nAs always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.\n\nLet me now turn to next-era energy partners which delivered solid first-quarter results with year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA of more than 16% driven primarily by contributions from the approximately 2,400 megawatts of renewables and storage added during 2021.\n\nYesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of 73.25 cents per common unit or $2.93 cents per common unit on an annualized basis up approximately 15% from a year earlier.\n\nInclusive of this increase, next-air energy partners has grown as LP distributions per unit by more than 290 percent since the IPO.\n\nFurther building upon that strength, Nexera Energy Partners today is announcing that it is entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 67% interest in an approximately 230 megawatt 4-hour battery storage facility in California that is fully contracted with an investment grade counterparty for 15 years.\n\nThe acquisition will further diversify NexEra Energy Partners' existing portfolio with the addition of another battery storage project and is an excellent complement to NexEra Energy Partners' existing operation.\n\nNext, Air Energy Partners expects to acquire the project interest for approximately $191 million, subject to closing adjustments, which is expected to be funded with existing debt capacity.\n\nNext-era energy partner's share of the asset's equity financing is estimated to be approximately $80 million at the time of closing.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $30 to $35 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $13 to $18 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2022.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close later this year upon the project reaching its commercial operation date and supports Nexera Energy's partners Projected, Adjusted EBITDA and CASH available for distribution growth in 2022.\n\nFinally, next-era energy partners recently closed on a transaction to sell an approximately 156-mile gas pipeline from its existing port of Forleo for a total consideration of approximately $203 million to a third party.\n\nThe cell price of the pipeline represents an attractive and a creative EBITDA multiple and further enhances the renewable energy profile of NexEra Energy Parts.\n\nWe are pleased with this transaction and look forward to redeploying the proceeds into a creative renewable energy assets like the battery storage acquisition from energy resources that I just mentioned to support NextEra Energy Partners long-term distribution growth expectations.\n\nTurning to the detailed results, Nexera Energy Partners' first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $412 million, and cash available for distribution was $169 million.\n\nNew projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed in the second half of 2021, contributed approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA and $25 million of cash available for distribution.\n\nThe adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution, contribution, existing projects declined $9 million and $29 million respectively versus the prior year comparable quarter.\n\nFable performance at existing projects drove an increase in adjusted EBITDA contributions of approximately $46 million year-over-year, which was more than offset by the absence of approximately $55 million in benefits realized during last February's winter storm year.\n\nexcluding the positive impact of winter storm URI from last year's first quarter results. This quarter's adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up nearly 38 percent and 31 percent respectively year over year.\n\nCash available for distribution was also impacted by the timing of pay-go payments.\n\nWind resource for the first quarter of 2022 was 108% of the long-term average, versus 98% in the first quarter of 2021. Additional details are shown\n\nNext-year energy partners continue to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2022, to be in the ranges of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and $675 million to $765 million, respectively.\n\nAs a reminder, year-end 2022 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense.\n\nAs always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.\n\nFrom a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12-15% growth per year in LP distributions, as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024.\n\nWe do not expect the recent solar supply chain disruption to impact our ability to deliver on these expectations.\n\nWe expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit.\n\nWe also continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12 to 15 percent while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80 percent range.\n\nIn summary, both Nexera Energy and Nexera Energy partners are benefiting from our history of strong execution that has positioned us well to capitalize on the terrific growth opportunities available to us across our business.\n\nWe look forward to sharing more detail with you on our growth plans for both Next Air Energy and Next Air Energy partners at our Investor Conference in New York on June 14th.\n\nBefore taking your questions, I'd like to turn the call over to John Ketchum. Thank you, Kirk.\n\nI am excited for the opportunity to talk to you in my new role. Since we announced our planned leadership succession in January , we have heard from many of our shareholders and industry analysts.\n\nSeveral of you have asked whether you should expect any changes in strategy under a new CEO .\n\nThe short answer is that I expect our strategy to be consistent with how we have grown the company over the past several decades.\n\nthat we will continue to adapt and evolve our strategy to meet increasing customer expectations to leverage new\n\nand to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy.\n\nour industry and our country to embrace low-cost renewable energy like never before.\n\nWe need to create more jobs, not less, and combat the impacts of higher inflation, higher oil and natural gas prices, and a rising electricity demand by supporting, not stymying, solar and storage development.\n\nOur strategy going forward is to pull down on our core business.\n\nAt FPL, we expect one of the highest population growth rates of any state in the nation to continue.\n\nIn fact, at our current rate of organic customer growth, FPL would add a customer base the size of gold power roughly every five years.\n\nFPL's undergrounding program is just getting started.\n\nAnd we have visibility to billions of dollars in capital investment for the next several decades to continue hardening and strengthening the grid as we deliver industry-leading reliability to our customers.\n\nAnd we are also just getting started at decarbonizing the generation fleet at FPL as only about 5% of our generation at FPL is currently produced by renewable energy.\n\nI believe that FPL already is the best utility in the nation.\n\nAnd yet, we see significant cost reduction and incremental capital investment opportunities at FPL over the next several decades that can further improve our industry-leading customer value proposition by delivering clean, low-cost energy solutions for Florida customers.\n\nOur strategy also entails doubling down on our core and energy resources.\n\nWe intend to build more wind, more solar, and more battery stores than anybody else in this country year in and year out, regardless of the headwinds or tailwinds in any given year.\n\nWe believe that we have the competitive advantages to win under any market condition.\n\nAnd with recent technological advancements in green hydrogen and other forms of long-term storage, we see a total addressable market in this country for renewables, storage, and transmission of around $8 trillion through 2015.\n\nWe have said this before and we believe it is never more true than it is today. The opportunity set for renewable energy in this country continues to expand rapidly. And we believe energy resources is in a terrific position for continued industry leadership and for long-term growth for shareholders.\n\nBoth FPL and Energy Resources have multiple ways to grow and each business continues to push the other to be even better.\n\nAs FPL grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in Florida.\n\nAs energy resources grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value and other markets across the country.\n\nOperational excellence is a competitive advantage for us across both businesses. So is development and construction expertise.\n\nSo is financial discipline. Both businesses are constantly implementing new technology.\n\nBoth businesses are constantly finding ways to do things more officially and to improve our cost position.\n\nAs Kirk mentioned, this year our employees generated about 900 individual ideas translating into roughly $400 million in additional run rate O&M savings across the enterprise through project velocity. Our best performance ever after 10 years of pursuing O&M improvement in this employee-driven annual exercise.\n\nOur strategy at Next Air Energy is to continue to do what we have done well, only better and bigger as new market opportunities present themselves.\n\nOur strategy at next-era energy partners is much the same.\n\nThe partnership will double down on what we have done well since our IPO in 2014. We expect to continue delivering LP distribution growth that is already best in class. We plan to continue to pursue growth in three ways, by acquiring assets from energy resources, by acquiring assets from third parties, and by additional organic capital investments in the assets we own as the portfolio grows over time.\n\nYet as at next-era energy, it is the future of the partnership and its long-term growth visibility that is most exciting to us.\n\nSimply put, we believe that what is good for next-era energy tends to be good for next-era energy partners, and what is good for decarbonization of the U.S. economy is going to be terrific for shareholders of next-era energy, as well as for unit holders of next-era energy partners.\n\nWe will have more to share about our long-term growth prospects at both companies at our investor conference in June . I'd like to close by once again thanking you.\n\nIn addition to the 900 project velocity ideas I mentioned earlier, last week we held our annual team competition for the highest quality and innovation award at our company.\n\nfollowed by our Employee Expo in which 56 teams were featured.\n\nI can tell you that as impressive as our track record has been over the last 30 plus years, our future is even brighter.\n\nOur team continues to impress with their creativity, analytical abilities, innovation, customer focus, and the will\n\nI truly believe that we have the best team in the industry. I believe this team can extend our long-term track record of outperformance, and I believe this is the team that can and will lead the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy.\n\nThank you for your continued support of our company, and I now look forward to taking your questions.\n\nTo ask a question, you're going to press star then 1 on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your hands before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then 2.\n\nOur first question will come from Steve Sliceman with Wolf Research. You may now go ahead.\n\nYeah, hi. Good morning. Thank you. And John Kirk, congrats on your new roles.\n\nyou bet uh... quirk just uh...\n\nThe ADCVD is obviously an important issue, and you made some really interesting comments here, so my questions are going to focus on that.\n\nThe comment about the tariffs not being known if they decided to go that route till 2025.\n\nThat would seem to be incredibly disruptive to the sector, so just could you just talk about like how that process works and why to actually set the tariffs so better understand why it would be that long?\n\nYes Steve, let me go ahead and take that, this is John speaking.\n\nThat's one of the things that we're pointing out to the Commerce Department is that when they establish tariffs, say they come up with a final determination of January of 2023.\n\nTheir practice has always been to impose the tariffs and calculate the actual amounts and release those.\n\ntwo years later. So those tariffs would not be known until the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAnd so what the industry would be forced to do\n\nis actually go back and buy panels from China because the tariffs in China are known. And China is the only country in the world that would have panels available to sell because as we said,\n\nThe U.S. panel manufacturing industry, which is incredibly small, again, even at full capacity, it only has the ability to satisfy 10 to 20 percent of the entire U.S. demand. The U.S. industry has sold out until 2025.\n\nAnd if you don't know what the tariff rates are in Southeast Asia,\n\nIt forces you back to China, where the terrorists are known and have been known for the last 10 years, which is an absolutely perverse outcome, an outrageous outcome, quite frankly. And one we intend to make sure that the Commerce Department clearly understands, because that's an unintended consequence that I don't think anybody wants. And the other point that goes along with it is, if we're trying to be tough on trade, we're not. China is not the one.\n\nWho pays the price here are American companies, American workers, the American consumer that pays higher electricity costs than they ever have before in a rapidly increasing natural gas price environment, oil prices, coal prices. Solar is actually deflationary.\n\nand you actually reward the Chinese who then get the cell panels at the inflated rate. So, that makes absolutely no sense at all. When you look at our company and our business, we are in, you know, I think, a different position than the rest of the industry is while all those things, you know, are not good for the industry. I think our company is in a position to be able to manage these risks fortunately.\n\nWe have strong contracts in place. We do have a global supply chain and sourcing capability that gives us options that others don't. But back to the strength of our contracts, I think that gives us the ability that others might not have to continue sourcing from our existing supply base even in South Korea without, or I mean in Southeast Asia even without those tariff amounts being fully known. But\n\nThe problem that this creates with that two year delay in the 2025, if Build Back Better doesn't get passed or some form of reconciliation, you're also on the ITC clock that is expiring over that same period of time. So you have to have an ability to go source those panels, find them someplace else to get your projects built. Again,\n\nWe're confident in our ability to be able to do that just given the strength of our contracts. That's why, and we're also optimistic that the outcome here is so outrageous and so ludicrous that the commerce\n\nyou know won't possibly based on their four prior rulings over the last decade twenty twelve\n\n2020, and in 2021, where this exact question has been asked and answered by three separate administrations, including this one, how can you possibly pull the rug out from under the industry? It makes absolutely no sense.\n\nforce business back to China, which is what you were trying to prevent in the first\n\nThat's super helpful. Just a couple quick follow-ups on the same issue, which is, first, given everything\n\nwhy did they initiate this in the first place? Did they not understand the implications? Second, are you seeing any better movement as a result of what's already happened to build back better? And then the last one is just in that worst case event that we have to wait till the end of the session.\n\n2025 to work this out and you reiterated, you know, back a month ago that even with this review confidence in the high end of the targets, does that include that scenario?\n\ntake those in order. So first of all, why did they take the investigation?\n\nyou know you saw what happened in October they had they had a similar you know uh... filing that was made around circumvention this to the same department of commerce decided not to take that up in the same year that they ruled that making cells of panels outside of china was okay\n\nhere in 22 I think\n\nthey looked at it and said okay well this is the second one in a row\n\nLet's take on the investigation. We don't think the investigation itself, if we just do a little bit more fact finding, will actually have an impact on the industry. They were wrong. It does.\n\nWe told them it would and you can see it in our own portfolio with 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts potentially being moved into 2023. Luckily, we have enough cushion and enough other things that we can do where it doesn't impact our financial expectations. That move and other companies in the industry are not that fortunate. And so our hope is that they look at the information. We don't think the information has changed.\n\nand they rely on the prior four decisions from 2012, 2014, 2020, and 2021 to follow consistent trade practice rather than retroactively changing the rules.\n\nforeign industry that has been playing by the rules for the last decade. That would make absolutely no sense in an environment where you have inflation increasing commodity prices and the only deflationary product.\n\nand source of generation that also achieves clean energy goals and creates a ton of American jobs.\n\nyour stymine rather than helping. So that's that's\n\nThe second question I think you had was on, you know, where are we on BBB? So look, if you're really looking at, if you look at BBB and the current environment, now is the time to move forward on it.\n\ngiven the inflationary pressures on energy prices, now is the time to double down on renewables, now is the time to create real manufacturing incentives if you wanna redomesticate the supply chain to the US, which is really, really small right now.\n\nAnd if you want to create those manufacturing incentives, do it with a carrot rather than a stick so we can achieve our clean energy goals over time. So that gives us some optimism, number one, going in. Second, I think there's motivation going into the midterms to get our energy policy right, particularly our clean energy policy.\n\nright and you know I think I think the Democrats do need a win you know going into these midterms. The structure is much the same so there wouldn't we're not contemplating a large change in structure. Both sides are talking. I think for the first time in a while we have the Supreme Court nomination behind us.\n\ntime is, you know, something we got to work with, the reconciliation for this year expires at the end of September , so we've really got to try to get something moving forward before the August resource or recess, but, you know, remain optimistic that we will be able to get\n\nYou know that moving forward and if it does a much skinnier down package that I would expect to look like a Focus really just on climate and clean air\n\nand prescription drugs and that would be, I think, a smaller package that might be able to\n\nto move forward, but I think at the same time, there's gonna have to be some open mindedness from the progressives, which I think we are seeing.\n\nCenter Mansions made no secret that we need pipeline infrastructure in this country, projects like MVP, for example, and more of an all-of-the-above approach to tackling this issue. And I think there is a rational outcome there that would make sense for all parties involved.\n\nIf we have to wait until 2025, you know, what's the impact on our long-term expectations? Again, we have strong contracts, we have a global supply chain capability, you know, we would not, you know, based on what we know today expect any changes to our long-term financial expectations.\n\nOur next question will come from Julian de Moreland Smith with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\n\nHey, good morning team, thanks for the time and congrats again on the promotion to you guys.\n\nGood morning. So I just want to come back to the earnings impact on you guys. I certainly appreciate the macro that you guys described here, but can you speak more specifically to the earnings offsets?\n\nnot just in 22, but especially 23 and 24, given that the timing of these renewable and services tends to impact the subsequent year more so.\n\nAnd then if I'm hearing you right, again, I know you keep talking about Chinese imports, but is that the answer here in lieu of having clarity effectively? And this is a matter of timing and pivoting into a Chinese supply solution in some form or another, or at least creating your own domestic supply rapidly. Just clearly, we're not going to sit here until 25, just want to get some understanding as to what the earnings mitigation is in the near term and what that answer is in 23, 24.\n\nOkay, Julian. Thank you for the question. In terms of the way we're thinking about being able to manage this and continue to still have the confidence to reaffirm our adjusted earnings expectations and reiterate that we would be disappointed if we\n\nWe're not able to deliver financial results at or near the high end of the range. Look, we're a very large company with a diverse set of growth drivers. FPL is performing really well. We have great visibility into the next four years with the settlement.\n\nWe run the business with a lot of financial discipline and build a conservative financial plan.\n\nWe, as we discussed today, continue to find ways to run the business more efficiently and have identified through the project velocity over $400 million of run rate savings that we expect to be able to receive over the next few years.\n\nWhen we add all that up and particularly think about how conservatively we are with the way we structure our plan, we feel very comfortable in being able to continue to deliver on our financial expectations.\n\nYeah, and then I'll, Julian, I'll take the last piece on the, I think what I understood your question would be on the supply chain. So that's the other reason why we don't think any action is required by the Department of Commerce today because the supply chain is already changing for the entire industry. Polysilicon is now being sourced out of Germany, it's being sourced out of the United States.\n\nSuppliers are quickly becoming more vertically integrated and moving their ingot and wafer producing capabilities outside of China where cells and modules are already made.\n\nAnd that will be, you know, a sourcing strategy that will be followed by us and much of the industry going forward, including I think by the US, the so-called US panel manufacturers. Because one thing I want to make sure people understand, as I said before, at full capacity the US panel manufacturers can satisfy only 10% to 20% of US demand, but when they make panels in the US.\n\nThey're not really making panels in the U.S. They're importing all of the products that go into a panel from outside the U.S., mainly from the Southeast Asian countries. And they have these small assembly shops in the U.S. that employ a few hundred people that go ahead and just put it together and then they stamp the panel made in the U.S.A. when it really is.\n\nAnd that's one of the frustrating things that we're tackling here, but we are, you know, again, as I said, moving the supply chain outside of China and the U.S. panel manufacturers, I assume, will be looking at some more things for their continued reliance on imports as they think about their strategy going forward as well.\n\nGot it. And just on your earnings impact, it sounds like this is about accelerating velocity, basically accelerating cost savings into the near term to offsets of the impacts, as well as maybe some FPL drivers, rather than saying we're going to do more wind versus what the plan is kind of in the near term sense. And then actually, if you can speak to the FPL piece just on CAPEX changes versus the 10K, it seems like the range is a little bit lower, but again, I'll let you respond holistically.\n\nSo, you know, on the first piece of your question, cost savings is one piece of it. We have cost savings.\n\nWe run the business very conservatively. We have cushion in the plan.\n\nWe expect to be okay. Kirk, I'll let you take the FPL question.\n\nAs we've thought about the CapEx plan at FPL, as we discussed on the call today, the expectation is...\n\nFor this year is roughly $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion of capital that we plan to deploy. We also laid out in the discussion around the 10-year site plan what we're thinking in terms of\n\nsolar that we're going to add to the system. We feel very good about the the capital program that we have at FPL over the next four years in not just generation but as well as T&D infrastructure, hardening and undergrounding. So we have we have a very good plan there at FPL.\n\nAlso, I think it's important to keep in mind with respect to FPL as we discussed in the prepared remarks as well. We are continuing to see just significant growth at FPL, organic growth in terms of people coming to Florida.\n\nAt 91,000 additional customers added, and roughly four or five years, we're going to add the size of golf to the system. And that's going to continue to provide us with CapEx opportunities as well.\n\nOur next questions will come from Shah Pariza with Guggenheim Partners. You may now go ahead.\n\nHey, good morning guys, good morning Kirk, John . Good morning.\n\nJust on the near the 23-24 signed contracts, I mean obviously they're up 11 gigs so you're getting close to the target range for those years which could elude, you know, obviously you got delivering within your 24 plan. But I just, I want to get a little bit of a sense here. If the tail risks are longer dated, right, could we see more projects shifts than what you kind of\n\nin the footnote, maybe into 24 and beyond, and if so, is there a point in time, you know, John , you start shifting into more wind from solar and storage. I mean, obviously, wind's very competitive, the returns aren't great, but I would think several players are going to follow in similar footsteps there. So I guess how to think about the profile of the backlog if this is more longer dated and we don't get this ability.\n\nSure, I'll take that. The first point that I would make is that this is good for the wind business. I think you can see that from the results of our origination activity this quarter. Even to the extent we might see some shifting solar from 22 to 23 or 23 to 24, we might\n\nis coming online even faster and remember the development cycle for wind and the origination activity for wind is much shorter. We can originate a wind project and have it built in 10 months and so to the extent you might see\n\nsome solar activity drop off, and really, again, I view this as a 22 and a 23 issue.\n\nThe beauty of it is you have wind to step in at its place and that's an area where we have significant competitive advantages and being able to sell 23 wind at a 80% PTC, we can be extremely competitive in the pricing there and in the offering and\n\nYou know, it provides us with, I think, a mitigation measure on top of the strong supplier contracts that we already have on the solar side that others in the industry don't have. It's great to have a diversified business.\n\nto be able to fall back on and that's why we feel good about our financial expectations.",
    "content2": "Got it. And then just maybe just shifting the FPL. I mean, you guys put out plans for additional winterization resiliency, 3200 megawatts of...\n\nNew storage 231 the solar programs are kind of well-defined, and I know we talked about Potential delays on the nearest side, but do you see opportunities? You know conversely to maybe accelerate some of that solar capex on the regulated side, especially as gas costs\n\nput a lot of pressure on affordability and certainly help from an LCOE comparability. So could we see faster maybe solar deployment on the regulated side to reduce what you're seeing in the commodity curves?\n\nYeah, I think, you know, first of all, you know, I want to say the CapEx is actually up at at FPL just back to, I think it was Julian's earlier, earlier question, undergrounding is a piece of that's really important. We get our undergrounding in service, you know, on time and on budget. We continue to look to ways to shift that to the left. And, you know, look, as we are in an increasing natural gas price environment, the right answer for Florida customers.\n\nCertainly is to evaluate and look at trying to get more renewables online in Florida faster It's a hedge against rising Natural gas prices in the state and it's a hedge for the country, which is another reason why as I've said a couple times already What what's happening is quite silly\n\nGot it, so there's an opportunity. This is Eric's logic. The only thing that would add is the 10-year site plan we just filed gives you a pretty good roadmap of future opportunities. We are going to be adding a lot more solar into the system pending of PhD's approval.\n\nand demand for solar together continues to remain very, very strong. And so we're going to be continuing to look at, you know, the next round for solar together after the current one we just filed for. So there's going to be additional opportunities. But again, this is about.\n\nsmartly deploying capital and doing the right thing for customers for the long term.\n\ngot it and Eric that those opportunities could be incremental right to the current.\n\nAbsolutely. Got it. And then just really lastly, and it's unrelated to what we're talking about, but John , just on the JEA case, again, the federal case against a couple of executives, I know next era and FPL were subpoenaed, is there any details you can provide there, because we do get some questions on that from time to time.\n\nYeah, let me just give a little bit of background there. We were asked a while back to provide some documentation and connection with that matter, which we did. We cooperated in full. We were told and have been told we are not a target of the investigation. And I think the article you're referring to, the reporter just got it flat out wrong. We have not been speaking.\n\nPerfect, as a witness in that matter. Okay, great. That's what I wanted to clarify. Congrats, John and Kirk, on the promotions.\n\nOur next question will come from Durgus Chupra with Evercore ISI. You may now go ahead.\n\nGood morning, David. Thank you for squeezing me in and taking my question here. Just maybe, good morning, Kirk. Just maybe can I just a little bit more granular on the, as we get towards the sort of the preliminary ruling here in late August on the solar panel investigation. What are the key steps that we should be watching for? And what is your and other industry sort of players involvement going to be in that process?\n\nSo, the way to think about the process is right now the DOC has provided questionnaires to two different groups.\n\nThose questionnaires are being completed. I believe they're due this week for some. I believe others had requested some extinctions and maybe have been granted. Once they have all that information, then the groups that are, that have standing are also allowed to weigh in on the matter. We do have standing in the case, so we will be weighing in on this as well. And then the DOC has all that information and reviews, essentially reviews the data and then reaches.\n\ntheir preliminary determination, which is expected to happen by late August .\n\nAll right, thank you, Karkin, and maybe just one quick one and see if you'll give this information. If not, that's okay, because it's small. But can you maybe talk about the gas transaction, the gas pipeline sale, and what kind of multiple and even that contribution? I know it's small, so I don't know if you can share that information, I'll just follow up with IR.\n\nYeah, we're not going to share that information at this time, understand the reason for the question. I would just say as we included in the press release and the script, it was a very attractive and a creative EBITDA multiple.\n\nWe were very happy with it. Perfect. Thank you so much guys. I appreciate the time.\n\nOur next question will come from Steven Byrd with Morgan Stanley . You may now go ahead.\n\nOh, hi, it's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit to PPA pricing that you're seeing for new contracts, I guess, across wind, solar, and storage. Is there an approximate level that you would expect PPA prices to have to rise to absorb some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen? And at the end of the day, do you expect that to happen? Do you think they'll rise enough that you can protect your returns on incrementally new signed renewables contracts?\n\nSure, this is Rebecca and I'll take that question. You know, as a matter of practice, what we do with our customers and as we're approaching the market is factor in whatever the current latest pricing is, which is certainly what we're doing now in terms of where we think the market is.\n\nSo keep in mind that as we've talked about some pricing pressure, whether it's consistent with the comments that Kirk and John have talked about on the solar side or on the wind side, that it's against the backdrop of costs that have gone up, other alternative costs that have also gone up, whether it's oil or natural gas, overall power prices in the marketplace. And so there is still a significant incentive for our customers to procure renewable energy.\n\nYou know, a lot of folks were caught off guard by this decision, surprised, you know, for all the reasons that John and Kirk highlighted, that the Department of Commerce would have taken this step, and all of us would like to see the uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible and as favorably as possible.\n\nso that our customers can move forward with deploying solar. We'll talk more about where we see the market in terms of pricing and specifically pricing versus the alternatives at the investor conference. But again, the key takeaway from my perspective is they remain very attractive for customers.\n\nGreat, thanks. That's helpful color. And I was just wondering, just on the pace of new signings, has that slowed down significantly since this investigation started, and would the preliminary determination potentially be a bit of a relief valve, or could it take longer than that to start to maybe kickstart the project signing?\n\nYeah, I'm always cautious to say anything about a given quarter's signings, because I think sometimes there's too much weight put on them, sometimes too little. But as a kind of an obvious point, contract signings were terrific this quarter, and I'm really proud of the execution of the team and it very much reflects a lot of interest from customers that has not waned at all.\n\nSo we're very excited about the opportunities. Nothing has changed in terms of the long-term view about excitement for renewables. They remain very attractive and as John highlighted, they should be deflationary. As in this uncertainty and relative to the alternatives, this is a great option for customers and we couldn't be more excited about the future. Great.\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.\nAs a reminder, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power continued as a separate reportable segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation, when we refer to FPL, we are referring to Florida Power & Light, excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames L. Robo\n\nChairman & CEO, NextEra Energy Partners, LP\n\nThanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had an outstanding year in 2021 and are well positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunities that lie ahead. NextEra Energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally, and we executed the largest capital program in our history. Investing approximately $16 billion in American Energy infrastructure in 2021, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all industries.\nContinuing our long track record of delivering value for shareholders, NextEra Energy achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.55, up more than 10% from 2020. Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of approximately 9%, which is the highest among all top 10 U.S. power companies who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of roughly 3% over the same period.\nAmid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2021, we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index in terms of total shareholder return on a 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and quadrupled the average total shareholder return of the index.\nOver the same period, we've outperformed 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of providing growth and value creation opportunities for our shareholders, and we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.\nAt FPL, net income increased nearly 11% year-over-year while continuing to deliver on its commitment to making smart, long-term investments in innovative technology, clean energy and strengthening our electric grid for the benefit of our customers. We were pleased the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously approved the settlement agreement in October, an agreement, which we believe is a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case. The 2021 settlement agreement supports continued smart capital investments, including the largest solar build-out by a utility in the U.S. while keeping FPL's typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through the end of 2025.\nFor customers in Northwest Florida, typical customer bills are projected to decline over the next 4 years. Among the long-term infrastructure investments anticipated in the new agreement, new solar generation is expected to grow through the expanded SolarTogether community solar program which is expected to more than double over the next 4 years as well as through new base rate solar generation, including the nearly 1,800 megawatts to be recovered under solar base rate adjustment, or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations in 2024 and 2025.\nIn total, our current solar build-out expectations are for approximately 4,800 megawatts of new solar over the term of the settlement agreement. In early 2019, FPL announced its groundbreaking role to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030. With the anticipated solar additions approved under the settlement agreement, I am pleased to announce that we now expect to reach this milestone by 2025, 5 years earlier than previously anticipated.\nIncluding the solar additions anticipated through 2025, this ambitious 30 by 30 initiative is expected to have generated approximately $2.5 billion in fuel cost savings for customers, and created more than 20,000 construction jobs while supporting the Florida economy with more than $700 million in property taxes over the life of the assets.\nDuring 2021, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing another 671 megawatts of cost-effective solar and service, completing the first roughly 1,500 megawatt phase of our SolarTogether community solar program. Additionally, last month, we commissioned the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will allow our customers to benefit from low-cost solar energy even during times when the sun is not shining.\nFPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2021. And FPL was recognized for the sixth time in 7 years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Moreover, FPL was ranked #1 in both residential and business customer satisfaction in the Southern U.S. amongst large electric providers by J.D. Power in 2021, and we are completely committed to continuing to provide clean, affordable and reliable service to our customers for many years to come.\nEnergy Resources also had a terrific year in 2021, delivering adjusted earnings growth of 13% versus the prior year. The team also had an outstanding record year of renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 7,200 megawatts to our backlog during the year as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring in our nation's generation fleet.\nOur backlog additions have grown more than 20% compound annual growth rate since 2017, and we are well on our way to meeting our current development expectations for new signed contracts. With the significant additions to our backlog of signed contracts over the last year, we've now signed nearly 80% of the megawatts needed to realize in the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range, with significant time remaining to sign additional power purchase agreements.\nOur supply chain and engineering and construction teams also continued to execute in 2021, commissioning approximately 3,800 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, solar and storage projects. Over the past 2 years, Energy Resources has constructed more than 9,500 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of its execution expertise, even in the midst of a global pandemic and industry-wide supply chain disruptions.\nFinally, during 2021, NextEra Energy Transmission its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution by increasing net income by nearly 20% over its previous earnings contribution record in 2020.\nGrowth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the U.S. to support this transition to a low-cost, low-carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. We anticipate that NextEra Energy Transmission will continue to capitalize on the growing opportunity set to both deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment.\nThe tremendous execution in both the major businesses in recent years, including '21, gives us great visibility to the longer-term outlook of NextEra Energy. Let me start with our opportunity set, which I would not trade with anyone in our industry. At Florida Power & Light, the settlement agreement allows us to focus on operating the business efficiently, reliably and affordably for the benefit of our customers.\nUnder the new agreement, we expect our average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be between 8% and 9% over the 4-year term through 2025. When you put it all together, low bills, best-in-class reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile are what helped FPL provide what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the nation.\nAt Energy Resources, our outlook for new renewables and storage development remains as strong as ever, and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old inefficient forms of generation and into clean, reliable, low-cost renewables and storage.\nWe believe that the rapidly accelerating trend toward electrification and decarbonization of a broad range of sectors across the U.S. economy has significantly increased the total addressable market for new renewables and storage, even beyond our expectations just a few years ago and is now measured in trillions of dollars of capital investment opportunity in the coming decades.\nWe believe that Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to advance its market leadership position in this environment. We have been in the renewables business for more than 30 years, and have the experience, resources, balance sheet, talent and advanced data capabilities necessary to execute complex renewable energy generation and storage integration projects at scale. We believe we have an excellent opportunity set for continued growth ahead of us at Energy Resources, and we will further discuss our long-term plans for deploying renewables at both Energy Resources and Florida Power & Light and the associated impact to our overall emissions profile and future goals at our upcoming investor conference, which we plan to hold on June 14 in New York City.\nWith the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2022 and 2023, and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025.\nFor 2022, we are now expecting our adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85, up from our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75. For years 23 through 25, we expect to grow our adjusted earnings per share by roughly 6% to 8% per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share. For 2023, this translates to a new range of $2.93 to $3.08, up from our prior range of $2.77 to $297 million.\nOur new adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2024 are $3.13 to $3.33. And for 2025 are $3.35 to $3.60. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.\nIn summary, we continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in each of 2022, '23, '24 and 2025, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings.\nLet me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 30% in 2021, bringing its 2-year total unitholder return up to more than 72% and further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO in 2014.\nFor 2021, the NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by 15% year-over-year, and has now grown its distributions per unit by nearly 280% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 80% as of year-end 2021.\nNextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year of execution in '21, and we are increasing our year-end 2021 financial expectations to reflect this better-than-expected growth execution. NextEra Energy Partners delivered year-end run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in excess of our prior expectations, including delivering more than 13% year-over-year growth in run rate cash available for distribution at the midpoints. This execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2021.\nDuring the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,900 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. In addition, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed 2 acquisitions of renewable energy assets from third parties, adding nearly 500 megawatts of operating wind projects to its portfolio.\nThese transactions demonstrate NextEra Energy's ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources, low-cost sources of capital and our strong industry relationships to be successful in third-party acquisitions. The combination of a growing portfolio at Energy Resources and a growing set of opportunities to acquire renewables from third parties as well as significant organic growth opportunities, further supports the partnership's long-term growth visibility.\nNextEra Energy Partners also continued to demonstrate its ability to access attractive sources of capital to finance its growth investments, including executing on the lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in its history. The roughly $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing carries a low implied cash coupon to the investor and partially funded NextEra Energy Partners acquisition of a 50% interest in a renewables portfolio, consisting of approximately 2,520 megawatts of newly constructed or in construction renewables projects and approximately 115 megawatts of integrated battery storage.\nNextEra Energy Partners was able to demonstrate the benefits to LP unitholders of the convertible equity portfolio financing structure during the fourth quarter when the partnership exercised its right to purchase 100% of the outstanding minority equity interests in the portfolio of wind and solar assets, supporting its 2018 convertible equity portfolio financing.\nRelative to issuing the same amount of common equity in 2018 to fund our growth needs. This financing allowed us to reduce unit issuance by more than 50% and save more than $140 million or roughly 75% in nominal cash costs while retaining the more than 80% increase in the net unit price over the last 3 years.\nNextEra Energy Partners public float has increased approximately 50% since 2019. We believe our strategy of using low-cost convertible equity products to efficiently layer in common equity over time has created significant value for existing LP unitholders. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy's partners clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers LP unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years.\nFinally, I'd like to comment on some important organizational changes that we announced this morning. These changes are part of a long-term succession process undertaken by the Board and me over the better part of the last 6 years. Effective March 1, John Ketchum will price me as President and CEO of NextEra Energy. Rebecca will succeed John as President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources. Kirk Cruise, currently Vice President, Business Management for NextEra Energy Resources will succeed Rebecca as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; of NextEra Energy. John, Rebecca and Kirk will also be appointed to the respective roles at NextEra Energy Partners. In addition, Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company has been named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light.\nIt has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CEO for nearly 10 years. I'm as excited as I've ever been about the future prospects of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. A big part of a CEO's legacy is the new leader in the next-generation leadership team that follows. And I couldn't be more thrilled about turning over the CEO role of this great company to John. I know he will be as focused on creating value for you, our owners, as I have been over the last 2 decades. John has been an incredible partner to me and a senior leader in this company for more than 19 years, and I can think of no better person to succeed me as CEO. John's breadth of experience across all aspects of our company, including commercial, operational, financial and legal as well as the significant leadership capabilities and vision position him exceptionally well to lead NextEra Energy to even greater heights in the coming years.\nI also want to congratulate Rebecca, Eric and Kirk on their new roles. One of the defining characteristics of this company over the last 30 years has been the quality and strength of its leadership team, and I'm very proud of and excited for the team that will leave this company into the future. Most importantly, I want to thank my team and all our employees for all that they have done. Our team, the best in the business, has built this amazing company, and I can't thank them enough.\nAs the announcement mentioned, I'm going to remain as Executive Chairman for a transition period to support John in his new role. I will now turn the call over to John, who would like to make some remarks.\n\nJohn W. Ketchum\n\nPresident & CEO, NextEra Energy Resources, LLC\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I have been privileged to have worked with and learned from Jim during an incredible period of growth for our company, and I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this company in the years ahead. As CEO, I intend to remain intensely focused on delivering value for our shareholders and building upon our long track record of success.\nI believe there is no company better positioned to lead our country's energy transformation than NextEra Energy. And I am humbled by the opportunity to lead this team through such an exciting period for our company. I am fortunate to have a broad leadership team with the experience and capability that I, too, believe is the best in the industry.\nI am very excited to have Eric, Rebecca and Kirk take on these expanded and new roles in the company. They, along with our broader leadership team and all of our approximately 15,000 employees worked tirelessly every day to serve our customers in Florida and across North America.\nFinally, I wanted to take a moment to thank Jim for his exceptional leadership and friendship. Jim has been an unbelievable steward of this company over his nearly 10 years as CEO, growing the leading, most profitable electric utility and renewable energy company in North America. Our total shareholder return during Jim's tenure has been more than 500%, and it is great evidence of Jim's exceptional vision, leadership and commitment to excellence. I know I speak for all of our employees that we are deeply grateful for everything Jim has done for our company.\nLet me now turn it over to Rebecca for a more detailed review of our results.\n\nRebecca J. Kujawa\n\nCFO & Director, NextEra Energy Partners, LP\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $560 million or $0.28 per share, up $0.03 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2021, FPL reported net income of $2.94 billion or $1.49 per share, an increase of $0.14 per share versus 2020.\nRegulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2021, and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of nearly 11% for the full year. During the fourth quarter, net income was impacted by a number of factors, including an approximately $32 million pretax contribution to our charitable foundation that will allow it to continue to support the communities that we serve. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.6% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $137 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2021 balance of $460 million. As a reminder, our new 4-year settlement agreement became effective this month, and includes the flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, which is inclusive of $346 million in reserve amount that we previously anticipated to be remaining at year-end 2021 under FPL's now expired 2016 rate agreement.\nConsistent with the terms of the 2021 settlement agreement, half of the $114 million in excess reserve balance at year-end 2021 will be used to reduce our outstanding capital recovery asset balance, and the other half will increase FPL's storm reserve to offset future restoration costs.\nAs a reminder, the new agreement limits reserve amortization to $200 million in 2022, which we will treat as a limitation in any given quarter during the year. Given the historical shape of our customer usage, we typically use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year and reverse reserve amortization in the hotter summer months.\nWe currently expect FPL to initially earn below our target regulatory ROE in the early part of 2022. Although for the full year, we are targeting the upper end of the allowed range of 9.7% to 11.7%. As a result, we also expect FPL's earnings growth to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.\nOur overall capital program at Florida Power & Light is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and met our solar deployment objectives at both FPL and Gulf Power in 2021, including commissioning more than 800 megawatts of new solar across the combined system.\nBeyond solar, construction on the highly efficient roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget, as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date later this year. The North Florida Resiliency Connection remains on track to be in service by mid-2022.\nLet me now turn to Gulf Power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into FPL on January 1, 2021, but continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $60 million or $0.03 per share. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $271 million or $0.14 per share an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year.\nBase O&M reductions and investments in the business were the primary drivers of Gulf Power's approximately 14% year-over-year growth in net income. Gulf Power's capital expenditures for the full year were roughly $800 million, and its reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.25% for the 12 months ending December 2021.\nGiven that this is the last time we will be talking about Gulf Power's financial results, let me take a moment to summarize the team's execution over the past 3 years. Gulf Power has delivered significant improvements in all key financial and operational metrics, while meaningfully improving its customer value proposition. The execution of the NextEra Energy playbook at Gulf Power, which is focusing on reducing costs and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, has been a remarkable success.\nGulf Power has realized a nearly 40% reduction in O&M costs since the acquisition. Since 2018, Gulf Power improved service reliability by nearly 60%, and it was awarded national recognition for its outstanding reliability performance in the Southeast suburban and rural service area for the second year in a row in 2021. Over the same period, Gulf Power realized an approximately 60% improvement in safety among our employees who have worked tirelessly to help us execute on our plans.\nRegulatory capital employed has grown by approximately 16% compound annual growth rate since 2018. We have invested approximately $2.5 billion in long-term improvements to Gulf Power's existing system and generation fleet. As a result of our clean power modernization investments at Gulf Power, we have already delivered an approximately 25% reduction in CO2 emissions over the last 3 years, and we look forward to further expanding the opportunity for our customers to access clean, low-cost solar and storage in the years to come.\nThis high level of performance across the board could not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all of the Gulf Power employees. And I would like to thank all of our Florida Power & Light employees, old and new, for their relentless focus on reducing costs while improving reliability and safety over the past 3 years.\nExecution of the plans that we laid out at Gulf Power has generated great outcomes for our shareholders as well. Gulf Power's net income has grown by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19% since 2018, an outcome that was even better than our expectations when we announced the acquisition. Our performance with Gulf Power is a clear validation of our strategy and our conviction that you can be clean, reliable, affordable and profitable at the same time.\nThe Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 5% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.2 trillion, which is up approximately 8% from pre-pandemic levels and would make Florida the 15th largest economy in the world. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. According to recent Census Bureau data, more people moved to Florida from other parts of the country than to any other state in 2021. We believe this is a reflection of Florida's unique proposition in terms of great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing customer growth at Florida Power & Light.\nOver the past year, Florida has created more than 485,000 new private sector jobs and Florida's labor force participation rate has improved significantly. Three months average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts are up 15% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 13%.\nOther measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior year, including a 34% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a 2.6% decline in mortgage delinquencies while mortgage delinquencies across the U.S. have remained roughly flat.\nDuring the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 82,000 customers from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were down 1.5% versus the prior year period, driven by an unfavorable weather comparison. For 2021, FPL's retail sales increased 1.7% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by ongoing strong customer growth and a 1.5% year-over-year increase in underlying usage per customer. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.\nEnergy Resources reported fourth quarter 2021 GAAP net income of $851 million or $0.43 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $414 million or $0.21 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $599 million or $0.30 per share and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.21 billion or $1.12 per share.\nEnergy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.13 or approximately 13% versus 2020. For the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables and energy storage portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.12 per share. Contributions from existing generation and storage assets decreased $0.04 versus the prior year due primarily to underperformance in our existing wind fleet as a result of extreme market conditions in Texas in February of last year.\nNextEra Energy Transmission and Gas Infrastructure contributed favorably, increasing results by $0.01 and $0.02, respectively, year-over-year, while the contribution from our customer supply and trading businesses decreased $0.02 versus 2020. All other impacts increased results by $0.04 year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, Energy Resources had an outstanding year, delivering our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 7,200 net megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog.\nIn 2021, we commissioned approximately 3,800 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects, including a 110-megawatt build-own-transfer project that was not included in our backlog. In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 1,500 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog, including approximately 70 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 300 megawatts of solar and 500 megawatts of battery storage.\nOur origination performance in 2021 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals but perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save energy -- save money on energy costs, while switching to lower cost forms of generation like wind, solar and solar plus storage.\nOur renewables backlog now stands at more than 16,600 megawatts, which is roughly the size of our entire renewables generation portfolio at the end of 2017 and nearly 25% larger than our backlog at year-end 2020, and this provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that lies ahead for Energy Resources over the next few years. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program in Energy Resources now stands.\nWe remain optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources. We believe that there are many new market opportunities where our industry-leading development platform will provide a competitive advantage to further grow our core long-term contracted renewables and storage business.\nAs we have previously discussed, green hydrogen presents a particularly compelling new market for Energy Resources. During the fourth quarter, a clean energy technology company in which we are a minority equity investor and that has developed a proprietary process to decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. One, a conditional approval for an approximately $1 billion DOE, Department of Energy loan to expand its clean hydrogen and carbon black production facilities in Nebraska. Our agreement with this company provides Energy Resources the opportunity to be its preferred renewable energy supplier for the facility, and we are encouraged by the acceleration of the facility build-out that is expected to occur as a result of this new loan.\nSimilarly, early in the year, we completed the strategic investment in a liquid fuels company with a proprietary process to produce 0 emissions synthetic fuels by combining green hydrogen with concentrated carbon dioxide streams captured from industrial processes. Our strategic partnership with this company includes the opportunity for Energy Resources to provide up to 3,000 megawatts under a preferential energy supply agreement.\nFinally, as part of our efforts to help our commercial and industrial customers achieve their substantial goals for both energy savings and decarbonization, we recently announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase that allows for use of our proprietary state-of-the-art smart energy software to optimize its energy use and reduce its carbon footprint.\nEnergy Resources advanced software platform uses artificial intelligence and blockchain technology and leverages data from the industry-leading renewables and storage fleet owned and operated by energy resources. Two, among other things, match energy demand with clean energy resources available on the market in real time.\nWe recently signed a similar agreement that allows a large university to use our advanced software platform to manage and optimize more than 100-megawatt solar plus storage asset in California. Through these initiatives, Energy Resources is leveraging its best-in-class renewable energy expertise to provide significant value to its customers in a market with meaningful growth potential.\nWe are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the U.S. economy. Consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in clean energy transition expected to drive tremendous growth for Energy Resources over the next decade and beyond.\nTurning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.2 billion or $0.61 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $814 million or $0.41 per share, respectively. For the full year 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $3.57 billion or $1.81 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.02 billion or $2.55 per share.\nFor the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.05 per share compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.\nOur fourth quarter refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $140 million. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contribution in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Specifically, during the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy successfully refinanced approximately $5.2 billion in existing debt and hybrid securities and proactively issued roughly $4.9 billion in replacement funding. This combination of redemptions and new issuance extended its maturity profile by over 6 years and is expected to generate an approximately $30 million after-tax reduction in annual interest expense in the near term.\nCapital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. During the fourth quarter, Energy Resources closed on its previously announced agreements to sell a portfolio of newly constructed and under construction renewable assets to NextEra Energy Partners and to a third-party infrastructure investor. Through the sale of this 2.5 gigawatt renewables portfolio, Energy Resources was able to recycle nearly $3.5 billion of capital, including the tax equity proceeds, an accretive matter -- manner, and take advantage of the strong market for wind, solar and storage assets. We believe that our renewables development platform at Energy Resources is second to none, and our ability to continue to harness market demand for renewables and recognize the value of that platform is a key competitive advantage for NextEra Energy as it continues to grow its portfolio of long-term contracted operating renewables and storage assets at Energy Resources.\nTurning now to our financial expectations for NextEra Energy. As Jim discussed, today, we are increasing the ranges of our adjusted EPS expectations for 2022 and 2023, and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. For 2022, NextEra Energy now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off of the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges for each year. Details of our new financial expectations are included on the accompanying slide.\nFrom 2021 to 2025, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats.\nLet me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $322 million, and cash available for distribution was $91 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to the growth in the underlying portfolio.\nFor the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired late in 2020. Our existing projects portfolio, favorable performance from NextEra Energy Partners natural gas pipeline investments and contributions from the wind repowerings that we added at the end of 2020 were partially offset by weaker wind resource and lower generation at our Genesis Solar project as a result of outages for major maintenance in the first and fourth quarters of 2021. For the full year, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 100% in 2020. Cash available for distribution was $584 million for the full year.\nThe benefit to cash available for distribution from lower corporate level interest expense was partially offset by a comparably higher project level financing costs on our Genesis solar project, and other existing assets that were recapitalized to fund the acquisition of approximately 500 net megawatts from Energy Resources at the end of 2020.\nOver the past 3 years, NextEra Energy Partners cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.\nYesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.775 per common unit or $2.83 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2021.\nDuring the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners closed on the initial funding of its approximately $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing with Apollo Global Management and use those proceeds along with existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity to fund its acquisition of approximately 1,300 net megawatts of renewables and storage from energy resources. Under the terms of the agreement, NextEra Energy Partners is expected to benefit from a low implied initial cash coupon over the first 10 years, despite only providing approximately 4% of the upfront capital needed to purchase the assets. While we expect to allow NextEra Energy partners to achieve a full return of its capital invested into this acquisition in less than 2 years.\nAdditionally, the financing will provide NextEra Energy partners the flexibility to periodically buy out the investors' equity interest between the 5- and 10-year anniversaries of the agreement at a fixed pretax return of approximately 5.6% inclusive of all prior distributions, making this NextEra Energy Partners lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing to date. NextEra Energy Partners will have the right to pay up to 100% of the buyout price in NEP common units issued at no discount to the then current market price.\nNextEra Energy Partners also issued approximately 7.25 million new NEP common units during the fourth quarter to acquire the remaining equity interest in a portfolio of 1,388 megawatts of wind and solar assets associated with the convertible equity portfolio financing that NEP entered into in 2018.\nNextEra Energy Partners funded the remaining roughly $265 million of the approximately $885 million of total consideration for the acquisition of equity in the portfolio, with project level debt issued on a subset of the underlying assets. The nearly $650 million project financing supported by these assets, which was also the lowest cost project level debt financing in the partnership's history is reflective of the strong performance of the underlying assets in the portfolio and also supportive financing of other growth opportunities executed in 2021.\nFrom an updated base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. We continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15%, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range.\nGiven the successful execution of the recent acquisition from Energy Resources as well as the approximately 100-megawatt operating wind facility from a third party, year-end December 31, 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution exceeded our previous expectations ranges. As a result, today, we are introducing new year-end 2021 run rate expectation ranges for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $1.635 billion to $1.795 billion, and $640 million to $720 million, respectively.\nWith a combination of strong cash flow generation from existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, including the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new renewables and storage added during 2021 and its relatively low payout ratio, NextEra Energy Partners has significant flexibility in terms of acquisitions in the coming year. Although acquisitions could occur at any time during 2022, for modeling purposes, it may be practical to assume that any new unannounced asset additions occur late in 2022, and therefore, have limited contributions to the calendar year 2022 expectations implied by the year-end 2021 run rate for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution for the portfolio that we just discussed.\nNextEra Energy Partners run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31, 2022, remain unchanged. Year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion, and CAFD in the range of $675 million to $765 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022.\nAs a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we anticipate -- as we treat those as an operating expense.\nIn summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth, both in the near and longer term. Florida Power & Light, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2021 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects. And while we have a lot to execute on in 2022, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.",

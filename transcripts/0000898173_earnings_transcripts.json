Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our third quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Brad Beckham.\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts third quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Hensley, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. I'll begin our call today by expressing my appreciation to more than 93,000 team members across all in North America for the hard work they put in to deliver the third quarter results we released yesterday. .\nTeam O'Reilly continues to win in each of our markets. In our team's dedication to excellent customer service drove the solid comparable store sales increase of 5.6% we generated in the third quarter. This performance was at the high end of our expectations, and we are pleased with the momentum our teams have been able to sustain on both sides of our business. The combination of our strong sales results with a 9% increase in operating income and a 12% increase in diluted earnings per share demonstrates our team's focus on driving profitable growth.\nThank you, Team O'Reilly for your commitment to our culture, and absolute dedication to taking care of our customers. Now I'll walk through the details of our comparable store sales performance for the third quarter. Our professional business continues to be the more significant driver of our sales results with an increase in comparable store sales of just over 10%. We continue to be pleased with the strength in our Pro ticket count growth, which was the primary driver of our professional comp increase and the biggest contributor to our outperformance relative to our expectations. We also saw increased benefit in the quarter from average ticket on both sides of our business that I will detail in a minute.\nWe remain confident that the professional sales growth our teams are delivering is the result of share gains and as we continue to be the supplier of choice for our professional customers. Our share gains have been broad-based with strong contributions from all of our market areas. The strength of our professional business is anchored in the valuable relationship we have developed with our customers who value the end-to-end partnership our team is able to provide to their business through service, availability and business tools that help them be a service provider of choice to their customers. We were also pleased to deliver DIY comparable store sales growth with this side of our business, finishing the quarter with a low single-digit comp, driven by average ticket benefits, partially offset by pressure to ticket counts. Our DIY business was in line with our expectations in July, after having experienced pressure in June as we exited the second quarter. We began to encounter modest pressure to DIY transaction counts midway through the third quarter, which we believe reflects some degree of initial short-term reaction by DIY consumers in response to rising price levels. The contribution to same SKU inflation during the third quarter, which was felt evenly on both sides of the business was just over 4%. As we've anticipated coming into the third quarter, we saw a significant ramp in tariff-driven acquisition cost increases and made appropriate adjustments to selling prices. On a category basis, the pressure to our DIY business as we moved through the quarter was primarily felt in some categories where we could be seeing some deferral in larger ticket jobs.\nHowever, we continue to see strength broadly in other DIY maintenance categories, including oil, filters and fluids that have continued the outperformance we have seen throughout the year. We want to emphasize that we are still in the early stages of the consumer response to the ramp-up in price levels. It can be difficult to parse to finally the initial response from our DIY customers, but the pressure we have seen thus far is modest and in line with consumer reactions to economic shocks we have seen in the past. As we've noted the last several quarters, we remain cautious in our outlook on the consumer and expect that we could continue to see a conservative stance from consumers and how they manage spending in this environment. However, even in this environment, our DIY consumers are still showing a willingness to invest in and maintain their vehicles and we believe any potential deferral pressure will be short term. When looking at category dynamics on the professional side of our business, we are seeing very strong performance across both failure and maintenance-related categories and are pleased with the resiliency of customer demand. The customer has taken their vehicle to a professional shop for their repair and maintenance work tends to be less economically constrained than our average DIY customer and less reactive to inflationary pressures on spend in a large -- largely nondiscretionary category of their wallet.\nLooking at the cadence of our sales results. In total for the quarter, we generated consistently strong comparable store sales growth as we move through the quarter with positive comps on both sides of our business in each month. We would characterize weather as neutral on balance for the quarter as we experienced normalized summer weather across most of our market areas. Now I would like to provide some color on our updated full year comparable store sales guidance.\nAs noted in yesterday's press release, we updated our guidance from the previous range of 3% to 4.5% to a range of 4% to 5%. At the midpoint of our full year range reflects our outlook when factoring in current sales volumes as we progress through September and thus far into October. We have incorporated into our guidance range the current pricing environment. While the broader tariff landscape has the potential to remain fluid, at this stage, we believe we have seen the lion's share of the cost impacts we are expecting as they relate to the tariffs currently in effect. As a result, we anticipate a mid-single-digit same-SKU benefit in the fourth quarter, but have also factored into our guidance a continuation of the pressure to our DIY customers from the dynamics I mentioned earlier.\nOur industry has continued to behave rationally in response to the pressure tariffs have placed on product acquisition costs and we continue to monitor industry pricing adjustments to ensure we are competitively priced for the value proposition we provide. Our industry backdrop remains or continues to be both stable and supportive. We believe the dynamics of the consumer uncertainty and continued pressure to the DIY business are being felt industry-wide. Most importantly, we believe our teams are winning share on both sides of the business against the current macroeconomic backdrop.\nIn times when spending decisions become more difficult for our customers, having our excellent customer service, superior product availability and professional parts people to guide them becomes an even more important piece of the value we deliver. Before I turn the call over to Brent, I would like to highlight our updated diluted earnings per share guidance. As noted in our press release, we have updated our EPS guidance to a range of $2.90 to $3. This incorporates our year-to-date performance, the revised sales outlook and our expectations for gross margin and SG&A for the fourth quarter, which Brent will discuss next.\nAt the midpoint, our current EPS guidance is an increase of approximately 2% from the midpoint of our previous guidance and a year-over-year increase of 9%. We are pleased that the team has been able to deliver both strong sales and earnings growth even in a rapidly changing environment of economic uncertainty. As I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their strong performance in the third quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Fred. I would like to start by thanking Team O'Reilly for their outstanding work during the quarter. Our team continues to outperform and remain steadfast in their focus on our culture and our customers to drive our success. Today, I will start by discussing our third quarter gross margin and SG&A results as well as provide an update on capital expansion and our updated outlook on these items. Starting with gross margin. For the third quarter, our gross margin of 51.9%, was up 27 basis points from the third quarter of 2024 and in line with our expectations. Our team was able to offset the gross margin headwind resulting from our customer mix from faster growth on the professional side of the business with prudent supply chain management and solid distribution productivity. .\nWhile the third quarter gross margin rate was above our full year gross margin guidance range, we expected a higher gross margin rate in the third quarter as compared to the rest of the year, which is typical for the seasonal composition of our product mix and consistent with our results in 2024. We are maintaining our full year gross margin guidance range of 51.2% to 51.7% and expect to see a similar progression of gross margin rate from the third to fourth quarter as we experienced last year. Our supply chain teams continue to work diligently, both internally and with our supplier partners to navigate the evolving tariff environment. Our ability to maintain consistent gross margins with the amount of change we have faced during the year is a true testament to their hard work and dedication.\nAs expected, we realized significant acquisition cost pressure from tariffs in the quarter. The impact from product cost inflation in the quarter closely mirrored in timing the adjustments we made in pricing. As Brad mentioned earlier, we have now seen the biggest impacts from the current tariff environment, and our guidance for sales and gross margin does not contemplate substantial impacts from further tariffs beyond what is reflected in our product acquisition costs today.\nHowever, to the extent any future tariff revisions result in further acquisition cost increases, we will prudently navigate those in the same way that we have done to date. As the tariff landscape and cost environment has evolved in 2025, we have maintained a close eye on the pricing environment within our industry to ensure that we are making the appropriate adjustments in remaining competitive. Against this volatile backdrop, our goal remains the same. To provide the exceptional service and industry-leading availability, our customers know and expect from O'Reilly Auto Parts to continue to earn their business. Overall, we believe our supply chain is at its healthiest point since we emerged from the pandemic. With the support of a strong supplier community, we have sustained robust in-stock availability across our tiered distribution network, this strong distribution infrastructure is the foundation for our industry-leading inventory availability and a critical factor in how we serve our customers and earn additional share.\nOur merchandising teams work diligently to maintain our diversified supplier base in order to actively manage exposure and risk on numerous fronts. This risk can range from country of origin to diversification of supply within a single product category. Supplier health and supplier performance can often go hand in hand. So an important part of our risk management process is monitoring our supplier partner health from all angles, ranging from shipping performance, product quality, catalog support, all the way to financial stability. While these processes always involve some level of effort to mitigate risk in a small subset of our supplier base, we would again reiterate that we are pleased with the collective health of our supplier partners.\nOur goal is always to foster supplier partnerships that are both long-standing and deep as we repeatedly earn our status as the desired priority customer for each of our suppliers. Now I'd like to turn to SG&A and give some color on the quarter. Our SG&A per store growth of 4% was at the top end of our expectations for the quarter. Driving this spend were expenses related to our strong sales performance, coupled with continued inflationary pressures in our cost structure, again, centered around medical and casualty insurance programs. Based on our third quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year, we expect our SG&A per store growth to come in at or slightly above the top end of our full year guide of 3.5%. We have factored in our updated expectations for comp sales and corresponding incremental SG&A dollars into our guide, and we have been pleased with how our teams are managing expenses while driving sales volumes above expectations.\nAs a reminder, our fourth quarter SG&A per store growth is expected to be below the full year run rate as a result of comparing against the charge we took in the fourth quarter of 2024 and to adjust reserves for self-insurance liability for historic auto liability claims. Based on our SG&A expectations and projected gross margin range we continue to expect our full year operating margin to come within our guidance range of 19.2% to 19.7%. As always, our top objective in managing our expense structure is ensuring that we are meeting our high standard of customer service by supporting our team of experienced professional parts people. Turning to an update on our expansion.\nWe opened 55 net new stores across the U.S. and Mexico during the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date store opening to 160 stores. We are on track to achieve our 2025 new store opening target of 200 to 210 net new stores by year-end, and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. New store growth remains an attractive use of capital for us, and we see ample growth opportunities spread across all of our North American footprint. In this regard, we are pleased to announce our 2026 store opening target of 225 to 235 net new stores.\nJust as our 2025 growth has been spread across 37 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Mexico, we anticipate growth in all of those markets as well as in Canada in 2026. Our store growth in 2026 will continue to be concentrated in the U.S. markets but we will also continue our measured growth within our international markets as we work to develop the teams and infrastructure to support our O'Reilly operating model. Our tiered distribution network continues to help drive our stores' competitive advantage in parts availability, and we are pleased to begin servicing stores out of our new Stafford, Virginia distribution center in the fourth quarter of this year.\nI would like to express my gratitude to our distribution and supply chain teams for all the hard work that has gone into this state-of-the-art new greenfield distribution center in the Mid-Atlantic market. This distribution center will be an important stepping stone for us to begin adding store count within heavily populated and untapped markets for us in the Mid-Atlantic I-95 corridor. As excited as we are about this new facility, there is no pause for our dedicated supply chain teams as we are full steam ahead with distribution growth and progress at our upcoming Fort Worth, Texas facility as well as future opportunities that will further support our store growth and inventory availability.\nCapital expenditures supporting both store and DC growth for the first 9 months of 2025 and were $900 million and are slightly below our expectations. Based on our year-to-date spend and fourth quarter outlook, we are reducing our full year capital expenditure guidance by $100 million to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This reduction is primarily the result of timing of spend on store and distribution center growth projects that we now expect to incur in 2026. As I close my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work in driving our company's success. Your commitment to providing consistent, excellent service to all of our customers is the foundation for our long-term growth.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter. Now we will take a closer look at our third quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2025. For the third quarter, sales increased $341 million, driven by a 5.6% increase in comparable store sales and a $101 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2024 and 2025 that have not yet entered the comp base. For 2025, we now expect our total revenues to be between $17.6 billion and $17.8 billion.\nOur third quarter effective tax rate was 21.4% of pretax income comprised of a base rate of 22.2%, reduced by a 0.8% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the third quarter of 2024 rate of 21.5% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 23%, reduced by a 1.5% benefit for share-based compensation. As we noted in our press release, during the third quarter, we accelerated the payment timing of transferable renewable energy tax credits that were originally planned to settle in 2026. Our full year income tax rate guidance has been revised to reflect the incremental benefits we expect from the accelerated payment.\nAccordingly, for the full year of 2025, we now expect an effective tax rate of 21.6% versus our prior expectation of 22.3%. The updated tax rate guidance includes an anticipated benefit of 1% for share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the first 9 months of the year due to the tolling of certain open tax periods.\nAlso, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly rate. Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2025 was $1.2 billion versus $1.7 billion for the same period in 2024. The reduction in free cash flow was primarily the result of the accelerated timing of payment for renewable energy tax credits that I previously mentioned. For the full year 2025, we have updated our expected free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, down from our previous range of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion. This adjustment reflects the headwind from the accelerated tax payment timing partially offset by the reduction in our capital expenditures guidance Brent discussed in his prepared remarks. Inventory per store finished the quarter at $858,000, which was up 10% from this time last year and up 7% from the end of 2024. Our inventory investments continue to generate strong returns, and we've been pleased with the overall in-stock positions of our store and distribution network.\nWe have executed our inventory growth strategy in 2025 at a faster pace than our initial expectations and could see elevated inventory balances above our original 5% per store plan as we finish out the year. We continue to manage the timing of inventory enhancements to capitalize on current opportunities we see to drive our business and are pleased with the productivity of these investments. This incremental inventory investment has been more than offset by our AP to inventory ratio. We finished the third quarter at 126%, which was down from 128% at the end of 2024 but above our expectations. Moving on to debt. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.4x and as compared to our end of 2024 ratio of 1.99x with an increase in adjusted debt partially offset by EBITDA growth. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan and prudently approach that number over time. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the third quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares at an average share price of $98.8 and for a total investment of $420 million. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs a reminder, our EPS guidance, Brad outlined earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I open up our call for your questions, I would like once again to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high levels of service to our customers. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matthew, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

My name is Matthew, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our second quarter 2025 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Brad Beckman.\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. It is once again my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on their performance in the second quarter and the solid results they have delivered in the first half of 2025.\nOur team's proven ability to provide superior value and excellent customer service drove our second quarter comparable store sales increase of 4.1%. These solid results contributed to a year-to-date comp growth at the high end of our expectations, and we are pleased with our team's ability to generate this level of sales momentum in the first half of 2025. Our second quarter sales growth drove an 11% increase in earnings per share to $0.78 and I'd like to thank our over 92,000 team members their unwavering commitment to executing our business model at an extremely high level and providing the best customer service in our industry. The composition of our comparable store sales growth in the second quarter was similar to the first quarter with solid contributions from both sides of our business. Our professional business was once again the more significant driver of our sales results with an increase in comparable store sales exceeding 7%, fueled by continued strong ticket count growth.\nOur teams continue to set the standard for how seamlessly and effectively they partner with and support our professional customers to grow their businesses. Our continued robust share gains in our professional business are a testament to the close relationships we have fostered with our customers and our continued efforts to enhance our service levels to earn a greater share of their spend. DIY was also a contributor to our sales growth in the quarter with a low single-digit comp. From a traffic standpoint, we did see pressure to DIY ticket counts as we exited the quarter in June that resulted in a small decline in DIY ticket count for the full year, but we were pleased to see positive overall sales growth in DIY in the quarter, driven by growth in average ticket size.\nAverage ticket continues to be a contributor to our sales growth on both sides of the business, driven by increasing complexity in vehicle repairs. We also saw a modest benefit from effective pricing management in the second quarter. The contribution to our average ticket from same SKU inflation for the second quarter was just under 1.5% and reflects the early stages of the impact of changes in the tariff environment in our industry, which I will discuss more in a moment.\nTurning to the cadence of our sales performance. Results were reasonably steady throughout the second quarter. As I noted previously, our comparable store sales for the quarter landed at the high end of our expectations, and we saw this outperformance primarily in the first 2 months of the quarter. As we remarked on last quarter's call, favorable spring weather supported strong volumes in our business as we exited the first quarter, and that momentum continued through April and May. Business normalized somewhat in June but was still in line with plan. The moderation at the end of the second quarter was driven at least in part by minor pressure in hot weather-related categories where we were up against a tough comparison to a strong performance in June last year.\nOn balance, we think weather impacts evened out over the quarter and were ultimately neutral to our full second quarter results but did contribute to some minor differences in the month-to-month cadence. Thus far in July, summer weather has been typical for the season, and we have been pleased with the continued solid trends in our business to start the third quarter. From a category perspective, our second quarter results reflected trends similar to what we've seen over the last few quarters. We continue to generate strong performance in maintenance categories, including oil, filters and spark plugs, and we're also pleased with solid performance in under car hard part categories, particularly on the professional side of our business.\nWe are encouraged by the resiliency of performance in these categories and believe it reflects favorable vehicle dynamics in our industry as well as continued willingness of consumers to prioritize the care of their existing vehicles. However, we also saw continued softness in discretionary categories in line with trends we have seen over the last year. As we have noted in the past, Discretionary products make up a small subset of our total sales, primarily on the DIY side of our business. While not a substantial headwind to our overall results, the continued sluggishness in these categories is an indicator to us that consumers are still remaining cautious and conservative in how they are managing the spend in the current environment.\nNext, I would like to provide some color on our revised full year comparable store sales guidance. As noted in yesterday's press release, we updated our guidance from the previous range of 2% to 4% to a range of 3% to 4.5%. It isn't typical for us to revise our guidance to a range of 1.5% at this stage of the year, but we feel this update is appropriate for a few reasons. The midpoint of our revised comp range represents a 75 basis point increase over our previous midpoint and is in line with trends we have seen in our business in the first half of the year. The increase in our guidance range at the top end also reflects the potential for incremental benefit we could realize from the effective price management that we talked about earlier as we navigate the challenging tariff environment.\nAs I previously noted, we have begun to see some incremental same-SKU benefit filter into our numbers from industry-wide pricing actions spurred by the first round of tariffs. Brent will discuss more of this in detail during his prepared comments, but we continue to be successful in working with our supplier partners to respond to and mitigate the impacts from tariffs. Likewise, we have begun to see industry adjustments in response to the incremental pressures to product acquisition costs and anticipate our industry will continue to behave rationally. However, in establishing our outlook for the remainder of 2025, we remain cautious as to the uncertainty of the timing, magnitude and ultimate impact of changes in the pricing environment in our industry. We are also cautious concerning the potential adverse impact to consumers and their resulting response in the face of rising prices.\nOur stance is driven in part by our current assessment of the health and confidence of consumers. We continue to view the consumer as relatively healthy, buoyed by strong employment and wage rate growth. We also believe the strong value proposition of maintaining and repairing an existing vehicle, coupled with the high quality of vehicles creates a very compelling incentive for our customers to prioritize their auto part spend. However, as I noted earlier, we also think that consumers in our industry remain cautious in a very uncertain environment and are remaining conservative in the management of their overall household spend. Should consumers face rapid broad-based price increases in the back half of the year, we could encounter short-term reactions, particularly by lower-income DIY consumers who may look to ease pressure in face of these shocks by cutting back on spending wherever possible.\nAs a result of these factors, our forward-looking guidance expectations do not incorporate a significant net benefit from tariff-induced inflation beyond the modest price changes we have already seen thus far. While we are cognizant that these macroeconomic factors could cause volatility in our industry in the remainder of 2025, we are also confident the disruptions to consumer demand will be short-lived. Over the course of many economic cycles, consumers in our industry have proven their resilience in responding to short-term shocks, whether caused by tariff-driven inflation, spikes in gas prices or other factors. The core fundamental drivers of demand in our business remain very solid, underpinned by the increasing age and quality of the vehicle fleet in the growth of the North American car park and the corresponding steady annual increases in miles driven. We also view periods of acute challenges in our industry as opportunities to leverage our strategic advantages and enhance our competitive positioning.\nWe currently hold just a fraction of the addressable market share in a fragmented industry. Our primary growth vehicle is centered on our ability to provide constantly improving value to our customers to earn a larger share of auto parts demand. This relentless focus on excellent customer service is an imperative every day in each of our markets regardless of the broader macro conditions. In challenging environments, our teams of professional parts people dig even deeper to distinguish the value we provide to our customers, knowing there is always more market share gains to be earned.\nBefore I wrap up and turn the call over to Brent, I wanted to call out the update to our diluted earnings per share guidance. As noted in our press release yesterday, we have updated our EPS guidance to a range of $2.85 to a range of -- $2.85 to $2.95. We were pleased to complete our Board and shareholder approved [ 15 for 1 ] stock split in the second quarter. So this quarter's press release is the first reporting period where we provided EPS results and guidance factoring in the increased share count. At the midpoint, our updated guidance is an increase of approximately 1% from the midpoint of our previous guidance adjusted for the stock split with the increase reflecting our second quarter results and expectations for the remainder of 2025. As I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their strong performance in the second quarter.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. Before I dig in further to our results, I would like to echo Brad's comments on the dedication of Team O'Reilly. The sales momentum we have generated in the first half of 2025 and is the direct result of the hard work of each of our team members in our stores, distribution centers and offices, and I want to thank the entire team for their commitment to our customers. I would like to begin my comments this morning by discussing our second quarter gross margin results and our outlook for the remainder of 2025.\nFor the quarter, our gross margin of 51.4% was up 67 basis points for the second -- from the second quarter of 2024. In establishing our full year gross margin outlook, we assumed a slightly lower gross margin rate in the second quarter as compared to the first, third and fourth quarters, which is typical for the seasonal composition of our product mix and consistent with our results in 2024. So while our second quarter gross margin performance fell in the middle of our full year guidance outlook, it handily exceeded our expectations for the quarter.\nOur performance in the quarter was driven by continued strong management of our supply chain environment and solid distribution productivity coupled with the timing benefit from the impact of tariff-related costs and pricing adjustments. On the tariff front, as Brad discussed in his comments, we did begin to see some impact to our business in the second quarter. As we've discussed at length in the past, the process by which we respond to any changes in the acquisition cost environment, including increases spurred by tariff modifications begins with close coordination with our supplier partners to mitigate the impact to our customers.\nAs we have worked through the changing tariff landscape over the last several months, we believe that coordination has been very effective and has allowed us to negotiate appropriate cost increases that do not reflect the full impact of incremental tariff rates while also temporarily delaying the timing of the application of those cost changes where possible. In anticipation of the impact of tariff cost pressures, we closely monitored the pricing environment in our industry as we move through the second quarter and where appropriate, made adjustments to selling prices.\nOur industry has historically been very rational in its response to changing input costs and pricing. And we believe those same dynamics are prevailing in the current environment. Typically, in our industry, we see changes in acquisition costs and any corresponding price movements sync up fairly closely, but can sometimes experience temporary timing differences they create short-term headwinds or tailwinds within a quarter. In these instances, we can realize a short-term benefit from the timing of pricing changes that are slightly out ahead of when the corresponding cost increases filter into our income statement.\nWithin the second quarter, we did realize a benefit from this timing dynamic, which contributed to our positive gross margin results. As we look to the back half of the year, we aren't currently projecting significant further incremental benefit or pressure to gross margin rates from tariffs, but the environment remains fluid, both as it relates to the exact timing and magnitude of any tariff revisions that have yet to be implemented as well as the timing of market responses in our industry.\nGiven the existing tariff landscape and our ongoing work with our supply chain partners, we do anticipate further impacts to acquisition costs and are cautious that we could encounter short-term timing headwinds to gross margin rate in the back half of the year depending on the speed with which our industry digests inflation pressures. Ultimately, we believe these short-term timing differences will even out over the long run and our industry will settle at an equilibrium that is in line with the rational pricing dynamics that have persisted over many cycles in many different environments in the automotive aftermarket.\nIndependent of these tariff-related impacts, we are pleased with our gross margin performance in the quarter and the trends we continue to see in our business. We believe our consistent results despite facing a mix headwind from a faster growth on the professional side of our business reflect continued strong management by our supply chain teams, working closely with our supplier partners. Given our experience thus far in 2024 and 2025 and factoring in that we could see tariff-induced choppiness in gross margin results in the back half of the year. we are leaving our full year gross margin guidance unchanged at a range of 51.2% to 51.7%.\nAs Brad discussed earlier, we remain cautious as to the potential adverse impact our customers could face from the heightened inflation in the remainder of 2025. We but remain confident that we will still be able to profitably earn our customers' business by delivering a strong value proposition driven by our professional parts people and industry-leading parts availability, even an environment of rising prices.\nTurning to SG&A. Our second quarter average SG&A per store growth of 4.5% was above our expectations and reflects a combination of the incremental spend to deliver excellent customer service in support of our above-plan sales performance and inflation pressure in our cost structure, particularly in areas more challenging to manage in the short term. such as expenses pertaining to our medical and casualty insurance programs. Based on the inflation pressure we are currently seeing, coupled with our top line outlook for the remainder of the year, we are revising our full year guidance for average SG&A per store growth to a range of 3% to 3.5%. While the pressures we are seeing have driven SG&A above our expectations, we continue to believe that the initiatives that we are executing and the enhancements to customer service we have been able to generate are integral factors in the market share gains that we are capturing on both sides of our business.\nAs such, we will continue to diligently manage our SG&A spend to prioritize a high standard of excellent customer service and take advantage of the opportunities to fuel growth. Based on our SG&A expectations and projected gross margin range, we continue to expect our full year operating profit to come within our guidance range of 19.2% to 19.7%. We successfully opened 105 net new stores across the U.S. and Mexico in the first half of 2025. And we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores. We continue to see solid growth in greenfield expansion markets, but we are also capitalizing on great growth opportunities across our footprint. As a result, our store growth thus far in 2025 was spread across 34 different U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Mexico.\nUnderpinning our very successful new store expansion efforts are the pivotal investments, we continue to make to enhance our industry-leading distribution network. We remain steadfast in our commitment to equipping our store teams with rapid industry-leading access to inventory. To that end, we are excited to announce that we have acquired a facility in Hazlet, Texas a suburb of Fort Worth that will become our 33rd distribution center. This new facility, which we were referred to as our Fort Worth D.C., is approximately 560,000 square foot with an expected capacity to serve 350 stores in the South Central United States. These market areas represent some of our most mature markets, while also being strong contributors of highly profitable growth for many years.\nEven with the relatively high store counts we have in Texas and surrounding markets, we still see tremendous opportunity to continue growing in this part of the country in the future, but are running up against constraints with our distribution capacity. The backfill addition of this facility will not only give us additional capacity and enhanced service capabilities in the important Fort Worth metro market, but will also free up much needed capacity in surrounding DCs to support growth across the South Central region of the country. We are still in the early innings of development for this new DC, having just acquired the facility with substantial infill work still ahead of us.\nAs a result, we anticipate this distribution center will be in operation in 2027. We are also excited to be nearing the completion of our Stafford, Virginia distribution center. We plan to start transferring stores to be serviced by Stafford at the end of the third quarter with the new facility servicing its initial store base by the end of this year. We could not be more excited about the store development opportunities that these 2 new facilities will unlock for the company in both the largely untapped Mid-Atlantic region and in strong existing markets in the South Central U.S. As I close my comments, I want to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success. Your commitment to providing consistent, excellent customer service to all of our customers each and every day continues to be the key to our long-term success.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to begin today by thanking Team O'Reilly for another successful quarter. Now we will take a closer look at our second quarter results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2025. For the second quarter, sales increased $253 million, driven by a 4.1% increase in comparable store sales and an $86 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in '24 and '25 that have not yet entered the comp base. For 2025, we now expect our total revenues to be between $17.5 billion and $17.8 billion.\nOur second quarter effective tax rate was 22.4% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.2%, reduced by a 0.8% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the second quarter of 2024 rate of 23.2% of pretax income which was comprised of a base tax rate of 23.8%, reduced by a 0.6% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2025, we now expect an effective tax rate of 22.3%. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain open tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly rate. Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results.\nFree cash flow for the first 6 months of 2025 was $904 million versus $1.2 billion in the first half of 2024. The reduction in free cash flow was primarily the result of the timing of payment for renewable energy tax credits with a higher cash outflow for these payments occurring in the second quarter of 2025 versus the third quarter of 2024. For the full year 2025, our expected free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at a range of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion. Inventory per store finished the quarter at $833,000, which was up 9% from this time last year and up 4% from the end of 2024.\nBroad-based inventory availability is critical to the success of our business and we have been pleased with the investments we have made in inventory in 2025. Our projected increase in 2025 in average inventory per store remains unchanged at 5%. I also want to touch briefly on our AP to inventory ratio. We finished the second quarter at 127%, which was down from 128% at the end of 2024, but slightly above our expectations. For the remainder of 2025, we expect to see continued moderation resulting from our planned incremental inventory investment across our store and distribution network and currently expect to finish the year at a ratio of approximately 125%.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.06x as compared to our end of 2024 ratio of 1.99x with an increase in adjusted debt partially offset by EBITDA growth. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the second quarter, on a split-adjusted basis, we repurchased 6.8 million shares at an average share price of $90.71 for a total investment of $617 million.\nWe remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance that Brad outlined earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I open up our call to your questions, I would once again like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and dedication to providing consistently high levels of service to our customers. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matthew, the operator to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. My name is Matthew, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher, Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our first quarter 2025 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Brad Beckham.\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts first quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman, and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.\nI'd like to begin today by thanking our over 93,000 team members for the hard work they put in during the first quarter to continue our track record of profitable growth, delivering a solid start to 2025. We held our annual leadership conference in January, and our theme and rally cry for this year is next level. Every single one of our leaders in every facet of our business are focused daily on how they can take their leadership, their ownership and in turn, our customer service and performance to the next level. It's incredible that O'Reilly has been a business for almost 70 years and the same fundamentals and next-level mindset that made our company successful in the early years are still what makes us great today. While I believe our people and our culture are truly world-class today, our team absolutely never settles for the status quo. I cannot be more grateful to work with the team that is always on the hunt for ways to improve, get better and take our company to the next level.\nDelivering excellent customer service and building top-notch teams to continue our company growing is not easy work, and I want to commend our team members for the pride they take in our company and the commitment they hold to being the best team in the business.\nNow I'd like to start our discussion on the first quarter by walking through the details of our comparable store sales results. Our comp growth of 3.6% in the quarter was at the high end of our expectations, and we are pleased with the solid start to the year. Both sides of our business performed well relative to our expectations and our professional business was the larger driver of our total comp results with a mid-single-digit comp consistent with our expectations and ongoing trends. DIY was positive for the quarter with a low single-digit comp, and we were pleased to see our comp outperformance being driven by strong ticket counts relative to our expectations on both sides of the business. Next, I want to give some color on the cadence of our sales results as we move through the quarter.\nWe've noted many times that our first quarter can be our most volatile with variability in our business resulting from the type and severity of winter weather and from the timing of the onset of spring. The timing and magnitude of individual income tax refunds can also be a factor impacting our results through much of February and into March. While our results for the quarter as a whole, were strong, we did see the choppiness in our business that is characteristic of first quarter from these impacts. Winter weather in January was largely as expected, but moving into February, we experienced more mixed weather patterns and some delays in the distribution of tax refunds. As we entered the last week of February, tax refunds caught up and coincided with favorable spring weather moving into March that supported strong volumes on both sides of the business through the end of the quarter. March was our strongest month of the quarter, and we produced solid results thus far into April.\nOn balance, we believe our underlying business and customer demand was steady throughout the quarter and the month-to-month cadence is very much in line with what we would have expected given the weather we experienced and the timing of tax refunds. Although ticket count was the primary driver of our comp sales growth and outperformance in the quarter, average ticket was also a contributor to comps on both sides of the business. The dynamic of increasing complexity continues to be a stable driver of average ticket within our industry as better engineered and more complex parts continue to drive both higher product costs and resulting selling prices. Same SKU inflation was a minimal benefit on the quarter at less than 0.5%. This was slightly below our expectations on both sides of our business, primarily due to the normal puts and takes we see in rational competitive pricing in our industry.\nI will discuss our thoughts on tariff developments in a moment, but I will note the tariff-related price changes had a very minimal impact to same-SKU inflation in the first quarter. Looking to the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year comparable store sales guidance of 2% to 4%. Now I'd like to spend a minute discussing what is driving our sales results and how we're thinking about what is ahead of us this year.\nDuring the first quarter, weather-related categories performed well, and we continue to see strength in maintenance categories such as Oil and Filters as consumers are prioritizing the maintenance of their existing vehicles. We also continue to see pressure in discretionary categories in line with trends over the last few quarters and a continued indicator to us that consumers are being cautious in a period of economic uncertainty. We saw solid results in failure-related Hard Part categories, and our customers continue to prioritize products that are higher quality on the value spectrum. We believe we're in a market where consumers are placing a high value on investments in their existing vehicles and will continue to be motivated to avoid the significant cost and monthly payment burden that comes with a new or replacement vehicle. The combination of these factors puts us in a backdrop that we would characterize as favorable for the industry and for O'Reilly yet carries a high degree of uncertainty.\nThere are several factors, namely tariffs and the ongoing international trade deliberations that have the potential to impose significant challenges on the consumer. Within the first quarter, most of this uncertainty was in the headlines and had yet to make its way to anything we would characterize as notable impact to our day-to-day business. As such, we have not made changes to the key assumptions behind our original comparable store sales guidance range of 2% to 4% that we discussed on our call in February. Tariffs certainly have the potential to impact the same-SKU inflation assumptions we have inherent within our guide. However, the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the duration, magnitude and timing of potential tariffs coupled with the changes we have already seen to previously announced tariffs, prevent us from prudently forecasting the inflationary impacts.\nAdditionally, we have not seen adverse impacts to consumers that could also come with rapid and sustained changes to the pricing environment, but we are cautious in our outlook given the broader uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. Based on these considerations, we have maintained an unchanged sales guidance range that is supported by current business trends and volumes. Brent will cover the gross margin outlook during his prepared comments, but I will note that our margin outlook was developed under the same thought process. Over the long term, regardless of any potential for short-term disruptions in the broader macro environment, we stand by the fundamental drivers of our business, increasing miles driven on a growing and aging vehicle fleet by consumers that view transportation needs is critical to their day-to-day lives, provides a stable and supportive backdrop for our industry.\nWhile tariffs may take up a significant bandwidth in the news, our teams are focused on what they do best, and that is getting incrementally better in executing our business model every single day in every single store. We have the absolute expectation that our industry-leading service and availability will take market share against any market backdrop, and internally, we certainly don't allow for excuses if results don't meet expectations. We have confidence in our industry, and we know that even after years of sustained profitable growth as a company, we still own a small fraction of the total addressable share. We believe we still have a ton of opportunity, and we intend to take market share both aggressively and profitably.\nBefore I wrap up, I wanted to also note that we are increasing our diluted earnings per share guidance to a range of $42.90 to $43.40. Our increase in EPS guidance is driven by our first quarter sales performance as well as a reduction in our expected tax rate and the impact of shares repurchased through the date of our earnings release yesterday. You might have also seen that we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 15:1 split of our common stock, subject to shareholder approval at our annual meeting this May. This would mark our fourth stock split in our company history, since going public in April of 1993 with our last split 20 years ago in 2005. Our primary motivation for a split, is to make our stock more accessible to our team members and enable them to acquire whole shares rather than fractions more readily through our employee stock purchase program. Our stock purchase plan has been an excellent way for our team members to share-in the success of O'Reilly, allowing full-time team members to begin purchasing stock at a discount right at the beginning of their career with the company.\nWith the outstanding results our team has been able to achieve over the years and the corresponding growth in share price, we believe this is the right time to split our stock and encourage our team members to join in the next chapter of growth for O'Reilly.\nAs I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for your hard work and commitment to excellent customer service with a solid start to 2025. Now I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would also like to begin my comments this morning by congratulating Team O'Reilly on a solid start to 2025. Today, I will further discuss our first quarter gross margin and SG&A results and provide a quick update on our expansion and capital investments thus far in 2025. Starting with gross margin.\nOur first quarter gross margin of 51.3% was a 12 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2024, which was in line with our expectations for the quarter. The acquisition cost environment remains stable. And as Brad noted, this is coupled with a rational pricing environment within the industry. Our first quarter gross margins were not materially impacted by the changing tariff environment. At this point in time, we have begun to see some cost flow through from the initial round of incremental tariffs on product from China, but there is still a very high degree of ambiguity as it pertains to the subsequently announced tariffs. We are still working through negotiations with our suppliers and our team is working diligently to rapidly digest new information as it becomes available and respond accordingly.\nAs Brad mentioned earlier, and similar to what we noted on our last call, at this stage, it is difficult to assess the exact timing, duration and magnitude of any tariff revisions that will occur and the way that suppliers, competitors and customers will respond to these changes. It is still our expectation that we will be able to work with our supplier partners to actively negotiate the level of any tariff-driven cost pressure, they pass through to us in order to mitigate the impact to our customers. In a similar fashion to how our industry and company has responded to previous tariff and other cost changes. We also continue to believe the demand in our industry is resilient because of the non-discretionary needs-based nature of the products that we sell. As such, we believe we will still be able to profitably earn our customers' business by delivering a strong value proposition, driven by our professional parts people and our industry-leading parts availability, even in an environment of rising prices.\nUltimately, we are confident in our ability to manage effectively through this period of uncertainty and believe that rational pricing will persist within our industry. We also have more flexibility than ever in our company's history and how we manage our supply chain and where we source our products. As we have previously stated, approximately 1/4 of our products are sourced from China, and we have continued to reduce this percentage over the last several years. Given the uncertainties surrounding current trade deliberations, we would not anticipate significant country of origin changes in our sourcing in the near term. However, we will continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to evaluate the most optimal strategic path forward. We have always been active managers of our supply chain in partnership with our supplier community, and we will work diligently to ensure that there is no barrier to us maintaining our inventory advantage that continues to position us as the industry leader in parts availability.\nFactoring in these considerations, we are maintaining our 2025 full year gross margin guidance range of 51.2% to 51.7%, in line with Brad's discussion on our comp sales guidance, this reiterated guidance does not forecast any discrete impacts for varying tariff scenarios that may yet play out.\nTurning to SG&A. Our first quarter average SG&A per store growth of 4.1% was above our expectations. As compared to those expectations, the pressure to SG&A was driven in part by team member payroll and benefit costs, reflecting variable spend on the sales results in the quarter and enhancements to store level pay plans as well as some pressure in the quarter from medical plan cost. We also saw some cost pressure driven by maintenance and occupancy expenses resulting from normal wear and tear to our stores during the winter months that outran our forecasts. Our spend in the first quarter puts us on track to finish at the high end of our 2% to 2.5% full year guidance range for average SG&A per store growth. On a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year, we are leaving our SG&A expectations unchanged, and we continue to expect to run approximately 2.5% to 3% in the second and third quarter, but will be below the full year rate in the fourth quarter as we compare against the charge that we recognized for self-insured auto liability in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nWhile we view some of the SG&A pressure in the first quarter to be temporary and aren't changing our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are cognizant of the potential for incremental impacts to our cost structure, should we see an accelerated inflationary environment more broadly in the economy. As always, we will diligently manage our SG&A spend to match business trends and the market share growth that we are driving in our stores, and will not overcorrect in the short term in any way that would impact, our high standard for providing excellent customer service. Based on our SG&A expectations and projected gross margin range, we continue to expect our full year operating profit to come within our guidance range of 19.2% to 19.7%.\nInventory per store finished the quarter at $806,000, which was up 4.3% from this time last year and up just under 1% from the end of 2024. Inventory turns remained strong at 1.6x as our teams work to continually enhance assortments by market. The tiered nature of our distribution network with regional DCs and hub stores allow us to hold broad coverage in every market that we serve, to provide the time-definite promise that is so critical when immediacy of need drives our delivery times to be measured in minutes, not hours. We are still projecting to increase our average inventory per store by 5% in 2025, and we are pleased with the inventory investments that we have made thus far.\nLastly, to touch on our store growth and capital investments in the first quarter. We opened a total of 38 net new stores across the U.S. and Mexico. Our new store performance continues to meet our high expectations, driven by the teams of professional parts people that we have behind the counter in every new store and the distribution capability to deliver the inventory availability that our customers expect from us. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $287 million, and we still expect a total capital expenditure investment for 2025 of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. The major projects behind this spend are on track, and we are excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us in all of our market areas.\nAs I conclude my comments, I would like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their hard work and dedication to starting the year right, in 2025. And I look forward to the opportunities we have ahead of us this year, and I have full confidence in our team to take on any challenge that presents itself. Now I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to thank all of Team O'Reilly for their continued commitment to our company and our customers. Now we will fill in some additional details on our first quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2025.\nFor the first quarter, sales increased to $161 million, driven by a 3.6% increase in comparable store sales, and a $73 million non-comp contribution from stores opened in 2024 and 2025 that have not yet entered the comp base, partially offset by a 125 basis point headwind to our total sales increase from 1 less selling day as a result of Leap Day in the first quarter of 2024. As a reminder, the impact from Leap Day is excluded from our comparable store sales. For 2025, we continue to expect our total revenues to be between $17.4 billion and $17.7 billion.\nOur first quarter effective tax rate was 21.3% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.2%, reduced by a 1.9% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the first quarter of 2024 rate of 21.9% of pretax income which was comprised of a base tax rate of 24.2% reduced by a 2.3% benefit for share-based compensation. Our first quarter effective tax rate was below our expectations as a result of the benefit we realized from share-based compensation. For the full year of 2025, we now expect an effective tax rate of 22.4% comprised of a base rate of 23%, reduced by a benefit of 0.6% for share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain open tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate as we saw in the first quarter.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2025 was $455 million versus $439 million in 2024. The increase of $16 million was a result of modest working capital improvements, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. For 2025, our expected free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at a range of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion. I also want to touch briefly on our AP to inventory ratio. We finished the first quarter at 126%, which was down from 128% at the end of 2024, but slightly above our expectations. For 2025, we expect to see continued moderation resulting from our planned incremental inventory investment across our store and distribution network and currently expect to finish the year at a ratio of approximately 125%.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.03x as compared to our end of 2024 ratio of 1.99x with a modest increase in adjusted debt partially offset by EBITDA growth. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We also completed the renewal of our revolving credit facility at the end of the first quarter, which extended the maturity for an additional 5 years and upsized the facility to $2.25 billion. We appreciate the support of our bank partners and believe this sizing provides the appropriate amount of liquidity for our business. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program, and during the first quarter, we repurchased 431,000 shares at an average share price of $1,297 for total investment of $559 million. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs a reminder, our EPS guidance, as Brad outlined earlier, includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I open up our call for your questions, I would like to thank our team for their hard work and dedication to start 2025. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matthew, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Brad Beckham.\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts fourth quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.\nTo begin today's call, I'd like to recognize the hard work and commitment demonstrated by our team of over 93,000 professional parts people throughout 2024. It is their commitment to our company and our customers that enabled us to deliver a solid year, highlighted by an increase in comparable store sales of 2.9% and an increase in diluted earnings per share of 5.7%.\n2024 was a challenging year across the automotive aftermarket, and our financial results reflected the headwinds our industry faced, finishing below the expectations we set for our business entering 2024. Our team has established a long track record of robust growth and profitability. So we are never fully satisfied when we fall short of that high bar.\nHowever, we are pleased with our team's ability to navigate the challenging environment and still deliver increases in comparable store sales and earnings per share, representing our 32nd consecutive year of growth in these metrics since becoming a public company. We are very pleased to have delivered record earnings despite a $0.46 headwind to EPS, resulting from a fourth quarter charge of $35 million to adjust our auto claims self-insurance liabilities, which Brent will discuss in more detail during his prepared comments.\nThis charge was a headwind of over 1% to the full year EPS growth we reported for 2024. The charge was even more impactful to the fourth quarter, representing a headwind of approximately 5% to the 2.6% EPS growth we reported for the quarter.\nNow I'd like to take a few minutes to provide some color on our fourth quarter sales results. Our comparable store sales for the fourth quarter grew 4.4%, which was at the high end of our expectations. Our sales growth was driven by solid results in both professional and DIY. The relative performance between the two sides of our business was more balanced than the fourth quarter than we experienced in the first 9 months of 2024.\nOur professional business again delivered mid-single-digit comp growth, while DIY grew just over 3%, the best quarterly result in 2024. To some degree, our fourth quarter results were consistent with the pressured demand environment we have experienced throughout 2024. The headwinds we have seen from broad-based pressure on consumers persisted in the fourth quarter and were reflected in continued softness in discretionary categories, such as tools, accessories and performance parts.\nHowever, we saw continued strong demand in maintenance categories in the fourth quarter. We also benefited from strong performance in winter weather-related categories as we calendared easier comparisons to the mild start of winter in the fourth quarter of 2023. Harsh inclement winter weather creates a tailwind to our business, and the timing of when we have experienced this type of weather has created some variability over the last few years. As a reminder, last year, we really did not see severe winter weather in the fourth quarter of 2023 with more of the harsh conditions that support our business arriving in January of 2024.\nSo far, this season has been more typical as we have seen the impact of winter weather spread out a little more evenly. As a result, from a cadence perspective, our business in the quarter was steady month-to-month when viewed relative to the normal sales volume trends in our business.\nOur comps in October benefited from 2024 having 1 less Sunday than the prior year, and our December comps reflected the easier weather comparisons. Again, these monthly variances were driven by prior year comparisons and not by variability in our business within the fourth quarter of the current year.\nNext, I'll discuss average ticket and traffic dynamics underpinning our sales growth for the fourth quarter. Ticket count growth was the larger contributor to our comparable store sales increase in the quarter, again led by the professional side of our business, in line with the consistent strength we saw throughout 2024.\nDIY ticket counts also grew in the fourth quarter, representing our best quarterly performance for the year, as this side benefited from solid performance in maintenance categories and the favorable winter weather comparisons.\nOn a 2-year stack basis, which smooths out the effect of the timing of impact of weather, fourth quarter DIY traffic was down slightly, in line with full year 2024 trends. We believe our customer transaction count results lead the industry on both sides of our business, reflecting continued market share gains in a tough environment.\nAverage ticket values were also a positive contributor to our comp growth in the fourth quarter and included a benefit from same SKU inflation of just under 1%. For the full year of 2024, our 2.9% comparable store sales increase was at the high end of the revised guidance range we provided on last quarter's call but just below the 3% to 5% guidance we set at the beginning of the year. The sales growth achieved in 2024 was on top of the robust increases our team delivered in 2023 and 2022 of 7.9% and 6.4%, respectively.\nAgainst the tougher industry backdrop, our team has worked diligently to double down on our efforts to provide the best customer service in our industry, allowing us to both sustain the business we have earned from our customers over the last few years and further grow our market share.\nNext, I want to transition to a discussion of our guidance for 2025, starting with our sales outlook. As we disclosed in our earnings release yesterday, we're establishing our annual comparable store sales guidance for 2025 at a range of 2% to 4%. And we want to provide a snapshot of how we view both industry and macroeconomic conditions and our prospects for the coming year.\nAs we've discussed over the last few quarters, the current environment in the automotive aftermarket has been challenging but is not unlike other cycles we've seen over our decades of experience in our industry. We operate in an extremely stable sector of retail, and our customers are very resilient in periods of economic uncertainty. The dynamics of the car park also contribute to stability in R&D. Vehicles are engineered and manufactured to be reliably driven at higher mileages. This reliability, coupled with the substantial cost that -- creates a compelling value proposition for customers to invest in the repair and maintenance necessary to keep their existing vehicles on the road. The result has been a growing U.S. car park characterized by an increased average vehicle age with steady growth in total miles driven, supports durable demand in the automotive aftermarket.\nAgainst this stable backdrop, our industry has encountered years similar to 2024, where industry-wide growth is hard to come by and positive sales momentum is only available through market share gains and industry consolidation. We remain confident these periods are short-lived and that our industry consistently rebounds due to the core strength of the demand drivers underpinned by the vehicle population.\nAs such, we are optimistic in the long-term fundamentals of our industry and the prospects for conditions to improve as we move through 2025. However, we remain cautious regarding the potential for worsening economic conditions or the possibility of short-term economic shocks, particularly pressure to the consumer from sustained high price levels, rapidly increasing interest rates or energy costs, spikes in gas prices or other adverse circumstances. These considerations are built into our 2025 outlook and full year guidance but are particularly relevant as we enter the year on a similar trajectory to our 2024 exit and face challenging comparisons in the first quarter on a multiyear basis.\nOur focus as a company is to control our own destiny and drive our industry-leading results in any market condition, and our performance this year will ultimately depend on our effectiveness in executing our business model and providing exceptional customer service.\nTo that end, we expect both our DIY and professional businesses to be positive contributors to our comparable store sales growth in 2025. We anticipate stronger growth in professional from increased ticket counts driven by an expected higher industry growth rate on this side of the business and by our ability to continue to capture market share. We also expect to be a DIY share gainer but expect these gains to be offset by the long-term industry dynamic of pressure to ticket counts resulting from increased parts quality and corresponding extended service and repair intervals.\nAs a result, we anticipate DIY traffic will be down slightly in 2025 but that a higher ticket value associated with the increasing complexity and quality of parts will drive comparable store sales growth in DIY similar to our experience in 2024.\nOur projected outlook for average ticket growth in 2025 assumes a benefit from same-SKU inflation of approximately 1%. Consistent with our historical practice, we are assuming only modest increases in price levels from this point forward in 2025.\nIn a few moments, Brent will discuss how we view the potential for increased tariffs on our supply chain and margin outlook. For now, I will just highlight that our sales assumptions exclude any changes in tariffs as it remains too early to project the impact to our business.\nBefore I move on from our sales guidance, I would like to highlight our expectations for the quarterly cadence of our sales growth in 2025. We expect our quarterly comparable store sales growth to be relatively even throughout 2025 with relatively minor differences driven by more challenging headwinds in the first and fourth quarter and easier compares in the second and third quarters. Thus far, in the first quarter, our sales volumes are tracking in line with our expectations against the tough comparison to favorable winter weather in January of last year.\nNow I'd like to move on to discuss our capital investment and expansion plans. Our capital expenditures for 2024 were just over $1 billion, in line with 2023 and marginally above our full year guidance range driven by the timing of spend on distribution infrastructure projects. For 2025, we are setting our capital expenditure guidance at $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. The increased level of projected investment is centered around our plans to accelerate our store and distribution expansion.\nStarting with our store network. We disclosed on last call our target of 200 to 210 net new store openings for 2025. The increase in new store openings reflects our continued strong new store performance and our confidence in our ability to successfully balance our organic growth with greenfield growth across our North American footprint.\nFor domestic U.S. store growth, our projected new store openings are spread across over [ 25 ] different states, balanced between expansion in newer markets in the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic and Puerto Rico as well as backfill in existing markets coast to coast. Our plans also include continued growth in Mexico. In 2024, we opened 25 new stores in Mexico, bringing our store count to 87 stores and expect to open a similar number of stores in 2025. We are still in the early innings of our expansion in Mexico, but we are gaining momentum and capitalizing on the opportunity to spread new store growth over several market areas while at the same time also beginning to increase density in markets outside of our core historical base in Guadalajara.\nWe are also building the development muscle necessary for greenfield new store growth in Canada. Our 2025 target does not yet include a substantial number of new stores in Canada, but the coming year will be an important one to build out organic capabilities and advance the development of the new store pipeline that will fuel our growth in the coming years.\nBeyond the increase in our new store targets, we are also expected to increase our growth capital spend as a result of two additional factors: a continuing shift to owned new store growth versus lease stores and incremental investments in our hub store network. Our ability to successfully open stores that increasingly generate higher sales volumes and stronger cash flows is driving enhanced returns on capital invested in our new store growth.\nIn light of these strong returns, we are planning 2025 new store openings to include a projected 60%-40% mix of owned versus leased stores. We are also pleased with the returns we have generated through our ongoing expansion and enhancement of our hub store network. Our ability to support our stores with quick access to broad localized SKU availability is an important factor in our ability to effectively compete and take market share on both sides of the business.\nWe have executed our hub strategy for decades. One of the strengths of this strategy is our flexibility to adjust the number, location and [indiscernible] of our hub stores to ensure our network provides our customers with the best access to inventory in each of our markets. As such, our capital investment projections for 2025 include planned increases in the number and size of our hub stores.\nThe second major driver of our 2025 CapEx outlook is our continued investment in distribution capabilities. The competitive advantage we maintain in industry-leading inventory availability is fueled by our substantial investment in our distribution network. And Brent will provide an update on our current distribution projects and expectations for 2025 during his supply chain update.\nOur store hub and distribution expansion represents the lion's share of the planned growth in CapEx for 2025, but also included in our outlook are continued ongoing investments to maintain and refresh the image and appearance of our store fleet as well as continued strategic investments in technology.\nAs I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for your unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service every day in each of our over 6,300 stores.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would also like to begin my comments this morning by congratulating Team O'Reilly on a solid finish to 2024. Today, I will further discuss our fourth quarter and full year operational results and provide some additional color on our outlook for 2025.\nStarting with gross margin. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 51.3% was in line with the fourth quarter 2023, which was within our range of expectations. Our full year gross margin came in at 51.2%, which was down 6 basis points from the prior year and in line with our expectations. The year-over-year comparison includes the headwind from the inclusion of our acquired Canadian business, which finished the year at the expected 30 basis point impact.\nOur 2024 gross margin also -- was also impacted by a mix headwind of approximately 11 basis points from the outsized strong performance in our professional business. These pressures were offset by incremental improvements in acquisition cost, achieved through the efforts of our supply chain and operations teams with outstanding support from our supplier partners.\nWe have been pleased with our consistent solid gross margin results and expect to see further expansion of gross margin in 2025 as we lap our 2024 gains and anticipate additional opportunities to reduce acquisition costs. We also expect to continue to incrementally drive distribution efficiencies.\nBased on these expectations, we have established a guidance range for 2025 of 51.2% to 51.7%, representing an increase of 25 basis points over 2024 at the midpoint. We remain very bullish on our prospect to generate gross profit dollar growth driven by the premium value proposition that our supply chain, store operations and sales teams create for our customers.\nOur outlook for gross profit assumes a stable inflation environment and the expectation that our industry will remain rational from a pricing perspective. As Brad previously mentioned, we have not incorporated any impact from changes to tariffs. At this time, it is difficult to assess the exact timing, duration and magnitude of any tariff provisions that will occur and the way that suppliers, competitors and customers will respond to any changes.\nWhile it isn't prudent to adjust our forecast to quantify the different possible paths these developments could take, we remain very confident in our ability to manage effectively in a changing environment. Our experience during the last round of significant tariffs in 2018 and 2019 is a clear demonstration that our industry behaves rationally in response to increased acquisition costs. This rationality was further demonstrated during the period of heightened inflation from 2021 to 2023. We fully expect this dynamic to continue and anticipate our industry will have both the ability and the resolve to appropriately pass through any increased tariff cost.\nFrom a cadence perspective, our quarterly gross margin remained relatively consistent throughout 2024, and we expect a similar quarterly cadence as we move through 2025.\nNext, I want to provide an update on some supply chain and distribution initiatives. Our unwavering commitment to providing the best possible parts availability in the industry is a critical component of our business model and a primary contributor to our long-term success. This commitment is reflected in the continued investments we make in our supply chain, distribution network, hub store network and inventory position. And 2024 was a very successful year for Team O'Reilly in these areas.\nOn the distribution side, we successfully completed the relocation of our distribution centers in Springfield, Missouri and Atlanta, Georgia to larger, more efficient facilities. Since our last earnings call, the new Atlanta distribution center began servicing stores in the fourth quarter, and we are extremely pleased with the seamless opening of this new facility. This 690,000 square foot facility will have the ability to service 350 stores with direct import processing capabilities and will further fuel our growth in a core market area for our company.\nWe are also nearing the completion of our new greenfield distribution center in Staff, Virginia and expect to start providing exceptional service to stores in the Mid-Atlantic region out of this facility in the back half of 2025.\nAs we've discussed earlier, the addition of this DC opens up a new section of the map, and we are excited to lean into growth in these new markets. We are also making great progress on the expansion of our existing distribution center in Lakeland, Florida and are eager to improve the efficiency of this building and unlock additional capacity when this project is complete at the end of 2025.\nFinally, our capital investment outlook for 2025 includes dollars allocated to future expansion and development of our distribution infrastructure. We do not currently have specific details on the next slate of projects, but we continue to proactively align our distribution strategy to the store growth opportunities that Brad outlined earlier. In line with physical expansion of our distribution and hub networks, we are targeting inventory investments in 2025 as another key component of planned enhancement to our industry-leading parts availability.\nOur inventory per store at the end of 2024 was $799,000, which was up 5.5% from the end of last year driven by our continued opportunistic investment to support our sales momentum. In 2025, we are projecting an additional per store inventory of 5% with a little over half of that increase driven by the investments in our expanded distribution center and hub store inventory layers. The remainder of the increase is capitalized on targeted additions to our stores to ensure that we're offering the best possible local assortment and inventory availability.\nNow I want to spend some time covering our SG&A and operating profit performance for 2024 and our outlook for 2025. Fourth quarter SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 33.3%, up 68 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023. This significant increase was driven by a $35 million charge, representing 85 basis points, to adjust reserves relating to our self-insurance liabilities for historic auto liability claims.\nAs we noted in our press release yesterday, the adjustment relates to claims that occurred prior to 2024 and reflects adverse claim development spanning multiple years of exposure to losses from accidents incurred in the operation of our store delivery fleet. Unfortunately, we have realized significant inflation in the cost to resolve these claims. This pressure, coupled with slower development time lines, resulted in the need to make the significant adjustment we recorded in the fourth quarter. The adjustment was driven both by our experience in administering and resolving these claims and also from revised assumptions that we use to estimate future liabilities.\nWhile the charge was driven by significant increases in cost, on an average claim basis rather than an increased frequency of accidents, we're taking all steps possible to improve safety, reduce accident rates and limit future loss exposure.\nAverage per store SG&A expenses for the full year of 2024 were up 4.6% with 0.7% of that growth reflecting the fourth quarter charge. Excluding the adjustment, for the pre-2024 auto claims, our per store SG&A growth was in line with our revised expectations of 3.5% to 4% and below the guidance range that we set at the beginning of the year of 4.5% to 5% growth.\nWhile we are certainly disappointed by the negative impact of the charge to our fourth quarter results, we are otherwise pleased in how we finished out 2024 and the productivity of the rest of our SG&A spend in the quarter, which generated 18 basis points of leverage over the prior year on a 3% increase in SG&A per store.\nAs we look forward to 2025, we are planning to grow average SG&A per store by 2% to 2.5%, which equates to 2.5% to 3% growth, excluding the impact of lapping the fourth quarter 2024 charge. Based on our SG&A expectations and projected gross margin range, we are setting our operating profit guidance range at 19.2% to 19.7%, which at the midpoint is in line with our full year 2024 results. Since our guidance range implicitly assumes a year-over-year benefit of approximately 20 basis points from calendaring the fourth quarter 2024 charge, we are also expecting an offsetting pressure to operating margin.\nOur SG&A outlook for 2025 anticipates the prudent actions our team will take to manage expenses to effectively execute our business appropriately in response to market conditions in a similar fashion to the steps that we took to adjust operating expenses down as we moved through 2024. However, these expense measures are limited by our expectation of modest pressure to wage rates as well as investments in key capabilities, including the hub store and technology initiatives that Brad outlined earlier.\nWe remain committed to investing in our business to grow market share and drive industry-leading results. We have been pleased with our ability to capitalize on our strong competitive positioning and sustain our industry-leading growth momentum, and we'll continue to judiciously manage our capital and operating investments to drive long-term growth and high returns.\nAs I conclude my comments, I would like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their hard work and dedication in 2024. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to thank all of Team O'Reilly for their continued commitment to our company and our customers. Now we will fill in some additional details on our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2025.\nFor the fourth quarter, sales increased $264 million driven by a 4.4% increase in comparable store sales and a $66 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2023 and 2024 that have not yet entered the comp base. For 2025, we expect our total revenues to be between $17.4 billion and $17.7 billion.\nOur fourth quarter effective tax rate was 19.6% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 20.4% reduced by a 0.7% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2023 rate of 17.7% of pretax income, comprised of a base tax rate of 18.9% reduced by a 1.2% benefit for share-based compensation. The fourth quarter of 2024 base rate as compared to 2023 was higher as a result of the timing of recognition of certain tax credits.\nFor the full year, our effective tax rate was 21.6% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 22.9% reduced by 1.3% for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2025, we expect an effective tax rate of 22.6%, comprised of a base rate of 23% reduced by a benefit of 0.4% for share-based compensation. We expect the quarterly rate to fluctuate due to variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation and the tolling of certain tax periods in the fourth quarter.\nAs we outlined in our press release yesterday, we have established our earnings per share guidance for 2025 at $42.60 to $43.10, which reflects an increase over 2024 EPS of 5.4% at the midpoint. The year-over-year increase reflected in our guidance range includes both the benefit of calendaring the fourth quarter 2024 self-insurance charge as well as the headwind from the increase in our expected effective tax rate with the impacts from these items roughly offsetting.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results in 2024 and our expectations for 2025. Free cash flow for 2024 was $2 billion, which was unchanged from 2023. Pressure to free cash flow in 2024 from the timing of tax payments and purchases of renewable energy tax credits, which we were able to defer in 2023, was offset by growth in net income and a decrease in net inventory in 2024 versus an investment in net inventory in 2023.\nFor 2025, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion. The expected reduction in free cash flow is driven by the incremental capital expenditures and inventory investments Brad and Brent outlined in their prepared comments, partially offset by growth in operating income.\nI also want to touch briefly on our AP-to-inventory ratio. We finished the fourth quarter at 128%, which was down from 131% at the end of 2023 but marginally better than our expectations for the end of 2024. For 2025, we expect to see continued moderation resulting from our planned incremental inventory investment across our store and distribution network and currently expect to finish the year at a ratio of approximately 125%.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.99x as compared to our end of 2023 ratio of 2.03x with a modest increase in adjusted debt more than offset by EBITDA growth. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time.\nWe continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And for 2024, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at an average share price of $1,072 for a total investment of $2.1 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2011, we have repurchased 96 million shares at an average share price of $264 for a total investment of $25.4 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nBefore I open up our call for your questions, I would like to thank our team for their hard work and the commitment to excellent customer service that drives our success. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matt, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Holly, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our second quarter 2024 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend, guidance, target or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Brad Beckham.\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Hensley, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. .\nI'd like to begin my comments today by thanking our team of over 91,000 hard-working professional parts people across North America for their continued dedication to our customers during a challenging second quarter. As we'll discuss during our call today, our second quarter results were below our expectations as we faced broader headwinds to demand in our industry. However, we are pleased with the job our teams did to uphold our commitment to providing top-notch customer service to our customers on both sides of our business. Despite a sales performance that fell short of what we have come to expect we continue to outperform the industry. This is the direct result of our team maintaining a high level of attention to detail and doubling down on their efforts to provide even better service to our customers. We finished the second quarter with a 2.3% comparable store sales increase on top of a 9% in the prior year. The pressure to top line sales also negatively impacted our operating profit and earnings per share results and we have revised our full year outlook for these metrics as outlined in our press release last night. Though our results were below our expectations for the quarter, we were still able to generate increased operating profit and EPS on top of several years of robust growth. We now expect our full year EPS to come in within a range of $40.75 to $41.25 with the adjustments reflecting our results in the second quarter and revised full year comparable store sales and operational outlook. At the midpoint of our updated range, our guidance represents a forecasted 7% increase in full year EPS, which matches our EPS growth in the first half of 2024. Our ability to generate solid EPS growth in a challenging macro environment, especially in light of the comparison to the 15% growth we delivered in 2023 is a testament to the continued strong execution by Team O'Reilly.\nNow I'd like to dig in further to our results in the second quarter by walking through the details of our sales performance, starting with our cadence of sales in the quarter. As we discussed on our last call, our quarter started off with sluggish results in April as we faced headwinds from cool wet weather during the spring selling season. The softness in our business persisted into May, which we believe reflected broad-based pressure throughout the industry. As we entered June, we saw improved trends driven by strong performance in hot weather-related categories. On a week-to-week basis relative to our original guidance expectations, June represented the strongest performance for our quarter. So far in July, sales trends have remained solid with weather benefit we saw in June, moderating somewhat as we compare to similar favorable hot weather in July of last year.\nOur comparable store sales growth in the second quarter was driven by continued strength in our professional business, where we delivered yet another quarter of mid-single-digit comps. While increases in average ticket values were positive contributors to comps on both sides of our business, the majority of our professional sales growth was fueled by robust growth in ticket counts. Our results in the second quarter came on top of prior year comparisons to mid-teens professional comps in 2023, and we attribute our robust 2-year stack performance to our industry-leading customer service and inventory availability. We continue to be excited by our team's ability to leverage the momentum we created in our professional business, and we remain bullish on our prospects to compound our share growth in what remains a highly fragmented professional market.\nThe strength in our professional business was partially offset by headwinds in DIY comparable store sales, which were down just shy of 1% for the quarter from pressure on ticket counts. Average ticket values on both sides of our business benefited from modest same-SKU inflation of less than 1%. From a category perspective, our results for the quarter were highlighted by the strong performance in hot weather categories, including batteries and HVAC as well as solid performance in maintenance categories like brakes, oil changes and spark plugs, which we believe reflects the ongoing priority our customers are placing on keeping their vehicles on the road and running well.\nThe sales softness we experienced in the quarter was more pronounced in the discretionary appearance and accessory categories. These categories comprise of a small percentage of our business and typically are not primary drivers of our comparable store sales results. However, demand for these products is more susceptible to volatility in periods where consumers are pressured and that dynamic contributed to our sales shortfall in the second quarter.\nWe also saw some sluggishness on both sides of our business in certain under car hard part categories, which performed below the company average. These types of repair parts are impacted by cumulative wear and tear and have been key contributors to our professional sales growth and share gains over the past 2 years. While we still believe we are performing well in these categories relative to the industry, our results in the second quarter may be indicative of temporary pressure across the broader industry. Against this backdrop of mixed results in our business for the first half of 2024, we continue to have confidence in the long-term fundamental drivers of demand for our industry, but also remain cautious about the current market environment. We still view the average consumer as relatively healthy with strong employment and wage rates underpinning the ability of our customers to invest in the repair and maintenance of their vehicles. However, we also believe we're seeing some level of conservatism in how consumers are managing their spend as they face the cumulative impact of elevated price levels and uncertainty about the broader macroeconomic conditions. Historically, more challenging periods in our industry are characterized by this type of short-term adjustment on the part of economically constrained DIY consumers. That said, we are cognizant of the potential that demand could be impacted during the back half of the year if this economic uncertainty persists, particularly during an election year.\nGiven this outlook and the trends we have seen in the first half of 2024, we are lowering our full year comparable store sales guidance to 2% to 4%, which reflects both our second quarter results and our updated expectations for the third and fourth quarter. We believe the pressure that our industry is experiencing will prove to be a short-term headwind. Our experience through multiple similar cycles in our company's history gives us confidence that the core drivers of demand for the automotive aftermarket remain very solid. The size and growth of the car park in North America coupled with the quality of vehicles and a continually rising average vehicle age drive resilient demand in our industry. We expect to see continued steady growth in total miles driven, underpinned by population growth and the critical nature of the daily transportation needs of vehicle owners.\nWe also believe that the value proposition for continued investment in an existing vehicle has never been higher and that consumers will continue to prioritize funding the cost of repair and maintenance of older, higher mileage vehicles. Ultimately, the macroeconomic conditions we face do not affect our company's philosophy for how we execute our business model. We have instilled an ownership mentality throughout our organization. Our run it like you own philosophy does not accept external pressures as an excuse when there is still market share to gain in every local market, simply by outhustling and outservicing our competition. Even though we believe we gained market share in the first half of 2024 in a tough environment, I can guarantee that none of our teams in our stores distribution centers and offices are satisfied with a 2.8% year-to-date comparable store sales increase. Our teams are committed to putting in the work, it takes to win every day in every one of our markets and remain hungry to achieve performance that matches the high bar we have set as a company. As I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for your commitment to our customers our company and to your fellow team members.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would also like to join Brad in thanking Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success and their steadfast commitment to excellent customer service. Our team's ability to gain market share in a challenging industry environment is a testament to their professionalism and dedication to our customers.\nToday, I would like to begin my comments by discussing our second quarter gross margin results. For the quarter, our gross margin of 50.7% was down 53 basis points from the second quarter of 2023 with approximately 35 basis points of the decrease driven by the acquisition of our Canadian business. As a reminder, the acquired Vast-Auto business operates a higher mix of distribution sales to independent parts stores at substantially lower gross margins. As we have worked to align their financial reporting, we now expect the headwind to gross margin from the addition of their results to be slightly higher than our original expectations with 30 to 35 basis points of dilution anticipated for the remainder of 2024. However, our outlook for the net impact of the acquired business is unchanged, and we still expect only a 15 basis point headwind to operating profit in 2024.\nExcluding the impact of the Canadian business in the second quarter, our gross margin results came in below our expectations, driven by a few different factors. First, the category composition of our sales that Brad outlined earlier, resulted in a product mix margin headwind as some of the solid results we saw in maintenance products carry a lower margin than the pressured undercar categories. We also saw some pressure to distribution costs in our gross margin from the deleverage of fixed cost on the below planned second quarter sales.\nFinally, our second quarter results include a slightly larger-than-anticipated headwind from the mix of DIY and professional business as the headwinds we saw to sales were more significantly felt in our higher-margin DIY business. While we are cognizant that we can experience these types of puts and takes in any given quarter, our outlook on the core drivers of our gross margin performance is unchanged. We continue to be confident in the stability of both acquisition costs and selling prices of our business and believe we have the ability to incrementally improve gross margins by delivering on premium value proposition we create for our supplier partners and customers.\nIn the second quarter, we saw a stable acquisition cost environment with the anticipated mix of incremental cost improvements and modest inflation pressure. Pricing remains rational in the industry. and we expect it to remain so in the future. Based on our results for the first half of 2024 and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are maintaining our full year gross margin guidance range of 51% to 51.5%.\nTurning to SG&A. Our second quarter results reflect prudent and appropriate expense management by our teams against the softer sales backdrop. On an average per-store basis, our SG&A grew 2.8% in the second quarter with approximately 10 basis points of that growth driven by the inclusion of Canada's operating results. Our SG&A spend was below our original outlook for the second quarter as our teams effectively balanced our unwavering commitment to deliver industry-leading customer service while also prudently dialing in the appropriate staffing levels to match our business. While we are certainly not pleased with the deleverage of our operating expenses resulting from pressure to comparable store sales, we remain committed to maintaining a high standard of customer service and will not make dramatic adjustments to our SG&A spend that would negatively impact our ability to serve our customers.\nOne of the greatest resources as an organization is the professionalism and experience of our store team leaders. An excellent example of the strength of our leadership bench is the quality and tenure of our group of over 600 district managers who each have responsibility for an average of 10 stores. Our district manager group averages more than 14 years of service with Team O'Reilly. And each of these leaders is actively engaged on a daily basis to identify and capitalize on opportunities to enhance the service we provide to our customers while also optimizing the productivity of the dollars we spend in each of our stores. Our ability to execute our business model at a high level and over 6,000 stores is the direct result of the broad-based experience and industry knowledge across the company. We believe that our consistency in delivering excellent customer service in all market conditions, driven by this experienced leadership team has been critical to our long-term success. Ultimately, our customers require and deserve a high level of service regardless of the broader market conditions. Our commitment to work that much harder to earn their business in a challenging environment simply represents another opportunity for us to develop strong long-term relationships and grow our share of the business over time.\nAs we look to the back half of 2024, we are cognizant of the sales volatility we could face, as Brad discussed earlier and expect to continue to judiciously manage SG&A expenses to match the business environment. Based on our results thus far in 2024 and updated outlook for the remainder of the year, we now expect full year SG&A per store to grow between 3.5% to 4%, down from our previous guidance of 4.5% to 5%. This guidance range assumes a more moderate impact from the addition of our Canadian business of approximately 0.2% of per store SG&A growth, which is revised from our previous expectation of one half of 1%. While our updated SG&A range reflects our current expectation for the rest of 2024, we will continue to adjust as appropriate. Based on our first half performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are updating our operating margin guidance and now expect the full year to come in within a range of 19.6% to 20.1%, which is a 10 basis point reduction from our previous guidance.\nBefore I conclude my comments, I would like to provide an update on our inventory and capital expenditure and expansion results. Inventory per store finished the quarter at $767,000, which was up just under 1% from this time last year and 1.4% from the end of 2023. We continue to be pleased with the health of our supply chain and our store in-stock position remains strong. We are leaving unchanged our 2024 target of 4% growth in inventory per store within our existing chain, excluding the impact of the acquired Vast-Auto inventory. We plan to opportunistically add inventory in the back half of the year to supplement our store, hub and DC level inventories ensuring that we are offering the best inventory availability in all of the markets that we serve.\nWe opened a total of 27 stores during the second quarter and remain on track to open 190 to 200 new stores in 2024. During the first half of the year, 7 of our 64 new store openings have been in Mexico, bringing our store count in Mexico to 69 stores. with an expectation to open an additional 15 to 20 stores in the back half of 2024. While our footprint in Mexico is still relatively small, and we are still only in the early innings of our growth. We continue to be excited about the attractiveness of the Mexican market and our prospects to grow a strong and profitable business there over time. We are also very excited about our new business in Canada and continue to be pleased with the partnership that we have formed with our Canadian team. Capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2024 were $475 million, which is in line with our expectations with a heavy weighting towards our ambitious plans to invest in new store and distribution expansion projects.\nTo close my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our customers. Our success is dependent upon providing the best customer service in our industry. and I'm confident in our team's ability to maintain this very high standard and deliver a strong finish to 2024.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to add my thanks to all of Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's long-term success.\nNow we will cover some additional details on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2024. For the quarter, sales increased $203 million, driven by a 2.3% increase in comparable store sales and a $70 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2023 and 2024 that have not yet entered the comp base.\nFor 2024, we now expect our total revenues to be between $16.6 billion and $16.9 billion. Our second quarter effective tax rate was 23.3% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.9% reduced by a 0.6% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the second quarter of 2023 rate of 22.5% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 24.3% reduced by a 1.8% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2024, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 22.4% comprised of a base rate of 23.2%, reduced by a benefit of 0.8% for share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the totaling of certain tax periods and variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the 6 months of 2024 was $1.2 billion, in line with the first half of 2023, with growth in income offset by a lower benefit from a reduction in net inventory this year versus 2023. For 2024, our expected free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at a range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion.\nOur AP as a percentage of inventory finished the second quarter at 130%, down from 131% at the end of 2023. This ratio was slightly above our expectations, driven by the timing of inventory investments in the first half of the year. We continue to expect to see moderation in our AP to inventory percentage in the back half of 2024 and expect to finish the year at a ratio of approximately 127%.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of 1.97x as compared to our end of 2023 ratio of 2.03x, with the decrease driven by a reduction in borrowings under our commercial paper program. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 784,000 shares at an average price of $1,012 for a total investment of $794 million. Year-to-date through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at an average share price of $1,020 for a total investment of $1.3 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance Brad outlined earlier, includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nBefore I close my comments today, I have one final item to cover as it relates to our Investor Relations function at O'Reilly and the change we will be making to our team. After more than 15 years as our Head of IR, Mark Merz will be transitioning into another key role with our company. Many of you who have interacted with Mark closely over the years understand that in addition to his duties managing our investor engagement and communications, Mark is also a senior leader in our finance team and a key partner to business leaders across our company. Beginning in a few months, Mark will be leveraging that deep experience and knowledge of our business as he takes on a new role as an in-country leader in our Mexican operation. As we continue to grow our business in Mexico, we have an opportunity to build on a strong foundation for success and growth in what we believe will be a large and important market for our company. In this new position, Mark will be taking on a key senior leadership role, working in tandem with our growing leadership team in Mexico. We plan to make this transition at the end of our third quarter, so Mark will continue to serve in his current role and be available to answer your questions about our business and second quarter results. During that process, he will also be managing the handoff of our primary Investor Relations contact function to Leslie Skorick. Leslie is a tenured O'Reilly team member with over 9 years of experience with our company and currently heads up our tax function as Senior Director of Tax, but will now be adding Investor Relations to her duties. Mark and Leslie will be managing this hand off over the next couple of months, including the opportunity for you to meet Leslie at our upcoming Analyst Day in August in Chicago. In addition, many of you have interacted with Eric Bird, another senior leader on our finance team, and he will continue to serve in his same role as an additional point of contact to support engagement with our investor community. This concludes our prepared comments.\nAt this time, I would like to ask Holly the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our first quarter 2024 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Brad Beckham.\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts first quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.\nI'll begin our call today by thanking our over 90,000 team members for their relentless dedication to providing the knowledge and expertise our customers have come to expect and rely on from the professional parts people at O'Reilly Auto Parts. We are truly in a people business where relationships and customer service are paramount, and Team O'Reilly continues to demonstrate their ability to outhustle, out service and, in turn, outperform our competition. We finished the first quarter with a 3.4% comparable store sales growth on top of a 10.8% in the prior year. Our continued strong top line sales results are dependent on and driven by consistent daily execution across all of our 6,200-plus stores in the U.S., Mexico, Puerto Rico and now Canada.\nDriving continued growth in our store volumes does not get easier as our company gets bigger, especially as we build on the significant market share gains we have captured over the last few years. Our single greatest challenge as a company and the driving factor to our success is our ability to build and develop teams and leaders who will be the standard bearers of our culture far into the future.\nOur leaders across our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices are relentlessly dedicated to perpetuating our culture and investing in our people. Thank you, Team O'Reilly for your commitment to our customers, our company and your fellow team members.\nNow I'd like to start our discussion of the first quarter by walking through the details of our sales performance. Starting with comparable store sales, our growth of 3.4% in the quarter was within our full year guidance range, but slightly below our expectations as we saw some volatility I will discuss in more detail in a moment. We drove solid performance and positive comps in both our DIY and professional businesses in the quarter with the mid-single-digit comps in Professional being the larger driver of our results, consistent with our expectation and ongoing trends. Increases in average ticket values and ticket counts were both contributors to comp growth on both sides of our business with inflation at about 1%, in line with our full year expectations.\nNext, I want to provide some color on the cadence of our sales results in the first quarter. As we have discussed in the past, our first quarter can be volatile as we see variability in our business from both the type and severity of winter weather and from the timing of the onset of spring. We were pleased to generate positive comparable store sales results in each month of the quarter. However, we did experience the choppiness that can be characteristic of first quarter, especially as we exited with a slow start to spring. As we reported on last quarter's earnings call, we produced solid results in January, which benefited from harsh winter weather in many of our markets.\nMoving past the winter weather in January, our business was negatively impacted through much of February by the timing of individual income tax refunds. Typically, we see a benefit starting early in February and ramping through the month that coincides with the distribution of tax refunds. However, there was a noticeable delay in the processing of refunds this year that pressured both sides of our business. These pressures moderated as the cumulative amount of refunds begin to catch up to the prior year, and we saw improved trends at the end of February in the first half of March. However, we also experienced unseasonably cool wet weather throughout March across many of our markets. As a result, March and the full quarter finished slightly below our expectations. The trends we saw as we exited the first quarter have continued into April as we still really haven't seen the uptick in our business that typically accompanies sustained favorable spring weather.\nThe choppiness we saw in the first quarter more significantly impacted DIY business, which is in line with what we have seen historically. Our DIY customers are often working on their vehicles in their driveways. So weather conditions can impact their ability and willingness to perform repair, maintenance and tune up items that may have been on hold during the winter. While our DIFM business was also impacted by the delayed timing of tax refunds, our professional customers tend to be more insulated from weather pressures and the volatility on this side of our business was more muted during the quarter.\nWe continue to be pleased with the performance of our professional business even as we face very challenging comparisons. As we outlined in our full year guidance on last quarter's earnings call, we are seeing an expected moderation in professional comps as we calendar significant share gains that drove a professional comp performance that exceeded 20% in the first quarter of last year. Against these challenging comparisons, we believe our professional results in the first quarter of this year reflect continued share gains. We are excited by our team's ability to leverage the momentum we have created in our professional business and continue to grow our share of what remains a highly fragmented professional market across all of North America.\nNow I'd like to provide some comments as to how we are thinking about the sales outlook for the balance of the year. As I noted previously, the volatility we have seen so far in 2024 is not uncommon for our business in the first quarter. As many of you listening today have heard us say before, we are cautious not to overreact to choppiness at this point in the year. As we move forward, we expect any weather-driven variability will moderate and business will normalize into the summer selling season. Given this outlook, we are maintaining our full year comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5% and would also expect our quarterly comp results to fall within the same range.\nInherent in our guidance expectations is our belief that demand for our industry is resilient and our end consumer continues to be reasonably healthy. In situations of heightened economic pressures, we believe consumers will continue to prioritize investing to maintain their vehicles, particularly given the significant cost and monthly payment burden of a new or replacement vehicle. We believe the composition of our sales results support this view of the consumer in the current environment.\nWe are encouraged to see broad-based performance across our category mix with continued strength in categories such as oil and filters as consumers continue to prioritize recurring maintenance jobs. Additionally, we are not seeing notable evidence of trade down within our categories rather we are seeing better and best level value spectrum products continue to perform well as consumers prioritize higher-quality products that carry extended warranties and in turn, provide long-term value to their investment in transportation. However, we still remain cautious of the potential deterioration in the broader macro environment that could push consumers to begin more carefully considering where and how they spend their money. Our experience gives us confidence that these demand headwinds are short term. And over time, the consumer will continue to prioritize their transportation needs given the value proposition that is present. All of this being said, we will not settle for industry average growth or allow our teams to accept macroeconomic pressures as an impediment to growth. We know there is substantial opportunity to gain a bigger piece of the pie in our industry and the mission we have set before our team is to be the leader in all of our markets and on both sides of our business.\nBefore I move on from our sales discussion, there are a few items I would like to call out as discrete impacts to our sales. First, the Easter holiday shifted into our first quarter this year which was built into our plan and met our expectations as a headwind of approximately 20 basis points to comparable store sales on the quarter.\nNext, we received the benefit of an additional selling day as a result of leap day in the first quarter of 2024. We exclude the impact of leap day from our comparable store sales calculation, but this benefit was included in our total sales guidance and came in as expected representing 125 basis points of our total sales increase of 7.2% on the quarter.\nLast, we closed on the acquisition of Group Del Vasto on January 22, and their operating results from that point forward are included in our reported numbers. The first quarter total sales increase benefited by approximately 70 basis points from the inclusion of Vast-Auto sales results, which are also excluded from our comparable store sales like Mexico.\nMoving on to diluted earnings per share. We are increasing our full year EPS guidance to a range of $41.35 to $41.85. Our lift in EPS guidance is driven by the gross margin and SG&A results that Brent will cover next as well as a lower-than-planned tax rate and the impacts of shares repurchased through the date of our earnings release today. As Brent will share with you here in a moment, we have been pleased with our team's ability to manage cost while still making steady progress on the numerous initiatives and projects we have in motion to further enhance our competitive position. As I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and dedication to start 2024.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would also like to begin my comments this morning by thanking Team O'Reilly for their incredible hard work to ensure a solid start to 2024. We are proud to say that Team O'Reilly now extends across the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Canada. Regardless of the market we operate in, we know that the absolute key to our success is a team of professional parts people dedicated to the O'Reilly culture of excellent customer service.\nToday, I will cover our first quarter gross margin and SG&A results and provide a quick update on our expansion and capital investments thus far in 2024. Starting with gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin of 51.2% was an 18 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2023 and slightly better than our expectations for the quarter. As Brad previously noted, this was the first quarter to include the operating results from the acquisition of the Vast-Auto business. And the incremental dilution to our first quarter gross margin was in line with the full year 25 basis points we guided to at the beginning of the year. We have continued to see a stable supplier and supply chain environment. and experienced the anticipated mix of acquisition cost puts and takes in the first quarter.\nOn a net basis, improved acquisition costs benefited gross margins driven by incremental buying improvements as well as market-driven reductions in freight cost. To the extent that we have seen modest inflation pressure in certain categories, we have been successful in passing those cost increases along in a continued rational pricing environment. Given our solid performance in the first quarter, we continue to expect our quarterly gross margin performance to land within our full year gross margin range of 51% to 51.5%.\nTurning to SG&A. We are pleased with our SG&A management in the first quarter results in line with expectations as a percentage of sales. Our first quarter average SG&A per store growth of 5.7% included an anticipated 100 basis point increase from the additional business day as a result of leap day. Additionally, the SG&A per store growth includes a 15 basis point increment on the quarter from the inclusion of Canada's operating results, which was in line with our expectations based on the portion of the quarter since we have owned that business.\nOur spend in the first quarter keeps us on pace for our full year plan of growing average SG&A per store by 4.5% to 5%. As we noted on our last call, the cadence of growth in average SG&A per store will moderate as we move throughout the year. As a result of beginning to compare against the impact of 2023 investments that we made in the business. While we continue to move forward as planned on our growth initiatives, some of the investments we have been making in technology capabilities as well as enhancements to our vehicle fleet and the image and appearance of our store will begin to layer into our SG&A comparisons as we incurred ramping incremental expenses throughout 2023 in these areas.\nThe impact of these comparison headwinds in our first quarter SG&A spend drove the planned deleverage of SG&A, which we also anticipate to moderate throughout the balance of this year. Given the top line choppiness we experienced during the first course of -- the first quarter, we believe our teams effectively balanced the incremental investments we are deploying in our business with prudent expense control. The decisions we make concerning the staffing levels within our stores remain the most significant driver of our SG&A spend in total.\nOur team is focused on judiciously managing our expenses as appropriate for the current conditions in our business, while also ensuring that we are delivering excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term customer relationships. We feel that our consistency in delivering excellent customer service in all market conditions has been critical to our long-term success and reflects the high level of professionalism demonstrated by our team. We are confident that the investments we have made and are continuing to make position Team O'Reilly to provide industry-leading customer service at high levels of productivity.\nWith the solid gross margin and SG&A performance we saw in the first quarter, our operating margin outlook is unchanged, and we continue to expect the full year to come in within the range of 19.7% to 20.2%, which includes the anticipated dilution of 15 basis points from the inclusion of Vast-Auto's results.\nInventory per store finished the quarter at $773,000, which was up 2.5% from this time last year and 2.2% from the end of 2023. The addition of Vast-Auto's inventory and store count provided the 1% incremental increase we had anticipated, and we continue to target a range of 4% growth within our existing chain by the end of 2024. Inventory turnover has remained at 1.7x, and we are pleased to see strong inventory productivity as we have continually enhanced and refined the inventory deployment in each of our stores while also expanding hub and DC level inventories. Our store in-stock position remains strong, and our teams are working hard to ensure O'Reilly Auto Parts offers the best inventory availability in all of our markets.\nTurning to our progress on store growth and capital investments. We opened a total of 37 stores across the U.S. and Mexico during the first quarter. Additionally, we were pleased to officially bring the 23 Canadian stores into the fold. Our annual net new store opening guidance of 190 to 200 excludes the addition of the 23 Canadian stores. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $249 million, and we are on track for our annual goal of $900 million to $1 billion.\nOur DC relocation projects in Springfield, Missouri and Atlanta, Georgia are making great progress, and we are excited to bring those new, larger and more efficient facilities online later this year to further enhance service levels within those markets. We are also excited about the progress made so far on our Mid-Atlantic, D.C. in Stafford, Virginia, that is slated to be operational in the middle of 2025.\nAs I finish my comments, I would like to thank Team O'Reilly for their commitment to delivering excellent customer service one customer at a time. I look forward to the opportunities we have ahead and taking on that challenge as a team.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to congratulate Team O'Reilly on a solid start to the year. Now we will fill in some additional details on our first quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2024.\nFor the quarter, sales increased $268 million, driven by a 3.4% increase in comparable store sales and a $73 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2023 and 2024 that have not yet entered the comp base. For 2024, we expect our total revenues to be between $16.8 billion and $17.1 billion. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21.9% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.2%, reduced by a 2.3% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the first quarter of 2023 rate of 23.7% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 24.3% reduced by a 0.6% benefit for share-based compensation. Our first quarter effective tax rate was below our expectations as a result of the timing and amount of benefit we realized from share-based compensation. For the full year of 2024, we now expect an effective tax rate of 22.4% comprised of a base rate of 23.1% reduced by a benefit of 0.7% for share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate as we saw in the first quarter.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 was $439 million versus $486 million in 2023. The decrease of $47 million was the result of a larger increase in net inventory in 2024, partially offset by an increase in earnings. For 2024, our expected free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at a range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. Our accounts payable as a percentage of inventory finished the first quarter at 127%, down from 131% at the end of 2023. This moderation was in line with expectations, including the impact from our Canadian acquisition and we would anticipate finishing the year in line with these levels.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.95x as compared to our end of 2023 ratio of 2.03x with the decrease driven by a reduction in borrowings under our commercial paper program. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 262,000 shares at an average share price of $1,029 an for a total investment of $270 million. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance, Brent outlined earlier, includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nBefore I open up our call to your questions, I would like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their dedication to our company and our customers. Your hard work and commitment to excellent customer service continues to drive our outstanding performance. This concludes our prepared comments.\nAt this time, I'd like to ask Matthew, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Matthew, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and our outlook for 2024. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.

At this time, I would like to introduce Brad Beckham.\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts fourth quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brent Kirby, our President; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. I'd like to begin our call this morning by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our team faced our toughest prior year comparisons where we generated 9% comparable store sales in the fourth quarter last year, which represented our strongest quarterly performance in 2022.\nAgainst this very high bar, our team was able to deliver a strong comparable store sales increase of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was a direct result of their unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service every day in each of our over 6,000 stores. For the full year of 2023, our team generated a robust 7.9% comparable store sales increase, which was at the high end of the revised guidance range we provided on last quarter's call.\nThis performance was also almost 2 full percentage points above the high end of our original 2023 comp sales guidance range of 4% to 6%. We're extremely pleased with the ability of our team to deliver industry-leading results again in 2023, especially since this performance was on top of the incredible sales growth in the preceding 3 years. These strong top line sales results drove another year of record-setting earnings per share as diluted EPS increased 15% to $38.47, representing continued strong value creation for our shareholders.\nAs strong as this performance was in 2023, I again think it's helpful to view these continued outstanding results in a longer-term context. To give some perspective, just in the last 4 years, our company has more than doubled earnings per share with our 2023 EPS 115% above the $17.88 we generated in 2019. After such an amazing run of performance, it would have been far too easy for our team to accept the idea that we may be forced to give back some of our growth. Instead, they did just the opposite as our business accelerated in 2023.\nI couldn't be more proud of our team's relentless dedication to outperforming the competition by providing the best customer service in the industry. As you'd expect, the incredible momentum we built in our business this year has generated a lot of excitement for our team, and that excitement was on full display at our annual leadership conference held in Dallas just 2 weeks ago.\nEach year, we bring all of our store managers and field leadership, including our sales and distribution management teams, together in one place to build leadership skills, enhance product knowledge, share best practices across our company, celebrate award-winning performances and most importantly, set our focus on the year to come.\nOur conference theme this year was Leaders in Motion, which perfectly defines the focus and attitude of our team. It's clear the energy created by winning with our customers and driving industry-leading performance is infectious. And all of our leaders are passionate about taking the next step forward and seizing the opportunities in front of us. Now I'd like to take a few minutes and provide some color on our fourth quarter results.\nAs we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we started the fourth quarter with solid sales results in line with trends we saw as we exited the third quarter. As we progress throughout the quarter, our results remain relatively consistent on a volume -- from a volume perspective with each month performing better than our guidance expectations. As we expected, our comparable store sales results on a year-over-year basis pressure in December against very challenging comparisons the last 2 years when we capitalized on favorable winter weather.\nSo far this winter, we have seen typical variability in winter weather with more of the harsh conditions that support our business arriving in January versus December. However, we are very pleased with how we finished out 2023 with broad-based solid performance across our core nonweather-related categories. Our comparable store sales results were driven by strength on the professional side of our business where our team delivered yet another quarter of double-digit comp growth in the fourth quarter.\nOur professional performance was primarily driven by robust growth in ticket counts, and we continue to be pleased with our team's ability to execute our proven business model at a high level and gain share through exceptional customer service. Our professional strength was partially offset by pressure in our DIY business, where we faced challenging ticket count comparisons to the weather benefits we saw in 2022 as well as a moderating benefit from same SKU inflation.\nOverall, the combined impact of average ticket growth on both sides of our business was a contributor to our comp growth in the quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, as we entered the fourth quarter, we had fully lapped the year-over-year inflation benefits that carried over from price levels that ramped throughout 2022. For the fourth quarter, our same SKU benefit was just over 1%, in line with our expectations.\nNext, I want to transition to a discussion of our guidance for 2024, starting with our sales outlook. As we disclosed in our earnings release yesterday, we're establishing our annual comparable store sales guidance for 2024 at a range of 3% to 5%, and we want to provide some additional color on how we're viewing both the broader economic conditions in our industry and the opportunities we have to outperform the market.\nAs we progress through 2023 and now into 2024, we believe the fundamental backdrop for the automotive aftermarket industry is stable, and the drivers for demand in our industry remains strong. The daily transportation needs of consumers generates robust and resilient demand for our industry, and there continues to be a very compelling value proposition for consumers to invest in the repair and maintenance of their existing vehicles.\nWe've been pleased to see improvement in the total miles driven in the U.S. over the last several quarters and expect to see continued steady growth in this metric in line with our -- in line with long term industry trends driven by population growth and an increase in the size of the car park. We also believe our industry has benefited and will continue to benefit from the increasing average age of vehicles as consumers show a strong willingness to prioritize investments in their existing vehicles to keep them on the road longer at higher and higher mileages.\nFrom a broader macroeconomic standpoint, we view current conditions as favorable for our customers and in turn, our industry. We believe the economic health of the consumer is solid, supported by strong employment trends, improved wages, stable fuel prices and moderating inflation. However, our expertise is not in our ability to predict broader economic conditions. We remain cautious in our outlook regarding the potential for worsening economic conditions or the possibility of short-term economic shocks, particularly any impacts we could see from sustained higher price levels and interest rates, jumps in gas prices or election year volatility.\nAs we have discussed in the past, we maintain our conviction that consumers in our industry quickly adjust to challenging environments and will prioritize the maintenance and repair of their existing vehicles as a countermeasure in the pace of economic pressures. Due to the resiliency of our customers and the nondiscretionary nature of our business, we have confidence our industry will perform well in 2024, even if the broader economy ends up facing challenges.\nWhile our outlook for 2024 incorporates our assumptions of a reasonably stable economic environment, ultimately, our performance this year will depend on our effectiveness in executing our business model, providing exceptional customer service and in turn, gaining market share. To that end, I want to spend a few minutes discussing how we view our opportunities on both sides of our business. We expect both our DIY and professional businesses to be positive contributors to our comparable store sales growth in 2024, with professional again expected to outperform.\nWe have been truly blown away by the incredible momentum our team has generated with our professional customer base, driving 3 consecutive years of comparable store sales growth in the mid-teens. We were especially excited with the ticket count gains we saw in 2023 is our store, sales, distribution and office team members delivered on our commitment to excellent customer service and industry-leading inventory availability.\nWe remain bullish in our outlook for growth in professional in 2024, but expect comps to naturally moderate as we compare against the higher bar we set in 2023. We also believe we have opportunities to gain share on the DIY side of our business, but anticipate that any share growth in the DIY will come in the context of the long-term industry trend of pressure to DIY ticket counts. We believe the industry dynamic of extended service and repair intervals resulting from increased complexity and quality of parts will drive down DIY ticket counts broadly in our industry.\nAs a result, we anticipate DIY traffic will be flat to slightly down in 2024 with an expectation that we will continue to gain share to partially offset the normal industry drag on ticket counts. However, increased complexity and quality of parts also drives higher average ticket values, and we expect total DIY comps to be positive in 2024. For both sides of our business, we expect to see continued growth in average ticket values. However, our 2024 projections assume same SKU inflation will provide a smaller benefit than we have realized in the last 3 years.\nOverall price levels were very much more stable in 2023. And consistent with our historical practice, we are assuming only modest increases in price levels from this point forward in 2024. As a result, our guidance assumes a minimal tailwind of less than 1% from same SKU inflation with overall ticket expected to be up low single digits, driven by increased complexity.\nBefore I move on from sales guidance, I would like to highlight our expectation for the quarterly cadence of our sales growth in 2024. On a weekly volume basis, our business is fairly steady in 2023, and we expect our quarterly comparable store sales growth to be relatively even throughout 2024 absent any unforeseen seasonal variability in weather and a minor shift from the timing of the Easter holiday in the first quarter of 2024 versus the second quarter last year.\nWe are pleased to be off to a solid start in 2024 aided by favorable winter weather in January. As I mentioned previously, we did not see much of the winter weather benefit in the fourth quarter. However, with the arrival of typical winter conditions in January, we would now view the weather backdrop as normal. And our assumptions underlying our sales guidance for the full year of 2024 do not include any material impacts from weather.\nNow I'd like to move on to discuss our capital investment and expansion results in 2023 as well as our plans for 2024. Our capital expenditures for 2023 were just over $1 billion, which exceeded the guidance range we updated on last quarter's call and is approximately $200 million above our initial guidance for the year. As we progressed through 2023, we realized incremental opportunities to further invest in our store and distribution network as well as accelerate our spend on certain initiatives to refresh our vehicle fleet and enhance our store image and appearance.\nFor 2024, we're setting our capital expenditure guidance at $900 million to $1 billion. While our expected total CapEx will approach a similar level of spend as 2023, the composition will change somewhat. A portion of our capital deployment in 2023 was directed at restarting initiatives that were delayed in previous years and accelerating certain projects where we saw an opportunity to improve the image and convenience of our stores.\nOur 2024 plans anticipate a leveling of capital investment for these type projects back to a more normalized annual spend. We also expect to see a reduced CapEx spend for new distribution projects in 2024. We continue to be on track with our ongoing distribution expansion, and Brent will provide a status update on these projects in a few moments.\nWhile we still have substantial dollars to invest to move these projects forward in 2024, our anticipated investment this year will be below our spend in 2023 based upon development time lines for new facilities. These planned reductions in CapEx will be largely offset by an increased investment in new stores as well as continued strategic investments in technology projects and infrastructure.\nOur growth in new store CapEx is being driven by a shift toward owned store growth versus lease stores in our planned 2024 new store openings and future store development. As we disclosed last quarter, we have established a target of 190 to 200 net new store openings for 2024 spread across multiple markets in the U.S. and Mexico.\nWe continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores and are excited about our growth opportunities in both new and existing markets alike. We have a long-held preference toward own properties as we fuel our expansion in our ability to successfully open stores that increasingly generate higher sales volumes and stronger cash flows is driving enhanced returns on capital invested in our new store growth.\nOne of the strengths of our company and a key factor in our growth story has been our ability to balance our organic greenfield growth across geographic -- across our geographic footprint, which -- while also supplementing our expansion with strategic acquisitions. The most important factor in the success of our new stores is the ability to staff the store with highly trained professional parts people who live the O'Reilly culture and are committed to providing excellent customer service in their markets.\nOver the course of our history, we have been very fortunate to join forces with several great companies through acquisitions and our ability to partner with seasoned professionals, who have strong relationships with customers in markets that are new to our company has been paramount to our success. With this in mind, we are thrilled to have completed our acquisition of Groupe Del Vasto in January and are extremely excited to partner with their experienced leadership team to enter the Canadian market.\nAs noted in our press release in December, the company is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and operates this Vast-Auto Distribution. Vast Auto is a highly respected family-owned business founded over 35 years ago with a company culture focused on the core values of hard work and excellent customer service. They currently operate 2 distribution centers and 6 satellite warehouses that support 23 company-owned stores, a network of strategic independent partners and thousands of professional customers across Eastern Canada.\nWe are still in the very early innings of planning -- of the planning process for our future expansion in Canada, and there will definitely be more to come as we grow our footprint. But for now, we are very excited to welcome the 500-plus Vast-Auto team members to Team O'Reilly. In a few moments, Brent will provide additional details on our gross profit and operating profit results as well as our expectations for 2024. But before I turn the call over to him, I want to highlight our earnings per share guidance we outlined in our press release last night.\nWe have established our EPS guidance for 2024 at $41.05 to $41.55, while we expect the Vast-Auto acquisition to be slightly accretive to our bottom line in 2024, it will not have a material impact on earnings per share. Our 2024 operating plans and earnings and profitability outlook reflects our continued commitment to investing in our business to grow market share and drive industry-leading results. We have been pleased with our ability to capitalize on our strong competitive positioning and generate robust sales momentum and will continue to judiciously manage our capital and operating investments to drive long-term growth and high returns.\nOur entire team remains highly committed to our business and our customers, and we are very confident in our ability to build on the strong historical EPS results I outlined at the beginning of our call today. As I wrap up my prepared comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work, dedication and performance in 2023. Now I will turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would also like to begin my comments this morning by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another great year in 2023 and welcoming our newest Canadian team members to our great company. We're thrilled to partner with the Vast-Auto team to enter the Canadian market. Their experienced leadership team and excellent company culture provide a strong foundation for our growth in Canada, and we view this acquisition as an important part of our strategic expansion plans.\nToday, I will further discuss our fourth quarter and full year operational results and provide some additional color on our outlook for 2024. Starting with gross margin. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 51.3% was a 47 basis point increase from the fourth quarter of 2022 and at the high end of our expectations. Our full year gross margin also came in at 51.3%, in line with last year and also at the high end of our guidance range.\nAs a reminder, our full year results as compared to 2022 were impacted by incremental pressure we faced in the first quarter from the final impacts of calendaring our 2022 professional pricing initiative. Subsequent to the first quarter, our gross margin for the remaining 3 quarters of the year improved approximately 30 basis points from the comparable period in 2022.\nWe've been pleased with our consistent solid gross margin results, especially in light of the mix headwind we faced from our outsized strong performance in our professional business. Our supply chain teams with outstanding support from our supplier partners have worked diligently to drive improved gross margins through incremental improvements in acquisition costs and distribution efficiencies.\nFor 2024, we expect to continue to see further expansion of gross margin as we calendar our gains in 2023 and drive similar incremental improvements as we progress through the year. We have established a guidance range for 2024 of 51% to 51.5%, which includes an anticipated 25 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of the acquired Vast-Auto business in our results. As we outlined in our press release, because of our new partner's current mix of lower margin distribution business to independent parts stores, we're expecting this headwind to consolidate gross margin, but only expect a net impact of 15 basis points to operating profit since they operate with a lower mix of owned stores and associated operating cost.\nExcluding the impact of adding the Vast-Auto business, our expected gross profit is projected to be up 24 basis points at the midpoint. This reflects our confidence in the tremendous amount of focus our supply chain, store operations and sales teams have on creating a premium value proposition for our customers. Our quarterly gross margin remained very consistent throughout 2023, and we expect a similar quarterly cadence as we move through 2024.\nWhile we cannot completely predict what inflation will look like from a macro perspective, our current assumptions also build in a stable inflation environment, both as it relates to our product input cost and selling prices to our customers, as Brad outlined in his comments. During 2023, we saw puts and takes in the costing environment as a result of inflationary pressures broadly experienced by our supply chain partners, offset by our team's efforts to manage acquisition cost effectively.\nWe really view this as a normal state of condition for our industry and expect a similar rational environment in 2024. Our expectations also assume customer pricing in our industry will remain rational. As pleased as we've been with our incremental improvements to gross margin rate, we're even more excited with our strong gross profit dollar growth, which saw an increase of 10% in 2023 and is projected for solid growth again in 2024.\nOur consistent strong performance is the direct result of a continued high level of execution of our business model and our unrelenting commitment to providing our customers with the absolute best parts availability in our industry. This competitive advantage is the direct result of our long-term commitment to making sound investments in our supply chain, distribution network and inventory position. And we're excited about the projects we have underway to continue to enhance our capabilities in 2024.\nTo start on the distribution side of the business, we have 3 significant projects in development that will add capacity and service levels to our network, and I'd like to provide a quick update on our progress. As we have previously disclosed, we currently have new distribution centers under construction to relocate our existing Springfield, Missouri and Atlanta, Georgia DCs to larger, more efficient facilities. This expanded capacity will enable us to continue to support new store growth in some of our more mature core market areas as well as support the increased per store volumes that have grown significantly during the last several years.\nBoth of these projects are on track. We're projecting the Springfield relocation to be complete in the back half of 2024, and we'll begin the process of transferring stores to the new Atlanta facility at the end of this year. We're also making great progress on the development of our new greenfield distribution center in Stafford, Virginia and continue to expect for this facility to be operational in the middle of 2025.\nIt will support our expansion into these new untapped market areas for our company. Our distribution strategy directly aligns with the store growth strategies that Brad outlined earlier, and these new facilities will be key drivers of our ability to capture market share in both existing and new markets. In addition to the investments we're making in our distribution centers, we continue to prioritize the opportunities we have to enhance our hub store network, which is the next level of our tiered supply chain model.\nOur ability to support our stores with quick access to broad localized SKU availability is an important factor in our ability to effectively compete up and down the street. We continually evaluate this network to ensure all of our stores have the best access to inventory in their respective markets, and we'll adjust the number, location and size of hub stores as necessary to achieve this goal.\nEvery year, a portion of our capital and operating investment is geared toward this tier and our distribution model, and our plans for 2024 are in line with this continued commitment. Moving on to inventory. Our inventory per store at the end of 2023 was $575,000, which was up 4% from the end of last year, driven by our continued opportunistic investments to support our sales momentum.\nIn the coming year, our planned growth and inventory per store corresponds with the growth we will send -- see in our distribution and hub network. For 2024, we expect per-store inventory to increase approximately 4% within our existing chain with the addition of the acquired Vast-Auto inventory, resulting in another 1% of per store growth since their model is more heavily weighted to distribution with a lower store count. Our growth objectives are focused on adding expanded inventories in our relocated DCs, augmenting the inventory availability in our hub network and capitalizing on targeted additions in our stores to ensure we're offering the best possible local assortment and inventory availability.\nNow I want to spend some time covering our SG&A and operating profit performance in 2023 and our outlook for 2024. Fourth quarter SG&A expense as a percent of sales was 32.6%, up 43 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2022 and above our expectations due to higher-than-expected self-insured auto liability exposure and legal costs, driven by inflation and claims costs.\nAverage per store SG&A expense for the full year of 2023 were up 7.8%, slightly above our revised guidance from the third quarter as a result of these same drivers. As we have discussed throughout the year, the outsized year-over-year SG&A growth, as compared to our historical growth rates, was the result of planned initiatives targeted at enhancing our long-term operational strength through reinvestment in our stores, technology and our outstanding team.\nAs we look forward to 2024, we're planning to grow average SG&A per store by 4.5% to 5% with approximately 1/2 of 1 point of this increase driven by the addition of the Vast-Auto operations. Our anticipated store growth in 2024 is a step down from the significant investment we made in 2023, but is higher than we would normally forecast in our initial SG&A guidance, driven by a few key factors.\nPart of our anticipated increase in 2024 SG&A expense is driven by a year-over-year increase in depreciation expense directly related to our increased CapEx spend in both 2023 and 2024. As we calendar passed our prior year investments, this headwind will moderate as we move through 2024, especially as our mix of capital spending in 2024 shifts more toward new store investments.\nThe more significant driver of our planned initiative-driven SG&A spend is our continued investment in our technology capabilities, both in incremental tools and infrastructure. We've been pleased with the impact our IT investments are having on our business and the opportunities we see to support our growth initiatives as we move forward. Based on these expectations and our projected growth margin rate -- gross margin rate, we're setting our operating profit guidance range at 19.7% to 20.2%. As we disclosed in our press release yesterday, this includes an anticipated dilution of 15 basis points from the inclusion of Vast-Auto's results in our consolidated guidance.\nExcluding that impact, our guidance for 2024 brackets our 2023 results with the midpoint of our expected operating profit range down slightly from last year. Based on the anticipated cadence of our SG&A growth during the year, we expect more pressure to operating profit in the first half of the year than the back half.\nAs Brad previously mentioned, we are highly committed to growing our share of the market and driving industry-leading results. Before I close my comments, I want to join Brad in expressing the privilege it was to spend time with our company leaders at our annual leadership conference in January. Our team certainly had much to celebrate given their outstanding performance in 2023, but it was evident that our team is not satisfied with resting on our past success. Rather, they are intensely focused on providing excellent customer service and continuing to grow market share in 2024 and beyond. Now I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to congratulate Team O'Reilly on another outstanding year. Now we will fill in some additional details on our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2024. For the fourth quarter, sales increased $188 million, driven by a 3.4% increase in comparable store sales and a $71 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base.\nFor 2024, we expect our total revenues to be between $16.8 billion and $17.1 billion. Our guidance for total revenues includes the benefit from leap day in 2024, but this additional day will not be included in our comparable store sales calculation consistent with our historical practice. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 17.7% of pretax income comprised of a base rate of 18.9%, reduced by a 1.2% benefit for share-based compensation.\nThis compares to the fourth quarter of 2022 rate of 18.2% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 19.9%, reduced by a 1.7% benefit from share-based compensation. The fourth quarter of 2023 base rate, as compared to 2022, was lower as a result of an increase in certain federal and state tax credits.\nFor the full year, our effective tax rate was 21.9% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.1%, reduced by a 1.2% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2024, we expect an effective tax rate of 22.6%, comprised of a base rate of 23.1%, reduced by a benefit of 0.5% for share-based compensation.\nWe expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate. Now we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results in 2023 and our expectations for 2024.\nFree cash flow for 2023 was $2 billion versus $2.4 billion in 2022. The decrease of $383 million was the result of the increased capital expenditures Brad discussed earlier as well as an increase in net inventory in 2023 versus the substantial working capital reduction in net inventory we realized in 2022. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in income and a benefit from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits.\nFor 2024, we expect free cash flow to again be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. We anticipate the benefit to free cash flow from growth in our operating income will be offset by a headwind as we compare to the benefit we realized in 2023 from favorable timing of tax payments and purchases of renewable energy tax credits.\nAs Brad and Brent discussed in their prepared comments, in 2024, we have planned for capital expenditures and inventory growth at similar levels to the investments we made in 2023. And as a result, we expect a comparable impact to free cash flow. I also want to touch briefly on the component of our net inventory driven by our AP to inventory ratio. We finished the fourth quarter at 131%, which was reduced from the rate we saw through much of 2023.\nThis moderation in AP reflects the timing impact of payments associated with the substantial inventory purchases we made at the end of 2022 to support our strong sales volumes and significant inventory additions as we exited last year. For 2024, we expect to see continued moderation and an impact from our Canadian acquisition and currently expect to finish the year at a ratio of approximately 127%.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.03x as compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x with the increase driven by our successful issuance of $750 million of 3-year senior notes in November and borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by the June retirement of $300 million of maturing notes. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plans to prudently approach that number over time.\nWe continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And for 2023, we repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average share price of $883.13 for a total investment of $3.2 billion. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2011, we have repurchased 94 million shares at an average share price of $247 for a total investment of $23.3 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs a reminder, our EPS guidance Brad outlined earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their dedication to our company and our customers. Your hard work and commitment to excellent customer service continues to drive our outstanding performance.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matthew, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Holly, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our third quarter 2023 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question in answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements and we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. At this time, I would like to introduce Greg Johnson.\n\nGregory D. Johnson\n\nCo-President & Chief Executive Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts third quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are our Co-President, Brad Beckham and Brent Kirby; as well as Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Hensley, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.\nI'd like to begin today's call by congratulating Team O'Reilly on outstanding results in the third quarter and express my deep appreciation to our team of over 88,000 professional parts people for their steadfast dedication to our customers. This unwavering commitment to excellent customer service is the hallmark of O'Reilly Auto Parts and the key to earning our customers' business every day.\nOur team's ability to deliver sustained profitable growth is evidenced by a robust 8.7% increase in comparable store sales coupled with a 17% increase in diluted earnings per share for the third quarter. Our results have exceeded our expectations throughout the year driven by the team's high level of execution.\nService and product availability are critical pieces of our value proposition and our ability to remain intensely focused on these fundamentals has continued to drive growth on both the professional and DIY sides of our business.\nAs we announced in July, upon my retirement in January, Brad Beckham will be promoted to the position of Chief Executive Officer, and Brent Kirby will be promoted to the role of Company President. Brad and Brent are tremendous leaders who bring world-class ability, experience and passion to their -- I'm sorry, yes, and passion into their new roles. Even more importantly, Brad and Brent are incredible standard bearers of the O'Reilly culture, and I'm very excited about what our future holds under their leadership.\nOur transition of the operations of the company to Brad and Brent has progressed smoothly and seamlessly and as a result, today's earnings call represents my last call as CEO. As such, it is appropriate for me to leave the bulk of our discussion of the third quarter results to Brad, Brent and Jeremy. But before I turn the call over, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued confidence in and support of our company during my tenure as CEO.\nFinally, I'd like to again thank Team O'Reilly for your hard work and commitment to our customers. It's been my absolute honor and privilege to work alongside you for the last 41 years with a front row seat to see you achieve so many incredible milestones along the road of success for O'Reilly Auto Parts. Even though I will get to actively participate in the next chapter of our company's success, I'm still very excited for the many opportunities ahead and look forward to watching our company's continued growth and future success. I'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another excellent performance in the third quarter. The ability of our team to deliver continued industry-leading sales performance requires a consistent and intense focus on our culture and the fundamentals of excellent customer service. I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work commitment and dedication to our great company.\nNow I'd like to walk through the details of our sales performance for the quarter on both the professional and DIY sides of our business. We spoke on our last call to the strong start to the quarter in July driven in part by extreme heat in many of our markets as we were pleased to see these very strong volumes carry on throughout the quarter.\nFrom a cadence perspective, we saw a similar top line outperformance in each month of the quarter as compared to both the expectations we built into our plan coming into 2023 and the updated guidance we provided on last quarter's conference call. As we have discussed throughout 2023, our prior year comparisons get more challenging as we move throughout the back half of the year, and this dynamic was reflected in the cadence of our comparable store sales in the third quarter with our strongest comps for the quarter in July and August.\nHowever, on a 2-year stacked basis, our performance was much more consistent through the quarter with September only slightly below the full quarter performance due to a moderation of the hot weather benefit we realized earlier in the quarter. While we did see outperformance during the quarter in categories impacted by heat, such as cooling and HVAC, we also experienced broad strength in application-specific hard part categories as well as maintenance categories such as oil and filters. These dynamics give us confidence that while we did benefit from weather, it was not the primary driver of our above-expectation results and the sales we are generating in failure and maintenance categories indicate a healthy level of broad-based consumer demand.\nOur Professional business continues to be the more significant outperformer and our team was able to deliver another quarter of mid-teens comparable store sales growth in our Professional business in the third quarter. This outstanding growth was in line with the Professional sales increase we achieved in the second quarter while facing increasingly challenging prior year comparisons. We are extremely pleased with our team's ability to gain share through consistently executing our business model and providing industry-leading value to our professional customers. Our expectation is to continue to grow our share in the Professional business as we see plenty of opportunity in both new and existing markets to consolidate the overall DIFM market.\nTurning to our DIY business. We were pleased to generate solid comparable store sales growth with our top line growth consistent with the first half of the year, even as we saw an expected moderation in the benefit from inflation. In line with the trends we have seen this year, our DIY comparable store sales growth has been driven primarily by increased average ticket values. However, we were pleased to see positive DIY ticket count comps in the third quarter.\nOur teams continue to execute our dual market strategy, driving market share growth in our DIY business alongside our robust growth in Professional. However, our portion of the total DIY market share in the U.S. is still relatively low, and we see continued DIY growth as a tremendous area of opportunity for our company.\nNow I would like to provide some color on our average ticket and ticket count performance. Average ticket growth was again in the mid-single digits on a combined basis and with slightly larger -- was the slightly larger share of our comparable store sales increase. While we are seeing the expected reduced benefit from same SKU inflation as we move throughout the year, our moderation in total average ticket growth has not been as significant due to offsetting strength we have seen from parts complexity and product mix.\nMoving forward, we expect a more normalized same-SKU inflation benefit but are confident that future average ticket growth will be supported by increased parts complexity, which has been the primary historical driver of our average ticket.\nEven though average ticket growth was the larger contributor to our comparable store sales growth, we are very pleased with our ticket count comps, which was the larger contributor to the outperformance versus expectations. Our team's ability to outhustle and outservice our competition for this increased traffic volume is paramount to ensuring these share gains translate into repeat business. It has never been more important to ensure that we have highly trained teams of professional parts people supported by superior product availability in every single one of our 6,000-plus stores.\nAs I finish up our remarks on sales performance in the quarter, I would like to highlight our updated full year sales guidance. We have increased our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 7% to 8% from our previous range of 5% to 7% and increased our total sales guidance to a range of $15.7 billion to $15.8 billion. This update is reflective of our year-to-date performance through today's call including a solid start to the quarter with October trends in line with how we exited the third quarter.\nAs we finish out 2023, our fourth quarter reflects our most challenging comparisons of the year as we lap the 9% comparable store sales increase in the fourth quarter last year and expect to see a fully normalized same SKU benefit. Our outlook for the remainder of the year is consistent with the guidance we have maintained throughout 2023. While we have been very pleased with the degree to which our performance has outpaced our expectations in the first 9 months of 2023, we are always cautious as we approach the last few months of the year, which historically can be volatile due to variability in winter weather and pressures consumers can face during the holiday shopping season.\nAs a reminder, our prior year comparisons are the most challenging in December as we benefited from broad-based strength in weather-related categories at the end of 2022. Against this backdrop, we maintain a positive outlook on the fundamentals of our industry. We are confident that the key demand drivers for the aftermarket, including steady recovery in miles driven and a very favorable U.S. vehicle fleet dynamics are in place to support steady growth moving forward.\nWe also believe that our customers have remained resilient and are continuing to prioritize the maintenance of their existing vehicles in order to avoid taking on a payment for a higher-priced newer vehicle.\nAs you have heard from me already today, we see lots of opportunities in our markets to grow faster than the industry. Our team is charged up by the results we are seeing from our solid execution of the basic fundamentals of our business that translate to success.\nNext, I would like to take some time to discuss our SG&A performance in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 30.1%, a deleverage of 29 basis points from the third quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in SG&A per store of approximately 8.5%. Our SG&A growth in the third quarter was above our expectations, so I want to provide some additional color on what drove the results in the third quarter.\nAs we saw in the first half of 2023, the majority of our outsized year-over-year SG&A growth as compared to our historical growth rates was the result of planned investments and initiatives targeted at enhancing our long-term operational strength. Our spend on these items was largely in line with our expectations coming into the quarter, and we remain pleased with the positive impact we are generating by reinvesting in our stores, technology and most important, in Team O'Reilly.\nWhile these initiatives continue to play out as planned, our total SG&A dollar spend per store in the third quarter was higher than we expected coming into the quarter. This was driven by incremental costs necessary to support our significant comparable store sales outperformance, but which also resulted in better leverage of SG&A expenses than we saw in the second quarter.\nOur focus remains on relentlessly pursuing the excellent customer service that strengthens the long-term relationship we have with our customers, and we will continue to be aggressive where we see opportunities to accelerate top line growth and, in turn, create leverage over time, driving long-term returns.\nBased on our results in the third quarter and expectations for the remainder of the year, we now expect to see SG&A per store increased 7% to 7.5% for the full year. With this increase from prior guidance, we still expect our full year operating margin to come in within the range of 19.8% to 20.3% of sales, driven by leverage on our strong top line results. Expense control remains as important to the O'Reilly culture as it always has, and we will be judicious in how we manage our spend to ensure we are seeing long-term results from the investments we make in the business.\nThis focus on profitable growth has drove our 17% increase in third quarter diluted earnings per share. We are updating our full year EPS guidance to $37.80 to $38.30, representing an increase of $0.75 at the midpoint, reflecting the strong performance in the third quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brent, I would like to again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and dedication to the O'Reilly culture. Greg has been a tremendous leader for our company, an incredible mentor to me and is a tough act to follow, but I am very excited for the future of our company and our entire team is committed to our company's continued success. Now I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would like to echo Greg and Brad, in congratulating Team O'Reilly on the outstanding performance in the third quarter. The continuation of our strong sales performance and proven ability to outperform the market is a testament to our team's unwavering commitment to excellent customer service. I want to thank all of our team members for their dedication to our company, and to our customers.\nNow I will cover our third quarter gross margin results, what we are seeing in the competitive environment and provide some updates on our store and distribution growth, inventory investments and capital expenditure plans.\nStarting with gross margin. Our third quarter gross margin of 51.4% was 46 basis point increase from the third quarter of 2022 at just above our expected range. We are pleased with the stability of our gross margin results as our third quarter continued the strong trend we saw in the second quarter. Our gross margin for the third quarter faced pressure from the sustained strong performance in our Professional business, creating a customer mix headwind, but we have been able to offset these headwinds through improved acquisition cost and outstanding support from our supplier partners.\nPricing to both DIY and Professional customers has remained rational within the industry. We continue to see modest inflation in the third quarter and remained very successful in passing along increases in product acquisition costs and other inflationary pressures in selling price.\nWhile our quarter-to-quarter gross margin rate can see normal fluctuations from seasonality and product sales mix and leverage of distribution costs relative to overall volumes, the stability of our results in light of the share gains we are experiencing demonstrates our team's ability to win share through service and product availability.\nAs a result of our solid year-to-date performance, we are maintaining our full year gross margin guidance of 50.8% to 51.3% but would now expect to come in within the top half of this range.\nInventory per store finished the quarter at $758,000, which was up 4% compared to the beginning of the year. We would now expect our average inventory per store increase to finish the year in a range between our original guidance of 2% growth and the current levels, driven by our continued opportunistic investments to support our sales momentum.\nOur [ AP ] to inventory ratio at the end of the third quarter was 134%, in line with the beginning of the year and slightly better than expectations, driven by strong sales volumes and inventory turns. We now expect to finish 2023 at a similar level.\nThe health of our supply chain and resulting store in-stock positioning continues to be a competitive strength, optimizing our assortments across our DC, hub and store network while simultaneously partnering with our supplier community to achieve industry-leading fill rates is absolutely playing a key role in our exceptional sales results, and we continue to regard inventory availability as a critical priority for our business.\nAlongside the investments we are making in inventory, we also remain focused on leveraging the benefits of the tiered nature of our distribution model. This strategy has been an important aspect of our supply chain for many years and begins with placing distribution centers in large metro areas to provide same-day availability to a wide range of SKUs for our customers. Strategically located hub stores augment our SKU availability on a more localized basis and represent the very important second tier within our distribution supply chain. We continually evaluate this network, including the number, location and size of our hub stores to ensure that all our stores have the best access to inventory in their respective markets.\nNext, I would like to discuss our capital investments and expansion opportunities, beginning with the investments we are making in our distribution network. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we are very pleased with the successful opening of our Guadalajara, Mexico DC in July, but are also excited on today's call to announce 2 additional expansion projects that we currently have underway. First, our distribution teams are actively working on a relocation of our Atlanta DC, which is a large project that will enable expanded, more efficient store servicing capabilities within that market. As well as providing direct import processing capability within this new facility. This new 690,000 square foot building is expected to be complete by the end of 2024 and will increase the number of stores we can support in this critical market by 100 stores.\nNext, we have an exciting distribution expansion project that is in progress in Stafford, Virginia where we have purchased a site and began construction on a large new distribution facility that will service the Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia corridor. The new DC will be approximately 530,000 square feet and our initial plan is to build out capacity to service 350 stores. We anticipate this distribution center will be open and operational by the middle of 2025. And we could not be more excited about the store development opportunity this provides us in what is largely an untapped market area for O'Reilly today.\nOur distribution center teams are diligently executing on these projects and are enthusiastically looking forward to further expanding our DC footprint and our industry-leading parts availability.\nTurning to store growth and expansion. We successfully opened 40 stores during the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 140 net new store openings for 2023. Our team is confident we will achieve the goal of 180 to 190 net new store openings for 2023. As we noted in our press release yesterday, we announced our 2024 new store opening target of 190 to 200 net new store openings. Our strong new store performance continues to prove that our investments in both new stores and the necessary distribution infrastructure to support those stores as an attractive use of capital.\nTotal capital expenditures for the first 9 months of 2023 were $754 million, a considerable increase over prior year, but reflective of the attractive opportunities we see to deploy capital against projects and initiatives to drive long-term growth and enhance our competitive positioning.\nIncluded within our press release yesterday was an update to our full year capital expenditure guidance to a range of $900 million to $950 million from the previous range of $750 million to $800 million. The primary driver of this increase was the progress that we have made on the new Virginia distribution expansion project as well as a higher mix of owned new stores and the pace of investment in technology and store infrastructure initiatives.\nTo close my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and continued dedication to our customers. Now I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued hard work and outstanding performance in the third quarter. Now we will cover some additional details on our third quarter results and guidance for the remainder of 2023.\nFor the quarter, sales increased $405 million driven by an 8.7% increase in comparable store sales and a $78 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base. Our third quarter effective tax rate was 23.2% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.3%, reduced by a 1.1% benefit from share-based compensation with both of the components of our rate in line with the third quarter of 2022. Our third quarter base tax rate was in line with our expectations with the total effective tax rate below our expectations due to higher-than-planned benefits from share-based compensation.\nFor the full year of 2023, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 22.5% comprised of a base rate of 23.4% reduced by a benefit of 0.9% from share-based compensation. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods. Variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2023 was $1.7 billion versus $1.9 billion in the same period in 2022. The reduction was the result of the increase in capital expenditures Brent discussed in his remarks as well as a lower working capital benefit from a reduction in net inventory this year versus 2022. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in income and a benefit from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits.\nFor 2023, we continue to expect free cash flow at a range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, with an increase in expected cash flow from operations offsetting the increase to our CapEx guidance.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.93x which is up compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x. The increase in total indebtedness was comprised of borrowings under our commercial paper program, which we successfully launched in the third quarter. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time.\nWe continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program and during the third quarter, we repurchased 852,000 shares at an average share price of $938.11 for a total investment of $800 million. Year-to-date through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 3.4 million shares at an average share price of $879.74 for a total investment of $3 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price inclusive of the current excise tax cost is supported by the discounted expected future cash flows of our business. And we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning capital -- excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs a reminder, the updated EPS guidance outlined by Brad earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nFinally, before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to again thank the O'Reilly -- the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's long-term success. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Holly, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matthew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our second quarter 2023 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements. And we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words, such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Greg Johnson.\n\nGregory D. Johnson\n\nCo-President & Chief Executive Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are our Co-Presidents, Brad Beckham and Brent Kirby; as well as Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.\nI'd like to begin our call today thanking Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to consistently providing excellent service to our customers. Our team's proven ability to execute our business strategy at a high level drove our second quarter comparable store sales increase of 9%, exceeding our expectations on both the professional and DIY sides of our business.\nFor the first 6 months of 2023, we generated a 9.8% increase in comparable store sales, which is the direct result of our team's unrelenting focus on providing the best customer service in our industry. Our team members and our culture remain our greatest assets. I made the exact same statement on our first quarter call, but it warrants repeating.\nOur commitment to strengthening our culture and investing in our team is paying clear dividends in our continued strong performance. And I want to congratulate all of Team O'Reilly on another outstanding job in the second quarter.\nDriven by the strength of our top line performance, we're also pleased to deliver a robust 16% increase in diluted earnings per share. Our operating cost spend was elevated above our expectations, which Brad will discuss more -- in more detail during his prepared comments, but we remain pleased with the investments we have made in our business to build on the momentum our teams are generating.\nOur EPS results reflect our ability to produce strong, compounding operating profit dollar growth, and we are committed to aggressively capitalizing on the opportunities we see to provide enhanced value for our customers and earn even greater market share.\nAs a result of our strong top line performance, we are increasing our full year 2023 EPS guidance to a range of $37.05 to $37.55, reflecting our second quarter results and shares repurchased since our last call. At the midpoint of this revised range, we now expect our full year EPS to increase 12% over 2022.\nAs we disclosed in our press releases last night, after 41 years of service to our company, I've made the decision to retire next January. At that time, Brad Beckham will take over my role as Chief Executive Officer with direct responsibility to the Board as the leader of our executive team. We will also be promoting Brent Kirby to the role of company President. As you know, Brad and Brent assumed the roles of Co-President earlier in the year, and they have both taken on increasing levels of responsibility and prominence in the leadership of our business over the past several years.\nSuccession planning has always been a very important and methodical process at our company. In many ways, our upcoming change mirrors the successful leadership transitions we have seen before in our company's history, including when Jeff Shaw and I were elevated to lead the company in 2018 and Greg Henslee and Ted Wise were selected as the first non-O'Reilly family members in the top leadership roles of CEO and COO in 2005. Brad and Brent are both extremely talented and experienced individuals who have the full support of our team, and I have every confidence they will continue to deliver on our company's long-term track record of success. Over the period of now -- from now through January 31, we will complete the transition of the day-to-day operations of the company to Brad and Brent.\nFinally, Greg Hensley, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, will also be continuing in their roles and along with our full Board will support Brad, Brent and our executive team in executing our strategy and driving long-term value for our shareholders.\nAs I finish up in my prepared comments, I would like to again thank our team for continuing to provide industry-leading customer service every day and generating excellent results in the first half of 2023. I'm extremely proud of all of you, and I'm excited to keep the momentum strong in the back half of the year.\nI'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another excellent performance in the second quarter. Our continued industry-leading sales performance is the direct result of our team's unwavering commitment to our company's culture of providing excellent customer service, and I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication.\nOver the last several quarters, our team has generated tremendous momentum in our business, and that strength carried into the second quarter, driving our outstanding top line sales performance. As we've discussed on our last quarter's conference call, we faced some pressure from the timing of spring weather at the end of the first quarter, but our business rebounded with the onset of normal spring weather in April.\nThose strong sales trends continued throughout the quarter, resulting in our outperformance versus our expectations in each month of the quarter. From a cadence perspective, our results were very steady in each month of the quarter both in absolute terms and as compared to our expectations.\nThe ability of our team to drive high levels of sustained sales growth month after month is the product of consistent daily execution of our key business fundamentals. And I couldn't be more pleased with how consistently Team O'Reilly has performed in the first half of 2023.\nNow I would like to provide additional details on our sales performance in professional and DIY. Our professional business was again the outperformer in the second quarter. Our team delivered a mid-teens comparable store sales increase in our professional business in the quarter with incredibly strong growth coming on top of double-digit professional comps in the second quarter of 2022.\nThe compounded gains we are seeing on this side of our business reflect a sustained high level of customer service and execution that has allowed us to translate increased sales gains into future business opportunities. Every chance we have with a professional customer to prove our exceptional value gives us the ability to earn the next call and capture even more of that customer's business.\nAs we have seen our business grow over the last few years, our store teams have made the most of these incremental opportunities, and we continue to see runway to leverage our proven business model and execution to gain market share.\nTurning to DIY. We continue to be reasonably pleased with this side of our business with our teams delivering steady comparable store sales growth, consistent with our overall trends in the first quarter. As we move past the spring weather volatility we experienced at the end of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, our DIY business has been very steady with consistently positive performance in each month of the quarter.\nOur comparable store sales increase in our DIY business was driven by increased average ticket values aided by same SKU inflation, but we were also pleased to see flat DIY ticket count comps in the second quarter. Average ticket growth was in the mid-single digits on a combined basis for both sides of our business and drove the larger share of our comparable store sales increase. However, strength in ticket count comps, especially in our professional business, was the larger contributor to our outperformance versus our expectations.\nOur average ticket growth was driven primarily by same-SKU inflation, which was in line with our expectations, coupled with a modest benefit from product mix and complexity in our professional business. As anticipated, same-SKU inflation we realized in the second quarter ticked down from the tailwind we saw in the first quarter. We continue to expect to see this benefit moderate in the back half of 2023 as we lap impact of 2022 price increases. This dynamic was built into our initial guidance expectations and remains unchanged.\nTo wrap up my comments on sales, I would like to highlight our updated sales guidance and full year outlook. From a macro perspective, we continue to remain bullish on the strength of our industry and prospects for the remainder of 2023. Our customer base has continued to be very resilient and willing to prioritize the maintenance and repair of their existing vehicles in order to avoid taking on a payment for newer, more costly vehicles.\nWhile we still maintain an element of caution with regard to the outlook for the overall U.S. economy and the potential for heightened economic pressures, we believe that current market dynamics combine to provide a strong backdrop for demand in our industry.\nIn light of this backdrop, we are increasing our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 5% to 7% from our previous range of 4% to 6% with a corresponding increase in total sales guidance to $15.4 billion to $15.7 billion. This increase reflects our year-to-date performance through today's call. As I've already discussed, we anticipate moderation in our comparable store sales expectations in the back half of the year as we realize less built-in benefit from same SKU increases.\nOur expectations also incorporate more challenging ticket count comparisons as we move through the back half of the year. The combined impact of both of these factors is driving the anticipated deceleration in our comparable store sales guidance in the second half of 2023 versus the 9.8% increase we generated in the first 6 months of 2023. However, our teams remain highly motivated to take share in every market, and we remain diligent in delivering a high level of customer service to accelerate our sales momentum.\nBefore I move on from sales, I will add that we are pleased to be off to a strong start in the third quarter as we have seen the robust sales trends in the first half of the year continue with incremental strength from the extreme heat in many of our markets in the first few weeks of July.\nNow I would like to discuss our second quarter SG&A results, which came in higher than our original expectations for the quarter and were above the long-term growth rate necessary to operate our business model. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 30.3%, a deleverage of 71 basis points from the second quarter of 2022. This deleverage was driven by an increase in SG&A per store of approximately 10%. This heightened level of SG&A was incorporated in part into our initial expectations for 2023 but ultimately came in higher than anticipated driven by a few key factors I will briefly recap.\nComing into 2023, we identified several key initiatives targeted to enhance our long-term operational strength with an intent to capitalize on the considerable momentum we have generated in our business to further separate ourselves from the competition and consolidate the market. We have been pleased with the progress of these initiatives and in a few instances, realized an opportunity to accelerate these investments in the second quarter.\nA good example relates to our plans this year to increase our spend on refreshing the image and appearance of our stores, which is targeted at both strategic projects as well as improved general maintenance of our existing facilities. We have sought to return to a new normal post pandemic. We have been -- excuse me, as we have sought to return to a new normal post pandemic, we have been working hard to catch up on deferred maintenance needs of our stores that have unfortunately accumulated over the last couple of years.\nAs a result, part of our SG&A pressure in the second quarter was driven by going faster than originally planned to address this issue. The image, appearance and shoppability of our stores is incredibly important to our ability to drive DIY traffic, customer satisfaction and in turn share gains over time. We have also seen good traction in our efforts to enhance our team member experience and benefits.\nOur initiatives here have reaped better-than-expected team member retention but have also contributed to the overall cost of these enhancements, which coupled with the deferred compensation SG&A headwind Jeremy will discuss in a moment, added to our SG&A growth in the quarter.\nOutside of these deliberate decisions to enhance our business, we unfortunately also faced pressure during the quarter from a higher-than-expected self-insured auto liability exposure driven by inflation and claim costs. Ultimately, we remain -- we retain control of our most significant driver of our total SG&A spend and the decisions we make around store payroll and appropriate staffing levels within our stores. Ensuring we have the strongest possible team delivering the best customer service in the industry is one of the most important, if not the most important driver of our long-term success.\nOur total payroll spend in the second quarter was another contributor to the higher-than-normal SG&A per store increase driven by total head count and staffing levels, coupled with higher incentive compensation with wage rates largely in line with our expectations. As we have discussed often in the past, we manage this key component of our SG&A spend with a long-term focus. As we have continued to see our business accelerate over the last year-plus since exiting the pandemic, we have prioritized ensuring that our stores are delivering a high level of service on both sides of our business.\nWhen we gain share with new and existing customers as we have seen over the last 2 years, we create an opportunity to prove our industry-leading value proposition as a trusted supplier and in turn earn repeat expanded business. In these situations, we are judicious about how we manage staffing levels to ensure we are delivering the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships.\nAs we look forward to the balance of the year, we now expect to see an SG&A per store increase of approximately 6%, which reflects our first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Implicit in this guidance is our expectation that per store SG&A growth will moderate versus what we have seen in the first half of 2023 even as we continue to pursue strategic initiatives in our business.\nWe remain highly committed to expense control as a culture value and have set high expectations for the long-term productivity of the investments we're making today. We have a long track record of diligently managing our expenses to match the business conditions we are seeing in our markets, and we will continue to prudently adjust our operating cost structure to drive long-term value in our business. Finally, we still continue to expect our full year operating profit margin to come in within the range of 19.8% to 20.3% of sales.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brent, I would like to thank our entire team for their unwavering hard work and commitment so far in 2023. I am extremely humbled to have the opportunity to service our next -- our company's next Chief Executive Officer. And I couldn't be more excited to work side by side with our over 88,000 dedicated parts -- professional parts people to provide the best service possible to our customers and in turn drive outstanding performance for years to come.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. And I would like to join Greg and Brad in congratulating Team O'Reilly on the strength of our performance in the second quarter. Our strong top line sales performance and continued ability to outperform the market and gain share is a direct result of our team's relentless commitment to providing excellent customer service. And I want to thank all of our team members for their dedication to our company and to our customers.\nNow I will walk through our second quarter gross margin results, what we are seeing in the competitive environment and discuss our investments in inventory, exciting developments in our store and distribution growth and capital expenditures.\nBeginning with gross margin. Our second quarter gross margin of 51.3% was down just 6 basis points from the second quarter of 2022 and at the top end of our expectations. Our second quarter of 2023 represents the first quarter after we have fully lapped the rollout of our professional pricing initiative and atypical LIFO impacts, which provides us a much clearer read on a year-over-year gross margin performance, excluding the noise that these factors have caused in prior quarters.\nWe are pleased with the stability of our gross profit results, especially in light of the pressure we continue to face from the extremely strong performance of our professional business. As this side of our business has continued to outperform, we have faced mix headwinds to gross margin but have been able to offset this pressure with incremental improvements in acquisition cost, solid leverage of distribution expenses and positive shrink results.\nI would also like to provide some color on the cost and pricing dynamics we are seeing in our industry, both on the acquisition side of our supply chain and across the competitive environment in our markets. The short and sweet answer is that our industry remains rational and cost and pricing continue to be very stable, consistent with what we have seen over the past several quarters. Our supplier partners continue to see some degree of inflationary pressure, while at the same time, we have been able to realize incremental opportunities to reduce acquisition costs across some product categories.\nThese puts and takes are occurring in a much more normalized pattern than what we experienced in 2021 and 2022 and are in line with how we would view normal conditions in our industry from a historical perspective.\nPricing to DIY and professional customers in the industry has remained rational. And we have not seen significant changes in market pricing dynamics in the industry in 2023. Where we have seen increases in product acquisition and other costs, we continue to be successful in passing these increases through in selling price and are confident that this will continue into the future. As we have discussed many times on these calls, prices ultimately not always the deciding factor that determines where a customer will take their business.\nOur team continues to perform at a high level by delivering industry-leading product availability and excellent customer service, and these strengths have enabled us to win share at appropriate gross margins in a competitive industry.\nAs we move into the back half of 2023, our gross margin results can vary based on product sales mix in any individual quarter or the timing of the pass-through of acquisition cost changes. But we are maintaining our full year gross margin guidance and continue to expect the back half of the year to fall within the 50.8% to 51.3% range.\nInventory per store finished the quarter at $762,000, which was in line with our expectations, up 12% from this time last year and 4% compared to the beginning of the year. We continue to track toward our planned inventory per store increase of 2% by the end of 2023. Our AP-to-inventory ratio at the end of the second quarter was 134%, in line with the beginning of the year and slightly better than our expectations, supported by strong sales volumes and inventory turns.\nWe are pleased with the health of our supply chain and continued improvements in store in-stock position. It is clear to us that our industry-leading inventory availability has been a key factor driving our robust sales results, and we continue to prioritize deploying the right inventory at the optimal position in our DC, hub and store network.\nTurning to our growth initiatives and capital investment. We are extremely excited to complete the very successful opening of our first new O'Reilly distribution center in Guadalajara, Mexico earlier in July. This 370,000 square foot facility will have the capacity to ultimately service 250 stores in the Guadalajara Metro area and surrounding regions in Mexico.\nEven more importantly, our new facility will be a game changer for our business model in Mexico. Since our entry into Mexico in 2019, we have supported our inventory strategies by utilizing a network of smaller distribution centers and warehouses that were part of the historical operations of Mayasa. Our new facility gives us the ability to deploy a much more significant inventory investment and leverage this enhanced and highly competitive inventory availability position.\nIt is our goal in Mexico, just as in all our domestic markets, to be the industry leader in putting the right part in the hands of our customers faster than the competition. And our new facility in Guadalajara provides the necessary platform to execute our strategy. We have a long history of successful distribution center openings, but each new facility is a significant undertaking and requires incredible hard work and coordination across our organization.\nWe could not be more pleased with the partnership between our U.S. and Mexico teams that drove the highly successful acquisition, development and opening of this new facility. It is an understatement to say that our store teams in Mexico are very energized by the opportunities that our new distribution center unlocks. And they are dedicated to leveraging all of our competitive advantages as they outwork the competition to grow market share.\nFrom a store growth perspective, we successfully opened 42 stores during the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 100 net new store openings. Our team is on pace to hit our plan of 180 to 190 net new store openings for 2023. Our openings in the first half of the year were very well balanced across our store footprint with new stores coming online in 34 different states, Puerto Rico and Mexico.\nOur ability to spread our growth across many markets positions us to be highly selective in hiring and training the outstanding teams that drive the success of our new stores. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our new stores and view our organic store growth as a key priority for our use of capital.\nTotal capital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2023 were $461 million, up substantially from the first 6 months of 2022, but in line with our ambitious plans to deploy capital against projects and initiatives that will drive long-term growth and operational gains for our business. We remain on target to hit our capital expenditure guidance range of $750 million to $800 million.\nTo close my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and continued dedication to our customers.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued hard work and exceptional professionalism. Now we will cover some additional details on our second quarter results and guidance for the remainder of 2023.\nFor the quarter, sales increased $398 million driven by a 9% increase in comparable store sales and a $75 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base.\nBrad covered our SG&A expense in the quarter in detail, but I did want to provide some additional color on our deferred compensation plan expenses given the nature of how this plan runs through our income statement. For many years, the company has sponsored a nonqualified deferred comp plan for team members whose participation would otherwise be limited in our qualified 401(k) plan. Since this is a nonqualified plan, the company maintains a liability for the obligation to pay the value of the deferred compensation to team members in the future, adjusted to reflect asset performance and also holds a corresponding asset for the fully funded and participant-directed assets in the plan.\nHowever, market value changes in the plan are reflected on different line items on our income statement with an increase in value driving an increase in SG&A expense and an offsetting benefit below the line in other income. Historically, the net impact has not been significant to either line item, but given the increased size of the planned assets and the more significant market value changes both in the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, we wanted to highlight the difference so that you will be able to update your models.\nThe year-over-year swing in the market values of planned assets drove a $9 million increase in SG&A expense or 24 basis points with a corresponding $9 million year-over-year favorable change in other income and expense.\nOur second quarter effective tax rate was 22.5% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.3%, reduced by a 1.8% benefit from share-based compensation. This compares to the second quarter 2022 rate of 23.8% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base rate of 24.3% reduced by 0.5% benefit from share-based compensation. Our second quarter base tax rate was in line with our expectations with the total effective tax rate below our expectations due to the higher-than-planned benefits from share-based compensation.\nFor the full year of 2023, we now expect an effective tax rate of 22.5% comprised of a base rate of 23.4%, reduced by a benefit of 0.9% from share-based compensation. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the totaling of certain tax periods. Variation in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2023 was $1.2 billion, in line with the first half of 2022, with growth in income and a benefit from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits, offset by increased capital expenditures in 2023 versus the prior year and a lower benefit from a reduction in net inventory this year versus 2022. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow at a range of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, up $100 million from our previous guidance range based on operating cash flow performance in the first half of the year.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.92x, which is up compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x with the increase driven by borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time.\nWe continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 0.8 million shares at an average share price of $904.37 for a total investment of $680 million. Year-to-date, through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average share price of $855.22 for a total investment of $1.9 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price, inclusive of the current excise tax cost, is supported by the discounted expected future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs a reminder, the updated EPS guidance outlined by Greg earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nFinally, before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's long-term success.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Matthew, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Ali, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ali. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our first quarter 2023 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements. And we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nYou can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Greg Johnson.\n\nGregory D. Johnson\n\nCo-President & Chief Executive Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts first quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are our Co-Presidents, Brad Beckham and Brent Kirby; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.\nI'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on a strong start to 2023. Delivering such consistent strong results requires an unrelenting commitment to excellent customer service from our team of over 86,000 professional parts people across the U.S. and Mexico. I am extremely grateful for the hard work our team puts in each and every day.\nOur first quarter results were highlighted by a robust 10.8% increase in comparable store sales as our team continued to deliver outstanding growth on top of strong performance in the prior year. These top line results exceeded our expectations and demonstrate O'Reilly strength on both the professional and DIY sides of our business.\nTeam O'Reilly charged out of the gate this year, highly motivated to execute on our initiatives to invest in our people, further refine and enhance our business tools and aggressively grow our market share. We have been very pleased with the momentum our teams have generated in 2023. Our team members and our culture remain our greatest assets. And our ongoing commitment to build on both of these competitive advantages is paying clear dividends through the sustained strong results delivered quarterly quarter after quarter.\nTeam O'Reilly remains highly focused on expense control and prudent capital deployment, enabling us to translate our sales gains and growth into outstanding returns for our shareholders.\nFor the first quarter, our diluted earnings per share of $8.28 represents a 15% increase over the prior year. We are increasing our full year 2023 EPS guidance to a range of $36.56 -- $36.50 to $37 even, reflecting our first quarter outperformance and shares repurchased since our last call. At the midpoint of the revised range, we now expect our full year EPS to increase 10% over 2022.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brad and Brent to provide additional detail on the first quarter, I'd like to reiterate our confidence in the favorable outlook for both our industry and our company for the balance of 2023. We view our first quarter top line results as a clear reflection of the strong demand backdrop in our industry.\nWe also remain firm in our belief that consumers will continue to prioritize the maintenance and repair of their existing vehicles in the face of economic pressures in order to avoid taking on a payment for a higher-priced, newer vehicle. This value proposition compelling consumers to reinvest in their existing vehicles continues to be further supported by elevated new and used vehicle prices.\nEncouragingly, the U.S. consumer remains resilient with low unemployment rates, wage growth and stabilization in fuel prices, supporting both consumer health and the steady growth in miles driven. While we still maintain an element of caution with regard to the outlook for the overall U.S. economy and potential for heightened economic pressures, we believe the current market dynamics combine to provide a strong backdrop for demand in our industry. Even more importantly, we believe our strategic competitive advantages uniquely position our company to capitalize on the positive fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket and grow at a faster rate than the industry as a whole.\nTo wrap up my comments, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly for continuing to uphold our culture of excellent customer service. Your commitment to our culture, our fellow team members and our customers drives our success and makes you the best team in the business.\nLastly, I would also like to extend our gratitude to our shareholders. This past week marked our 30th anniversary as a public company with our initial public offering in April of 1993. The O'Reilly family had the wisdom and foresight to recognize the benefits of obtaining capital through the public markets to grow our business as well as extending ownership opportunities to our team members to allow us all to share in the company's success.\nOur incredible financial performance as a public company is a true testament to the dedication of our team. In each of the 30 years since 1993, our team has delivered growth in both sales and EPS, driving returns to our shareholders in excess of 22% per year on a compounded annual basis. We see a bright future for O'Reilly and are thankful for the trust and confidence our shareholders have placed in the O'Reilly team over the years.\nI'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nEVP of Store Operations & Sales, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to begin with a sincere thank you to Team O'Reilly for their commitment to our continued success through providing excellent customer service. We have set an incredibly high bar of performance, and I could not be more excited about the momentum our team drove in the first quarter by executing on the fundamentals of our business and taking care of our customers every day.\nOur ambitious goals require dedication and hard work from every area of our organization, and I'm extremely proud of the way Team O'Reilly continues to deliver.\nNow I'd like to take some time to walk through the details of our sales performance for the first quarter and what we saw on each side of the business. I'll start with the professional side of our business, which was the outperformer in the quarter and the driver of our above-expectation results.\nOur professional sales growth on a comparable basis exceeded 20% for the quarter, and we were very pleased to see outperformance steadily throughout the quarter. The growth trend in our professional business continues to be very strong even in light of increasingly challenging comparisons, and these compounded gains are the direct result of our team's outstanding execution.\nFor us, the bread and butter of our execution on the professional side of our business is always ensuring we have the right part available for our customers when and where they need it and providing efficient delivery service so that a customer can get cars off the rack and turn their base, but it doesn't stop there.\nProviding top-notch customer service also includes our professional parts people regularly visiting our customers and spending time in their shops, making sure we are doing all we can to deliver value as a business partner, whether it be educating them on our store team and service, our products, equipping that shop with shop management tools or providing training to their technicians.\nFocusing on these fundamentals and building long-term loyal relationships are the key drivers of our robust professional sales results. We continue to expect our professional business to be the stronger driver of our growth in 2023, but also see exciting opportunities on the DIY side of our business to win share in the marketplace.\nTurning to our DIY business. We were generally pleased with our results for the quarter with our teams delivering positive comparable store sales growth each month of the quarter driven by solid results in January and February mixed with some weather-related pressure in March.\nThe first quarter has historically seen the most weather-driven volatility in our business as we see impacts both from the type and severity of winter weather and from the timing of the onset of spring weather. Our DIY customers often take on jobs in their driveways and will take advantage of the first warm days of spring to perform repair, maintenance and tune up items that were temporarily on hold during the winter.\nThe pace of our DIY business in the first quarter was definitely impacted by this weather volatility as unseasonably cool, wet weather across much of the country pressured our March results. However, spring finally sprung as we turned into the calendar into April, and we have been pleased with the solid rebound we have seen in our DIY business.\nThe DIY improvement, coupled with continued robust professional sales growth, has resulted in a strong start to the second quarter. As we have said more than a few times over the years, we don't like to talk about weather since it's out of our control. But on balance, so far in 2023, the volatility in our sales results lines up pretty much exactly with what we would expect, given the timing of spring.\nNow I would like to provide some color on our ticket count and average ticket performance. Strong ticket count comps on the professional side of our business were partially offset by pressure to DIY ticket counts in the quarter. Directionally, our ticket counts performed as we expected with the gap wider than our original outlook because of the outperformance in our professional business and, to a lesser degree, the weather headwind to DIY in March.\nWe saw mid-single-digit average ticket growth supported by same-SKU inflation at similar levels and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our benefit from same-SKU inflation was primarily the result of year-over-year benefit of price increases we passed along in 2022 as opposed to significant incremental cost increases in the first quarter.\nAs a result of this dynamic, we expect first quarter will be the most significant benefit to average ticket increases from same-SKU inflation and continue to expect this benefit to moderate as we move throughout the year and compare against higher price level stemming from price increases in the first half of this year.\nTo wrap up my comments on sales, I would like to highlight our sales guidance and full year outlook. We are maintaining our full year comparable store sales guidance range of 4% to 6% and total sales guidance of $15.2 billion to $15.5 billion.\nAfter incorporating above plan first quarter results, we are trending above our full year midpoint and are encouraged by the strength we have seen thus far. However, even though we outpaced our sales plan in the first quarter, our original expectations had already anticipated some of the strength we saw in Q1.\nAs we discussed when we laid out our expectations on our last call, we expect first half 2023 comps to be stronger as a result of the year-over-year same-SKU inflation benefit as well as easier ticket count comparisons on both sides of our business. While we are pleased with our strong sales performance thus far in 2023, we're always cautious about overreacting to first quarter results, especially in light of the weather volatility we can see at the beginning of the year.\nUltimately, as Greg noted, we believe industry dynamics are positive and supportive of strong demand moving forward. And we are optimistic about our ability to drive strong results as we move through the year.\nRest assured, our teams are focused on taking share in every market and on both sides of the business regardless of any challenges that may arise.\nOur teams do not waste energy focusing on things outside of our control. We work in a people, service and relationship business. And we spend 100% of our time focusing on and executing the basic fundamentals of our business. Ownership and everything we can control with our team and our service levels is at the core of our culture and in turn, everything we do.\nNow I'd like to discuss our SG&A performance in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 31.7%, a deleverage of 14 basis points from the first quarter of 2022. Our first quarter SG&A results included a planned approximately 35 basis point headwind from the resumption of our annual in-person leadership conference in February.\nAs we discussed on our conference call in February, this event was our first in-person conference since 2020, and as such, was a headwind to our first quarter SG&A on a year-over-year comparison basis. However, this spend is one of the absolute best investments we make in our team as we celebrated our successes from 2022, shared best practices and strategies for better serving our customers, expanded product knowledge, perpetuated our culture and energized our team to be the dominant supplier of auto parts in each of their markets in 2023.\nAs noted on our last call, we have also invested in our team through the enhanced paid time-off program we rolled out at the end of 2022, which resulted in a $28 million SG&A charge in the fourth quarter of 2022. On a full year basis, the total cost for this program in 2023 will be roughly comparable to our fourth quarter 2022 charge that creates a year-over-year headwinds in the first 3 quarters of 2023 but a positive comparison in the fourth quarter of this year.\nFor the first quarter, our SG&A per store increased 9.6%, which is well above our expected full year run rate in part because of the year-over-year impacts from both our leadership conference and the team member benefit plan transition. In total, our SG&A spend in the first quarter was above our original plan coming into the quarter driven by incremental costs related to stronger-than-anticipated sales but is in line with our expectations given the sales performance.\nAs we move forward in 2023, we will continue to execute our plans targeted at strengthening our team member experience and benefits, upgrading our vehicle fleet, refreshing and improving our store image and appearance and deploying incremental technology projects as well as investments in infrastructure.\nWe are investing in our teams and our customer service levels from a position of strength. And we'll continue to capitalize on opportunities we see to accelerate share gains, drive long-term profitable growth and generate strong returns on our investments. These initiatives are on track through the first quarter, and we have continued confidence in our ability to deliver on these items as planned.\nFor the full year, we expect to see SG&A per store increase of approximately 4.5% at the top end of our original guide of 4% to 4.5% as a result of incremental spend in the first quarter to support our robust sales growth. Finally, we are maintaining our operating margin guidance range at 19.8% to 20.3% of sales.\nTo conclude my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their dedication to our success. I am very fortunate to continue to spend time in our stores with our team members and with our customers, both DIY and professional, and can assure you our teams remain focused on relentless execution of our customer service fundamentals.\nOur team has a proven playbook that has been developed over the 65 years O'Reilly Auto Parts has been serving customers. And our team members are passionate about upholding our standards of service and professionalism. Thank you, Team O'Reilly, and great job.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Supply Chain Officer, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would also like to give my thanks to Team O'Reilly for your performance in the first quarter. These outstanding results are a testament to your efforts and focus on our culture of providing excellent customer service.\nNow I will take some time to walk through our first quarter gross margin results, discuss our inventory position and provide color on our store growth and capital investments. Beginning with gross margin. Our first quarter gross margin of 51% was an 84 basis point decrease from the first quarter of 2022, but in line with our expectations. As we noted in our last call, we anticipated comparison pressures in the first 2 quarters of this year. Our results in the first quarter hit those expectations, and I will now provide some color on what we saw.\nFirst, our year-over-year gross margin results for the first quarter were impacted by the rollout of our professional pricing initiative last year, which began in the middle of the first quarter of 2022. We fully lapped the higher gross margin run rate in the first half of the quarter and will be apples-to-apples in the comparison for the remainder of 2023.\nSecondly, we have a headwind as we compare against the final roll-through of our historic LIFO accounting benefit in the first quarter of 2022, which we noted at the time was approximately $10 million in that quarter. Both of these headwinds were in line with our expectations for the quarter and will not impact gross margin moving forward.\nIn addition to the anticipated pressure from the first quarter in pro pricing and LIFO, we also saw continued gross margin pressure from a higher mix of professional business, some of which was planned and some resulting from our outperformance versus our expectations as that side of the business continues to grow faster but also carries a lower gross margin.\nHowever, product margin on both sides of our business has been slightly better than expected, resulting from positive acquisition cost benefits, offsetting some of the pressure from the higher-than-planned mix of professional sales.\nWhile we are pleased with our results so far this year, we remain cautious regarding the cost outlook for the remainder of 2023, including the prospect for incremental reductions to acquisition cost. Our supply chain partners continue to face anticipated broad inflationary pressures, and we expect to see a relatively stable cost environment with potential for puts and takes in both directions.\nPricing in the industry has remained rational. If we see future increases in product acquisition or other costs, we are confident in our ability to pass those cost increases through in selling price. We are maintaining our full year gross margin guidance of 50.8% to 51.3% and expect our quarterly gross margin performance for the remainder of the year to be consistent on a quarter-to-quarter basis and within that range.\nInventory per store finished the quarter at $754,000, which was up 14% from this time last year but flat compared to the beginning of the year. We continue to track toward our planned inventory per store increase of 2% by the end of 2023 and are constantly working to deploy our inventory at the optimal position across our distribution centers and hub stores in our tiered distribution network.\nOur supply chain and store in-stock positions are as strong as they have been in several years. And the diligent work that our merchandise inventory management and distribution teams have done to deploy the best possible local inventory assortment is reaping benefits and strong top line results.\nOur AP to inventory ratio at the end of the first quarter was 133% and continues to be supported by strong sales volumes and inventory turns. Net inventory investment remained flat compared to the beginning of the year, and we remain pleased with the returns generated from ensuring that we are the industry leader in product availability.\nTurning to our progress on store growth and capital investments. We successfully opened 60 new stores during the first quarter. Within these openings, there are a few milestones that I would like to highlight.\nFirst, we kicked off the year with our entrance into Maryland, marking our 48th state. Not long after, we celebrated the opening of our 6,000th store on February 23 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma. Finally, we successfully opened our first 2 stores and a distribution center in Puerto Rico in March. We are truly proud of these accomplishments and would like to thank and congratulate all of the teams involved in achieving these milestones.\nGrowth is always hard work, and Team O'Reilly does an outstanding job of rolling up their sleeves and ensuring that each O'Reilly store is a model of excellent customer service and industry-leading product availability. Our team's ability to perpetuate our culture and execute on our dual market strategy is the reason our store growth continues to drive premium returns on the capital that we invest.\nOur team is marching ahead toward our goal of 180 to 190 net new store openings for 2023. We still have an ambitious year ahead of us in terms of growth initiatives and capital investments to fund those plans.\nOur capital expenditures for the first quarter were $223 million. And our projects and initiatives are still on track for us to hit our capital expenditure guidance of $750 million to $800 million.\nProgress on our distribution center in Guadalajara, Mexico remains on schedule for an opening this summer. We are excited about the opportunity that this new facility will create for us in terms of enhanced service levels to the Guadalajara metropolitan area as well as future store growth across Mexico for many years to come.\nBefore I turn the call over to Jeremy, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their accomplishments during the quarter and for their enthusiasm for excellent customer service. It is a real privilege to be a part of the best team in the automotive aftermarket.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nSenior VP of Finance & Controller, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and the outstanding professionalism as they deliver excellent customer service every day.\nNow we will cover some additional details on our first quarter results and guidance for the remainder of 2023. For the quarter, sales increased $412 million driven by a 10.8% increase in comparable store sales and a $68 million noncomp contribution from stores opened in 2022 and 2023 that have not yet entered the comp base. For 2023, we continue to expect our total revenues to be $15.2 billion to $15.5 billion.\nBrent covered our gross margin performance and guidance already, but I would like to remind everyone that we view our reported GAAP gross margin as the best measurement of our gross margin performance and do not view the normal application of LIFO as a discrete charge in the evaluation of gross margin.\nThe comparison headwind in first quarter of 2023 resulting from the $10 million LIFO benefit recognized in the first quarter of 2022 is unique to our first quarter comparisons. And we will not have a discrete LIFO impact for the remainder of 2023.\nOur first quarter effective tax rate was 23.7% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.3% reduced by a 0.6% benefit from share-based compensation. This compares to the first quarter 2022 rate of 23.9% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base rate of 24.3% reduced by a 0.4% benefit from share-based compensation.\nOur first quarter effective tax rate was in line with our expectations. For the full year of 2023, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 22.9%, comprised of a base rate of 23.4% reduced by a benefit of 0.5% from share-based compensation. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods. Variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the quarter of 2023 was $486 million versus $579 million for the first quarter of 2022 with the decrease driven by higher capital expenditures in '23 versus the prior year. For 2023, our expected free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at a range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.96x, which is up compared to our end of 2022 ratio of 1.84x with the increase driven by borrowings on our revolving credit facility. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x and plan to prudently approach that number over time.\nWe continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at an average share price of $819.06 for a total investment of $1.1 billion. Subsequent to the end of the quarter and through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 0.2 million shares at an average share price of $864.44 for a total investment of $137 million.\nThe excise tax on share repurchases that was implemented as part of the Inflation Reduction Act became effective for all share repurchases beginning January 1, 2023, and is assessed at 1% of the aggregate fair market value of net share repurchases. We incurred $11.1 million in excise tax during the first quarter, which is reflected directly in our balance sheet and retained earnings.\nWe remain very confident that the average repurchase price, inclusive of the current excise tax cost, is supported by the discounted expected future cash flows of our business. And we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, the EPS guidance outlined by Greg earlier includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nFinally, before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their commitment to our customers and our company.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Ali, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Paul, and I will be your operator for today's call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and our outlook for 2023. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under, the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nYou can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and other recent SEC filings.\nThe company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. At this time, I would like to introduce Greg Johnson.\n\nGregory D. Johnson\n\nCEO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts fourth quarter conference call. Before we begin our discussion on our results and our plans for 2023, I'd like to take a few moments to discuss the announcement we made in January regarding the promotion of Brad Beckham and Brent Kirby to co-Presidents.\nOur company is extremely focused on identifying and developing leaders, who in turn are relentless in building the very best team in our industry. Our long-term commitment to succession planning is a critical component of our human capital strategy. In line with that strategy, we're extremely pleased to have Brent and Brad assume the elevated positions of Co-Presidents.\nBrad and Brent are exceptional leaders, and are both driven by their passion for perpetuating our O'Reilly culture and providing excellent service to our customers. Brad and Brent bring diverse and broad experience to their roles of co-President. Brad's career with O'Reilly began 26 years ago when he joined the company as a parts specialist in Wagoner, Oklahoma.\nHe has progressed through every leadership role in our store operations group, from Store Manager through Executive Vice President of Store Operations and Sales, before assuming the role of EVP and Chief Operating Officer, and now Co-President.\nBrad's leadership has been instrumental in the growth and expansion of our company and his impact is evident throughout the leadership ranks of our operational teams, many of whom have been mentored and promoted directly by Brad. As Co-President, Brad is responsible for the company's domestic and international store operations and sales, real estate and expansion, human resources, training, legal, risk management, loss prevention and finance.\nLike Brad, Brent brings decades of retail leadership experience to his role as Co-President. Brent began his 35-year retail career with Lowe's companies and progressed through their ranks, ultimately serving in the roles of Senior Vice President of Store Operations, Chief Omnichannel Officer, and Chief Supply Chain Officer.\nBrent joined Team O'Reilly in 2018 as our Senior Vice President of omnichannel and made an immediate impact in that role before assuming leadership of our supply chain and distribution efforts. His extensive experience and significant DIY and professional retail industry knowledge is critical to our efforts to enhance our industry-leading inventory position, leverage technology investments to deliver powerful tools for our team, and drive deep connections with our DIY and professional customers.\nAs Co-President, Brent is responsible for the company's distribution operations, logistics, merchandising, inventory management, pricing, advertising, omnichannel, customer satisfaction, program management, electronic catalog, and information technology.\nAgain, I am very pleased to have Brad and Brent step into these new roles, and I'm excited about the leadership they will provide to team O'Reilly as Co-Presidents. Brad and Brent are participating on the call with me this morning, along with Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. I'm once again pleased to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another record-breaking year in 2022.\nWe finished the year with incredible momentum, posting a comparable store sales increase of 9% in the fourth quarter, representing an increase of almost 35% on a 3-year stack basis. For the full year of 2022, our team generated a robust 6.4% comparable store sales growth, which came in above the revised guidance range of 4.5% to 5.5% we provided last quarter and above the midpoint of our original comp range of 5% to 7% we said at the beginning of 2022.\nEven more impressive, our 6.4% comparable store sales growth in 2022 followed representing sales growth in 2021 and 2020 when we delivered comps of 13.3% and 10.9%, respectively, resulting in 3-year stacked comps exceeding 30%.\nThese strong top line results drove another year of record earnings per share as diluted EPS increased 8% to $33.44, representing a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 23%. Our ability to continue to grow our business and capture market share year in and year out is a testament to our team's commitment to providing excellent customer service, and we couldn't be more pleased with how our team finished 2022.\nEntering 2023, we remain bullish on the opportunities we see ahead of us, and are anticipating another strong year of sales and earnings growth. For earnings per share, we have established the guidance for 2023 at $35.75 to $36.25, representing an increase of 8% versus 2022 at the midpoint.\nAchievement of our 2023 guidance would result in us doubling our EPS over the last 4 years, representing a compounded annual growth rate of over 19%. This impressive performance and challenging target is a testament to the quality of our team and their commitment to our customers. Brad, Brent and Jeremy will walk through the rest of our detailed outlook in their prepared comments.\nBut for now, I will just say that we're excited about the aggressive plans we have to invest in our business and continue to take market share and drive industry-leading results. Before I turn the call over to Brad, I want to share a little bit about the incredible culture building experience our team just had in January at our Annual Leadership Conference in Dallas.\nEach year, we bring all of our store managers, field leadership, as well as our sales and DC management team members together in one place at one time to build leadership skills, enhance product knowledge, share best practices across our company, and celebrate our award-winning performance.\nThe theme of this year's conference was: One Team, Reunited. And it was definitely an appropriate rallying cry for our first in-person leadership conference in 3 years. The passion and energy displayed by our company leaders was infectious, and it gives us even more confidence in the Team O'Reilly's ability to drive future success through their unwavering commitment to our customers and fellow team members.\nTo wrap up my prepared comments, I want to thank each of our team members for their dedication to our long-term success and their outstanding performance in 2022. I'm extremely proud of all of you, and I'm confident 2023 will be another record-setting year for Team O'Reilly. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nCo-President, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to begin my comments this morning by congratulating Team O'Reilly on another great year in 2022. Our team's focus on providing consistent, excellent customer service allowed us to generate the outstanding results we reported yesterday, and we are excited about the opportunities we see to continue to grow our business.\nNow I'd like to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter comparable store sales results and outline our guidance for 2023. As we discussed on our third quarter conference call, we started the fourth quarter with strong sales volumes in line with trends we saw as we exited the third quarter. Those robust sales volumes continued through the end of the year, delivering results solidly above our expectations on both the professional and DIY sides of our business each month of the quarter.\nFrom a cadence perspective, the monthly comp was steady throughout the quarter with December being the strongest month of the quarter on a 2- and 3-year stack basis. As we finished the year, we saw broad-based strength across all of our markets and weather-related categories, such as batteries cooling and antifreeze, as well as our other core non-weather-related categories.\nWe saw strength in both our DIY and professional businesses, with professional again leading the way with double-digit comparable store sales growth on robust increases in both ticket counts and average ticket size. As we finished 2022, we were very pleased with our professional performance, and we believe the momentum we have created is the direct result of our team executing our proven business model at a high level and providing industry-leading customer service.\nWe were also pleased to see the improved performance in our DIY business, which accelerated on a 1, 2 and 3-year comparable store sales growth basis, driven by our strong average ticket growth. As anticipated, DIY ticket counts were a partial offset to our comp growth due to difficult comparisons from strong traffic growth in the previous 2 years, but improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, continuing the trend we saw in the third quarter and exceeding our expectations.\nAs we saw throughout 2022, growth in average ticket values drove our total comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter. Average ticket size grew in the high single digits on both sides of our business, supported primarily by the mid-single-digit growth in same SKU inflation and augmented by a benefit from increasing parts complexity and improved quality and design of new parts.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we saw a moderation in the same SKU benefit after peaking in the second and third quarters as we lap the acceleration of higher inflation in 2021 and saw modest increases in selling prices as we finished out 2022. The moderation in selling price increases correlate with what we're seeing in product acquisition costs as industry pricing has remained rational on both sides of the business, and we've been successful in passing through cost increases.\nNow I want to transition to a discussion of our 2023 sales guidance and our outlook for this year. As we disclosed in our earnings release yesterday, we are establishing our annual comparable store sales guidance for 2023 at a range of 4% to 6%. And we want to provide some color on the factors that are driving our expectations as it relates to both our outlook for our industry as well as the specific opportunities we see for our company.\nI'll begin with our view of the prospects for our industry which we believe are still very favorable. The health of the automotive aftermarket continues to be supported by strength in the core fundamental drivers of demand and the last few years have further reinforced the compelling value proposition that motivates consumers to invest in their vehicles.\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the scarcity of vehicles has forced many consumers to keep their vehicles longer. These investments the consumers have made to keep their vehicles well maintained and paid off, and we expect to see a continued willingness by consumers to invest in their high-quality vehicles at higher and higher mileages.\nWe also have a positive outlook on the strength of the consumer our industry and their ongoing willingness to prioritize their transportation needs. We continue to view the health of our customers as strong, supported by extremely low unemployment and robust growth in wages over the past 2 years.\nWe think these factors provide a solid backdrop for growth in miles driven in our industry and solid demand over the next year. While miles driven still remain below pre-pandemic levels, we've seen growth in this key fundamental for our industry over the past 18 months.\nWe believe we will see a continuation of the long-term industry trend of steady growth in miles driven, resulting from population growth and an increase in the size of the U.S. car park. As we think about the broader macro factors that could impact the U.S. economy in the coming year, we remain cautious in our outlook for -- outlook concerning ongoing headwinds from inflation and the potential for deterioration in economic conditions.\nNegative trends in the broader economy can -- it can influence demand in our industry in the short term, but we have consistently seen over time that consumers adjust quickly in challenging environments. In fact, in 2022, it was a good illustration of how this can play out.\nThe pressure we saw from elevated gas prices, broad-based inflation and global economic shocks weighed on our results versus our expectations in the first half of the year. However, our customers adjusted as conditions stabilize and our business rebounded to meet our full year sales growth expectations.\nOur experience through multiple economic cycles in our company's history is that consumers will prioritize the maintenance and the repair of their existing vehicles as a means to avoid a car payment and save money in the face of economic pressures. Ultimately, due to the nondiscretionary and value-driven nature of our business, we have confidence our industry will perform well in 2023, even if we end up facing challenges in the broader economy.\nAs confident as we are in the strength of our industry, the most important driver for our outlook for 2023 is the opportunity we see to outperform our competition and gain market share by out-executing -- or excuse me, by executing our business model and providing the best customer service in the industry.\nTo this end, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our outlook on both sides of our business. We expect both our DIY and professional businesses to be positive contributors to our comparable store sales growth in 2023, with professional again expected to outperform.\nWe are excited about the strength we built in 2022 in our professional business and we believe this will continue to accelerate our growth on this side of the business. We remain highly committed to being the industry leader in the quality of service and inventory availability we provide to the professional customer, and our focus moving into 2023 is to aggressively lever these strengths to further consolidate this side of the market.\nWe also see significant opportunity to grow our DIY business, but are more cautious in how we view our ability to increase ticket counts on a year-over-year basis. Our DIY ticket counts in 2022 were pressured in comparison to 2021 as we were still calendaring the impact of government stimulus and faced headwinds from gas price shocks and inflation.\nWe feel like we have now completely lapped the artificial spikes in demand and are pleased with steady DIY traffic we saw in the back half of the year. While there's been a lot of volatility in our comparisons over the past 3 years, our overall growth in DIY ticket counts has been solidly positive in total during that time frame.\nWe have clearly taken market share since the onset of the pandemic through consistent execution and excellent service even as we face the long-term industry trend of pressure to DIY ticket counts. For 2023, we will continue to face this industry dynamic where increased complexity and quality of parts extend service and repair intervals.\nAs a result, we anticipate DIY traffic down slightly in 2023 with an expectation that we will continue to gain market share to partially offset the normal industry drag on ticket counts. We expect the pressure to DIY traffic to be more than offset by increased average ticket.\nWe anticipate average ticket on both sides of our business to benefit from low single-digit inflation arising from the carryover benefit on a year-over-year basis as we compare against price levels that ramp throughout 2022.\nConsistent with our historical practice, we are including only modest increases in price levels from this point forward in 2023. We do not expect to see growth in average ticket values above and beyond same-SKU inflation, resulting from increased product complexity and our ability to trade customers up to a higher product on the good-better-best spectrum.\nAs we move through 2023, we anticipate comps in the first half of the year to be stronger than the back half as a result of the year-over-year same-SKU inflation as well as easier comparisons in professional ticket counts, which ramped throughout 2022, and to a lesser degree DIY ticket counts which face more pronounced pressure in the first half of last year.\nWe are off to a strong start thus far in 2023, and we are pleased to see continued momentum on both sides of our business. Now I want to spend some time covering our SG&A and operating profit performance in 2022 and our outlook for 2023 before turning the call over to Brent who will provide color on our gross margin.\nFourth quarter SG&A expense as a percentage of sales was 32.2%, in line with the fourth quarter of 2021. As we noted in our press release yesterday, this number includes $28 million charge associated with our transition to an enhanced pay time off program for our team members.\nAverage per store SG&A for 2022 was just -- was up just over 4.8%, driven by incremental variable operating expenses on better-than-expected sales volumes and cost inflation in fuel, wage rates and team member benefits. Over the last several years, our teams have demonstrated an ability to drive an enhanced level of profitability and productivity on our SG&A spend as we are pleased with the strong finish to 2022.\nAs we look forward to 2023, we are planning to grow average SG&A per store by approximately 4.5%. This level of spend is a step change higher than we would normally forecast in our initial SG&A guidance. While we anticipate facing some pressures to costs from ongoing inflation, the majority of our incremental spend anticipated in 2023 reflects deliberate decisions we are making to invest in our business.\nWe are targeting initiatives we believe will enhance the value proposition we offer to both our team members and customers by investing in our professional parts people, in our customer service levels, in turn, driving both long-term sales and operating profit dollar growth.\nWe plan to deploy these resources to enhance our long-term operational strength with specific emphasis on strengthening our team member experience and benefits, upgrading our store vehicle fleet, refreshing and improving our store image and appearance, and deploying incremental technology projects as well as investments in infrastructure.\nWe believe we have an opportunity to capitalize on our strong competitive position in our industry and further separate ourselves as we consolidate the market. We are highly confident our investment and these initiatives will provide strong long-term returns, but anticipate we will face initial pressure to our SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2023.\nBased on these expectations, coupled with the normal drag from new store expansion in our anticipated gross margin rate, which Brent will discuss in a minute, we are setting our operating profit guidance range at 19.8% to 20.3% of sales. At the midpoint of our guidance, we are expecting operating profit to increase over 4%.\nUltimately, our leadership team is focused on enhancing the excellent customer service and overall value that create strong relationships with our customers on both sides of the business that in turn drive long-term growth in operating profits. To finish up my prepared comments, I want to add to what Greg has already said about the incredible experience we had as a leadership team in Dallas and the enthusiasm our team showed for our business and the O'Reilly culture.\nThis was my 26th Leadership Conference, my first being in 1998 when I first became a store manager, and there is no doubt in my mind, it was our best one yet. Since there was -- since this was our first in-person conference since 2020, the last 2 being virtual, there was certainly a lot for us to celebrate, but I was blown away by the commitment I saw from our team to not rest on our laurels or be satisfied with our past success.\nInstead, our team was passionate about the opportunities we have in front of us. As we look forward to 2023 and set an ambitious plan to outperform the competition and gain market share, we will be aggressive in supporting our teams and equipping them with the tools and resources to drive our company to an even higher level of performance. I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company. Now I will turn the call over to Brent.\n\nBrent G. Kirby\n\nCo-President, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin my remarks today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on yet another strong year. Once again, your commitment to consistent, excellent customer service drove outstanding results in 2022.\nAs Greg and Brad have already shared, it was a privilege to be able to get together with our industry-leading team, professional parts people at our leadership conference in January, and we are all incredibly excited about the strength of our business moving forward in 2023.\nToday, I'm going to discuss our fourth quarter and full year gross margin and supply chain results and our outlook for 2023 and provide color on our capital investments. Starting with gross margin. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 50.9% was 183 basis point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021, but in line with our guidance expectations.\nFor the full year, gross margin came in at 51.2%, which was 145 basis point decrease from last year. Our year-over-year margin results were primarily impacted by the rollout of our professional pricing initiative, combined with anticipated comparison headwinds to the LIFO benefits that we realized in 2021.\nWe are pleased to generate a full year gross margin rate in the upper end of our guidance range. However, we're even more excited to drive strong gross profit dollar growth. Our price investments and superior execution of our business model paid off in a solid 5% increase in gross profit dollars in 2022, which represents a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 11%.\nI want to thank our supply chain store operations and sales teams for their hard work in driving these results in a dynamic and very challenging market environment. For 2023, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 50.8% to 51.3%, which is consistent with how we viewed our margin guide throughout 2022.\nEven though we aren't anticipating a significant year-over-year change, there are a few puts and takes that I want to call out that we expect to impact our gross margin in 2023. To begin, we will face some remaining incremental pressure in the first quarter from our professional pricing initiative as we lap a higher gross margin run rate at the beginning of 2022 before we fully rolled out the initiative in the middle of the first quarter.\nWe also will face headwinds from a number of other factors, including comparisons to temporary benefits in the first half of 2022 from the timing of selling price increases, a higher planned mix of professional business in 2023 as that side of the business continues to grow faster, the calendaring of the remaining LIFO benefit that we realized in 2022, and pressure on distribution costs as we continue to stabilize our network after the disruptive periods we have seen during the pandemic, and face headwinds in the fixed cost we capitalized in inventory driven by a significantly smaller planned inventory build in 2023.\nOffsetting these headwinds, our gross margin outlook also includes an anticipated benefit from modest acquisition cost improvements. On balance, we still expect to see inflationary pressure in acquisition cost in 2023, driven by rising labor and raw material costs in the supply chain.\nThese are specific areas that we have seen some relief in from cost pressure that were passed along to us over the course of the last 2 years, specifically in freight and transportation costs. Beyond what we have built into our outlook for next year, we remain very cautious regarding the prospect for incremental reductions in acquisition costs as most of our supply chain partners continue to face broad inflationary pressures.\nOn an individual basis, none of the discrete factors I just outlined represent a significant impact to our gross margin. And candidly, we normally don't dig in at this level of detail in discussing the puts and takes that impact our margin. However, we think it's important to provide additional color since there are so many moving pieces.\nOver the last several years, we have seen variability in our quarterly margin results that are not typical of the normal cadence for our business, driven by significant cost inflation, the reversal of our historic LIFO debit balance and the implementation of our professional pricing initiative.\nIn 2023, we anticipate quarter-to-quarter gross margins to be more consistent, with only first quarter being slightly below our full year guidance, driven by product mix. However, since some of our comparisons are more challenging, in the first half of the year, we do expect to see some pressure on gross margin rate on a year-over-year basis in the first 2 quarters.\nInventory per store at the end of 2022 was $730,000, which was up 15% from the end of last year, which is significantly above the target that we set for inventory growth at the beginning of 2022. Over the course of much of the last 3 years, it has been our intent to aggressively add incremental inventory dollars, and we have been constrained by supply chain challenges and the necessity to keep up with the strong sales volumes and replenishment needs of our stores.\nAs we move through the back half of 2022, our supply chain distribution and store operations teams made tremendous progress in deploying additional inventory. We also proactively took advantage of opportunities to incrementally add inventory to our network as we saw upside in capitalizing on strong sales demand as supply constraints begin to ease.\nFor 2023, we are planning per store inventory to increase approximately 2%, which is below our historical run rates. This is primarily because of the inventory additions that we accelerated at the end of 2022. Our ongoing inventory management is geared to deploy the right inventory at the optimal position within our tiered distribution network.\nWhile our expected incremental additions in 2023 are modest, our plans include continued adjustments to push out and pull back inventory to ensure that we're offering the best possible local inventory assortments. A key part of our inventory deployment strategy is our ongoing evaluation and modification of all aspects of our hub store network, including the number of hub stores, sizing of inventory assortments and market positioning.\nA substantial amount of increased inventory that we deployed in 2022 and the dollars we plan to roll out in 2023 are targeted in our hub stores to further enhance our industry-leading inventory position. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 135%, which sets an all-time high for our company, and was heavily influenced by extremely strong sales volumes and inventory turns along with the impact from increased inflation and product acquisition costs.\nWhile we deployed significant incremental inventory into our distribution centers and stores in 2022, we actually saw a decrease in net inventory investment of $513 million. We anticipate our AP to inventory ratio to moderate slightly as we move through 2023 and currently expect to finish the year with a ratio of approximately 133%.\nOur capital expenditures in 2022 were $563 million, which fell short of our original plan by approximately $140 million. The lower CapEx was driven by a few different factors, including a heavier weighing of leased versus owned stores, the delay of certain store DC and headquarter projects and planned maintenance, and the timing of expenditures related to distribution expansion projects.\nIncluded in our expectations for 2023, our plan to deploy capital for the initiatives that were delayed in 2022, as well as support new store and DC development to support our long-term growth strategies in the U.S. and Mexico. For 2023, we are setting our capital expenditure guidance at $750 million to $800 million.\nWe have also established a target of 180 to 190 net new store openings with a planned heavier mix of owned versus leased locations. Our CapEx outlook also includes significant investments in our distribution network, as we will complete and open our newest distribute center in Guadalajara, Mexico and expect initial expenditures for future projects.\nWe have identified several exciting projects and initiatives in 2023 to enhance our service levels and provide customers an improved efficiency and product availability. Our CapEx guidance includes planned investments in significant DC and store fleet upgrades, store projects to enhance the image, appearance and convenience of our stores, and strategic investments in information technology projects.\nBefore I turn the call over to Jeremy, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly for their unwavering commitment to our customers and dedication to going the extra mile to deliver outstanding business results in 2022. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brent. I would also like to congratulate Team O'Reilly on another outstanding year. Now we will fill in some additional details on our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2023. For the fourth quarter, sales increased $353 million, comprised of a $288 million increase in comp store sales, a $65 million increase in noncomp store sales, a $2 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales, and a $2 million decrease from closed stores.\nFor 2023, we expect our total revenues to be between $15.2 billion and $15.5 billion. Brent covered our gross margin performance and guidance earlier, but I want to provide a quick reminder on how we view the application of LIFO in our gross margin results. We view our reported gross margin as the best measurement of our performance.\nSince the GAAP cost of goods sold under the LIFO method, most closely matches our current acquisition costs. As a result, we don't view the normal application of LIFO as a discrete charge in our evaluation of gross margin. In the first quarter of 2022, we did receive a limited benefit of just under $10 million, resulting from the reversal of our historic LIFO debit balance and the final sell-through of inventory purchase prior to acquisition cost increases.\nThis comparison headwind is a component of our gross margin expectations that Brent outlined earlier. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 18.2% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 19.9%, reduced by a 1.7% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2021 rate of 19.4% of pretax income which was comprised of a base tax rate of 20.4% reduced by a 1% benefit for share-based compensation.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 base rate as compared to 2021 was lower as a result of an increase in certain state tax credits. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 22.4% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.3%, reduced by a 0.9% benefit for share-based compensation.\nFor the full year of 2023, we expect an effective tax rate of 22.9%, comprised of a base rate of 23.4%, reduced by a benefit of 0.5% for share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the tolling of certain tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results and our expectations for 2023. Free cash flow for 2022 was $2.4 billion versus $2.5 billion in 2021. The decrease of $178 million was driven by higher capital expenditures in 2022 versus 2021, and differences in accrued compensation.\nFor 2023, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. As Brent discussed earlier, the expected year-over-year decrease is due to a planned increase in net inventory in 2023 versus the benefit we realized in 2022 as well as the planned increase in CapEx. These headwinds are expected to be partially offset by a benefit of $300 million in 2023, resulting from favorable timing of tax payments and disbursements for renewable energy tax credits.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt to EBIT ratio of 1.84x as compared to our end of 2021 ratio of 1.69x, with the increase driven by our successful issuance of $850 million of 10-year senior notes in June, offset by the September retirement of $300 million of maturing notes.\nWe continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x, and plan to prudently approach that number over time. We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And for 2022, based on the strength of our business, we were able to purchase 5 million shares at an average share price of $661.66 for total investment of $3.3 billion.\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program in 2011, we have repurchased 91 million shares at an average share price of $224.8 for a total investment of $20.4 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected future discounted cash flows of our and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs a reminder, our EPS guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to thank our team for your hard work and dedication to our company and our customers. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Paul, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. You may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vanessa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's call, we will discuss our third quarter 2022 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.

Johnson\n\nCEO & President, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts third quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brad Beckham, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer; Brent Kirby, our Chief Supply Chain Officer; Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.\nI'd like to begin our call today by thanking Team O'Reilly for your hard work and commitment to providing excellent customer service, which drove our strong results in the third quarter. Our quarterly results were highlighted by a 7.6% increase in comparable store sales, resulting in an impressive 2- and 3-year comp sales stacks of 14.3% and 31.2%, respectively.\nBefore we walk through the details of our performance and our prepared comments, I want to begin the call today by acknowledging all of those affected by Hurricane Ian. On behalf of all of Team O'Reilly, I wanted to express our greatest sympathies for the devastation and loss being felt by so many families in the regions impacted by the hurricane.\nAs a company, we were very fortunate to have incurred only limited damage and our teams were simply incredible in their rapid response to the recovery from the storm. I am always extremely proud of the way Team O'Reilly shines during these challenging times, and we are all incredibly appreciative of how our team members once again stepped up in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian to serve their communities with critical supplies necessary in the recovery efforts. Thank you to each of our over 84,000 team members for living our culture of excellent customer service so well for truly being the friendliest parts store in town and producing the outstanding results we will discuss today.\nNow I'd like to turn to our comparable store sales performance and provide some color on what we saw on both sides of our business as we move through the quarter. We started the quarter in July with improving volume trends, driven in part by warm weather across many of our markets, and we're pleased to see these trends continue through the quarter with positive comparable store sales growth on both the DIY and professional side of the business each month of the quarter. Our sales volumes accelerated as we moved through the quarter and exceeded the guidance we communicated on our second quarter call.\nOn a 3-year stack basis, our comparable store sales were strong each month, with September finishing as the strongest month of the quarter. Our professional business again outperformed in the third quarter, producing double-digit comparable store sales growth on robust growth in both ticket counts and average ticket size. Our third quarter professional comparable store sales growth was a continuation of the strength we saw in the second quarter with the continued benefit from average ticket growth supplemented by accelerating ticket count gains and we're very pleased to see the strong durable nature of our professional sales volume. We're very excited about the momentum we've seen in our professional business and remain highly confident in our competitive advantages in customer service and inventory availability on this side of our business. We expect to continue to consolidate the industry and grow our professional share, and our team is highly motivated to outperform the competition in all of our market areas.\nShifting to the DIY business. We are pleased to generate positive results in the third quarter against extremely difficult 2- and 3-year comparisons, reversing the trend of pressure to DIY sales in the first half of the year and outperforming our guidance forecast.\nAs I previously noted, our DIY business was positive each month of the quarter with comparable store sales increases driven by growth in average ticket being partially offset by anticipated traffic pressures with both metrics outperforming our expectations for the quarter.\nWe saw improvement in ticket counts on the DIY side as we progress through the quarter while calendaring very challenging prior year comparisons, and we are pleased to see the resilience in our DIY customer base in spite of continued pressure from broad-based inflation. Although the professional side of our business continues to be the stronger performer, the improvement in our DIY business was the larger driver in surpassing our expectations for the third quarter. In total, our combined DIY and professional comparable store sales growth was again driven by strength in average ticket, which was approximately 10% on both sides of the business and consistent with what we saw in the second quarter.\nSame-SKU inflation benefit in the third quarter were also consistent with the second quarter levels coming in at similar levels to our average ticket increases, which was above our expectations. In the third quarter, we began to anniversary the acceleration of higher inflation in 2021. However, we did not see as much moderation as originally expected in this benefit on a year-over-year basis. We have continued to experience increases in product acquisition and operating costs that we are passing through in selling price increases. Pricing in our industry remains rational, and we continue to be pleased with our ability to pass through cost increases but also maintain an element of caution as our consumers face persistent inflation across the economy that could result in traffic headwinds for our business.\nFrom a category standpoint, we saw broad-based support across our business, including strength in the categories that normally benefit from summer heat as we experience warm temperatures at the beginning of the quarter. However, the benefit in weather-related categories was modest in relationship to our total business, and as such, we do not view weather as a significant contributor to our performance in the quarter. From a regional perspective, our performance was fairly consistent across our market areas with widespread outperformance versus our expectations as we move through the quarter.\nNow I'd like to turn to our updated sales guidance and industry outlook. As noticed in our -- as noted in our press release yesterday, we have updated our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range to 4.5% to 5.5%. This increase in our expectations for the full year is primarily a result of updating for third quarter performance.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are pleased to see the volume trends we have experienced thus far in October, which have been in line with our third quarter results. We have seen sustained resilience in consumer demand but remain cautious as we face continued broad-based inflation, the upcoming holiday season and spending pressures that places on consumers and weather dynamics that can vary significantly for the remainder of the year.\nWhile gas prices have retreated from the peaks we experienced in June, providing some level of relief to many consumers, we recognize that current fuel prices remain very volatile and well above where we started the year as well as this time of last year. It is important to note that the fact these factors can influence demand in the short term such as fuel price spikes, weather and economic uncertainty can be distinguished from the long-term fundamental drivers of demand in our industry. We continue to be confident in the health of the automotive aftermarket, supported by steady recovery in miles driven and very favorable U.S. vehicle fleet dynamics. We still view our customer base is healthy, and believe consumers are in a stronger position now than in recent periods of economic uncertainty with continued support from strong employment and wage growth. Consumers continue to be able to capitalize on the strong value proposition of investing in their existing vehicles at higher and higher mileages as a result of the increasing quality of manufacturing and engineering vehicles on the road. We expect for demand in our industry to remain resilient as consumers who are facing high inflation and economic uncertainty prioritize the maintenance of their existing vehicles in order to avoid taking on a payment for a higher priced newer vehicle.\nNow turning to gross margin. For the third quarter, our gross margin of 50.9% was 132 basis point decrease from the third quarter 2021 gross margin, but in line with our guidance expectations. Our year-over-year margin continues to be primarily impacted by the rollout of our professional price initiative, combined with pressures from a reduced LIFO benefit, which Jeremy will discuss in more details in his prepared comments, and a faster growth of our professional business.\nAfter incorporating our third quarter results, we continue to expect full year gross margin to be in the range of 50.8% to 51.3%. Our team worked relentlessly to translate the strong topline results into outstanding earnings per share growth with third quarter diluted EPS increasing to $9.17, a 14% increase over a strong comparison in 2021.\nWhile the year-over-year increase is impressive alone on a 3-year compounded basis compared to 2019, our third quarter EPS increased 22% per year, highlighting our team's ability to deliver consistent, profitable growth through executing our business model regardless of the tough comparisons we have faced.\nWe are increasing our full year 2022 EPS guidance to $32.35 to $32.85, reflecting our year-to-date results and fourth quarter expectations. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional shares.\nTo wrap up my comments, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly for never backing down from a challenge and providing consistent, excellent customer service to our customers each and every day. It is your commitment to our culture, your fellow team members and our customers that drives our success and makes you the best team in the business. I'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nExecutive VP & COO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to personally thank Team O'Reilly for their commitment to our continued success and dedication to delivering excellent customer service by outhustling and outservicing our competition. Our topline results for the quarter are a testament to our team's ability to compete, and I am proud of the way our team members in our stores and distribution centers go to market each and every day to win.\nOur team has repeatedly proven they are up to any challenge, and I want to join Greg in showing my appreciation for the way our supply chain teams as well as our store operations and DC leadership in the Southeast took care of our teams and our customers in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. Since safety has always been a critical culture value for Team O'Reilly, our primary focus during the weather event like Ian is ensuring our team members and their families are safe. Then as soon as we can safely make our way back to our store locations, our leaders and teams waste no time getting their stores back up and running, often on generator power with no communication systems. This incredible hard work and sacrifice creates tremendous goodwill with our customers who often have limited options to source the critical parts and supplies they need to meet the basic needs not only with their vehicles, but at home with their families to start recovering from the storm.\nNow I'd like to give some additional color on our professional sales performance for the quarter. As Greg previously discussed, strength in our professional business underpinned our comparable store sales growth for the quarter, and we are extremely pleased to continue to see robust growth in both ticket and traffic on this side of our business. Our commitment to the professional customer has been ingrained in our company's DNA since our founding in 1957. The momentum we've generated on this side of our business is the result of solid fundamental execution of the same core competitive advantages that have driven our business for 65 years. Our professional customers rely on us to be an integral partner in the success of their business. We focus on developing long-lasting, durable relationships with our customers by providing exceptional service from highly qualified, knowledgeable, professional parts people who are committed to overcoming any obstacle to take care of our customers. Our team's sense of urgency, professionalism and dedication to our customers allows us to leverage the significant investments we've made in distribution, hub infrastructure, in inventory to provide industry-leading inventory availability, which is absolutely vital to the success of our customers. Our partnerships with our professional customers go even deeper as we support all aspects of their operations through our investments in technology platforms, shop management systems as well as technical and business management train.\nAbove and beyond technical training for technicians, this training includes things like how to grow and manage a profitable business, effectively right service, how to market and advertise, and effective strategies to retain the best technicians. It's our execution on these foundational priorities that not only earn the retention of existing business that give us the opportunity to earn new professional customers' business, all aided by a competitive pricing strategy that all equals the best overall value in the automotive aftermarket.\nWe've discussed our professional pricing initiative at [leak] this year, and we remain very pleased with the results we've seen from our competitive positioning within the broader aftermarket. We are confident that this was the right time to invest in professional pricing, and we continue to see a rational overall pricing environment and normal competitive dynamics.\nOur sales teams know we provide a premium service delivered by the best teams in the industry, and we go to market with the confidence that our value proposition is an attractive one for both our existing and future new professional customers alike.\nNext, I'd like to discuss our DIY business as well as the opportunities we see to grow share on the retail side of the business. While the DIY market is much more consolidated than the professional business, we see tremendous share growth opportunity. The key value components of parts availability, excellent customer service provided by professional parts people and strong relationships that drive our professional business are also critical to our DIY business. Our DIY customers heavily rely on the service we provide, and you can really see this play out in the highly consulted nature of a DIY customers visit to one of our stores.\nThe professionalism of our team is on display during a typical customer encounter, creating a DIY customer when they walk in the door or pull in our parking lot and providing technical information and advice to walk them through the total job. This often includes standing side by side with the customer at their vehicle to test an existing part or redo trouble code.\nOur professional parts people are committed to ensuring our customers have identified the right solution for their problem and have all the parts, tools, and knowledge necessary to complete the job correctly the first time. When this work is beyond our DIY customers' ability, our professional customers in each market come into play with our shop referral program that we established many decades ago. Simply put, the growth of our DIY and DIFM business go hand in hand.\nWe believe it was our team's intense focus on fundamental execution of our business model and excellent customer service, coupled with continued improvements in fill rates and store in-stock inventory position that drove our results above our expectations in the third quarter. The DIY environment continues to be challenging with the pressures these customers are facing on a broad scale in turn placing pressure on our DIY ticket counts.\nWe have also faced extremely difficult comparisons from the surge in DIY transaction counts we've generated over the past 2.5 years and are pleased with our team's ability to grow our DIY share and earn our customers' repeat business.\nThe professional parts people we have standing ready at every green counter in every one of our stores across the country are ingrained with the understanding that our never say no philosophy is so very important. It means not only putting a part in a customer's hands for a sale today to solve their immediate need, but earning their business the next time they are taking on an automotive repair or maintenance job.\nNow I'll turn to our SG&A and operating profit results for the third quarter and our updated expectations for the full year. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 29.8%, a leverage of 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2021. Total SG&A spend for the quarter came largely in line with the expectations given the better-than-expected sales volumes.\nOn an average per-store basis, our SG&A was up 3.2% for the quarter. For the full year, we now expect SG&A per store to grow between 3% and 3.5% with the increase reflecting incremental variable operating expenses on better-than-expected sales volumes in the third quarter as well as ongoing cost inflation.\nOur teams continue to be very prudent in managing expenses in the face of significant inflationary impacts while also being appropriately responsive to current sales trends to ensure we are able to optimize both our service levels and our operating margins. We are raising our full year operating profit guidance and now expect to be in the range of 20.3% to 20.6%, which is reflective of both our adjustment to SG&A per-store growth and our increased comparable store sales range.\nNow I'll provide an update to our store growth during the third quarter. We opened 37 net, new stores across 20 states in the U.S. and 1 new store in Mexico, bringing our year-to-date total to 154 net, new store openings. This puts us on track to achieve our target of approximately 180 net, new store openings for 2022.\nAs we noted in our press release yesterday, we are pleased to announce our 2023 new store opening target of 180 to 190 net, new stores, providing us the opportunity to expand our footprint across the U.S. and Mexico. We continue to be pleased with our new store performance and see store and distribution growth as an attractive deployment of capital.\nThese new store openings will again be spread across new and existing markets supported by our industry-leading distribution network. This allows us to continue to build on the superior parts availability, our existing and future customers' value and expect. Having the right part, at the right place, at the right time for each 1 of our DIY and professional customers in every single 1 of our markets is more important than ever, and we are fully committed to continue to build on our world-class supply chain.\nWhile we made further investments to enhance our distribution network, we are also making investments in our local inventory position to improve overall inventory availability. We finished the quarter with an average inventory per store of $697,000, which was up 10% from this time last year and 9% from the beginning of the year.\nOur plan when we enter 2022 was to aggressively add incremental dollars to our store level inventories throughout the year with a target to finish the year with an average per-store inventory up over 8%. We are now looking to finish 2022 with average per-store inventory at levels consistent with our current position. This would have us finishing with a slightly higher inventory increase than originally expected due to cost inflation above our expectations, pushing up unit price, while overall units are in line with expectations.\nThese continued strategic investments into our inventory position focused around having the right local combination of common and hard-to-find parts for every single market, store and customer are a critical component of our success. Deploying additional inventory dollars into -- and incrementally enhancing our hub network now at approximately 380 hubs strong, has also supported growth on both sides of our business. Particularly with our professional customers, we're turning their base, keeping their technicians productive and in turn, keeping their end DIFM customer truly happy is paramount.\nYou've heard us say it repeatedly, time is money for our professional customers. So the quicker we can put the right part in their hands, the faster they can turn their base, get their customers back on the road and in turn, the more profitable we become together.\nTo close my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Excellent customer service is who we are, but that doesn't mean it comes easy. It takes hustle, hard work, commitment and dedication to every single customer, every single day in each of our 5,900-plus stores, and I am thankful to work with the team who is truly dedicated to make this happen.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would also like to add my thanks to all of Team O'Reilly for your performance in the third quarter and continued dedication to our company's long-term success. Now we will cover some additional details on our quarterly results and updated guidance for the remainder of 2022.\nFor the quarter, sales increased $319 million, comprised of a $257 million increase in comp store sales, a $60 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $4 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales and a $2 million decrease from closed stores. For 2022, we now expect our total revenues to be $14.1 billion to $14.3 billion, which is an increase from our previous range of $14.0 billion to $14.3 billion and is in line with the updated comparable store sales guidance range Greg discussed earlier.\nGreg covered our gross profit performance earlier, noting that gross margin for the third quarter was in line with our expectations with anticipated year-over-year pressure from the rollout of the Pro pricing initiative, LIFO comparisons and accelerated professional sales mix headwind.\nSince I'm sure you're all anxiously awaiting a detailed accounting discussion, I want to provide some additional details on the LIFO comparison and how we view the flow-through of acquisition cost inflation in our gross margin results. We think it is helpful to contrast the impact of our earlier LIFO reporting prior to 2022 when we were still in a debit LIFO position versus the current situation where we have returned to a traditional LIFO credit balance.\nAs we discussed throughout 2021, the application of LIFO accounting meant that as acquisition costs and selling prices went up, we realized the benefit from the sell-through of existing on-hand inventory that we carried at a lower historical cost due to our debit LIFO position. This nonrecurring benefit is a comparison headwind for 202,2, which we anticipated in our gross margin guidance, and we've seen results in line with those expectations.\nSince our LIFO reserve flipped back to a credit balance in the third quarter of 2021, we are now back to typical LIFO accounting. And I think it is useful to clarify how we view the application of LIFO and the treatment of inventory acquisition costs in our gross margin results.\nUnder last in first out accounting, the cost of goods sold that runs through our reported gross margin results most closely reflects our current acquisition costs, and we believe this is the best picture of our gross margin performance. This reporting aligns with how we manage our process of evaluating and adjusting prices based on changes in inventory costs.\nOur teams diligently work to pass along cost increases in a timely manner consistent with or ahead of our actual receipt of cost increases from suppliers. From a balance sheet perspective, in periods when costs are rising, we see an increase in our LIFO inventory credit balance which reflects the application of the LIFO calculation. However, because we evaluate gross margin performance on the basis of current acquisition costs and selling prices, we do not view the normal application of LIFO as a discrete charge to our gross margin results.\nSince we take this approach, we can see some temporary impact in our gross margin results to the extent that the timing of cost changes and corresponding pricing movements did not align perfectly. The last several years have created volatility in our reported results, driven by the exhaustion of our debit LIFO balance as well as significant inflation in acquisition costs and disruptions in supply chains. But ultimately, we expect to see a much more muted impact from LIFO moving forward as our reported results reflect a more consistent, relevant picture of gross margin performance.\nOur third quarter effective tax rate was 23.2% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.3%, reduced by a 1.1% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the third quarter of 2021 rate of 22.5% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.2% reduced by a 1.7% benefit for share-based compensation. The third quarter of 2022 base rate was in line with our expectations.\nFor the full year of 2022, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 23.0% comprised of a base rate of 23.5% and reduced by a benefit of 0.5% for share-based compensation. Our fourth quarter and full year expected tax rate is expected to be below our year-to-date rate of 23.6% due to anticipated benefits in the fourth quarter from our continued commitment to renewable energy investments and the tolling of certain tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2022 was $1.9 billion versus $2.2 billion for the first 9 months of 2021, with the decrease driven by higher capital expenditures in 2022 versus 2021 and differences in accrued compensation.\nCapital expenditures for the first 9 months of 2022 were $389 million versus $341 million for the first 9 months of 2021. We now expect CapEx to come in between $550 million to $650 million for the full year, with the balance of the spend for the remainder of the year continuing to support new store and DC development projects, initiatives to enhance the image appearance and convenience of our stores and strategic investments in the information technology projects.\nThe reduction in our expected CapEx from our previous guidance range of $650 million to $750 million is primarily the result of ongoing supply chain challenges to acquire new fleet vehicles and complete various store and DC projects.\nOur AP to inventory ratio at the end of the third quarter was 135%, which once again has set an all-time high for our company and was heavily influenced by the extremely strong sales volumes and inventory turns along with the impact from increased inflation in product acquisition costs.\nWe do not anticipate our AP to inventory ratio to moderate off of this -- I'm sorry, we do anticipate our AP to inventory ratio to moderate off of this historic high as we complete our inventory -- additional inventory investments but we now expect to finish the year slightly below our third quarter ratio.\nAfter generating $1.9 billion in year-to-date free cash flow and based on our updated net inventory and CapEx spend expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our expected full year free cash flow guidance to a range of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion, an increase of $0.5 billion from our previous guidance of $1.3 million to $1.6 billion.\nMoving on to debt. In September, we retired $300 million of maturing 10-year senior notes using available cash on hand. As a result of the maturity, we finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of 1.84x, which is down from our second quarter ratio of 1.95x and but above our end of 2021 ratio of 1.69x. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x, and we'll approach that number when appropriate.\nWe continue to be pleased with the execution of our share repurchase program. And during the third quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average share price of $683.09 for a total investment of $710 million. Year-to-date through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 4.6 million shares at an average share price of $650.43 for a total investment of $3 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected future discounted cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.\nFinally, before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to again thank the entire O'Reilly team for their commitment to our customers and our company. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Vanessa, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cheryl, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Jeremy Fletcher. Mr. Fletcher, you may begin.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cheryl. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our second quarter 2022 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. After our prepared comments, we will host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I would like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Johnson\n\nCEO & President, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brad Beckham, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeremy Fletcher, our Chief Financial Officer. Brent Kirby, our Chief Supply Chain Officer; Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call. I'd also like to welcome Jeremy to his first earnings call.\nI'd like to begin our call today by thanking Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our customers and their hard work that drove another solid quarter of financial performance. Hopefully, everyone had a chance to review the details in our second quarter earnings release.\nDuring the call today, I will walk through the performance in the quarter and our adjusted outlook for the remainder of the year. I think it's important to begin by highlighting the strong results our team continues to generate and then put them into proper context against the backdrop of the incredible growth we've delivered in the past 3 years.\nIn the second quarter, our team was able to generate a 4.3% comparable store sales increase after driving comp increases of 9.9% and 16.2% in the second quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in an incredible 3-year stack of 30.4%.\nEntering 2022, we knew our team had a daunting task ahead of them with the challenge to deliver continued growth on top of these outstanding results, which were fueled by -- which were fueled in part by government stimulus payments in 2020 and '21 that did not repeat in 2022. Our teams have set an incredibly high performance bar, and their ability to comp the comp yet again is a testament to their relentless focus on providing excellent customer service.\nTeam O'Reilly has continued to translate the robust sales growth into outstanding returns for our shareholders, highlighted by second quarter diluted earnings per share of $8.78, which is an increase of 5% over our extremely strong second quarter 2021 when we grew EPS by 17%. On a compounded basis, compared to 2019, our second quarter EPS is up an impressive 25% per year, which is just another testament to the unwavering commitment of our team to growing profitable growth through their dedication to the O'Reilly culture of excellent customer service.\nNext, I'd like to spend time walking through some details of our sales performance for the second quarter and the factors that drove our results as well as provide some color on our revised comparable store sales guidance for the full year. As we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in April, we began the second quarter facing headwinds from a delayed start to spring and rising fuel prices. We're also lapping our historically strong comparable store sales performance driven in part by the tailwinds we saw from government stimulus payments in 2021. However, as we moved through the quarter, the volatility from these factors moderated and our business stabilized.\nSince the past few years have been so significantly impacted by these -- the effects of the pandemic and timing of the stimulus payments, we think it is most useful to evaluate the cadence of our comp results on a 3-year stack basis. On this basis, our month-to-month results were fairly steady throughout the quarter.\nAs our business stabilized in the second quarter, we encountered more pronounced ticket count pressures on the DIY side of our business, resulting in top line results below our expectations for the quarter. Our plan for the second quarter included an expected headwind to DIY ticket counts as we were up against extremely strong growth from the comparison to stimulus-driven demand at the beginning of the second quarter of 2021. However, we saw more pressure than expected as our DIY customers faced high fuel prices and continued significant broad-based inflation.\nI'll spend some time in a few moments discussing our broader outlook for the industry and our business as we move forward, but for now, I'll point out that it's not completely surprising to us to have experienced these types of pressures. Many of our core DIY customers work on their own vehicles out of economic necessity and can be more susceptible to price inflation in short periods of time. We believe what we're seeing now is comparable to other periods in our history when our customers have gone through these types of fuel price spikes.\nThe current environment is different to the degree that the spike in fuel prices is occurring at the same time broad-based inflation is elevated, but we expect consumers will adjust to these pressures as we've seen in the past and continue to prioritize vehicle repair and maintenance.\nFrom a total DIY comp perspective, we did see an inflation benefit in average ticket values, but the macroeconomic pressures to ticket counts and difficult compares resulted in total DIY comparable store sales being slightly negative for the quarter.\nTurning to the professional side of our business. We're very pleased with our team's performance in the second quarter, where we generated comparable store sales growth in the low double digits as a result of growth of both ticket counts and average ticket size. We continue to be excited about the strength of our professional customer business as we grow our share and consolidate the industry.\nAs we discussed on the last 2 calls, we anticipated this side of our business will be a larger driver of our growth in 2022, and our results in the second quarter were in line with those expectations. We continue to be pleased with the early returns from our professional pricing initiative, and Brad will cover our professional customer momentum and this initiative in more detail in his prepared comments.\nOn a combined basis, including both DIY and professional sales, our comparable store sales growth for the quarter was driven by strength in average ticket with professional ticket count growth only partially offsetting pressure we saw in DIY traffic. Average ticket size came in around 10% for the quarter on both sides of our business due to a benefit from same SKU inflation at similar levels.\nWe have continued to be highly successful in passing through product acquisition and operating expense inflation and selling price increases as we move through 2022, which is a benefit to average ticket values. Beginning in the third quarter, we began to anniversary the onset of higher inflation in 2021, which will moderate the year-over-year increase in average ticket value and is factored into our full year sales expectation.\nNow I'd like to provide some color on how we view the conditions of our industry and our outlook on the remainder of the year. As we move through the back half of 2022, it remains a challenge to predict what we will encounter in a rapidly changing macroeconomic environment. Certainly, if we could look in the rearview mirror from the beginning of the year and build our expectations based on inflation we haven't seen in decades and a global conflict accelerating growth in fuel prices, we would have landed in a different spot with our initial guidance.\nDespite these headwinds, we're pleased with our performance against this challenging macro backdrop, and we remain very confident in both the fundamental strength of our industry and the quality of our team and their proven ability to outperform the market and gain share.\nWhile we believe we're seeing some short-term impact to demand as consumers respond to economic challenges, we're also confident our industry benefits from the reality that very little of the demand in the automotive aftermarket is truly discretionary and the necessary maintenance and repairs can only be deferred for so long. In fact, as economic conditions worsen, our experience has been that our industry provides even more critical -- I'm sorry. In fact, as economic conditions worsen, our experience has been that the value our industry provides is even more critical to consumers facing economic challenges.\nThis plays out in many different ways. We see it when one of our customers is able to hold off on a new car purchase and avoid a monthly expense because they're able to invest through repairs and maintenance on a higher-mileage vehicle. Or when we help a DIY customer stretch their wallet a little further by providing incredible service from one of our professional parts people who have technical knowledge and customer service skills to support the customer who needs a DIY fix to keep their vehicle on the road. These are just 2 of the many scenarios, which motivate our customers to prioritize taking care of their vehicles when money is tight or consumers have less confidence in the state of the economy.\nThe core underlying factors that support demand in our industry also continue to be very healthy. The average age of vehicles on the road continues to increase, aided not only by headwinds to new vehicle sales and mileage and higher resale values -- I'm sorry, of older vehicles, but also the excellent engineering and manufacturing of vehicles on the road today.\nWe are also bullish on the overall health of our customer base. Unemployment has remained at very low levels, and increasing wage rates have been a positive partial offset to inflation, especially for the more economically constrained DIY customer base. We believe consumers are in a much stronger position than in recent periods of economic uncertainty. As we have discussed often in the past, miles driven is a critical metric for our industry, and we are cognizant that the potential for miles driven growth could slow if the broader economy slows.\nAs a buffer against this pressure, we believe industry benefits from dynamics that will support miles driven growth over the long term as we still see the potential in incremental miles from post-pandemic return to work, coupled with consumers' willingness to move further away from urban centers and utilize their vehicles to satisfy pent-up demand for personal travel.\nFinally, while miles driven is an important factor for our industry, we have proven that during previous periods when miles drivens have flattened that we have the ability as a company to drive top line growth as consumers prioritize the care and maintenance of their vehicles.\nThe broader outlook for our industry is important in how we think about the prospects for future growth, but far more important is the opportunity we have to outperform the industry to drive outstanding financial results. We have the best team of professional parts people in the industry, and we are very confident we are well positioned to deliver excellent customer service and increase our market share in any market condition.\nWhile we remain very positive on the prospects of our industry and our business, we are also cautious in our assessment of the pressures from high fuel prices and broad-based inflation that impacted our second quarter performance and the potential for continued pressure as we move through the balance of 2022.\nAs a result, we have incorporated our year-to-date performance and expectations for the remainder of the year and our updated comparable sales guidance range of 3% to 5%. Ultimately, we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out, and we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of our business, but feel the prudent step is to adjust our expectations at this time. At the midpoint, our revised comparable store sales guidance range reflects solid growth over 2021 and a 3-year stack increase of 28%, and we still view this as a very favorable outlook, reflecting our ability to outperform the market and gain share.\nBefore I move on from sales, I will note that we are pleased with our performance thus far in July. We've seen some improvement in July sales volume trends relative to our expectations partially driven by the extreme heat we're seeing across many of our markets right now. We still have a lot of summer remaining, and ultimately, we'll have to see how the weather plays out for the rest of the year. As such, our guidance forecast assumes a normal weather backdrop for the remainder of the year, in line with our customary practice.\nMoving on to gross margin. For the second quarter, our gross margin of 51.3% was a 136 basis point decrease from the second quarter of 2021 gross margin. This is in line with our expectations with a couple of key points I want to highlight.\nOur year-over-year gross margin is impacted primarily by the rollout of our professional pricing initiative as well as pressures from a reduced LIFO benefit and higher mix of professional business. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we rolled out our initiative in February and only saw a partial impact to gross margin rate in that quarter. Our second quarter gross margin reflects a full quarter impact from the initiative and is in line with our expectations. We are maintaining our full year gross margin range of 50.8% to 51.3% with the expectation that gross margin in the back half of the year as compared to 2021 will be slightly below where we have run year-to-date based upon mix differences and timing of the reduced LIFO benefit.\nBefore handing the call off to Brad, I want to update our full year diluted earnings per share expectations. Based on the adjustment to our comparable store sales guidance, we are lowering our full year earnings per share guidance to $31.25 to $31.75. At the midpoint, this represents -- this range now represents an increase of 1% compared to 2021 and a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 21%.\nTo wrap up my comments, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to consistently providing excellent customer service. It's your commitment to our culture, fellow team members and customers that drives our success.\nI'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nExecutive VP & COO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin my comments today by thanking Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success and their steadfast commitment to excellent customer service.\nSince Greg has already discussed our sales results and how we view the current industry environment, I don't want to spend a lot of time repeating what he said. However, I do want to highlight our company's philosophy for how we execute our business model in more challenging macroeconomic conditions. Simply put, we never accept external market pressures as an excuse for falling short of our goals.\nA guiding philosophy in our company, especially in our store operations group from our store manager up through the chain to senior vice presidents, states that as long as there are customer vehicles in the parking lot of our competitors or there are competitors delivering to our professional customers in our markets, we haven't captured all the business we are entitled to, and we are missing out on an opportunity to grow sales. We believe our commitment to never settling for subpar performance is a key to our success and also served us well in the second quarter.\nWhile pressures to our DIY customers from spikes in fuel prices and persistent high inflation weighed down the top line sales growth we were expecting to see, we are still pleased with our team's ability to drive solid, positive sales increases on top of 2 consecutive years of record growth for our company. More importantly, we remain excited about the opportunities we see to grow our business as we move forward.\nI'm sure not an expert in predicting what the rest of the year will hold for the U.S. economy, but I am highly confident that even challenging market conditions can present an opportunity for us to capitalize on our competitive advantages. Our focus on maintaining an extremely high standard of customer service in any market environment allows us to build long-term relationships, ultimately reinforcing our industry-leading position.\nNow I would like to provide some color on our professional sales performance in the quarter as well as review what we're seeing from our professional pricing initiative. As Greg mentioned in his prepared remarks, our professional business was the driver of our comparable store sales growth with a double-digit increase, in line with our expectations for the quarter.\nBefore I provide an update on our progress with our professional pricing initiative, I think it's important to first focus on the key factors that drive our professional sales growth. Our company's foundation was largely built on the professional customer, and we have proven decade after decade that the most important drivers of our success on the professional side of the business are also our competitive advantages in strong customer relationships, excellent customer service and superior inventory availability.\nFor our professional customer base, the efficient and reliable service they receive from their parts supplier is the most important factor in driving the economic success of their business. We strongly believe that professional business can only be won by consistently delivering a high level of customer service, and this was the primary reason we were able to deliver robust comps in the second quarter. We also believe what we're seeing in professional comps is consistent with the long-term demographic industry trend of faster professional growth as well as the stronger economic resilience of the end-user do-it-for-me customer on this side of our business.\nHowever, our professional customers aren't completely insulated from the economic pressures of high fuel prices and inflation that are impacting our DIY business. We believe our ability to post significant professional sales growth in this environment against extremely difficult comparisons reflects the momentum we're generating through our professional pricing initiative, though it's only one piece of our value proposition.\nWe are very pleased with the response we've seen from our store teams and our sales force as well as our existing and new prospective customers. Our store and sales teams have been energized as they've leveraged this initiative as another tool in their toolbox to win professional business.\nIt truly is a combination of strong customer relationships, excellent customer service and industry-leading inventory availability, coupled with our more competitive pricing, which drives the superior value proposition we provide to our professional customers. Simply put, the best overall value in the aftermarket has gotten even better.\nSince the professional business is driven primarily by strong customer relationships, exceptional customer service and inventory availability, it is difficult for us to parse the direct impact of our pricing initiative now that it has been rolled out across our company for several months. However, we believe the results we are seeing line up favorably with the expectations we developed in our thorough testing process leading up to launching this initiative.\nWe are excited about the immediate positive results we've seen, but I want to caution everyone that we are still in the early innings of this initiative. Our pricing actions are clearly removing some barriers, which had previously existed. However, business is ultimately won with consistent execution after being given a chance to earn new business.\nThese new opportunities don't necessarily open up instantly, and we expect that we will have to grind out gains over time, which is no different than how we've executed our playbook for 65 years and in turn, established our company as the premier supplier to the professional market.\nFinally, before I move on, I want to reiterate that the execution of our professional pricing initiative hasn't changed the broader pricing dynamic in our industry. We have not seen significant competitive pricing actions in response to our initiative. And as Greg mentioned, we continue as a company and industry to rationally pass along inflation in pricing.\nNow I'd like to discuss our SG&A and operating profit results for the second quarter and our updated expectations for the full year. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 29.6%, a leverage of 15 basis points from the second quarter of 2021. At this level, SG&A is down over 400 basis points from prepandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. This incredible step change in our profitability is a testament to our team's commitment to grow sales, exercise diligent expense control, improve productivity and drive long-term value.\nOn an average per-store basis, our SG&A grew 2.5%, which was largely in line with our expectations for the quarter. On a full year basis, we are revising our guidance for SG&A per store to grow 3%, up from our previous guidance of 2.5%. Our teams have been diligent in managing costs to mitigate the impact of inflation thus far this year with our overall spend largely in line with our expectations, but the prolonged and heightened inflation we're experiencing, especially in fuel and energy costs, has driven up our forecast for the remainder of the year.\nWage rates have also been in line with our expectations year-to-date. But I could -- but we could also see pressure in the back half of the year if we see further sustained inflation. We are also updating our operating profit guidance and now expect the full year to be in the range of 20% to 20.3%, which reflects the adjustment to SG&A per store in our revised comparable store sales range.\nAs we look to the back half of the year and plan SG&A, we will be appropriately responsive to the changing business trends and sales opportunities, and we'll make prudent adjustments to staffing levels to provide excellent customer service and grow our business, while at the same time, controlling our expenses.\nAs we've discussed on multiple occasions over the years, we are very deliberate in how we manage our SG&A spend and leverage a variety of tools to manage store payroll on a store-by-store, day-by-day basis. We believe sudden dramatic changes in store staffing levels have a noticeable negative impact on customer service. And as a result, we manage adjustments gradually over time to match the sales environment in conjunction with the normal seasonality of our business.\nAs always, our top priority in managing expenses is to ensure consistent, excellent customer service that is critical to building long-lasting relationships with both our DIY and professional customers. We strongly believe this long-term view of never sacrificing excellent customer service has been a key factor in our success and was the foundation that drove the incredible gains in profitability that our team has generated over the last several years.\nNext, turning to inventory. We finished the second quarter with an average inventory per store of $679,000, which was up 7% from both the beginning of 2022 and this time last year. Parts availability is a key driver of our success in our business, and we continue to execute our plan to aggressively add incremental dollars to our store level inventories as we move throughout 2022.\nWhile we still face constraints in certain areas of our supply chain, we are very optimistic we will see continued improvement as we move through the back half of the year and still expect our per-store inventory to be up over 8% by year-end. Our investments in inventory and daily execution both continue to be focused first and foremost on our replenishment and fill rates; then on having the right combination of common as well as hard-to-find parts in every one of our stores that is tailored to that specific market; then backed up by our dynamic, multitier hub and distribution center network. Our extensive, industry-leading network powers our best-in-class parts availability and equips us to be the dominant auto parts supplier in all our market areas.\nWe feel strongly that these investments in inventory as well as enhanced supply chain capabilities will continue to be a critical part of our success on both sides of the business and in turn, provide long-term share gains as well as returns.\nBefore turning the call over to Jeremy, I'll provide an update on our store growth during the second quarter. We opened 62 new stores across 28 states in the U.S., bringing our year-to-date total to 116 net new store openings. We are on pace to hit our plan of 175 to 185 net new store openings for the year. We continue to be pleased with our performance of our new stores, and I am very proud of the outstanding teams of professional parts people we have in each of our new stores.\nTo close my comments, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our customers. Our teams are committed to winning our customers' business each day by outhustling and outservicing our competition, and I am confident in their ability to deliver a strong finish to 2022.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jeremy.\n\nJeremy Adam Fletcher\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I would also like to add my thanks to all of Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's long-term success.\nNow we will cover some additional details on our quarterly results and updated guidance for the remainder of 2022. For the quarter, sales increased $205 million comprised of a $145 million increase in comp store sales, a $56 million increase in noncomp store sales, a $5 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales and a $1 million decrease from closed stores.\nFor 2022, we now expect our total revenues to be $14.0 billion to $14.3 billion, which is a reduction from our previous range of $14.2 billion to $14.5 billion as a result of our revised comparable store sales guidance range.\nGreg covered our gross margin performance for the second quarter and reiterated our full year guidance, but I want to briefly recap that we are not expecting a significant LIFO benefit to our gross margin results in 2022 as a result of more typical LIFO accounting after our reserve returned to a credit balance in 2021. Our year-to-date results were in line with those expectations, and our outlook on this item for the year is unchanged.\nOur second quarter effective tax rate was 23.8% of pretax income comprised of a base rate of 24.3%, reduced by a 0.5% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the second quarter of 2021 rate of 23.1% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 24.5%, reduced by a 1.4% benefit for share-based compensation. The second quarter of 2022 base rate was in line with our expectations. For the full year 2022, we now expect an effective tax rate of 23.0% comprised of a base rate of 23.5%, reduced by a benefit of 0.5% per share-based compensation.\nOur expected tax rate is down slightly from our previous guidance of 23.2% due to the anticipated benefits from renewable energy tax credits, and we continue to expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters as a result of the timing of these benefits and tolling of certain tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow we will move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2022 was $1.2 billion versus $1.5 billion for the first 6 months of 2021 with the decrease driven by a smaller benefit from a reduction in net inventory investment in 2022 versus 2021 and differences in accrued compensation.\nCapital expenditures for the first 6 months of 2022 were $229 million, which was in line with the same period of 2021. We continue to expect CapEx to come in between $650 million to $750 million for the full year with the balance of the spend for the remainder of the year supporting new store and DC development initiatives to enhance the image, appearance and convenience of our stores; DC and store fleet upgrades; and strategic investments in information technology projects.\nOur AP-to-inventory ratio at the end of the second quarter was 131%, which once again has set an all-time high for our company and was heavily influenced by the extremely strong sales volumes and inventory turns over the last 12 months. We anticipate our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate off of this historic high as we complete our additional inventory investments.\nBased on the anticipated moderation in this ratio and a heavier spend on CapEx for the second half of the year, we are keeping our expected full year free cash flow guidance unchanged at a rate of $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion after generating $1.2 billion in the first half of 2022.\nMoving on to debt. In June, we were pleased to execute a very successful debt transaction with the issuance of $850 million of 10-year senior notes at a rate of 4.7%. As a result of the bond issuance, we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.95x as compared to our end of 2021 ratio of 1.69x. We continue to be below our leverage target at 2.5x, and we will approach that number when appropriate.\nWe continue to execute our share repurchase program. And during the second quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average share price of $620.27 for a total investment of $1.4 billion. Year-to-date through our press release yesterday, we repurchased 3.8 million shares at an average share price of $637.47 for a total investment of $2.4 billion. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected future discounted cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nFinally, before I open up our call to your questions, I would like to thank the entire O'Reilly team for their continued dedication to the company's long-term success.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I would like to ask Cheryl, the operator, to return to the line, and we will be happy to answer your questions."

First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference. My name is Richard, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Tom McFall. Mr. McFall, you may begin.\n\nThomas G. McFall\n\nCFO & Executive VP, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we will discuss our first quarter 2022 results and our full year outlook for the remainder of 2022. After our prepared comments, we'll host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words.\nThe company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I would like to introduce Greg Johnson.\n\nGregory D. Johnson\n\nCEO & President, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts first quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brad Beckham, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer; Brent Kirby, our Chief Supply Chain Officer; Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; and David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present on the call.\nI'd like to begin our call today by thanking Team O'Reilly for their hard work and commitment to drive another solid quarter, ensuring we deliver excellent service to each and every customer. Our team of over 84,000 dedicated professional parts people across the U.S. and Mexico continually reinforces our O'Reilly culture of excellent customer service. Their unwavering commitment to achieving such high standards and going the extra mile for our customers is key to our repeated success.\nOur first quarter results were headlined by a 4.8% increase in comparable store sales, which is on top of the record 24.8% comparable store sales we delivered in the first quarter last year, resulting in an impressive comparable store sales 2-year stack of 29.6%. These top line results produced diluted earnings per share of $7.17, which is an increase of 2% over our extremely strong first quarter of 2021 when we grew EPS by 78%, representing an outstanding 34% compounded annual growth rate when compared to the first quarter of 2020.\nNow I'd like to provide some color on our comparable store sales results and what we saw on both sides of our business as we move through the quarter. I'll begin by reiterating what we noted in our press release yesterday. Historically, weather creates volatility in our first quarter from both the type and severity of winter weather at the beginning of the quarter and from the timing of the onset of spring weather, and we definitely experienced choppiness in our first quarter this year. We encountered the volatility more significantly on the DIY side of our business, which I'll cover in a few minutes, but I'll start by discussing our professional business, which is much more consistent and the stronger performer in the quarter.\nIn our professional business, we started the quarter with some pressure from the Omicron variant. And outside of this short period, our professional business in the quarter was consistent and in line with our expectations, with comp strongly positive in each month of the quarter. We're encouraged by the resiliency and consistency of our professional customer demand and still anticipate this side of the business to be the larger driver of our growth in 2022 as we share and consolidate the market -- as we grow share and consolidate the market. We have been pleased with the results from the professional pricing initiative we began rolling out company-wide in February. Brad will provide more color on this initiative in his remarks, but I'd like to comment that the market reaction from our competitors, thus far has been muted as expected and pricing remains rational.\nTurning to the DIY business. As I mentioned earlier, we saw much more volatility during the quarter on this side of the business. Early in the quarter, in addition to the headwind from inclement weather and Omicron, we also faced headwinds to DIY traffic for macroeconomic pressures stemming from the spike in gas prices and global instability. However, over the last 8 weeks, beginning in March and stretching into the beginning of our second quarter through the call today, volumes have become more consistent, though still hampered by less than ideal spring weather as our business benefits when we see an early start to spring.\nOur DIY customers also often perform their routine jobs outside of their driveways and will take advantage when warmer weather hits to catch up on the repair, maintenance and tune up items that have been temporarily on hold at the end of winter. This year, we have seen cold wet weather persist through much of spring in many of our markets. However, the corresponding impact to demand matches up with what we have historically seen in similar environments and we've been encouraged that DIY results have stabilized from volatility earlier in the quarter.\nFrom a cadence perspective, our DIY business faced very challenging year-over-year comparisons in March, driven by government stimulus payments that -- during that month of the last year. We also faced a step-up in professional comp comparison in March due to last year's stimulus, though to a lesser degree than our DIY business. However, the cadence for total comparable store sales for the quarter levels out on a 2- and 3-year stack basis, which eliminates the pandemic and stimulus impacts, with March being in the relative strongest over this extended period of time.\nThe durable nature of our sales volumes, as evidenced by a 2-year stack of nearly 30%, demonstrates our team's ability to differentiate our in-store experience and service levels to the many new customers we encountered over the last 2 years and convert those new customers into repeat loyal customers.\nNext, I'd like to provide some color on our ticket count and average performance. The pressure to DIY ticket counts from the volatility we experienced throughout the quarter was offset by strong growth in average ticket, resulting in flat DIY comps for the quarter. We also saw a strong benefit from average ticket on the professional side of our business, which combined with an increase in ticket count drove double-digit professional comp growth. The continued strength in average ticket is in line with our expectation and reflects the benefit from the pass-through of cost increases into selling prices. Same SKU inflation was in line with our expectation for the quarter in the high single digits.\nHowever, we have seen additional pricing increases since we communicated our guidance outlook on last quarter's call. These additional price increases and any additional inflation moving forward will help our average ticket throughout the year but may create traffic headwinds as consumers deal with broader inflation across the economy.\nNow I'd like to turn our sales guidance. Now I'd like to turn our -- to our sales guidance and full year outlook. We are maintaining our full year comparable store sales guidance to a range of 5% to 7% and total sales guidance of $14.2 billion to $14.5 billion. Based on first quarter results, we are currently trending below our midpoint, but where we land will partly depend on how much of the wet weather impacts we experienced in the first quarter have deferred business later in the spring. We do believe we experienced necessary harsh winter to support demand of undercurrent categories as we move through the next 2 quarters.\nWe also saw volatility in the DIY traffic in the first quarter that was likely driven in part by economic shocks from the spike in gas prices and global instability, and we remain cautious in how we think about the impact of macroeconomic pressures as we move forward. However, we also continue to remain confident with the broader industry backdrop with steady recovery of miles driven and increasing employment underpinning stable, robust growth trends in the automotive aftermarket. This, coupled with a strong value proposition, compelling consumers to invest in their vehicles as a result of the combination of quality engineered and manufactured vehicles capable of being driven to higher mileages and new vehicle supply constraints, elevating demand for used vehicles.\nBeyond these macro factors, we remain confident in our ability to capture market share on both sides of the business through our service-driven business model and robust supply chain.\nShifting to gross margin. For the quarter, our gross margin of 51.8% was 126 basis point decrease from the first quarter of 2021 gross margin, in line with our expectations for the quarter with a decrease driven by the rollout of our professional pricing initiative. As a reminder, we began rolling out this initiative in February, so we did not see the full impact in the first quarter. But our gross margin results from both professional pricing and the higher mix of professional business was in line with our plan.\nOur gross margin outlook for the full year remains unchanged at a range of 50.8% to 51.3%. Earnings per share for the first quarter of $7.17 represents a 2-year increase over $7.06 in the first quarter of 2021 and a compounded 2-year growth rate of over 34% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Again, I would like to thank team O'Reilly for their unrelenting focus on driving profitable growth through excellent customer service. We are maintaining our full year 2022 EPS guidance of $32.35 to $32.85. Our EPS guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nBefore I turn the call over to Brad, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the executive leadership transition we announced in our press release yesterday. After almost 16 years of exceptional leadership and service, Tom expressed his interest in taking on a different role with the company. Therefore, effective May 9, 2022, Tom will step down from his role as Chief Financial Officer and will continue his employment with O'Reilly in the role of Executive Vice President. And at that time, Jeremy Fletcher, our Senior Vice President of Finance and Controller, will be promoted to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nTom has been an important part of our success during his tenure, not only providing valuable operational and financial guidance, but also by identifying and mentoring many of today's senior leaders. We are very happy that Tom will continue to be an important part of our executive leadership team, and he will retain his current responsibilities for our information technology, real estate, legal and risk management efforts. We place great importance on succession planning as an integral part of our culture, and Tom has done an extraordinary job preparing Jeremy for this new role.\nJeremy has been an O'Reilly team member for 16 years, with the last 5 years of service as Senior Vice President of Finance and Controller, and is also an exceptional leader who is well suited for the position of Chief Financial Officer. I'm very confident in his ability to help lead our company to continued success well into the future.\nTo wrap up my comments, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly. Your dedication to living out our culture and taking care of our customers every day drives our continued success. I'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nExecutive VP & COO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I would also like to thank Team O'Reilly for their outstanding efforts during the quarter. Similar to last year, we knew coming into 2022, we were facing extremely tough comparisons, but I'm extremely proud of our team's continued focus on what's next, not what's behind us. We are well aware of the opportunities in the marketplace on both the DIY and the professional fronts and are excited to continue earning our customers' business each and every day. .\nOur team is energized and intently focused on outhustling and outservicing our competition. First, I would like to give some added color on our professional pricing initiative. As discussed on our last conference call, we began rollout company-wide in February, and all pricing actions associated with this initiative were completed in all of our markets during that month. Our store and sales teams immediately engaged with our existing customers as well as prospective new customers to ensure there was broad awareness of the changes we implemented.\nThis has generated a lot of excitement for our team and our customers. We have really just begun to see the fruits of this initiative and remain excited about our long-range opportunities to accelerate our professional customer share gains within this highly fragmented market.\nAs I discussed on our last call as we were rolling out this initiative, our more competitive pricing, combined with excellent customer service provides a superior value proposition, enhancing our ability to take share and generate long-term sustainable business. However, we continue to strongly believe our growth will be fueled by the same key competitive advantages of exceptional customer service and rapid inventory availability.\nWe are still in early innings with this initiative, but are pleased with the momentum we've generated and we'll continue to execute our proven game plan and take share in the professional market. As Greg noted, pricing in the professional market has remained rational and we haven't seen significant competitive pricing actions in response to our initiative. This lines up with what we expected since we still continue to be priced at a premium, albeit now a smaller premium to the traditional players in the professional market.\nWe expect to -- we expect pricing to remain rational moving forward and we'll continue to execute our long-standing practice of passing through acquisition cost increases as well as reviewing and adjusting pricing on a tactical basis to ensure we are appropriately and competitively priced in each of our markets.\nNow I'd like to discuss our SG&A results for the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 31.5%, a deleverage of 78 basis points from the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we leveraged SG&A an incredible 450 basis points in the first quarter of 2021 and called out at that time as not being the right long-term level of SG&A expense leverage for our business.\nOn an average per-store basis, our SG&A grew 6.4%, which was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but above our anticipated full year run rate. Our guidance continues to incorporate a full year SG&A per store growth of approximately 2.5% with the first quarter exceeding that full year average as a result of the SG&A comparison to the first quarter of 2021.\nFrom an inflation perspective, we continue to see wage pressure in our distribution centers and our stores, but these have been within our expectations thus far. However, we have also seen pressure from rising energy costs in the form of fuel, freight, and utilities that have been above our expectations, and it's simply too early to tell how long these cost pressures will persist within the remainder of the year. Ultimately, we micromanage our operating cost to ensure a long-term focus on building strong relationships with our customers through excellent customer service.\nWe will remain diligently focused on evaluating expenses to appropriately respond to the match and sales environment ongoing. That said, as I previously mentioned, we will always staff our stores with professional parts people that can and will provide top-notch excellent customer service to ensure our long-term success. Consistent with our unchanged sales and gross margin guidance, we are also maintaining our full year 2022 operating profit margin guidance of 20.6% to 21.1%.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our store growth during the first quarter. We opened 52 net new stores across 25 states in the U.S. as well as 2 stores in Mexico, keeping us on pace for our plan of 175 to 185 net new store openings for the year. We remain very pleased with our new store performance and continue to be excited about our ability to attract, recruit, retain and develop outstanding teams of professional parts people and quality leadership in our new stores.\nOur distribution strategy and long-term steadfast commitment to industry-leading parts availability is a key driver of our growth. Expansion of our distribution network has always gone hand-in-hand with our new store growth plans. To that end, we are very excited to announce that we have begun construction on our first O'Reilly prototype distribution center in Mexico. Our new facility is located in Guadalajara with a metro population of over 5 million people and will have a footprint of approximately 370,000 square feet. This new facility will have the ability to provide company store and job or distribution to the Guadalajara metro area and support growth in the surrounding region.\nOur distribution teams are well seasoned in the design, planning and construction of new facilities, and we have been very pleased with our progress in working with our leadership team in Mexico to get this project rolling in true O'Reilly fashion. We are targeting a completion date of the first half of 2023 and continue to be excited about the growth opportunities we see in the Mexican automotive aftermarket.\nAs travel restrictions have eased, it's been very nice for our U.S.-based leadership team to get back in person with our outstanding team in Mexico. Our leadership teams in the U.S. and Mexico are working hand in hand to execute our store, distribution and infrastructure growth strategies in the Mexican market.\nNow turning to inventory, and as we shared on our last call, we intend to aggressively add incremental dollars to our store level inventories as we move throughout 2022, seizing the opportunity to build upon our industry-leading parts availability. We finished the first quarter of 2022 with an average inventory per store of $659,000, which was up approximately 3% from both the beginning of the year and this time last year. Our supply chain leaders and teams are working diligently with all of our distribution centers and suppliers as our supply chain still has kinks and is uneven with constraints on certain commodities and with certain suppliers. That said, we are still in line with our plans to increase per store inventory over 8% by year-end.\nBefore I finish my comments, I want to echo Greg and sincerely thank you, Tom, for your dedicated service the last 16 years serving as our CFO. You have been an incredible mentor to me, a partner in driving the success of O'Reilly and a great friend. I am very excited about this new chapter and continue to work closely with you to drive our performance for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. We are all very excited about Jeremy's well-deserved promotion and you've done an incredible job preparing him and the team for the future.\nI want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their commitment, hard work and dedication to excellent customer service and in turn, our great company. I am confident in our team's ability to execute on the many initiatives we have in progress to grow our company, and I look forward to a strong performance throughout the rest of 2022.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas G. McFall\n\nCFO & Executive VP, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I'd also like to thank all of Team O'Reilly for their continued commitment to our customers and our success. Now we'll take a closer look at our first quarter results and review our guidance for the full year.\nFor the quarter, sales increased $205 million comprised of $144 million increase in comp store sales, a $51 million increase in noncomp store sales and a $10 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales. For 2022, we continue to expect our total revenues to be between $14.2 billion and $14.5 billion.\nGreg previously covered our gross margin performance for the first quarter, but I want to briefly recap our LIFO accounting for the quarter and expectations moving forward. As we noted when we established our full year gross margin guidance in February, our LIFO reserve had flipped back to a credit balance in the back half of 2021 as a result of inflation and acquisition costs, and we are now back to more typical LIFO accounting and no longer valuing the inventory at the lower replacement cost. As a result, we are expecting a limited benefit from LIFO during 2022 versus the more significant tailwind we saw throughout 2021.\nAs we unwound our historical debit LIFO reserve, our first quarter results were in line with those expectations, and our outlook on this item for the year is unchanged. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 23.9% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 24.3%, reduced by a 0.4% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the first quarter of 2021 rate of 23.5% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 24.4%, reduced by a 0.9% benefit for share-based compensation. The first quarter of 2022 base rate was in line with our expectations.\nFor the full year of 2022, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 23.2% comprised of a base rate of 23.7%, reduced by a benefit of 0.5% per share-based compensation. We expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the expected timing of benefits from renewable energy tax credits and the tolling of certain tax periods. Also, variations in the tax benefit for share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow we'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $579 million versus $790 million in the first quarter of 2021, with the decrease driven by a smaller benefit from reduction of debt inventory investment in '22 versus '21, and the differences in accrued compensation. For 2022, our expected free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at a range of $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion.\nOur AP-to-inventory ratio at the end of the first quarter was 129%, which once again has set an all-time high for our company, and was heavily influenced by the extremely strong sales volumes and inventory turns over the last 12 months. We anticipate our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate off this historic high as we complete our additional inventory investments. We continue to expect to finish 2022 at a ratio of approximately 120%.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.72x as compared to our 2021 ratio at the end of the year of 1.69x. We continue to be below our leverage target of 2.5x, and we will approach that number when appropriate. We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares with an average share price of $664.15 for a total investment of $775 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter and through the date of our press release, we repurchased an additional 0.2 million shares at an average share price of $694.70. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected future discounted cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nBefore I open up our call to your questions, I want to make a few comments on my decision to step down from the CFO position and transition into a different role with O'Reilly. It's been an honor to have been part of this outstanding team for over the past 16 years. Working together, our team has pushed O'Reilly to incredible levels of success, and I'm very grateful that I can continue to be part of our growth moving forward, as I focus more of my time on enhancing our team and the processes we use to provide even better levels of customer service.\nI could not be more excited for Jeremy as he transitions into his well-deserved and earned promotion to CFO. Jeremy and I have worked closely together since my first day at O'Reilly, and he has been a trusted adviser ever since. I'm extremely confident in Jeremy's abilities, and I know his transition will be seamless and successful. I want to thank our team for their support over the years, and I'm excited about the opportunities we have in the future.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Richard, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is James, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd I'd now like to turn the call over to Tom McFall. Mr. McFall, you may begin.\n\nThomas G. McFall\n\nCFO & Executive VP, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we'll discuss our fourth quarter 2021 results and our full year outlook for 2022. After our prepared comments, we'll host a question-and-answer period.\nBefore we begin this morning, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements, and we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, expect, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words. The company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, and other recent SEC filings. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.\nAt this time, I'd like to introduce Greg Johnson.\n\nGregory D. Johnson\n\nCEO & Co-President, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts fourth quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Brad Beckham, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer. Greg Henslee, our Executive Chairman; David O'Reilly, our Executive Vice Chairman; and Brent Kirby, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, are also present on the call.\nI'd like to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on the tremendous results in the fourth quarter, which capped off another record-setting year. This year marked our company's 65th year since our founding and our 29th year as a publicly traded company, and I feel very comfortable saying it was our best year yet driven by the truly remarkable contributions of our team of over 83,000 hard-working professional parts people.\nOur team's performance in 2021 was highlighted by our comparable store sales growth of 13.3% and diluted earnings per share growth of 32%. This outstanding performance is even more impressive when you consider that our team delivered these results on top of a record-setting year in 2020, when we achieved comparable sales increase of 10.9% and growth in earnings per share of 32%.\nThere are a number of different metrics I could provide to highlight the strength of our business, and we'll talk through many of those details in our customary updates during the call today. However, there are 2 specific numbers that I'd like to provide an incredible picture of just how much growth Team O'Reilly has generated for our shareholders over the past 2 years.\nFor 2021, our average store generated sales of $2.3 million, which represents an increase of over 23% from the average store sales volume just 2 years ago in 2019. During this same time -- period of time, our operating profit dollars per store has grown by an incredible 42% as our store and distribution teams leveraged our dual market business model to drive very strong operating profit flow-through.\nI want to take this opportunity to thank Team O'Reilly for your tremendous back-to-back annual performance. One of the guiding principles of our culture is our team's dedication to our customers and fellow team members, and that commitment was truly on display in 2021.\nRolling out the numbers for over the $13 billion of sales, it can be easy to lose sight of the context of what it takes to deliver these results. These big growth numbers are made up of millions of individual interactions with our customers, where our team members constantly go the extra mile to provide the best customer service in our industry to earn our customers' current and future business.\nOur team truly lived a \"Never Say No\" philosophy in 2021, while at the same time, consistently executing on best practices to protect the health and safety of our customers and team members and tackle head on the significant challenges brought on by the pandemic. It's taken a monumental effort, and I again want to express my gratitude for the selfless dedication, hard work and sacrifice of each member of Team O'Reilly.\nNow I'd like to take a few minutes and provide some color around our fourth quarter results. Our comparable store sales for the fourth quarter grew 14.5%. From a cadence perspective, we continue to see steady trend of elevated sales levels throughout the quarter, continuing the consistent broad-based strength we've experienced since the second quarter of 2020. As a result, our sales results were fairly consistent throughout the quarter, with December being the strongest month on a 2- and 3-year stack basis.\nWe've continued to see solid sales volumes. The results thus far in 2022 have been impacted by the Omicron variant and by some inclement weather given choppiness in certain regions of the company -- or country, rather. I'll spend more time on this in a few minutes on our sales outlook for 2022, but I'd like to add that we're always pleased to see this type of harsh weather as the wear and tear it inflicts on vehicles benefits us throughout the year.\nOur comparable store sales results were driven by somewhat stronger growth on the professional side of our business, which continues to trend -- which continues the trend we experienced in the second and third quarters. However, our DIY business was also very strong in the fourth quarter and our expectations against difficult compares from the prior year.\nFor the quarter, we were very pleased to see the solid growth on both average ticket and comparable ticket counts in both our professional and DIY businesses, with average ticket being the larger contributor. The average ticket growth was aided by heightened inflation with the benefit we realized from same-SKU selling prices landing in the high single digits. However, we continue to be pleased to see growth in average ticket beyond the positive impact of same-SKU inflation driven by the long-term increased complexity of automotive technology.\nDemand in our industry has remained very resilient for the past 2 quarters, even as price levels and the broader economy have risen sharply. The acquisition cost increases we saw in 2021 were consistent with the cost pressures experienced across the automotive aftermarket, and the industry continues to be very rational in passing through the inflationary pricing.\nFinally, even though average ticket was the larger contributor to our comparable store sales for the quarter, we also believe we're pleased to capitalize on solid ticket count comps, which were positive for both the professional and DIY businesses. We've been encouraged by the stability of our customer traffic, especially as we continue to move further past the major macro-level demand tailwinds provided by the government stimulus. We believe we're very clearly benefiting from market share gains and an increased willingness of customers to invest in their existing vehicles.\nNext, I want to transition to a discussion of our 2022 sales guidance as well as our 2021 gross profit performance and outlook for gross profit for 2022. As we disclosed in our earnings release yesterday, we're establishing an annual comparable store sales guidance for 2022 at the range of 5% to 7%. Our expectations are to generate positive comparable store sales growth on both sides of our business, with stronger growth on the professional business.\nThis range and corresponding expectations for the coming year are higher than we can remember ever providing in our initial annual guidance. So I want to spend some extra time to provide color on the basis for our forecast relating both to our general outlook for the coming year as well as our planned strategy to further invest in pricing on the professional side of our business.\nTo begin, from a macro perspective, we remain very confident about the health of the automotive aftermarket and believe the stable, robust growth trends experienced in our industry are indicative of ongoing core underlying strength. The value proposition for consumers to invest in their existing vehicles remains very strong driven by scarcity of new vehicle supply, high demand for used vehicles, and the quality of engineering and manufacturing of vehicles currently on the road, merits higher mileages.\nOur industry history has proven that time -- in times of economic uncertainty motivate consumers to take more cautious financial outlook and allocate additional share of their wallet to maintain their existing vehicles. We believe this has been a positive for our business since the onset of the pandemic and that this value proposition will continue to support solid demand in our industry. We are also encouraged by the resilience of the strong sales trends in our business we've moved -- as we move further past the injection of government stimulus into the economy and believe that economically consumers remain relatively healthy with employment increasing and miles driven steadily recovering.\nBeyond this positive macroeconomic backdrop, it is also clear to us that our extremely strong sales results are driven by significant share gains, with our outperformance the direct result of significant competitive advantages afforded by the strength of our business model and supply chain.\nFor the DIY side of our business, we anticipate delivering generally stable to slightly negative ticket counts, with the headwind coming from lapping the positive impact of governance stimulus in the first half of 2021 and expected pressures from increased prices. We remain cognizant of the impact of sustained inflation on the economically challenged DIY consumers, who have just historically deferred noncritical maintenance and traded down the product value spectrum as prices dramatically increased.\nWe expect this pressure to ticket comp counts to be more than offset by increased average ticket as our forecast includes an assumption of mid-single-digit same-SKU inflation. The anticipated benefit from same-SKU inflation does not include significant incremental increases in price levels from this point forward in 2022, consistent with our historical approach to issuing guidance. Our projection reflects the static prices from current levels with expected benefit of same-SKU inflation being stronger in the first half of the year as we compare price levels that ramp throughout 2021.\nOn the professional side of our business, our guidance expectations assume robust growth in ticket counts supported by 4 factors: the stronger economic resilience of the end-user customers on this side of the business; incremental improvement in miles driven from consumers generally returning to an in-person work post pandemic; the long-term industry demographic trend for faster growth on the professional side of our business; and anticipated accelerated growth from the professional pricing initiative, which I will discuss next.\nThroughout our history, we have been steadfast in earning our professional customers business by providing excellent customer service from highly trained professional parts people with rapid access to industry-leading inventory at competitive prices. This unwavering commitment to customer service has allowed us to drive exceptional value for our customers and capitalize on competitive advantages to earn a pricing premium in many of our markets. Our service over price philosophy remains unchanged, but we believe we have an opportunity to accelerate our professional share gain through targeted competitive adjustments to our professional pricing strategy.\nThe past 2 years in the automotive aftermarket have been very turbulent, characterized by volatility in customer demand as a result of the pandemic, significant supply chain shocks and an evolving competitive landscape. These factors have been more disruptive on the do-it-for-me side of the business, which remains very fragmented and where the ability to respond to challenging environments has differed significantly between market participants. Against this backdrop, we have been very successful in gaining professional market share and growing substantially faster than the overall market through the strength of our industry-leading inventory availability, tiered distribution and hub network and world-class professional parts people.\nHowever, we believe that the current disruptive environment presents an opportunity for us to enhance our competitive positioning and leverage our competitive advantages to drive accelerated long-term market share gains. Over the course of the past few quarters, we've tested several professional pricing strategies in multiple markets. We've been very encouraged by the results of our testing. And after dialing in our strategy, we rolled out the professional pricing initiative company-wide at the beginning of February.\nFor 2022, we expect to see a meaningful benefit to our professional customer comps from share gains, which we've incorporated into our comparable sales growth expectations. The professional pricing initiatives will pressure our gross margin rate, which we have also incorporated into our gross profit guidance. While we continually adjust pricing by location, by customer and by product line to reflect changing market conditions, we believe the professional pricing initiative we've put in place appropriately positions us to enhance the value proposition we offer our professional customers and solidify our position on the top of the call list for 2022 and beyond.\nNext, I'd like to provide some color on our fourth quarter gross margins and additional details supporting our full year 2022 guidance. Our fourth quarter gross margin of 52.7% was a 66 basis point improvement from our fourth quarter of 2020, which exceeded the expectations we discussed on the third call -- third quarter call. For the full year, gross margin also came in at 52.7%, which was 23 basis points higher than last year and at the upper end of our guidance range instead of the bottom half of the range as previously expected. The principal driver of the better-than-expected performance was lower-than-expected distribution cost. As we've discussed on previous calls, our distribution infrastructure is facing inefficiencies due to extremely high sales volumes, the difficult labor environment and global logistics challenges. While we continue to take targeted actions in the fourth quarter to respond to these pressures, we did not incur the level of incremental expense that we had anticipated.\nFor 2022, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 50.8% to 51.3%. The year-over-year pressure to our gross margin rate is driven by the impact of our professional pricing initiative, a reduced LIFO benefit and a headwind from higher mix of professional business, which we expect to grow faster than DIY. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by leverage of our distribution cost as supply chain conditions begin to normalize.\nBefore turning the call over to Brad, I'd like to highlight our fourth quarter earnings per share increase of 41% to $7.64 with a full year 2021 increase of 32% to $31.10. For 2022, our guidance is $32.35 to $32.85, representing an increase of 5% versus 2021 at the midpoint. After delivering earnings per share growth of 32% in both 2021 and 2020, our forecasted annual increase for 2022 diluted earnings per share represents a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 22% and is a testament to the historical results our team has been able to generate and repeat through consistent excellent execution.\nTo wrap up my comments, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly for an outstanding year. Your dedication to living out our culture and taking care of our customers every day drives our continued success.\nI'll now turn the call over to Brad Beckham. Brad?\n\nBrad W. Beckham\n\nExecutive VP & COO, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin my comments today by echoing Greg and congratulating Team O'Reilly on another amazing year. After our record-breaking year in 2020, we came into 2021 knowing just how difficult it was going to be to sustain that same level of performance. However, our team once again proved they were up to the challenge and generated even more impressive growth in 2021. The core driver of our success is our team's relentless focus on providing excellent customer service, and we are very excited about the opportunities we have in front of us in 2022.\nGreg previously discussed our strategic professional pricing initiative, but I want to add one more point before we move on to the rest of my prepared comments. Anyone who has participated in our earnings calls or attended our Analyst Days for any length of time has heard us say on multiple occasions that price is not the most important factor on the professional side of the business and that you cannot win sustainable business solely on price. We want to be very clear that this rule still holds true for our business and our industry. We strongly believe that the lion's share of the professional business in the marketplace is, one, day in and day out through exceptional customer service and rapid inventory availability.\nHowever, we believe we can generate solid long-term returns by further investing in professional pricing. As an important part of our professional pricing initiative, we are intentionally not positioned as the lowest-price competitor in each market, and our store and sales teams remain as committed as ever to earning our customers' business by outhustling and outservicing our competitors. Our team fully realizes that business won with price alone is easily lost to a lower price, a competitor may decide to offer. This initiative is geared to position us more quickly to gain professional market share based on all the services we offer, along with a very competitive price.\nNow I'd like to take some time to covering our SG&A and operating profit performance in 2021 as well as our outlook for 2022. For the fourth quarter, we generated an impressive increase in operating margin of 165 basis points and operating profit dollar growth of 27%. For the full year, we generated a 21% increase in operating profit dollars, yielding a new annual record of 21.9% operating margin. This increase in operating profit results for 2021 was driven by our team's ability to generate exceptional comparable store sales results of 13.3% while limiting our per-store SG&A growth to under 9%. The result was improved leverage of SG&A expenses of 81 basis points.\nOur 2021 results are even more impressive considering we delivered these results on top of leveraging SG&A by 263 basis points in 2020. The dollar growth in our SG&A spend per store in 2021 was significantly higher than our typical growth in operating expenses driven by expenses incurred in store payroll, incentive compensation and variable operating expenses to support our sales growth. Over the last 1.5 years, our focus has been to match the tremendous opportunities we've had to gain share and drive very strong sales growth by delivering on the excellent customer service standard that is at the core of our business, all while micromanaging our expense structure.\nThe result has been an enhanced level of profitability that candidly has exceeded our previous expectations for our ability to execute our model effectively at this level of SG&A productivity. However, our top line growth for the last 7 quarters has been both robust and remarkably consistent. This stability in strong sales volumes, coupled with high fixed low-variable cost structures for our stores to generate very favorable leverage for our business model. As we capitalize on lessons learned as we've navigated record high sales and productivity gains and look forward to 2022, we are more confident than ever that our seasoned experienced teams will continue to be able to execute at this step change of increased profitability.\nOur estimated per-store SG&A reflects our confidence in our ability to effectively control expenses moving forward. Our teams have demonstrated this ability to leverage SG&A even as we have faced significant wage rate pressures. Our SG&A expectations for 2022 include continued pressure from inflation and wage rates at trends consistent with what we saw in 2021, more than offset by efficiency gains, leverage on fixed costs and incentive compensation planned at target levels.\nFor 2022, we estimate per-store SG&A will grow by approximately 2.5%, which is solidly below our comparable store sales we expect to generate. As always, our top priority is to ensure we are providing excellent customer service, enabling us to develop long-term, loyal customer relationships.\nBased upon the pressure to gross margin Greg outlined earlier, partially offset by improved SG&A leverage, we expect operating profit to decline between 80 and 130 basis points from 2021's phenomenal results. However, we expect operating profit dollars at the midpoint of our guidance to increase approximately 2.5% and our operating profit guide of 20.6% to 21.1% of sales brackets our 2020 operating profit, which represented an all-time high for our company before we expanded the record by another 100 basis points in 2021.\nOur capital expenditures for 2021 were $443 million, which was lower than our typical capital spend and below our original plan going into 2021. The lower CapEx was driven by a few different factors, including a heavier weighting of leased versus owned stores, the delay of certain expenditures limited by constraints on availability of vehicles and equipment and the timing of certain store-level strategic initiatives that had to be pushed back as our teams prioritize supporting the current strong sales volumes.\nAs we set our expectations for 2022, our plan is to deploy capital for the initiatives that were delayed in 2021 as well as support new store and DC development to support our long-term growth strategies in the U.S. and Mexico. For 2022, we are setting our capital expenditure guidance at $650 million to $750 million. We have also established a target of 175 to 185 net new store openings.\nOutside of our new store and DC development, we have also identified several exciting projects and initiatives in 2022 to enhance the service we provide our customers and improve our efficiency to drive strong returns. Our CapEx guidance includes planned investments in DC and store fleet upgrades; store projects to enhance the image, appearance and convenience of our stores; as well as strategic investments in information technology projects.\nInventory per store at the end of 2021 was $637,000, which was down 2% from the end of last year. As we've discussed on previous calls during the course of 2020 and 2021, our intent has been to aggressively add incremental dollars to our store-level inventories. During the strong sales environment the past 7 quarters, rolling out the full scope of these initiatives has had to take a backseat to the day-to-day replenishment needs of our stores. We still see significant opportunity to build upon our industry-leading parts availability, and our plan for 2022 includes the deployment of additional inventory in our store and hub network above and beyond our normal new store and typical product additions.\nAs a result of this plan to catch up on delayed initiatives for 2022, we are planning our per-store inventory to increase over 8%. This level of inventory growth is significantly above our historical run rates and is driven in part by our focus on meeting the extremely strong sales demand in a supply-constrained market environment. Our ongoing inventory management is geared to deploy the right inventory at the optimal position within our tiered distribution network and includes continual adjustments to pushout and pullback inventory to achieve this objective. However, our overriding goal is to have the best local inventory offering, and that priority drives how we manage our inventory and, in turn, is the primary reason for the higher level for 2022.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tom, I want to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their dedication and hard work in 2021.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas G. McFall\n\nCFO & Executive VP, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brad. I'd also like to congratulate Team O'Reilly on another outstanding year.\nNow we'll take a closer look at our fourth quarter results and provide some additional guidance for 2022. For the quarter, sales increased $463 million, comprised of a $398 million increase in comp store sales, a $56 million increase in noncomp store sales and a $9 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales. For 2022, we expect our total revenues to be between $14.2 billion and $14.5 billion.\nGreg covered our gross margin performance earlier, but I want to provide additional details on our positive LIFO impact. For the full year 2021, the LIFO impact was $80 million compared to $11 million in the prior year. As a reminder, the positive LIFO impact is a byproduct of the reversal of our historic LIFO debit. Since 2013, due to negotiated acquisition price decreases, our calculated LIFO inventory balances exceeded the value of our inventory at replacement costs, and we elected the conservative approach to not write up inventory value beyond the replacement cost.\nAs a result of this accounting, we've seen a benefit from rising costs and price levels via the sell-through of lower-cost inventory purchased prior to the recent cost increases. However, during the third quarter of 2021, our LIFO reserve flipped back to a credit balance as a result of inflation and acquisition costs. And moving forward, we expect to be back to typical LIFO accounting and no longer valuing inventory at a lower replacement cost. As a result, we anticipate a limited benefit of less than $10 million in 2022 for the final sell-through of the remaining lower-cost inventory, which creates a headwind to our gross margin rate.\nOur fourth quarter effective tax rate was 19.4% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 20.4%, reduced by 1% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2020 rate up 21.4% of pretax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 21.8%, reduced by a 0.4% benefit for share-based compensation. The fourth quarter of 2021 base rate as compared to 2020 benefited from a higher level of renewable energy tax credits, as a result of the timing of these projects, which was in line with our expectations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 22.2% of pretax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.5%, reduced by 1.3% per share-based compensation. For the full year of 2022, we expect an effective tax rate of 23.2%, comprised of a base rate of 23.7%, reduced by a benefit of 0.5% per share-based compensation.\nWe expect the fourth quarter rate to be lower than the other 3 quarters due to the expected timing of benefits from renewable energy tax credits and tolling of certain tax periods. These expectations assume no significant changes to existing tax codes. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.\nNow I'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results and our expectations for 2022. Free cash flow for 2021 was $2.5 billion versus $2.2 billion in 2020. The increase of $359 million or 16% was driven by an increase in operating income and a higher reduction in net inventory in 2021 versus the prior year. For 2022, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion, with the year-over-year decrease primarily due to increased net inventory investment and increased CapEx, as Brad previously outlined.\nOur AP-to-inventory ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 127%, which set an all-time high for our company and was heavily influenced by the extremely strong sales volumes and inventory turns in 2021. We anticipate our AP-to-inventory ratio to moderate off of this historic high as we complete our additional inventory investments and sales growth moderate. Our current expectation is to finish 2022 at a ratio of approximately 120%.\nMoving on to debt. We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.69x as compared to our end of 2020 ratio of 2.03x, with the reduction driven by the significant growth in EBITDAR during 2021 and a decrease in adjusted debt, including the redemption of $300 million of senior notes in the second quarter. We continue to be below our leverage target ratio of 2.5x, and we will approach that number when appropriate.\nWe also continue to execute our share repurchase program. And for 2021, based on the strength of our business, we were able to repurchase 4.5 million shares at an average share price of $545.78 for a total investment of $2.5 billion. Subsequent to the end of the year and through the date of our press release, we repurchased 0.3 million shares at an average share price of $660.23. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by the expected future discounted cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. As a reminder, our EPS guidance for 2022 includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases.\nBefore I open up our call to your questions, I'd like to thank the O'Reilly team for their dedication to our company and our customers. Your hard work and commitment to excellent customer service continues to drive our outstanding performance.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask James, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions."

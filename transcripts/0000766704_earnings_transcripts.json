Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, November 6, 2025.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tyler Baba, Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Fiscal Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 months ended September 30, 2025. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO.\nI trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today. Portions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information.\nThese forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control, that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and our management's discussion and analysis.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations from which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, and good day, everyone. We appreciate everyone for joining us today as we discuss our Q3 2025 financial results. Q3 2025 was an excellent quarter for WELL, driven by strong performances network-wide, but especially in our core Canadian business.\nWe're seeing our technology-enabled approach, which is increasingly AI-enabled, drive real business results across the enterprise. We feel qualified and authentic to say that we're firmly delivering on our mandate of delivering high-quality tech-enabled care and/or supporting physicians across the continent in delivering high-quality tech-enabled care in their environments.\nWe generated approximately $365 million in revenues for the quarter, which were up by 56% year-over-year and surpassed $1 billion in revenue and $137 million in adjusted EBITDA in just the first 9 months of the year. 5 years ago, for perspective, our quarterly revenues were $12 million and year-to-date revenue as of Q3 2020 was approximately $33 million with negative adjusted EBITDA.\nOur revenues have grown more than 30 times in 5 years, while our adjusted EBITDA is trending to meet our stated guidance of between $190 million and $210 million this year.\nWe also witnessed improvements in a number of operations and productivity metrics, which we'll discuss later on this call which we feel demonstrate that we're not just growing but delivering real value and efficiency to the health care markets we serve.\nWe achieved adjusted EBITDA of $59.9 million in Q3, an increase of 296% as compared to $15.1 million in Q3 of '24. If one were to exclude the impact of Circle Medical deferred revenues, Q2 -- Q3 would have been $347 million, representing 48% year-over-year growth while adjusted EBITDA would have been $42.3 million, representing a 180% increase compared to the previous year.\nAlso very pleased to report that given management's very intense focus on margins, we've improved our gross margins by 510 bps to 45.5% from 40.4% last year, and our operating adjusted EBITDA margins have improved by 990 bps year-over-year.\nFree cash flow attributable to shareholders in Q3 was $30.2 million, including one small divestiture we had in our CRH platform and $15.1 million in Q3 without it. Eva will speak to this in greater length later.\nI will now share with you some of our operational highlights for Q3. As of the end of Q3 '25, WELL had over 4,500 billable and non-billable providers delivering care across our entire network of physical and virtual clinics. Of that number, we now have over 1,300 physicians in Canada operating with WELL, which is just over 1% of all physicians practicing in the country.\nWe continue to focus on achieving 10% market share within 8 to 10 years, so we have a tremendous amount of runway left to continue to expand our footprint across Canada. As a reminder, we are the market leader.\nIn addition, over 43,000 health care providers across the country, the majority of which are physicians, continue to benefit from our SaaS and technology services. We estimate that more than 40% of all physicians in Canada engage with our WELLSTAR technology platform in some capacity.\nLooking at our patient visits, which are a strong indicator of our revenue growth and progress, patient visits are very strong for the quarter, especially in Canada. Total care interactions were over 2.7 million in Q3, which represented a 29% increase compared to last year and represented 19% organic growth.\nFor the second quarter in a row, Canadian patient visits surpassed 1 million in a single quarter, reaching 1.08 million patient visits in Q3 2025. Total patient visits increased 38% year-over-year, including organic growth of 9%, accounting for both clinic absorptions and same clinic expansion.\nSystem-wide, inclusive of U.S. and Canada, we delivered over 1.7 million patient visits in Q3, a 19% increase from the prior year, with organic growth of 3%. We note that the slower organic growth in patient visits system-wide was attributable to Circle Medical, whose patient visits were lower than last year because of the significant focus on compliance.\nHowever, I'm pleased to note that Q3 was a bounce-back quarter for Circle Medical compared to Q2. We'll talk a bit more about these positive results at Circle Medical later in the call.\nI'd like to now share with you an updated overview of WELL Health and its key operating subsidiaries. We think it's important to convey what the company will look like as the dust settles on its journey to simplify and streamline operations, especially with the divestiture processes we have underway in the United States currently.\nAs you can see, our core operating business and capital allocation focus is our Canadian clinics network. This is where we have a leadership position in Canada and where we are able to generate the highest return on invested capital or ROIC.\nOur 3 key areas of focus here are: primary care; diagnostics and specialized care; and of course, our preventative and executive health line of business. Complementing our Canadian clinic network assets, we have our strategically controlled operating platforms. This includes WELLSTAR, for which we are planning an IPO next year on the TSX and HEALWELL, which is already a publicly listed company on the TSX.\nWELLSTAR is focused on providing digital enablement solutions for health care providers and clinics, while HEALWELL is building AI solutions and data science, health care information systems for public health as well as other solutions for big pharma and life sciences companies.\nAn easy way to think about this is that WELLSTAR generally serves SMB or small and medium-sized businesses clients, such as outpatient medical clinics and doctors, whereas HEALWELL serves large enterprises around the globe, such as the NHS.\nIt is important to note that both HEALWELL and WELLSTAR are able to fund their future acquisition plans through their own fundraising and capital allocation programs. This structure is very capital efficient for WELL shareholders who will continue to benefit from the consolidated financial statements and enterprise value of both WELLSTAR and HEALWELL without seeing any dilution in WELL's own share capital.\nIncidentally, CYBERWELL is another strategically controlled operating platform, but has been excluded from this slide for the moment due to its small size. It is currently generating less than 1% of WELL's total revenue.\nNow that we've covered off the key results, I'd like to go over a few key presentation themes we'll be covering in the rest of the presentation. One, of course, will be our Canadian clinics update; two, WELLSTAR; three, HEALWELL AI; and fourth, we'll provide an update on the strategic alternative processes for our U.S. assets.\nThe first key theme I'd like to address this morning is the success of our Canadian business. As you can see from these charts, the historical performance of our Canadian clinics business has been exceptionally strong. Over the past 4 years, our Canadian clinics business has exceeded 50% compound annual growth rate.\nDuring the 9 months ended September 30th, Canadian clinics achieved revenue of $325.3 million. Our year-to-date revenues have already surpassed our total revenue for all of 2024. For perspective, 5 years ago, our Canadian clinics revenue was $9.7 million for the quarter and $26.4 million on a year-to-date basis. So again, well over 10 times.\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to our Canadian clinics business has grown at a compound annual growth rate of over 44%. During the 9 months ended September 30, '25, Canadian clinics achieved adjusted EBITDA of $45.7 million. Notably, our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA for the first 9 months has also surpassed our total adjusted EBITDA last year with an additional $5 million so far.\nOur Canadian clinics network has grown to 227 clinics at the end of Q3 2025. Our Canadian clinics business continued its strong growth trajectory in Q3 2025. Patient visits in our Canadian clinics network totaled 1.08 million in the third fiscal quarter, our second quarter in which we surpassed 1 million patient visits and up 38% from 780,000 in Q3 2024.\nThe number of billable providers within the network reached 2,068 in Q3, up 17% from 1,769 in Q3 of last year, highlighting the growing magnitude of our scale. Note that the number of doctors here is just over 1,300, as mentioned earlier.\nIn the quarter we recruited 44 physicians versus acquiring 64 physicians into our platform through our M&A program. We're pleased that we are now recruiting more physicians than ever before as the WELL brand is gaining recognition as an attractive place for physicians to work and build their practice. This is due to the hard work we're doing to win the hearts and minds of doctors by making their lives easier and helping them be more successful in their practice.\nA major goal of our platform is to allow providers to spend more quality time seeing patients without having to worry about the overhead tasks or managing a clinic or spending countless hours on charting patient records. This shows that our business model is working.\nIn fact, in Q3 '25, our number of patient visits per billable provider was 524 compared to 441 in Q3 of last year, representing a year-over-year increase of 19% in this very important metric. With patient visits growing faster than the number of billable providers in WELL's Canadian clinic network, we are demonstrating increasing efficiency in our clinics.\nWhile there are many more contributors to this improvement, we believe improved tooling and technology to be one of those key reasons.\nAnd looking at our Canadian business, including Canadian clinics, WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL, but excluding HEALWELL, our WELL Canada business is experiencing accelerating growth, as you can see from both of these graphs. In Q3 '25, WELL Canada generated revenue of $129.3 million compared to $93.5 million in the prior year's quarter, an increase of 38% as compared to the prior year's growth of 27%.\nWe're also quite proud to report that our adjusted EBITDA is growing faster than our revenues now, which was not the case last year.\nIn Q3 2025, adjusted EBITDA for our total WELL Canada business reached $21 million, up from $14 million year-over-year, representing an increase of 50% as compared to the prior year growth rate of 16%.\nOn to our Canadian clinics capital allocation track record slide. If you were on last quarter's conference call, you would have likely remembered this slide. We've updated it to include -- to demonstrate our capital allocation record at Canadian clinics. As a reminder, this slide speaks to all of our clinical acquisitions and absorption since inception.\nOn the right hand of the slide, we provided total figures relative to our capital allocation record in Canadian clinics. As you can see, we've allocated about $280 million overall in 31 separate transactions where we have acquired $273 million in revenues.\nOur total deal multiple for all acquisitions was 9.4x EBITDA at the time of acquisition. Since then, we've grown the EBITDA of all of our acquired assets by 117%, rerating the implied multiple to 4.3x.\nIf one takes out MyHealth, the specialized care and diagnostic imaging platform, which was our single largest and most expensive acquisition to date in Canada, the average original multiple that we transacted against was 5.8x EBITDA. But given that we've substantially improved the EBITDA for these businesses, the implied multiple after these improvements currently stands at just 2.2x shareholder EBITDA. This yields an adjusted EBITDA growth of 164%.\nIn Q3 2025, we continued executing on our strategic growth plan through the expansion of our clinic network. During Q3, we acquired 5 clinics generating over $27.5 million in annual revenue. Our owned and operated clinic network welcomed 68 new billable providers in the third fiscal quarter, further strengthening our capacity to deliver high-quality care.\nAs we articulated at the beginning of our call, the main focus of our capital allocation focus is our Canadian clinics business. As such, we have picked up the pace of our M&A program relative to Canadian clinics.\nYear-to-date, we have already completed 12 transactions and acquired $67 million in clinical revenue, which includes acquired and absorption revenue, which exceeds our full year metrics in the prior year. By comparison last year, we completed 10 transactions in the full year, accounting for $53 million of acquired business.\nWe continue to tool up our M&A program and are getting ready to improve these numbers as we get into 2026. We have now spent considerable time and effort streamlining, automating, and where possible, AI-enabling our corporate development efforts with the goal of evolving our M&A efforts into a true, efficient machine.\nAs for our growing M&A pipeline, we're pleased to report that we are working on some of our largest acquisitions to date in Canadian clinics and have approximately $235 million in clinics under LOI with approximately $0.25 billion overall under LOI enterprise-wide, including WELLSTAR and HEALWELL.\nThe $235 million figure reflects 8 signed LOIs and 61 clinics and includes some of the largest targets we've had locked down in quite some time. As a comparison, on our prior call in August, we had 25 clinics and only $48 million in annual revenue under LOI.\nWe also have a very large pipeline of target acquisitions that are in the pre-LOI stage. For our total pipeline, including both LOI and pre-LOI, we now have more than 35 targets engaged, representing over $350 million in annual revenue and more than 130 clinics.\nThe second theme I'd like to talk about is WELLSTAR. As a reminder, WELLSTAR is a WELL subsidiary, which we intend to spin out as a publicly listed high-growth, profitable, pure-play Software-as-a-Service or SaaS health care technology company, which would still be majority owned by WELL.\nWELLSTAR is laser-focused on addressing the diverse needs of health care providers by streamlining care delivery, integrating fragmented health care systems, reducing provider burnout and improving patient experiences and outcomes.\nLast week, we announced a $62 million equity financing for WELLSTAR, which is expected to close by early December 2025. This financing was led by syndicate of investors, including 3 of Canada's most prominent fund investors: Mawer Investment Management; EdgePoint Wealth Management; and Picton Mahoney. We're very grateful for the support provided by these investors and extremely proud to have the support of such outstanding Canadian institutions.\nThis equity offering was done at $1.50 per share, which is a 50% premium compared to the prior WELLSTAR financing that we completed at $1 per share in December of '24. On a fully diluted basis, the post-money valuation for WELLSTAR is approximately now $535 million, and WELL's ownership stake is approximately 70%. This would imply that WELLSTAR should contribute approximately $375 million to WELL's valuation on a sum of parts valuation.\nThus, you can see we are unlocking the value of WELLSTAR as we believe it is not properly reflected in the total value of WELL Health, which we believe remains undervalued.\nWe continue to believe WELLSTAR will be a very strong IPO candidate on the TSX main board sometime early in 2026, depending on market conditions. Our plan is to build additional scale before going forward with the [ goPublic ] initiative by completing additional acquisitions that will position WELLSTAR towards achieving more than $100 million in annualized revenue run rate.\nWELLSTAR has already signed an agreement to acquire a health care billing company, which is expected to close in early December and subject to regulatory approval, and earlier this week announced the acquisition of Mutuo, a leading Canadian AI Scribe platform.\nWe're also pleased to report that WELLSTAR delivered another exceptional quarter, generating revenue of $18.3 million, an increase of 67% as compared to revenue of $10.9 million in Q3 of the prior year. WELLSTAR achieved monthly recurring revenue or MRR of $5.5 million at the end of Q3, 2025, an increase of 63% as compared to Q3 of '24.\nWELLSTAR continues to have a strong profitability profile with adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million in Q3, an increase of 69% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 million in Q3 of '24.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins were 35% in Q3 for WELLSTAR on a pre-shared services basis. WELLSTAR's EBITDA margins were boosted by a significant provincial ocean referral e-referral contract. However, I want to point out that once we add in the shared services and public company overhead costs, the EBITDA margins will be expected to be slightly lower when we go public.\nThe third theme I'd like to talk about is HEALWELL AI. As a quick reminder, HEALWELL is a global health care software company with enterprise-grade data science and AI offerings, serving 70 of the largest health systems here in Canada and globally in 11 countries, including customers such as the NHS in the U.K. and the governments of France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, New Zealand, Australia and various health systems in the United States.\nEarlier this week, HEALWELL announced 3 transactions, which allow the company to evolve into becoming a pure-play high-margin AI and SaaS Software-as-a-Services focused business on large enterprise customers such as health systems and life sciences pharmaceutical companies globally.\nThe transactions include the following. First, HEALWELL has divested its Polyclinic family medicine and specialty group of clinics to WELL Health Clinic Network. This includes 2 clinics and approximately 40 physicians. WELL had already been managing these 2 clinics for HEALWELL since January of 2024. And so it's highly logical that WELL now becomes the owner and operator of these clinics.\nSecondly, HEALWELL sold its majority interest in Mutuo Health Solutions to WELLSTAR. As you may recall, Mutuo is primarily focused on selling solutions to doctors and clinics, which actually aligns better with WELLSTAR's mandate and its Nexus AI platform as opposed to HEALWELL and its focused on public health and enterprise customers around the globe.\nThe divestiture of Mutuo enables HEALWELL to concentrate resources on its core digital health care solutions while Mutuo strengthens WELLSTAR's Nexus AI platform. For clarity, HEALWELL is building category-leading AI solutions for public health and life sciences, while WELLSTAR advances digital enablement for health care providers and clinics across Canada.\nAnd third, HEALWELL has formed a 50-50 clinical research JV or joint venture with WELL. This joint venture includes biopharma services and Canadian phase onward, which will no longer be consolidated under HEALWELL. We intend to continue the strategic evaluation process for this joint venture to find the best solution to support the growth opportunity in clinical research. And we'll keep our shareholders updated.\nThese 3 transactions will allow HEALWELL to place a greater focus on integrating its industry-leading and third-party validated AI solutions with its Healthcare Software segment and obtain important synergies that will result in margin expansion and organic growth.\nHEALWELL's new pure-play yearly revenues are currently at $120 million and profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis. We're also very pleased to report that our -- that this was BR's second quarter of inclusion of HEALWELL into our financial statements, which were released earlier this morning by the company.\nHEALWELL achieved quarterly revenue from continuing operations of $30.4 million for Q3, an increase of 354%. Also during Q3 2025, HEALWELL reported positive adjusted EBITDA of $700,000 compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.8 million for the same quarter last year.\nWe're extremely proud of the progress made by HEALWELL, a company that we helped launch and incubate with management more than 2 years ago and in which we took a majority voting position this past April.\nThe fourth theme I'd like to talk about is our current strategic review process for our U.S. assets. We are, of course, limited in what we can say about these strategic review processes with our U.S. assets, especially given the advanced nature of some of our work here, but I will try to give you some high-level color.\nWe remain committed to our strategy of divesting the company's U.S. care delivery assets, including WISP, Circle Medical and CRH, noting that Circle Medical will likely take longer and be more of a 2026 project due to our focus on clearing the previously noted regulatory inquiry.\nCurrently, we have multiple advanced conversations occurring across 2 of these assets. And our objective, which is consistent with our announcement back in August at our Q2 earnings event is to announce at least one divestment by the end of the year.\nGiven the significant revenue and EBITDA attributable to these assets, we also have worked very hard to improve our executable pipeline of deals that would benefit from these divestments, which we obviously covered quite comprehensively earlier as part of our M&A pipeline review.\nAnd now a quick word on WISP. WISP continues to demonstrate strong business fundamentals with consistent revenue growth and operating margin expansion. WISP had a strong Q3 with quarterly revenues of $30.3 million, an increase of 13% from $26.9 million achieved in Q3 last year. WISP continues to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million in Q3 of this year.\nMoving on to Circle Medical. Last year, we were just getting started on executing on our strategic alternatives process for Circle when we had to slow down the process due to the regulatory inquiry, year-end audit and reclassification of deferred revenue.\nCircle Medical reported revenue of $42 million in Q3, an increase of 120% compared to revenue of $19.1 million last year. Revenue was boosted by approximately $17.6 million of deferred revenue in Q3. If you remove the deferred revenue, Circle Medical's revenues did decline on a year-over-year basis. However, with the greater focus on compliance and execution, it did also see an improvement in EBITDA, generating $4.8 million in EBITDA, not including the deferred revenues, which was an improvement from the previous year, again, excluding the impact of deferred revenues.\nWe're encouraged by the stabilization of revenues and improvement of EBITDA at Circle Medical and continue to be focused on improving our compliance program and clearing our regulatory review process. We look forward to providing updates there, too.\nAnd finally, CRH and Provider Staffing. As for CRH, the combined CRH anesthesia and staffing business has been performing very well, having generated revenue of $125.1 million in Q3 compared to $94.7 million in Q3 of 2024, an improvement of 32% year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for combined anesthesia and staffing was $22.7 million in Q3 compared to $20 million in Q3 of last year, an improvement of 14%. These results are indicative of the growth and strong profitability of these 2 assets.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials in greater detail for Q3. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. Let's start with the factors that led to the strong revenue growth in the quarter. As you can see from the graph on the left, WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $364.6 million in Q3 2025, driven by positive contribution from HEALWELL of $37.9 million and very strong net growth of $57.4 million. The Circle Medical deferrals attributed $35.2 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q3 2025 was $59.9 million, a 296% increase, which was due to $35.2 million from the Circle Medical deferrals and $8.2 million from [ growth ]. HEALWELL's contribution to adjusted EBITDA was small at $1.4 million.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect a positive contribution of approximately $16 million from the Circle Medical deferred revenue and approximately $18 million contributions in the first half of 2026 and negligible thereafter.\nOn a year-to-date basis, in Q3, we achieved revenues of over $1 billion as compared to revenues of $685 million last year, reflecting growth of 48%. Year-to-date EBITDA for the 9 months of 2025 was $137 million, which was 172% higher than the previous year.\nNow on to quarterly adjusted net income. Overall, our Q3 2025 results reflect continued profitability in the business. WELL reported record adjusted net income of $41 million or $0.16 per share in Q3 2025 compared to adjusted net income of $4.1 million or $0.02 per share in Q3 of last year.\nDuring the quarter, the net impact of Circle Medical deferrals was $17.7 million. HEALWELL's contribution was a negative impact of $1.9 million to adjusted net income, while we had a one-time gain of $8 million from the divestment of a clinical asset in CLH, resulting in net growth of $13.1 million to the record adjusted net income. This growth represents a significant improvement in profitability over the past year.\nWELL achieved adjusted free cash flow attributable to shareholders of $15.1 million in Q3 2025, a slight decrease from $16.1 million in Q3 of last year.\nFree cash flow was positively impacted by $4.8 million increase in adjusted shareholder EBITDA, but however, this was offset by taxes, interest and capital expenditures and a small negative cash flow at HEALWELL.\nDuring the quarter, we had higher quarterly cash taxes compared to last year due to the higher profitability for the company. And capital expenditures were also greater than normal due to investments in new equipment and clinical facilities to drive new revenue, especially related to our executive health and longevity clinics.\nOne thing to note, including proceeds from divestment in our free cash flow attributable to shareholders, our actual cash flow in the quarter was $30.2 million, including the cash of $15.1 million from the divestment of the CLH assets.\nNow turning into our balance sheet as of September 30, 2025. WELL ended Q3 2025 with a solid balance sheet, holding cash and cash equivalents of $82.5 million. We remain in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related to our 2 credit lines at WELL: JPMorgan in the U.S.; and Royal Bank in Canada.\nThe outstanding debt from these credit lines was approximately CAD 347 million as of September 30, 2025. This doesn't include HEALWELL's credit line with the Bank of Nova Scotia, which is also in good standing with outstanding debt of $49 million as of the end of September 2025.\nWe resumed our normal course issuer bid or NCIB in the second quarter. Year-to-date, as of November 5, 2025, the company has bought back approximately 297,000 shares in 2025. We are expecting to continue with our share buyback program for the remainder of the year as permitted.\nI'm pleased to report that we have the cash and available resources to continue to fund our organic and inorganic growth program. This is true for Canadian clinics and WELLSTAR, where the majority of our M&A pipeline is focused on.\nThat concludes my financial update, and I will now turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. With the record results achieved in Q3 of 2025 and the size of our M&A pipeline under LOI, I'm very excited and confident about our outlook for the balance of the year and into 2026.\nIn the fourth quarter, we believe shareholders can expect to see us continue to achieve new levels in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income. As for guidance, we are reaffirming our prior guidance, which was as follows. Our 2025 annual guidance for revenues to be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion, representing 52% to 58% annual growth as compared to 2024. Furthermore, we reaffirm our guidance for annual adjusted EBITDA to be in the upper half of our previously provided guidance of $190 million to $210 million.\nExcluding the impact of Circle Medical deferrals, the company's annual revenue guidance would be between $1.36 billion and $1.41 billion. And excluding the impact of those deferrals, our guidance for annual adjusted EBITDA would be in the range of between $150 million and $170 million.\nOur present guidance for the balance of the year is sensitive to a number of factors, including the timing of additional M&A and/or divestitures, which may cause these figures to slightly change or be reissued or updated accordingly. For example, if we have a significant divestiture that may require us to discontinue that revenue line item, which would obviously change our financial results, and we would update accordingly.\nOur longer-term view of the Canadian clinic market remains very bullish. For WELL Canada, which includes Canadian clinics and WELLSTAR, we are targeting to be over $800 million in revenue and over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA within 18 months.\nWe remain resolutely committed to the sale processes of all of our U.S. assets, including WISP, Circle and CRH, as discussed earlier. Our objective continues to be to, again, announce at least one of these transactions that unlocks value by the end of the year. Note that we did have a small divestiture within CRH, but of course, we are in process with all of CRH as well.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with the strength and fundamentals of our business and look forward to delivering strong results in 2025 and beyond.\nThematically speaking, WELL management is very much focused on streamlining, integrating and unlocking value from its parts to achieve optimal shareholder value. WELL's growth engine has never been stronger. Our organic growth continues to be strong, especially in Canada, where we are executing on an extremely healthy M&A pipeline. We have a strong balance sheet and are well positioned to improve shareholder value.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our Board of Directors, WELL's senior management team as well as the senior teams at WELL Clinics, WELLSTAR, HEALWELL and CYBERWELL and all of our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort and support.\nIn particular, I'd like to thank our team of health care practitioners and other frontline workers who provide outstanding patient care every day. They're the true heroes of the health care ecosystem, and we're grateful to have an opportunity to serve them. It brings meaning to everything that we do. I also want to thank you all for joining us today on this call and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support as well as the valued analysts that help tell these important stories and shed light on our performances. We appreciate everyone's support.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be pleased to answer some questions."

Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Joanna, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI'll now turn the call over to Tyler Baba, Investor Relations Manager. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Fiscal Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for the first 3 months -- for the 3 months ended June 30, 2025. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call other than historical performance include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control, that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis.\nWe provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in our -- in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We appreciate everyone for joining us today as we discuss our Q2 2025 financial results.\nWe are extremely proud to deliver what we feel may be our best financials ever to our shareholders. There is much to talk about on today's call as it relates to numbers and performance, especially given the fact that quarterly revenues reached an annualized figure of approximately $1.4 billion. But before we do that, we wanted to profile the evolution of the company for shareholders.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we're working on strategic alternatives and divestiture processes for all 3 of our U.S. care delivery divisions, and we'd be pleased to provide more updates later in the call on this.\nThis WELL family tree slide provides a view of our corporate family once those processes have been completed. WELL Health Technologies provides exposure to 4 pure-play digital health markets and segments.\nOur largest division by revenues is our Canadian Clinics network, which is focused purely on tech-enabled health care delivery. This includes our primary specialized and diagnostic imaging businesses, which are the largest and most scaled in the country.\nThen you have WELLSTAR, which is our pure-play SaaS and services company focused on technologies that support the care provider. And then we have HEALWELL AI, which yesterday reported record financial results and advised the market of the Board's decision to immediately become a pure-play AI data science and health care software company by divesting all non-SaaS and digital businesses.\nFinally, we have CYBERWELL, our pure-play data protection and cybersecurity business, which works extremely hard and confidently to protect a significant portion of health care data in Canada and beyond and which is in an exciting ramp-up stage in its revenue and development, and we believe will be an excellent spinout candidate in a few years.\nShareholders of the parent company, WELL Health, will benefit from the consolidated financial statements and enterprise value of all these pure-play areas. We also note to investors that any capital raised by WELLSTAR or HEALWELL will not be dilutive to WELL shareholders. This structure is very capital efficient for WELL shareholders who benefit from WELL's ownership in these key segments.\nMoving on. In Q2 2025, WELL delivered another record performance, and it's safe to say that we really shattered records and delivered our best performances ever really across the board this quarter. This slide shows some of our key quarterly financial highlights. WELL achieved quarterly revenues of $356.7 million in Q2, an increase of 57% year-over-year, driven by total enterprise-wide organic growth of 19% and acquisitions.\nWELL achieved adjusted EBITDA of $49.7 million in Q2 2025, an increase of 231% year-over-year. And excluding the impact of Circle Medical deferred revenues, Q2 would have been a little bit less at $347 million, representing 53% growth, while adjusted EBITDA would have been $40 million, representing 166% increase compared to the previous year.\nImportantly, WELL's consolidated gross margin was 44.5% in the quarter. Even without the Circle Medical deferred revenue impact, gross margins would have been 43%, which are higher than last year and last quarter.\nFree cash flow attributable to shareholders was approximately $11.7 million in Q2 2025, an increase of 35% -- 34% as compared to $8.7 million last year. Please note that our free cash flow available to shareholders metric was impacted by elevated cash taxes and capital expenditures, which were focused on investments in upgrading our clinical portfolio. Had we had not had these elevated expenditures, we would have had record cash flow as well.\nMoving on. Before we get into the operational highlights, I want to just share with you an illustrative case in which we look at the performance of just WELL Canada and CRH. In this case, we excluded HEALWELL as Q2 is the first time we're including HEALWELL in our consolidated financials, and HEALWELL does not factor into our historic results. We also excluded Circle Medical and its deferred revenue as well as Wisp from this analysis as both of these assets have been in process of divestment the longest.\nThe objective of this illustrative view is to demonstrate a clear year-over-year comparison and margin profile and helps illustrate the strong underlying performance of the rest of the business. So as you can see, quarterly revenue in Q2 in this illustrative case for WELL Canada and CRH was $254 million, an increase of 36% year-over-year as compared to Q2 2024 and organic growth of 20%. Gross profit in Q2 was $98.1 million, an increase of 37% year-over-year as compared to Q2 2024. WELL achieved 49% gross margin percentage in Canada and 28% gross margin percentage in CRH.\nQuarterly adjusted EBITDA in Q2 for WELL Canada and CRH was $38.4 million, a 40% increase as compared to Q2 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin percentage was very healthy at 15.1%. This strong EBITDA margin is reflective of a healthy and profitable core business.\nLooking at just WELL Canada, we achieved revenue of $131.4 million, representing total growth of 40% and 25% organic growth. Meanwhile, WELL Canada achieved adjusted EBITDA of $23 million, an outstanding 76% year-over-year improvement.\nAs you can see, the core business remains not only in excellent health, but also growing with exceptional growth rates. These results, in particular, highlight the strength of our Canadian business, which is a core focus of the company moving forward.\nAnd now I'll share with you some of our operational highlights for Q2 2025. At the end of Q2, WELL had 4,300 providers and clinicians delivering care across our network of physical and virtual clinics. Of that number, we now have just over 1,000 physicians in Canada, which is just over 1% of all physicians practicing in the country. We have tremendous runway to continue to expand our footprint across Canada.\nIn addition, over 42,000 health care providers across the country, the majority of which are physicians, benefit from our SaaS and technology services provided by WELLSTAR. We estimate that more than 40% of all physicians in Canada engage with the WELLSTAR technology platform in some capacity. As we continue to expand our digital capabilities and deliver best-in-class AI-powered solutions, it's clear that WELL is playing an increasingly vital role in Canada's healthcare ecosystem. We remain committed to driving innovation and making a meaningful positive impact on the future of care in this country.\nLooking at our patient visits, which are a strong indicator of the health of our business and of revenue growth, we delivered 1.6 million patient visits in Q2, a 21% year-over-year increase from the prior year, with strong organic growth of 14%. These results demonstrate our strong fundamentals and unique platform, which is winning in the marketplace.\nCanadian patient visits reached a major milestone surpassing 1 million patient visits in a single quarter for the first time. Total patient visits increased 38% year-over-year, including organic growth of 12%, accounting for both clinic absorptions and same clinic expansion.\nTotal care interactions, which is defined as total patient visits plus technology interactions plus biller provider hours, were over 2.5 million in Q2, which represented a 34% increase compared to last year and represented 27% organic growth.\nNow that we've covered off the key results, I'd like to go over a few key presentation themes that we'll be covering in the rest of the presentation. These won't surprise you. One, Canadian Clinics update; two, WELLSTAR; three, HEALWELL AI; and fourth, we'll provide an update on our strategic alternative processes for our U.S. assets.\nThe first thing I'd like to address this morning is the success of our Canadian business. As you can see from these charts, the historical performance of our Canadian Clinics business has been exceptionally strong. Over the past 4 years, our Canadian Clinics business has exceeded 50% CAGR. During the 6 months ended June 30, 2025, Canadian Clinics achieved revenue of $214 million and adjusted EBITDA attributable to our Canadian Clinics business has grown at a CAGR of over 44%. During the 6 months ended June 30, Canadian Clinics achieved adjusted EBITDA of $32 million.\nOur Canadian Clinics network has grown to 222 clinics at the end of Q2 compared to 128 starting Q1 2022. We expect this strong performance will continue in 2025 and beyond, driven by healthy organic growth and our very significant M&A pipeline.\nAs I mentioned on our call -- on our last call, we have a really special capital allocation program at WELL that we've worked very hard to improve over the years. Here, we've included and updated the same slide we showed at our last conference call that speaks to all of our clinical acquisitions since inception.\nNote that on this slide you can see our clinical acquisitions grouped into cohorts by year of acquisition. For each cohort, we provided the EBITDA multiple associated with our original acquisition of these clinics shown in the dark blue color. And then we also show [Audio Gap] the resulting or improved implied EBITDA multiple that we've achieved for each of these cohorts since then due to the improvements we've made over time. This is shown in the light blue color.\nOn the right-hand side of the slide, we provided total figures -- total comprehensive figures, not cherry-picking, not excluding anything. As you can see, we've allocated $280.7 million overall in 31 separate transactions, and we have acquired $273 million in revenues.\nOur total deal multiple for all acquisitions was 9.4x EBITDA at the time of acquisition. Since then, we've grown the EBITDA of our acquired assets by 101%, re-rating the implied multiple to 4.7x, which was pushed up by our largest Canadian acquisition to date, which was MyHealth.\nInterestingly, if one takes out MyHealth, which was our single largest and most expensive acquisition in Canada, the remaining portfolio would be almost entirely primary care oriented. In this population, the average original multiple that we transacted against was 5.8x EBITDA. But given that we've substantially improved the EBITDA for these businesses, the implied multiple after improvements currently is just at 3x EBITDA.\nI'll point out a couple of other observations here. WELL achieved 101% adjusted EBITDA growth across all cohorts, demonstrating our ability to improve the efficiency and operating margins after we acquire a clinic.\nNote that in 2021, we had our highest original deal multiple of 10.5, which again was our acquisition of the MyHealth platform. Since then, we've significantly improved the EBITDA of MyHealth and the implied multiple of that cohort is now closer to 5.1x.\nWe hope you agree that this is a very clear demonstration of the power of our platform. True value creation is one -- when one can repeatedly deliver above-average returns over time consistently. We've been able to demonstrate steady performance over a significant period of time where we have methodically delivered great returns. And this is due to the great work of our clinic transformation teams and the people on the ground and our [ technologists ] who provide incredible tools.\nWe continue to find ways to convey -- we will continue to find ways to convey the results of our capital allocation program to shareholders and demonstrate strong accountability and discipline in carrying out this program.\nMoving on. Our Canadian Clinics business continued its strong growth trajectory in Q2 2025. Patient visits in Canadian Clinics totaled 1.1 million in the second fiscal quarter. our first quarter with 1 million patient visits and up 38% from 766,000 in Q2 2024, demonstrating a significant increase in patient volume and engagement.\nThe number of billable providers within this network reached 1,935 in Q2, up 13% from 1,706 in Q2 2024, highlighting the growing magnitude of our scale.\nIn Q2 '25, our patients per billable provider was 548 compared to 449 in the prior year, representing an increase of 22%. With patient visits growing faster than the number of billable providers in WELL's Canadian Clinic network, we are demonstrating increasing efficiency in our clinics, resulting in an increase in the number of patients per billable provider. While there are many factors that contribute to this improvement, we believe improved tooling and technology provided by WELLSTAR and sourced from HEALWELL AI to be one of those key reasons.\nOur platform allows providers to spend more time seeing patients and not to have to worry about the overhead tasks or managing a clinic or spending hours on charting patient records. This shows that our business model is working, and we are successful in helping the most important constituent in our business, the health care provider.\nNow looking at our Canadian business, including Canadian Clinics, WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL, our WELL Canada business is experiencing accelerating growth as you can see from both of these graphs. In Q2 '25, Canadian clinics generated $131 million compared to $93.6 million in the prior year, an increase of 40% as compared to the prior year's growth of 39%, thus the acceleration. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA for our Canadian Clinics business reached $23 million in Q2 '25, up from $13 million in Q2 '24, representing an increase of 76% as compared to the prior year growth of 19%.\nThat is a good segue to this new slide, which shows our very steady history of improving EBITDA growth -- adjusted EBITDA growth in Canada, which is comprised of Canadian Clinics, WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL. Note that just last quarter, we indicated that it was our goal to reach $100 million in adjusted EBITDA on a run rate basis by the end of 2026, inclusive of organic and inorganic growth.\nNote that we are now targeting to reach this milestone by mid-2026, which would be at least 2 quarters earlier. We believe it may be possible for us to pull this schedule even further as we continue to accelerate and improve our business. Stay tuned next quarter for an update on this.\nNote that in 2025, we're expecting our adjusted EBITDA in Canada to experience over 25% growth, inclusive of both organic and inorganic growth. We see this target as entirely within reach and are fully committed to making it a reality.\nTurning our attention to the Canadian clinic market. WELL is the largest network of outpatient clinics in the country. To put that in perspective, in Canada, there are roughly 290 million patient visits each year and WELL Canadian Clinics current run rate accounts for approximately 4.1 million of those visits.\nWELL still represents only about 1.6% of the total Canadian patient visits nationwide. This small market share highlights the significant growth opportunity ahead of us. Even as the market leader, we have substantial runway to expand both our clinic count and our patient base. On the right-hand side here, you can see how our clinical footprint is larger than the next 5 Canadian clinic peers combined.\nThe takeaway here is clear. There is a large and fragmented market in front of us with thousands of clinics and hundreds of millions of patient visits, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to capture a more significant portion of market share over time.\nIn Q2 2025, we continue to execute on our strategic growth plan through the expansion of our clinic network. We acquired 3 clinics generating $8 million in annual revenue. Our owned and operated clinic network welcomed 45 new providers in the second quarter, further strengthening our capacity.\nWhile Q2 activity was technically lower compared to Q1, several transactions we have been working on, closed just after the end of the quarter, at the beginning of Q3. As you can see here, thus far in Q3, we've already acquired 4 clinics adding more than $15 million in revenue and welcoming 70 new providers to our network.\nWith a diversified clinic strategy, a growing physician base and a scalable expansion model, we are well positioned to drive long-term growth and operational efficiency.\nOn this slide, we highlight our M&A pipeline. As you can see, we have a very healthy pipeline of clinic acquisition opportunities, which we believe is directly correlated with the challenges doctors are feeling in the marketplace and WELL's growing brand recognition.\nWe continue to focus on Canadian -- acquiring Canadian clinics under both our absorption model and our acquisition model. As a reminder, under the absorption model, we're usually acquiring clinics with lower operating margins for nominal consideration. Meanwhile, under the acquisition model, we're acquiring more profitable clinics that can typically be acquired for approximately 3 to 4 to 5x multiple.\nOur current pipeline of Canadian clinic acquisition opportunities is very active. In Canadian Clinics, we currently have 7 signed LOIs, representing 25 clinics and approximately $48 million in annual revenue. This is an improvement from our prior call in May where we had 10 clinics with $44 million in annual revenue under LOI.\nIn total, across the organization, including Canadian Clinics, WELLSTAR, WELL USA and HEALWELL, we have a total of 15 signed LOIs, representing $134 million in annualized revenue. We're expecting to execute on this pipeline of signed LOIs in a non-dilutive manner to current operating margins.\nWe also have a very large pipeline of target acquisitions that are in the pre-LOI stage. We have more than 35 targets engaged, representing about $440 million in annual revenue and more than 110 clinics represented.\nNow let's talk about the long-term vision for WELL's Canadian clinic market share. Looking forward, our target is ambitious, but highly achievable. We see a path to 1,400-plus clinics delivering $4.5 billion plus in revenue and $650 million in EBITDA. We estimate this represents more than 40 million patient visits each year, which is approximately capturing an 8% to 10% of the market share with growth implied within that.\nWe have a scalable acquisition engine already in place, supported by a robust clinic pipeline that can drive accelerated expansion in the near term. Our dedicated transformation team, combined with AI-driven acquisition and integration workflows enables us to significantly shorten timelines and enhance efficiency. This is backed by a proven track record of optimizing hundreds of clinics across Canada.\nFrom a unit economics perspective, incremental clinics are highly accretive, delivering strong returns on incremental capital invested, which in turn raises our long-term ROIC. We monitor payback periods closely and focus on the speed at which each acquisition begins contributing EBITDA, and the results so far give us confidence in our ability to hit these targets.\nThe second theme I'd like to talk about is WELLSTAR. As a reminder, WELLSTAR is a WELL subsidiary, which we intend to spin out as a publicly listed high-growth, profitable pure-play SaaS or Software-as-a-Service healthcare technology company, which would still be majority owned by WELL.\nWELLSTAR is a technology platform that powers WELL's own clinical ecosystem in addition to serving thousands of clinics and doctors outside of WELL's owned clinics who purchase WELLSTAR's solutions. In fact, 95% of WELLSTAR's revenue comes from external customers.\nWELLSTAR is dedicated to empowering healthcare providers with innovative solutions that enhance patient care and optimize operational efficiency. WELLSTAR is laser-focused on addressing the diverse needs of healthcare providers by streamlining care delivery, integrating fragmented care systems, reducing provider burnout and improving patient experiences and outcomes.\nAs noted before, over 40% of all providers in the country use at least one product from WELLSTAR. We believe WELLSTAR will be a very strong IPO candidate on the TSX main board sometime as early as Q4 of this year, depending on market conditions. Our plan is to build additional scale before going forward with the go public initiative by completing additional acquisitions and enhancing our organic growth. This will position WELLSTAR towards achieving more than $100 million in annualized revenue on a run rate basis.\nWe can't predict how the capital markets environment will be in the future, but our plan is to be ready for any market opportunity that may appear in late 2025 or early 2026.\nAs well as a majority voting shareholder of WELLSTAR, we expect to continue consolidating WELLSTAR's financial results into WELL in accordance with IFRS accounting rules, even after WELLSTAR is its own public company with its own listing.\nNow let's look at WELLSTAR's financial performance. We're pleased to report that WELLSTAR delivered another exceptional quarter, generating revenue of $16.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $4.4 million. This reflects approximately 15% organic growth and adjusted EBITDA margins of 26% on a pre-shared services basis.\nWELLSTAR is operating on a rule of 40 or better -- operating as a Rule of 40 or better business. WELLSTAR achieved annualized recurring revenue or ARR of $53 million in Q2, an increase of 51% compared to Q2 of last year.\nWELLSTAR is already one of the most relevant and consequential companies in Canada's healthcare technology landscape and has firmly established itself as a de facto market leader in technology enabling clinicians across the country.\nWELLSTAR operates in 3 distinct segments. First is EMR or electronic medical records, where we serve approximately 16,000 providers working in over 3,700 clinics. Secondly is our Digital Health App segment. This includes apps.health marketplace and OceanMD as well as our suite of AI solutions, including Nexus AI, altogether reaching approximately 25,000 providers. And finally, the billing and practice management division that serves almost 14,000 practitioners working in over 1,500 clinics.\nI want to zoom in on OceanMD now. Just a reminder, OceanMD is the Canadian leader in patient engagement tools and e-referrals. OceanMD is trusted by over 49,000 providers and clinic staff at over 5,600 clinics and hospitals across Canada. Ocean's patient engagement tools are the most used across the country with over 3 million online appointment bookings annually and 36 million annualized automated reminders sent to patients.\nOcean's e-referral platform facilitates over 1.7 million annual e-referrals and growing rapidly. Ocean is active in 9 provinces across Canada and is winning larger contracts all the time. We look forward to telling you more about Ocean's recent wins in the coming weeks. They are very exciting.\nThe third theme I'd like to talk about is HEALWELL AI. We are very pleased with the progress at HEALWELL, a company that we had a central and foundational role in conceiving and developing after we acquired its MCI clinics in October 2023. We took on a major leadership role in capitalizing and relaunching the company and shaping its fundraising and M&A journey along with the management team.\nWe're also very pleased to report our first quarter with the inclusion of HEALWELL AI, a company that, again, we helped incubate 2 years ago, in which we took a majority voting control position just this past April.\nAs a reminder, HEALWELL AI is a global data science and AI leader, serving 70 of the largest health systems here in Canada and globally in 11 countries, including customers such as the NHS in the U.K., the governments of France, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and UAE, New Zealand, Australia and health systems in the United States as well.\nHEALWELL's Q2 '25 financial results revealed a truly transformational quarter for the company where HEALWELL achieved quarterly revenue from continuing operations of $40.5 million, 645% higher than the $5.4 million generated in Q2 of '24. Revenue growth in the quarter was largely driven by the Orion acquisition, resulting in a record 1,064% year-over-year increase in the company's healthcare software business compared to Q2 of '24. The company also had excellent growth in its all-important AI division.\nDuring Q2 '25, HEALWELL reported positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.7 million in the prior year. This marks the company's first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA, reflecting strong operating fundamentals and accelerating business momentum.\nYesterday, HEALWELL announced that it is seeking strategic alternatives for the company's clinical research and patient services business units and has signed a number of nonbinding LOIs to investigate this effort with the goal to become a pure-play digital SaaS and services company, with a focus on enterprise-grade data science and AI offerings.\nThis is a major strategic initiative by HEALWELL. By divesting of its clinical research and patient services businesses, HEALWELL envisions becoming a pure-play enterprise-grade provider of high-margin AI data science and SaaS software services to some of the largest health systems globally. And we are very excited about their ability to connect, surface and analyze complex healthcare [ arena ].\nThe fourth theme I'd like to talk about is our current strategic review of our U.S. assets. We are limited in what we can obviously say about these strategic review processes with our U.S. assets until they come to terms with binding commitments, but I will try to give you some high-level color as we are making progress.\nWe remain committed to our strategy of divesting the company's U.S. care delivery assets, including Wisp, Circle Medical and CRH. We believe these divestments could result in significant cash benefit for WELL. Our strategy would be to redeploy this capital into our Canadian clinic footprint, where we have significant leadership advantage and exceptional growth potential.\nRecently, over the last few months, when we started to see the capital markets improve and get back to record levels, we have also witnessed increasing levels of interest and activity in these assets, frankly, at levels that we've never experienced before since we started the initial processes over 1 year ago.\nCurrently, we have multiple advanced conversations occurring across these assets, and our objective is to announce at least one divestment by the end of the year.\nWe'd also like to take note that although we are exiting our patient care and digital delivery businesses in the United States, including Wisp, Circle and CRH, our technology-focused subsidiaries such as HEALWELL, WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL will continue to serve customers in the U.S. and around the globe with their SaaS and services offerings. In fact, we believe the U.S. to be an excellent growth market for SaaS and services, and we are less interested in the U.S. for care delivery businesses, and that is why we are executing on these divestiture processes.\nAnd now a quick word on Wisp. Wisp continues to demonstrate strong business fundamentals with consistent revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Wisp had a very strong Q2 with quarterly revenue of $28 million, an increase of 15% from Q2 of last year, and it achieved positive adjusted EBITDA of $866,000 in the quarter.\nThis performance reinforces the Board's conviction in Wisp's long-term value potential as we navigate our sales processes. We're expecting Wisp to have solid performance in the back half of 2025 and remind investors that Wisp has typically performed better in the second half of the year than the first due to some seasonality in the business.\nAnd a few words about Circle Medical. Last year, we were just getting started on executing on our strategic alternatives process for Circle, and then we had to slow down this process due to the regulatory inquiry, year-end audit and reclassification of deferred revenue, which we are now in the process of recognizing.\nSince we've already discussed the impact of Circle Medical and its deferred revenues extensively in this report and our financial statements, we won't get into the numbers here. We continue to be focused on improving our compliance program and clearing our regulatory review process and look forward to continuing to report on this matter in the next earnings event.\nAnd finally, CRH and provider staffing. In addition, we have now initiated a strategic review process for our CRH and provider staffing businesses, as we indicated last call. We're still early in the process, and we'll provide updates as we are able to. The combined CRH Anesthesia and Staffing business has been performing very well, having generated revenue of $122.8 million in the quarter compared to $93.3 million in Q2 of last year, an improvement of 32% year-over-year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the combined Anesthesia and Staffing was $24 million in Q2 compared to $19.6 million in Q2 of last year, an improvement of 22%. These results are indicative of the growth and strong profitability of these 2 assets.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials for Q2 2025. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $356.7 million in Q2 2025, marking a 57% increase compared to $227.3 million generated in Q2 2024. This growth was driven by strong organic expansion and recent acquisitions with HEALWELL contributing $40.5 million to the quarter's results.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q2 2025 was $49.7 million, a 231% increase compared to $15 million in Q2 of last year. The strong growth in adjusted EBITDA demonstrates the underlying strength of our operations and solid financial position with the fundamentals of our business continuing to improve as we move forward.\nThis was the first quarter that we consolidated HEALWELL into our financials. As you can see in the slide, HEALWELL had a positive impact of $40.5 million to revenue and added $2.2 million to adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter.\nExcluding the impact of Circle Medical's deferred revenue, Q2 2025 revenue would have been $347 million, while adjusted EBITDA would have been $40 million in Q2. Notwithstanding Circle Medical's own results, which has seen a year-over-year decrease due to the focus on compliance, we expect Circle Medical's deferred revenue will continue to make a positive contribution to adjusted EBITDA in Q3 and Q4, with the impact significantly declining in the second half of next year.\nNow on to our quarterly adjusted net income. Overall, our Q2 2025 results reflect a solid first half of the year. WELL reported record adjusted net income of $25.8 million or $0.10 per share in Q2 2025 compared to adjusted net income of $4.1 million or $0.02 per share last year.\nDuring the quarter, HEALWELL contributed $4.8 million to adjusted net income, while the net impact of Circle Medical deferrals contributed $2.8 million. Excluding the impacts from Circle Medical revenue deferrals and the inclusion of HEALWELL, the company improved its adjusted net income by $14 million compared to Q2 of last year, representing a significant improvement in profitability over the past year.\nWe achieved record free cash flow in Q2 2025. Adjusted free cash flow attributable to shareholders was $11.7 million in Q2 2025, an increase of 34% from $8.7 million in Q2 of last year. This increase was largely attributed to increase in shareholder EBITDA, which was offset by taxes, interest and capital expenditures.\nIn Q2 2025, we had high quarterly cash taxes for the company. Capital expenditures were also greater than normal due to investments in new equipment and clinical facilities to drive new revenue, especially related to our executive health clinics. Note also that Circle and Wisp combined had a negative incremental impact of $2.1 million to free cash flow.\nTurning to our balance sheet as of June 30, 2025. WELL ended Q2 2025 with a solid balance sheet, holding cash and cash equivalents of $98.9 million. We remain in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related to our 2 credit lines: JPMorgan in the U.S.; and Royal Bank in Canada. The outstanding debt from these credit lines was approximately CAD 253.2 million as of June 30, 2025.\nOrion Health, a wholly owned subsidiary of HEALWELL, entered into a new credit facility with the Bank of Nova Scotia in Q1 2025 with an outstanding debt balance of $44.3 million as of June 30, 2025.\nOur balance sheet continues to be strong, and we are confident that we will continue to see strong free cash flow generation in 2025. We've also resumed our normal-course issuer bid or NCIB in the second quarter. Year-to-date, as of August 13, 2025, the company has bought back approximately 175,000 shares in 2025, and we are expecting to continue with our share buyback program in the second half of the year as permitted.\nI'm pleased to report that we have the cash and available resources to continue to fund our M&A program. This is true for Canadian Clinics and WELLSTAR where the majority of our M&A pipeline is focused on.\nThat concludes my financial update, and I will now turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. I'm very excited and confident about our outlook for the balance of the year and into 2026. For the balance of the year, we believe shareholders can expect to see us continue to achieve new levels in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income as well as cash flow until divestments take place, at which time we will reissue updated outlook and guidance figures.\nAs for the current guidance, we are reaffirming and slightly updating and upgrading. I will explain. We're pleased to reaffirm our 2025 annual guidance for revenue to between $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, representing 52% to 58% annual growth as compared to 2024. Excluding the impact of the Circle Medical deferrals, the company's annual revenue guidance would be $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion. This annual revenue guidance only includes announced acquisitions. However, WELL expects to be in the upper half of this guidance range with the inclusion of planned acquisitions in the second year -- half of the year.\nFurthermore, we're pleased to increase our guidance for annual adjusted EBITDA to be in the upper half of the previously provided guidance of $190 million to $210 million, so an improvement of approximately $10 million.\nExcluding the impact of Circle Medical deferrals, we are similarly improving our guidance for annual adjusted EBITDA to be in the upper half of our previously provided guidance of $140 million to $160 million, again, roughly a $10 million improvement. This improvement of the company's annual adjusted EBITDA guidance only includes announced acquisitions.\nWhile the improvement in revenue guidance is with additional M&A, our improvement in adjusted EBITDA guidance does not require any additional acquisitions, which, of course, is highly likely to occur. So this shows the improving profitability profile and margins for the company.\nSecond quarter was a milestone quarter as we included HEALWELL's financial results for the first time, and it was an exceptional quarter for HEALWELL where it surpassed the $40 million revenue milestone and achieved positive adjusted EBITDA. Our Canadian Clinic business, including Canadian Clinics and WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL, is outperforming, and we have many tailwinds in the health care market, including the Buy Canadian sentiment from federal and provincial governments that we expect will activate over time. We're expecting WELL Canada's adjusted EBITDA to grow by at least 25% this year, inclusive of acquisitions.\nOur longer term view of the Canadian market remains bullish. As we indicated last quarter, we're still targeting inclusive of Canadian Clinics and WELLSTAR to be over $800 million in revenue within 2 years, and we are ahead of plan with the company's expectation to be over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA by mid-2026 instead of the end of 2026, which is what we said last quarter on our call.\nWe are the market leader in Canada with the largest owned and operated clinic network, and we expect we will experience substantial growth and profitability improvement in the coming years as we continue to pursue our long-term market share goal of 10%. In addition, WELLSTAR is the health care technology leader in Canada, whose growth will only accelerate as a publicly traded company.\nAs noted earlier, we remain committed to the sale processes of our U.S. digital assets as well as CRH, and our objective is to deliver at least one transaction that unlocks value by the end of the year in this portfolio.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with the strengthening fundamentals of our business and look forward to delivering strong results in 2025 and beyond. WELL's growth engine has never been stronger. Our organic growth is operating at its optimal level while we are executing on an extremely healthy M&A pipeline. We have a strong balance sheet and are well positioned to improve shareholder value.\nWe have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can execute on our objectives. And in line with that, I would like to thank WELL's senior management team as well as the senior teams at WELL Clinics, WELLSTAR, HEALWELL and CYBERWELL and all our employees and contractors and of course, our Board of Directors, for their tremendous effort and support. In particular, I would also like to thank our team of healthcare practitioners and our other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care. They are the true heroes of the healthcare ecosystem, and we are grateful to have an opportunity to serve them.\nI would like to thank you all for joining us today on this call and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the resources and means and support to pursue our goals and not only deliver shareholder value, but provide positive societal impact.\nAnd with that, we would be open to questions. Operator, would you please open the line?"

First Quarter 2025 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Wednesday, May 14, 2025.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tyler Baba, Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's fiscal first quarter financial results conference call for the 3 months ended March 31, 2025. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO.\nI trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today. Portions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information.\nThese forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis.\nWe provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use the terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures.\nFor more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definitions set out in today's press release and in our management's discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We appreciate everyone for joining us today as we discuss our Q1 2025 financial results.\nI'd like to do something a bit different on today's call. Instead of starting with our financials, I'd like to talk a little bit about our overall vision for WELL Health and where we are headed in the next few years and create clarity around markets we will be serving in the future.\nThis diagram shows the current state of the WELL family, which includes all our operating divisions. We've previously provided clarity on the fact that we are in the process of divesting of both Circle Medical and Wisp.\nAnd I will speak more later on the call about that. But I'd like to provide some additional clarity on this call that in the next 1 to 2 years, it is now our expectation that we will no longer be operating any care delivery businesses in the United States, inclusive of CRH and provider staffing.\nWhile we are very proud of the progress we've made in the United States with these businesses and we've been very fortunate to work with some great teams and leaders and build significant value, we believe the time is right to unlock the value of these assets and use the freed-up capital to accelerate the compounding story we have activated in Canada, particularly in our WELL Clinics enterprise.\nWe also believe that this will further streamline and simplify not only our own overall operation, but also simplify our investor story. We will still be very much involved in providing or selling software and data protection services to the U.S. market through subsidiaries such as CYBERWELL, HEALWELL and of course, the business Orion Health has in the United States and likely WELLSTAR in the future.\nBut we believe that it is the right decision for us to consolidate our care delivery business into Canada, where we are seeing better returns on capital than the U.S. with less risk.\nWe also want to build on our leadership position as the largest owned and operated clinic network in Canada, the largest physician network in Canada and the most distributed technology platform supporting health care providers in Canada with WELLSTAR touching well north of 40% of all health care providers in the country. Simply put, we have tremendous network effects in Canada that we do not enjoy in the United States.\nAs far as timing of these events, I want to be clear that we will not be in a rush to do this. And this applies particularly to CRH as it is a significant source of revenue and free cash flow for the company.\nBut when we find the right opportunity, we will engage in a strategic transaction that allows us to redirect significant amounts of capital back into Canada to grow our network.\nNow let's zoom in on what the WELL family will look like in the future once the U.S. assets are divested of and our key areas of focus. We'll have 4 areas, which are growth engines of the company. These are: one, our Canadian clinics network, which provides tech-enabled health care, delivery and is the largest pan-Canadian health care provider in the country, spanning multiple disciplines and specialties. We have 100% ownership of the WELL clinics business.\nThe second, WELLSTAR, which is focused on providing technology solutions to health care providers. Our ownership of WELLSTAR is approximately at 85%. Third, HEALWELL, which is focused on AI and data science for health systems around the globe. Our current ownership of HEALWELL is approximately 30% economic ownership on a fully diluted basis and 69% ownership of the company's voting stock.\nAnd lastly, CYBERWELL, our data protection arm, which provides cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. Our current ownership of CYBERWELL is also in the 85% range. I'm proud to recognize that all 4 of these entities are growth businesses that are self-funded and cash flow positive.\nBoth WELLSTAR and HEALWELL will continue to work very closely with WELL and our clinical footprint in Canada, but they will also operate as independent companies that will have their own shareholders, capital allocation strategies, fundraising plans and acquisition opportunities.\nFor example, just last December, WELLSTAR recently raised $50 million in equity from marquee investors to power its pre-IPO growth plan. And HEALWELL also raised $100 million, which was comprised of $50 million in equity and $50 million in debt to support its acquisition of Orion Health.\nThese companies have access to capital and can activate this without causing a drain on WELL's resources. Our goal is to achieve over $1 billion in enterprise value for each of WELLSTAR and HEALWELL in the next 2 to 3 years.\nShareholders of the parent company, WELL Health, will benefit from the consolidated financial statements and enterprise value created. We also note to investors that any capital raised by WELLSTAR and HEALWELL will not be dilutive to WELL shareholders. This structure is very capital efficient for WELL shareholders who benefit from WELL's ownership in these entities. The emphasis is to drive returns and value to shareholders over the medium- to long-term.\nMoving forward, our central goal at WELL and for our capital allocation program will be the Canadian clinics network, which will continue to grow organically and inorganically to broaden scale, activate new levels of network effects as we look and feel a lot more like a pure-play in this area in the next 1 to 2 years.\nTo state the obvious, we are very bullish on Canada, not only due to our own strengths, but we also see significant tailwinds emerging in the Canadian market and we don't want distractions to deal with our important role in this market.\nWith over 220 clinics as the market share leader, we currently own approximately 1% of total clinics in Canada and our goal is to reach 10% market share, which would be equivalent to a larger than $5 billion per annum business just in Canada, as we are now essentially at a $0.5 billion revenue run rate just in Canada.\nAs for our plan moving forward, we intend on focusing on our growing market leadership in Canada with a laser-like focus on improving cash flow. We will grow cash flow.\nAnd if we feel our stock is undervalued, we will buy it with impunity and force a smaller denominator in the cash flow per share equation, driving improved shareholder value, which we believe will force investors to take notice over time.\nIf we believe our value is properly reflected, we will eventually create distributions that allow shareholders to share in the value of their business, all the while we will continue to create a business that drives immense positive societal value by creating more accessibility to care and supporting care providers such that they can deliver the best health outcomes possible.\nWith continued cash flow compounding, we can achieve superior returns for our shareholders. As such, I'm pleased to announce that we intend on resuming our stock buyback program shortly after reporting this quarter's results.\nNow this slide speaks to some of our key quarterly financial highlights for Q1 2025. WELL achieved record quarterly revenues of $294.1 million in Q1, an increase of 32% year-over-year, which was driven by organic growth and acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the Circle Medical deferred revenue, quarterly revenue would have been $300.7 million, exceeding a $1.2 billion revenue run rate.\nWELL achieved adjusted EBITDA of $27.6 million in Q1, an increase of 36% as compared to the restated Circle Medical adjusted EBITDA of Q1 2024. Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by a net of $6.5 million of deferred revenue adjustment from Circle Medical. Excluding the impact of the Circle Medical deferred revenue, quarterly adjusted EBITDA would have been $34.1 million.\nOur Canadian business continues its strong momentum with 32% year-over-year revenue growth to $120.6 million and 13.4% year-over-year organic growth. Our adjusted EBITDA in Canada grew 29% year-over-year to $18.7 million for the quarter.\nI'll now share with you some of the operational highlights for Q1 2025. As of the end of Q1 2025, WELL had over 4,300 providers and clinicians delivering care across our entire network of physical and virtual clinics.\nOf that number, I'm proud to announce that we now have over 1,000 physicians in Canada working within the WELL network, which is just over 1% of all physicians practicing in the country. We have a tremendous runway to continue to expand our footprint across Canada.\nIn addition, there are more than 42,000 providers benefiting from our SaaS and technology services, most of which are physicians. We estimate that well over 40% of all physicians in Canada touch our WELLSTAR technology platform in some way. As we enhance our digital offerings and provide leading AI products and services, we believe these figures will continue to rise.\nAnd within the short-term, we can see over 50% of all providers in the country coming into contact with WELLSTAR's platform. One can see the increasing importance, relevance and role that WELL is playing in the country's health care ecosystem and we are determined to continue to make a positive impact.\nLooking at our patient visits. Our revenues are generally underpinned by patient visits. As such, it's very important to track them closely as they are a true measure of the fundamentals of our business.\nWe delivered over 1.6 million patient visits in Q1, a 24% year-over-year increase from the prior year with strong organic growth of 14%.\nCanadian patient visit metrics continue to demonstrate that it is one of the most prominent growth drivers of the company as visits grew by 30% year-over-year with organic growth of 12%, inclusive of absorptions and same-clinic growth. U.S. patient visits grew by 16% year-over-year with all of it related to organic growth.\nTotal care interactions, which is defined as total patient visits plus technology interactions plus biller provider hours were 2.5 million in Q1, which was a 34% increase compared to last year and represented 27% organic growth.\nSo now that we've covered off the key results, I'd like to cover off a few topics in the rest of the presentation. These won't be a surprise. One, HEALWELL AI; two, WELLSTAR; three, Canadian clinics. And then fourth, we'll provide an update on the sales processes.\nFirst theme I'd like to talk about is HEALWELL AI. We're very pleased with the progress at HEALWELL AI, a company that we had a central role in conceiving and developing in the past couple of years after we acquired its MCI clinics and formed a pure-play AI software company.\nWe took a major leadership role in recapitalizing and relaunching the company 19 months ago and shaping its fundraising and M&A journey along with the management team.\nOver the last 19 months, HEALWELL has made 6 acquisitions, including Pentavere, Intrahealth, Verisource, Biopharma and most recently, Orion and of course [Nutrio]. HEALWELL has raised over $150 million in equity and debt financing during this period of time and WELL's net cash contribution was $5.4 million.\nThis net cash contribution included $8.6 million in cash and promissory notes that we received from the sale of Intrahealth to HEALWELL.\nThis is an outstanding capital allocation story in which we have been able to invest net cash of only $5.4 million to help create a global AI company that is majority controlled by WELL Health. HEALWELL has a -- currently has a market cap of approximately $0.5 billion on a fully diluted basis. HEALWELL is a Canadian capital markets success story and is now the second largest publicly listed health care tech company in Canada as measured by revenue and is second only to WELL Health.\nWe're very excited about the progress made at HEALWELL and its future. HEALWELL's robust client base reflects its ability to deliver unparalleled value to the health care ecosystem. As you can see in this chart, HEALWELL has been a tremendously successful investment for WELL Health and its shareholders.\nThe net amount invested in HEALWELL is $28.9 million based on the net cash invested then in equity value related to the sale of Intrahealth and the face value of the currently outstanding promissory note related to the sale of Intrahealth to HEALWELL.\nAs of yesterday's close, the current market value of our investment is $158.5 million, representing a $129 million gain or value created for WELL shareholders. This investment represents a 450% rate of return and 5.5x MOIC or multiple of invested capital.\nI'd now like to share some of my thoughts on HEALWELL's recent acquisition of Orion Health. With HEALWELL's recent acquisition of Orion completed on April 1, HEALWELL is building the world's leading company in health care data interoperability and artificial intelligence.\nHEALWELL's strategic acquisition of Orion Health significantly enhanced its market position, accelerating its path to profitability. Orion was generating approximately $100 million in annualized revenue run rate, mostly from SaaS with strong operating EBITDA margins.\nThe company's solutions are powered by approximately 400 global employees working out of 15 global offices in 11 countries. HEALWELL delivers cutting-edge software solutions to public and private sector customers globally.\nIts technology is deployed across 70-plus sites globally, supporting health care systems that collectively manage over 150 million patient records. In conjunction with the HEALWELL acquisition of Orion, WELL increased its holdings in HEALWELL to an approximate 30% fully diluted economic interest and an approximate 69% voting interest.\nAs a result, the company will begin to fully consolidate HEALWELL in its financial results starting in Q2 2025 as per IFRS control requirements. HEALWELL is expected to contribute approximately $120 million in revenue and positive adjusted EBITDA to WELL's fiscal 2025 consolidated financial results.\nOrion Health provides significant strategic benefits to HEALWELL and now WELL, which include: one, financial benefits such as Orion's strong recurring revenues with large enterprise public sector entities with healthy operating margins and high free cash flow conversion. Significant distribution opportunity for HEALWELL AI's offerings as well as WELLSTAR's best-in-class provider-focused tech and significant data science and data interoperability expertise.\nThe 4 public sector clients can use AI in any meaningful manner. Remember, they must get their data in order. They must get it -- their data normalized and organized and achieve interoperability. This is not an easy task and Orion is one of the best in the world at helping public sector health care groups organize their data, often beating out some of the largest companies in the world for these major initiatives.\nThe second theme I'd like to talk about is our strategic spinout of WELLSTAR. Last year, we created WELLSTAR, a WELL subsidiary that we intend to spin out as a publicly listed high-growth, profitable pure-play SaaS health care technology company, which would still be majority owned by WELL.\nAs a reminder, WELLSTAR is a technology platform that powers WELL's clinical ecosystem. WELLSTAR is dedicated to empowering health care providers with innovative solutions that enhance patient care and optimize operational efficiency.\nWELLSTAR is laser-focused on addressing the diverse needs of health care providers by streamlining care delivery, integrating fragmented health care systems, reducing provider burnout and improving patient experiences and outcomes.\nWe're pleased to report that WELLSTAR had another great quarter, clocking in organic growth of approximately 20% as well as adjusted EBITDA margins of 29% on a 4-wall basis, pulling in a Rule of 49 performance for the quarter.\nWELLSTAR is currently on a $70 million annual revenue run rate and generates 80% gross margins. WELLSTAR is already one of the most relevant and consequential companies in Canada's health care technology landscape and has firmly established itself as a de facto market leader in technology enabling clinicians across Canada.\nWe've already completed the first step in WELLSTAR's go-public plans, which was to add significant capital to WELLSTAR's balance sheet so it can execute on its acquisition plans. As such, during Q4, as I mentioned earlier, WELLSTAR closed a $50 million equity placement entirely supported by Mawer Investment Management, EdgePoint Wealth Management and PenderFund Capital Management, 3 very reputable firms with a strong track record of investing in Canadian technology companies.\nWELL and WELLSTAR management also participated in this financing to fund WELLSTAR's pre-spinout growth objectives. WELL did not issue any shares as part of this transaction. We believe WELLSTAR will be a very strong IPO candidate on the TSX main board sometime in late 2025 or early 2026.\nThere are 2 factors that dictate timing of our listing. One is company readiness and the second is market readiness. We've assembled a very strong team led by Amir Javedan as CEO and WELLSTAR has a compelling pipeline of target acquisition opportunities as our plan is to build additional scale by completing additional acquisitions that will position WELLSTAR towards $100 million in annualized revenue run rate before going public.\nThe second factor is market readiness, which we can't predict when that will be, but our plan is to be ready for any market opportunity that may appear in late 2025 or early 2026. As a majority voting shareholder, we fully expect to continue consolidating WELLSTAR's financial results into WELL in accordance with IFRS accounting rules even after WELLSTAR is its own public company and has its own listing.\nThe third theme I will address this morning is the success of our Canadian business. As you can see from these charts, the historical performance of our Canadian clinics business has been exceptionally strong. Canadian clinics achieved revenue of $319 million in 2024.\nOver the past 4 years, our Canadian clinics business has exceeded 50% compound annual growth. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to our Canadian clinic business has grown at a CAGR of 44% and achieved over $40 million in 2024.\nNote that we've had a great start to the year and we expect this strong performance to continue in 2025, driven by healthy organic growth and our significant large M&A pipeline.\nLook, we have a really special capital allocation program at WELL clinics happening and I feel that we have really under-told this story in the past few years.\nThis quarter, we really wanted to change that and provide some more significant data for investors to see how the program is trending. We've been very thoughtful about this and are pleased to share this new data with shareholders that provide some perspective on just how disciplined we have been in building Canada's largest clinical network and how our discipline has evolved, which is in great part encouraging us to be so bullish on the future, even to the extent that we would like to be fully focused on it and exit our successful U.S. care businesses.\nSo bear with me because there's a lot of data on this page, but the key elements are as follows: we've identified a number of cohorts of clinics purchased by time frame. And for each cohort, we provided the original blended multiple of EBITDA associated with our original purchase of these clinics. And then we showed the resulting or improved or implied multiple that we've achieved due to the improvements we've made to the EBITDA over time.\nSo for example, in our 2018 to 2020 cohort, we purchased those clinics on an average multiple to EBITDA of 6.3x and we have improved the EBITDA of those clinics substantially by 73%, which has now reduced our implied multiple to 3.6x.\nNote that in 2021, we had a higher original multiple. This is mainly because of our acquisition of the MyHealth platform, which carried a double digit multiple of EBITDA. Since then, we've significantly improved the EBITDA of MyHealth and the implied multiple of that large cohort is now closer to 7.1x.\nAs you can see, we've allocated $280.7 million overall in 31 separate transactions where we have acquired $273 million in revenues. Our average deal multiple over time was 9.4x EBITDA, which was pushed up by our largest Canadian acquisition to-date, which was MyHealth. Since then, we've grown the EBITDA of all our acquired assets by 73%, re-rating the implied multiple to 5.4x.\nInterestingly, if one takes out MyHealth, which was our most expensive acquisition in Canada, the average original multiple that we transacted against for our primary care business was 5.8x EBITDA. But given that we've improved the EBITDA for all these businesses by an average of 121%, the implied multiple after improvements currently is at just 2.9x EBITDA, dramatically improving the return on capital invested.\nI'll point out a couple of additional observations here. In 2023, our clinic acquisition program was mainly focused on MCI's clinics, which were not profitable at the time. So there was no multiple of EBITDA. As you're likely all aware, we've turned those clinics around and are now operating them profitably based on a 2.2x multiple of EBITDA based on our original purchase price.\nAnother key observation I'd like to share is our 2024 cohort. Note that the original multiples are now coming down and we are continuing to improve those multiples with time.\nThis is a very clear demonstration of the power of our platform. True value creation is when one can repeatedly deliver above-average returns over time and have a substantial TAM by which to execute its strategy against. We believe we've been able to demonstrate steady performance over a significant period of time, where we have methodically delivered great returns while using high cost of capital to execute those plans.\nOur Canadian clinics business continued its strong growth trajectory in Q1 2025. Patient visits in our Canadian clinics network totaled 933,000 in the first quarter, up 30% from 716,000 in Q1 2024, demonstrating significant increase in patient engagement.\nThe number of billable providers within the network reached 1,833 in Q1, up 11% from 1,654 in Q1 2024, highlighting the growing magnitude of our scale.\nWith patient visits growing faster than the number of billable providers in WELL's Canadian clinic network, we're demonstrating increasing efficiency in our clinics, resulting in an increasing number of patients per billable provider.\nSimply, WELL providers are seeing more patients, which we believe is demonstrative of the impact that we're having. Our platform allows providers to spend more time seeing patients and do not have to worry about the overhead task or managing the clinic or spending hours on charting patient records.\nNow looking at our Canadian business, including Canadian clinics, WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL, our WELL Canada business is experiencing accelerating growth. In Q1 2025, WELL generated revenue of $120.6 million compared to $91 million in Q1 '24, an increase of 32% as compared to the previous year's growth of 30%.\nSimilarly, adjusted EBITDA for WELL Canada reached $18.7 million in Q1 '25, up from $14.5 million in Q1 '24, representing an increase of 29% as compared to the prior year's growth of 23%.\nAs you can see here, we have a very steady history of improving our EBITDA growth in Canada, which has been attributable to both organic and inorganic growth. We recently increased our investments in shared services and clinic transformation and we believe we're well-positioned to continue this growth journey with Canadian clinics, WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL.\nThe WELL Canada team achieved annual adjusted EBITDA of $56.3 million in 2024, an increase of 23% as compared to $46 million in 2023.\nIn 2025, we're expecting our adjusted EBITDA in Canada to experience over 25% growth, inclusive of both organic and inorganic growth. We're very confident in our Canadian business and are now targeting over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA in Canada alone by the end of next year and on an annualized run rate basis, inclusive of additional M&A activity.\nWe think this is very much an achievable goal and are focused on making this a reality. Note that this may require some of the divestments that we've been talking about to go through so that we have the capital to reinvest and grow.\nMoving on, in Q1 2025, we continued executing on our strategic growth plan through the expansion of our clinic network. We acquired over 11 clinics, generating $31.5 million in annual revenue. Our owned and operated clinic network welcomed 71 new providers in the first quarter, further strengthening our capacity to deliver high-quality care.\nWith a diversified clinic strategy, a growing physician base and a scalable expansion model, we're well-positioned to drive long-term growth and operational efficiency.\nWe now have a very healthy pipeline of clinic acquisition opportunities, which I believe is directly correlated with the challenges doctors are feeling in the marketplace and WELL's growing brand recognition. We continue to focus on acquiring Canadian clinics, both under our absorption model and our paid acquisition model.\nAs a reminder, under the absorption model, we are usually acquiring clinics with lower operating margins for nominal consideration. Meanwhile, under the acquisition model, we're acquiring more profitable clinics that can typically be acquired for approximately 3 to 5x EBITDA multiples.\nOur current pipeline of Canadian clinics acquisition opportunities is very active. In Canadian clinics, we currently have 8 signed LOIs, representing 10 clinics and approximately $44 million in annual revenue. This is an improvement from our prior call last month, where we have 5 clinics with $31 million in annual revenue under LOI.\nIn total, across the organization including -- apologies, that was $65 million in annual revenue. In total, across the entire organization, including Canadian clinics, WELLSTAR and WELL USA, we have a total of 11 signed LOIs, representing approximately $65 million in annualized revenue. This compares favorably to our call last month, where we had 7 signed LOIs and approximately $40 million in annualized revenue.\nWe're expecting to execute on this pipeline of signed LOIs in a non-dilutive manner to current operating margins. We also have a very large pipeline of target acquisitions that are in a pre-LOI stage. We have more than 35 targets engaged, representing over $360 million in annual revenue and more than 130 clinics. The fourth theme I'd like to talk about is our current strategic review process of Wisp and Circle Medical.\nLet's start with Wisp. As we've discussed on our Q4 conference call just a month ago, we concluded the first phase of our strategic review for Wisp resulting in the receipt of numerous proposals from prospective acquirers.\nWhile interest in Wisp was significant, the Board determined that none of the proposals adequately reflected Wisp's exceptional operational performance, accelerating growth trajectory and substantial market opportunity in women's health care.\nThroughout the review process, Wisp continued to demonstrate strong business fundamentals with consistent revenue growth and operating margin expansion. This performance reinforces the Board's conviction in Wisp's long-term value potential beyond what was reflected in the proposals received.\nThe company and its advisers continued to actively work on the strategic review process, and we remain committed to our strategy of divesting the company's U.S. digital assets in order to allocate more capital into Canada and we'll provide further updates as appropriate.\nOperationally, Wisp had a very strong Q1 2025 with record quarterly revenue of $29.5 million, an increase of 40% from Q1 '24 and it achieved adjusted EBITDA of $459,000 in Q1 compared to $850,000 in Q1 '24. Wisp is performing very well and we're expecting Wisp to have improved EBITDA performance in 2025, which we believe may assist in attracting a more favorable valuation.\nMoving on to Circle Medical. Last year, we engaged a global investment bank to consider strategic alternatives for Circle. This process had recently flowed down to the regulatory inquiry.\nHowever, we are now continuing to move forward on the sale process of Circle Medical and currently have a number of active discussions and engagements occurring with interested parties. While the regulatory inquiry will continue to be a factor, we do not necessarily believe that this matter needs to be fully resolved before a sale takes place or a strategic alternative can be found.\nCircle Medical's patient visits in Q1 were 208,000, representing approximately 19% growth over last year's visits of 174,000. We continue to believe that unlocking the value from Circle and Wisp could result in significant cash benefit to WELL, which we'll use in a variety of ways, including redeploying the capital into our Canadian clinic footprint, where we have significant leadership advantage and exceptional ROIC performance. We will provide material updates as they become available.\nAnd with that, I'd like to pass the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials for Q1.\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $294.1 million in Q1 2025, marking a 32% increase compared to $223.5 million generated in Q1 of last year. This growth was driven primarily by strong organic expansion and recent acquisitions.\nExcluding the impact of Circle Medical's deferred revenue adjustments, Q1 2025 revenue would have reached $307 million. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2025 was $27.6 million, a 36% increase compared to $20.2 million in Q1 2024.\nExcluding the impact of Circle Medical's deferred revenue adjustments, adjusted EBITDA would have reached $34.1 million. These growth rates are comparing periods between Q1 2025 and Q1 2024, where both periods have been impacted by the Circle Medical deferred revenue adjustments.\nOverall, our Q1 2025 results reflect a solid start to the year despite the challenges related to Circle Medical's deferred revenue, as Hamed previously discussed. WELL reported a net loss of $41.9 million or negative $0.19 per share in Q1 2025 compared to net income of $13.8 million or $0.05 per share in Q1 2024.\nThe decrease in net income was primarily due to fair value adjustments on the company's HEALWELL investments and the deferred revenue from Circle Medical, which will be recognized in future periods. Adjusted net income for Q1 2025 was $7.5 million or $0.03 per share compared to adjusted net income of $17.2 million or $0.07 per share in Q1 2024.\nWe note that last year, Q1 2024 adjusted net income benefited from a gain on our sale of Intrahealth to HEALWELL of $11.3 million. Excluding the Intrahealth gain and the Circle Medical deferred revenue impact, there was actually a $2.6 million improvement in adjusted net income.\nExcluding the impact of Circle Medical deferred revenue adjustments, adjusted free cash flow attributable to shareholders was $11.8 million in Q1 2025, a slight decline from $12.6 million in Q1 of last year, which benefited from a number of onetime payments to physicians. The decline was largely due to higher capital expenditure and cash taxes paid. Cash interest was -- has remained stable with higher debt balances and lower interest rates.\nNow turning to our balance sheet as of March 31, 2025. WELL ended Q1 2025 with a solid balance sheet, holding cash and cash equivalents of $103.2 million. We remain in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related to our 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada.\nThe outstanding debt from these credit lines was approximately CAD 340 million as of March 31, 2025. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we are confident that we will continue to see strong free cash flow generation in 2025.\nI'm pleased to report that we have the cash and available resources to continue to fund our M&A program, as Hamed has discussed earlier. I'm also very pleased to confirm that we will be reinitiating our share buyback program shortly after reporting our Q1 results.\nWe believe our shares are undervalued and we will continue to improve our cash flow and demonstrate the power of our platform by returning value to our shareholders.\nThat concludes my financial update and I'll now turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. I'm very excited about our outlook for this year in which we expect to achieve record revenue, record EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and record net income and record free cash flow.\nFirst of all, I want to reiterate our 2025 guidance as conveyed last quarter, but I want to add a little more clarity for those who are trying to better understand how guidance incorporates deferred revenue. So we've expressed the guidance also excluding Circle Medical impact as being guidance for revenue for 2025 at $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion and guidance for adjusted EBITDA is between $140 million and $160 million.\nThis guidance doesn't include any unannounced acquisitions and we have a tremendous pipeline of potential targets that could significantly boost guidance upwards. In addition, we have not included any amounts from the $24.5 million in delayed earnings on CRH until the claims affected are collected or there's a formal settlement with health care -- Change Healthcare.\nOur guidance also includes fully consolidated financial results from HEALWELL starting in Q2 2025. Based on the guidance they gave to the market recently, we are expecting HEALWELL to contribute approximately $120 million in revenue and positive EBITDA to WELL's consolidated financial statements in 2025.\nWe believe HEALWELL is on a strong growth trajectory and we will see double-digit growth through 2026 based on the strength of the platform there, especially post the Orion acquisition.\nOrion is very well-positioned for public sector wins in Canada and beyond given the tariff situation and geopolitical matters that we're all witness to as their main competitors are U.S. companies, not only in Canada, but all over the world.\nAs I outlined at the outset of the call, we believe exiting our U.S. care businesses will not only reduce complexity to our business, but also unlock significant capital opportunities for us to grow and accelerate our Canadian business, which is demonstrating significant growth and predictability, which is a quality that we really appreciate given some of the volatility we're seeing in the U.S. health care markets.\nDivestments of these assets will allow us to redeploy capital into the Canadian market and further improve shareholder value given our superior return on capital invested capabilities in Canada. While our most pressing priorities are to execute on our Circle Medical and Wisp processes, we will start to undertake efforts to seek strategic alternatives for our CRH business as well.\nI want to stress that this will not be rushed. It will be a thoughtful and measured process as we generate significant revenue and cash flow at CRH and we want to make sure we have a good strategy to free up cash value and replace profitability with opportunities in Canada.\nOur Canadian business, including Canadian clinics, WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL, is outperforming and we have many tailwinds in the Canadian health care market driving growth in the business, including a strong buy Canadian sentiment from the federal and provincial agreement -- governments. We are expecting WELL Canada's adjusted EBITDA to grow by at least 25% in 2025, inclusive of acquisitions. And our longer-term view of the Canadian market, as I mentioned earlier, remains very bullish.\nAs noted earlier, we're targeting inclusive of Canadian clinics, WELLSTAR and CYBERWELL, to be over $800 million in revenue and over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA, inclusive of acquisitions in the next couple of years. We are the market share leader in Canada with the largest owned and operated clinic network which we believe will experience substantial growth and profitability improvements in the coming years as we continue to pursue our long-term market share goal of 10%.\nIn addition, WELLSTAR is the health care technology leader in Canada, whose growth will only accelerate with the future IPO and access to capital.\nIn summary, we're very pleased with the strengthening fundamentals of our business and look forward to delivering strong results in 2025 and beyond. WELL's growth engine has never been stronger.\nOur organic growth is operating at an optimal level while we are executing on an extremely healthy M&A pipeline. We have a strong balance sheet and are well-positioned to improve shareholder value. We have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can execute on our objectives.\nTo that, I would like to thank WELL's senior management team, our Board of Directors, all of our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort. In particular, I'd like to thank our team of health care practitioners and other frontline workers who are providing incredible care. We are here to support them as they're the real backbone of the health care industry.\nI want to thank you all for joining us on this call today and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals and drive societal value and provide the care that we all need.\nAnd with that, operator, we'd be open -- please open the line to questions."

Fourth Quarter 2024 -- and Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 months and full year ended December 31, 2024. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our Management Discussion and Analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by securities law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow attributable to shareholders on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler. Good day, everyone. We appreciate everyone for joining us today as we discuss our Q4 and annual 2024 financial results. Before we get into our discussion, I'd like to address two exceptional items that impacted our 2024 results, which impacted two of our U.S. subsidiaries, one, Circle Medical, which is a non-wholly-owned subsidiary; and CRH Medical, which is wholly-owned. Let's start with Circle Medical first.\nAs previously disclosed just a couple of weeks ago on March 29, Circle Medical received a request from U.S. regulators investigating certain of Circle Medical's billing practices in the United States. In the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, the company recognized an expense of USD 2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, for estimated settlement costs on its audited financial statements.\nAs the company was finalizing its annual filings for fiscal 2024, it was determined that Circle Medical had billed and received payment for patient services that had been delivered during 2024 for which it had not yet met all the required criteria to recognize such revenue under applicable IFRS standards. As a result, the company has recorded a revenue reduction of $56.6 million for fiscal 2024 and recognized cash received from customers of $53.9 million as deferred revenue as at year-end.\nThe company expects to recognize substantially all of this deferred revenue during fiscal 2025 with the remainder recognized in fiscal 2026. As of April 11, 2025, WELL has already satisfied the criteria for revenue recognition in fiscal 2025 for approximately $6.7 million of this deferred revenue. The company expects to recognize substantially all of this deferred revenue during fiscal 2025 with the remainder in '26. As of April 14, as I mentioned, we've recognized already 12% of this deferred revenue.\nNote that when the revenue is recognized, there won't be any costs recognized against this revenue resulting in full contribution to adjusted EBITDA in 2025. Therefore, we expect a significant boost in our reported adjusted EBITDA in 2025, and that has been embedded in our guidance. I want to stress here that all the revenue that is being deferred is related to patient care that was already delivered in 2024. It is expected that we will not lose any revenue here.\nCircle Medical had thousands of patient visits in 2024, where we provided care for patients related to these patient visits. We bill for them and consequently receive payment for them. The impact is a revenue recognition policy where a portion of Circle's revenue is being deferred to the future, even though the delivery and payment happened in 2024. Hence, we are seeing revenue and EBITDA decline in 2024, but will have the positive impact of increasing both revenue and EBITDA accordingly in 2025.\nThe billing errors relate only to Circle Medical and have no effect on the rest of WELL's business. Circle Medical has since made changes to its billing practices and revenue recognition policies to remediate the issues causing this deferral. As previously disclosed, we had initiated a process last year to seek strategic alternatives for Circle Medical. The company is committed to carrying out this process in due course. I'll discuss this further later on in the call.\nAnd now an update on the Change Healthcare cybersecurity impact on CRH. As previously discussed last year, CRH Anesthesia's primary billing partner, Change Healthcare, experienced a cybersecurity attack in February of 2024, which sidelined the Change Healthcare revenue cycle management service relied upon by the company for billings and collections. This resulted in the company experiencing delayed billing and cash collections on claims processed for several months during 2024.\nDue to this business interruption affecting a significant number of healthcare companies across the United States, which rely on Change Healthcare for revenue collection, Change Healthcare's affiliate provided advanced funding to many of its customers, including CRH, in lieu of the cash collections CRH would normally receive related to these claims.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, CRH updated key assumptions in its revenue recognition model related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack and determined that it would delay the recognition of approximately CAD 24.5 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 that otherwise would have been recognized during 2024 had the cyberattack not occurred.\nCRH expects to recognize these revenues if and when collections from patients and third-party payers occur and when settlement terms have been reached with Change Healthcare. Once this occurs, such earnings will result in almost 100% contribution to adjusted EBITDA. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing and the amount that will be recovered, this has been excluded from our 2025 guidance.\nNotwithstanding to our revenue from the Circle Medical revenue deferral and the Change Healthcare cyberattack matters, we're very proud of our overall achievements in 2024. Simply put, the fundamentals and outlook of our business have never been stronger. Despite these two IFRS revenue impacts, WELL delivered record annual revenue and free cash flow attributable to shareholders in fiscal 2024. WELL achieved annual revenue of $919.7 million in 2024, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year.\nAs you can see here, revenue was negatively impacted by a delay in the recognition of earnings related to Circle Medical and CRH in the amounts of $56.6 million and $24.5 million, respectively. All of the deferred Circle Medical revenue is expected to be recognized, as I mentioned earlier in 2025, and the CRH revenues will be considered recognized once collected or earned as other income when terms are confirmed with Change Healthcare.\nExcluding such impacts, the company was on track to achieve record revenue of CAD 1 billion in 2024, which has been a clear beat on our consensus results and reflected an increase of 29% as compared to the prior year. We think it's important for shareholders to be aware of this as WELL management has a culture of being highly accountable to its guidance, and excluding the two IFRS revenue impacts, we had beaten again.\nAs you can see here, as a result of revenue recognition delays related to Circle Medical and CRH, our adjusted EBITDA in 2025 was $46.7 million as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $113.4 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $56.6 million as a result of the Circle Medical revenue deferral and $23.8 million as a result of the revenue deferral -- delay, pardon me, related to the Change Healthcare cyberattack.\nAlthough Circle Medical contributed a net loss to consolidated income and only contributed 2.7% to the company's consolidated adjusted EBITDA in 2023, under IFRS for fiscal 2024, the company is required to recognize 100% of the expenses related to the $56.6 million that was deferred, which results in a significant reduction in adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024 and caused a significant positive contribution to adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2025 once the deferred revenue is recognized.\nThe graph on the right shows excluding the impacts from these two matters, adjusted EBITDA would have been $127 million, an increase of 12% as compared to 2023, which is within the range of our previously provided annual guidance for 2024. The company continues to seek strategic alternatives for Circle Medical, and we are committed to carrying out this process. Again, we will discuss this further. This slide shows some of our key annual financial highlights.\nFor fiscal 2024, we achieved net income of $29.1 million, representing 75% year-over-year growth compared to $16.6 million in 2023. Free cash flow attributable to shareholders was $49.3 million in 2024, an increase of 16% as compared to the prior year. We were trending to be higher than $50 million in free cash flow but had more significant CapEx at the end of the year as we had suggested could happen in our Q3 conference call.\nOn a per share basis, free cash flow attributable to shareholders was $0.20 per share. Our Canadian business continues its strong momentum with 30% year-over-year growth and 20% year-over-year organic growth, and our adjusted EBITDA in Canada grew 22% year-over-year to $56 million. I will now share with you some of our operational highlights for 2024. As of the end of Q4 2024, WELL had over 4,100 providers and clinicians delivering care across our entire network of physical and virtual clinics.\nOf that number, I'm proud to announce that we now have over 2,500 providers within WELL-owned clinics in Canada, which includes approximately 1,000 physicians, which is over 1% of all physicians practicing in the country. We have a tremendous runway to continue to expand our footprint across Canada. In addition, there are more than 41,000 providers benefiting from our SaaS and technology services, most of which are physicians.\nWe estimate that well over 40% of all physicians in Canada touch our WELLSTAR technology platform in some way. As we enhance our digital offerings and provide leading AI products and services, we can see the increasing importance, relevance and role that our company is playing in the country's healthcare ecosystem, and we're determined to make a positive impact. Looking at our patient visits as our revenues are generally underpinned by patient visits.\nAs such, it's very important to track them, especially in this quarter as we are experiencing some delays in revenue recognition under IFRS. We delivered 5.7 million patient visits in 2024, a 32% year-over-year increase from the prior year with strong organic growth of 30%. These results demonstrate our strong fundamentals and unique platform, which is winning in the marketplace. Canadian patient visit metrics continue to demonstrate that this is one of the most prominent growth drivers of the company as visits grew by 35% year-over-year, with organic growth at 32%, inclusive of absorptions and same clinic growth.\nU.S. patient visits grew by 28% year-over-year with all of it related to organic growth. Total Care Interactions, which is defined as total patient visits plus technology interactions plus biller provider hours were over 8.7 million in 2024, which was a 37% increase as compared to the last year and represented 34% organic growth. Turning to our guidance for 2025; WELL is expecting its strong fundamentals and operational performance to continue into 2025 with a greater focus on leveraging all the product and corporate synergies [ it ] has access to, given its depth of product and technology at WELLSTAR and now HEALWELL.\nMoreover, the company continues to focus the substantial majority of its M&A and capital allocation activity in Canada, where it is experiencing its strongest returns. Management will continue to pursue its focus on optimizing its operations for organic growth and profitability. With that, WELL is pleased to provide a positive outlook for 2025 with annual revenue guidance of between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion. For adjusted EBITDA, we're providing annual guidance in the range of $190 million to $210 million.\nNote that we've included over 90% of the $56.6 million deferred Circle Medical revenue in our 2025 guidance. This IFRS revenue associated with Circle Medical deferral will have a close to 100% contribution, as I noted, to adjusted EBITDA and it is important to consider when evaluating the company's performance. We expect Circle Medical deferred revenue will be recognized primarily in the matters noted on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\nNote that as of today, the company has already recognized, again, approximately $6.7 million of this deferred revenue. Our guidance does not include contribution from the $24.5 million in delayed earnings on CRH until this matter is resolved through a more exhaustive collection effort performed by Change Healthcare or formal agreement with Change Healthcare itself as it relates to their advances. Our guidance includes 100% consolidation of HEALWELL financial starting in Q2 2025 as per IFRS control requirements.\nWe're currently expecting this will add approximately $120 million in annual revenue with positive adjusted EBITDA contribution. Note that WELL's voting interest in HEALWELL is currently approximately 69%, pardon me, and its economic ownership of HEALWELL is currently at approximately 37%. Our guidance reflects healthy organic growth expectations in our Canadian operations. Importantly, this guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions, and we have a very strong pipeline with a strong balance sheet.\nSeparately, while this is not part of our official 2025 guidance, we're pleased to note that with the strong outlook and fundamentals of our Canadian business, we are now targeting to reach $800 million in revenues and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA in Canada alone by the end of next year. We're confident in our fundamentals and outlook and are expecting 2025 to be a great year for the company with record revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. I'd now like to provide the listeners today with an overall view of what WELL Health family will look like in the future.\nWe anticipate WELL will be comprised of three operating subsidiaries and two publicly listed entities. The three operating subsidiaries will include Canadian Clinics, WELL Health USA and our cybersecurity business unit. The two publicly listed entities will include WELLSTAR and HEALWELL. HEALWELL is currently listed on the TSX under the ticker AIDX, and WELLSTAR. WELLSTAR is expected to debut with an IPO on the TSX by early 2026. WELL Health is the largest shareholder in each of WELLSTAR and HEALWELL.\nWe have a majority ownership position in WELLSTAR and a majority voting share ownership in HEALWELL. Both WELLSTAR and HEALWELL are independent companies that will have their own capital allocation strategies, fundraising plans and acquisition opportunities. However, both WELLSTAR and HEALWELL will continue to work very closely with WELL and our clinical footprint in Canada. Now that we've covered off some of the key results, I'd like to cover off a few key topics.\nWe'll do a deeper dive into HEALWELL, our WELLSTAR and buy Canadian theme, our Canadian Clinics update and as well an update on the Wisp Circle sale processes. Let's start with HEALWELL. We're very pleased with the progress of HEALWELL AI, a company that we developed a plan and took a major leadership role in recapitalizing and relaunching 18 months ago after we acquired its MCI clinics and formed a pure-play AI software company.\nWith HEALWELL's recent acquisition of Orion Health completed on April 1, HEALWELL is building the world's leading company in healthcare data interoperability and artificial intelligence. In conjunction with HEALWELL's acquisition of Orion Health, WELL increased its holdings in HEALWELL to an approximate 37% economic interest and an approximate 69% voting interest. As a result, the company will begin to fully consolidate HEALWELL in its financial results starting in Q2 2025. We're very excited about the progress made at HEALWELL and its future.\nHEALWELL's commercial success is underscored by its partnerships with 7 of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world. This robust client base reflects its ability to deliver unparalleled value to the healthcare ecosystem. HEALWELL is not just revolutionizing patient care through AI, but through building a scalable and sustainable platform that is shaping the future of healthcare. HEALWELL's strategic acquisition of Orion Health significantly enhanced HEALWELL's market position, accelerating its path to profitability.\nOrion Health was generating approximately $100 million in annualized revenue run rate the majority of which is coming from large enterprise SaaS with strong operating EBITDA margins. Orion Health provides significant strategic benefits to HEALWELL and now WELL, which includes: one, financial benefits of its strong recurring revenues; two, significant scale benefits as Orion Health currently services a total population of 150 million lives throughout all of its customers worldwide; three, a significant distribution opportunity for HEALWELL's AI offerings as well as WELLSTAR's best-in-class provider-focused tech; and four, significant data science and data interoperability expertise.\nBefore public sector clients can use AI, which they really want to do in any meaningful manner, they must get their data normalized and organized and achieve interoperability. This is not an easy task, and Orion is one of the best in the world at helping public sector healthcare groups organize their data. This is a very important thematic to be aware of. This map shows how HEALWELL has strengthened its position with the Orion Health acquisition as the global leader in AI-driven healthcare solutions.\nToday, Orion operates across 11 countries, delivering cutting-edge software solutions to public and private sector customers globally. Its technology is deployed across 70 sites -- more than 70 sites globally, supporting healthcare systems that collectively manage, again, over 150 million patient records. This global presence, combined with deep integration into healthcare ecosystems, positions HEALWELL for sustained growth.\nThe company's solutions are powered by 500 global employees working out of 15 global offices in 11 countries. As a leader in AI-driven healthcare solutions, HEALWELL has large referenceable customers globally. Its ability to execute at scale is evident in the successful deployments of Digital Care Records or DCR and Digital Front Door or DFD solutions for major health care systems across the world. Some of these customer deployments include, for example, in Saudi Arabia, where HEALWELL and Orion is powering the world's largest Digital Care Records deployment globally covering 35 million people.\nThis system integrates data from over 5,000 governmental and private healthcare providers, creating a single comprehensive view of each patient's medical history. In Ontario, Canada, HEALWELL or Orion has delivered a Digital Front Door platform serving 15 million people and is now executing on the deployment of a unified Digital Care Record system to enhance clinical interoperability.\nIn Abu Dhabi, Orion has deployed its first-ever Digital Care Record solution in the Middle East, seamlessly connecting 100% of all hospitals, clinics and pharmacies to improve patient outcomes through real-time data integration. This is an exceptional solution and result, of which there are far -- very few examples in the world. And in the United States, HEALWELL is delivering -- or Orion is delivering Digital Care Records for state and regional Health Information Exchanges or HIEs in Maine, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, North Dakota and Idaho, reinforcing its presence in the U.S. healthcare ecosystem.\nAnd now I'd like to talk a little bit about the strategic spinout of WELLSTAR. During Q4, we created WELLSTAR, a WELL subsidiary, which we intend to spin out as a publicly listed high-growth, profitable pure-play Software-as-a-Service or SaaS healthcare technology company, which would still be majority owned by WELL. WELLSTAR is the technology platform that powers WELL's clinical ecosystem. WELLSTAR is dedicated to empowering healthcare providers with innovative solutions that enhance patient care and optimize operational efficiency.\nWELLSTAR addresses the diverse needs of the healthcare providers by streamlining care delivery, integrating fragmented care systems, reducing burnout and improving patient care and experiences and outcomes. There are over 4,000 clinics across the country that are customers of WELLSTAR. And as we noted earlier, over 40% of all providers in the country touch the platform in some way. WELLSTAR is currently on a $70 million annual revenue run rate, generates 80% gross margin is operating as a Rule of 40 or better business with 20% organic growth and 29% adjusted EBITDA margins before shared services.\nWELLSTAR is already one of the most relevant and consequential companies in the Canadian healthcare technology landscape and has firmly established itself as a de facto market leader in technology-enabling clinicians across the country. We believe WELLSTAR will be a very strong IPO candidate on the TSX main board sometime in early 2026.\nWe continue to believe that pursuing the spin-out and public listing for WELLSTAR will accelerate the growth of the company, providing it with attractive cost of capital for M&A purposes and position it to be a multibillion-dollar company itself in the pure healthcare software vertical. We've already completed the first step in the WELLSTAR go public plans, which was to add significant capital to WELLSTAR's balance sheet so it can execute on its acquisition plans.\nAs such, during Q4, WELLSTAR closed on a $50.4 million equity placement entirely supported by Mawer Investment Management, Edgepoint Wealth Management and PenderFund Capital Management, three very reputable investment firms with a strong track record of investing in Canadian technology leaders. WELL and WELLSTAR management also participated in this financing to fund WELLSTAR's pre-spin-out growth objectives. WELL did not issue any shares as part of this transaction.\nStep 2 for WELL Health and WELLSTAR is to acquire scale in its business. WELLSTAR completed acquisition of two healthcare technology companies, Microquest and BlueBird, which boosted WELLSTAR's annualized revenue to approximately $70 million. WELLSTAR has a compelling pipeline of target acquisitions in its portfolio. Before WELLSTAR does its public listing, our plan is to build additional scale by completing additional acquisitions that will position WELLSTAR towards $100 million in annual revenues.\nStep 3 is the actual IPO, which we expect to occur in the next three to four quarters. As a majority voting shareholder, we expect to continue consolidating the financial results, as I mentioned earlier. We are now pleased to report that the buy Canadian sentiment is presenting significant strategic advantages for WELL Health, especially in the WELLSTAR and HEALWELL areas of our business. As policymakers across the Federal and Provincial levels increasingly prioritize domestic healthcare solutions, WELL Health is uniquely positioned to benefit from this shift and further solidify our leadership in Canadian healthcare ecosystem.\nIn recent months, we've had a 200% increase in the size of our public sector pipeline as our deep-rooted presence in the Canadian healthcare landscape has led to unprecedented engagement from various different federal and provincial governments. We are currently seeing over 70 opportunities across Canada representing $300 million in deal value. In the past, despite there being high-quality technology vendors available in Canada, public sector procurement managers were mostly buying U.S. products and services to power many aspects of the Canadian healthcare ecosystem.\nThe recent U.S. tariff policies have completely changed this perspective and accelerated the demand for homegrown digital health solutions. This policy-driven shift has created new revenue opportunities for WELL Health as one of the few companies in the country with the technology depth to deliver on large projects, particularly in the areas such as digital health infrastructure, AI-powered solutions, virtual care and primary care enablement.\nOur acquisition of Orion Health through HEALWELL has further solidified our position as a leading provider of provincial health information exchange platforms, while the expansion of OceanMD's e-Referral platform in BC and other provinces is streamlining patient care coordination. Our extensive network of healthcare providers as well as our owned and operated network which is the largest in the country positions us very well to support policymakers in their efforts to enhance patient outcomes.\nWe also believe that WELL will benefit from a reduction in engagement from U.S. companies internationally. Note that with Orion Health, we now have boots on the ground in 11 countries globally, and we'll be working with Orion to sell more of our WELLSTAR capabilities internationally. This is a unique catalyst not previously considered [ before ] within WELL's business. The third theme I'd like to discuss this morning is the success of our Canadian business.\nAs you can see from these charts, the historical performance of our Canadian Clinics business has been exceptionally strong. Canadian Clinics achieved revenue of $319 million in 2024, handily beating our previous revenue guidance of $300 million. Over the past 4 quarters, our Canadian Clinics business had exceeded 50% compound annual growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to our Canadian Clinic business has grown at a CAGR of 44% and achieved $40.7 million in 2024.\nOur Canadian Clinics network has grown to 210 clinics at the end of 2024 compared to 167 at the end of 2023. We expect this number will continue to increase in 2025 as we have a significant M&A pipeline. In Q4, we continued executing on our strategic growth plan through the expansion of our clinic network. We acquired 20 clinics generating over $30.8 million in annual revenue. This does not include our affiliate clinic acquisition from Jack Nathan Health, which would increase our total clinic count to 57, including both owned and affiliate clinics.\nWe also -- our owned and operated clinic network welcomed 111 new healthcare providers in Q4, further strengthening our capacity to deliver high-quality care. We continued this momentum in Q1, in which we acquired 11 clinics generating $31.5 million in annual revenue and added 71 providers. With a diversified clinic strategy and a growing physician base and a scalable expansion model, we're well-positioned to drive long-term growth and operational efficiency.\nAnd now a little bit about our M&A pipeline. We have a very healthy pipeline of clinic acquisitions opportunities, which we believe is directly correlated with the challenges doctors are feeling in the marketplace. We continue to focus on acquiring Canadian Clinics under both our absorption model and acquisition model. Our current pipeline of Canadian Clinic acquisition opportunities is very active. In Canadian Clinics, we currently have 5 signed LOIs, representing 5 clinics and approximately $31 million in annual revenue.\nIn total, across the entire organization, including Canadian Clinics, WELLSTAR and WELL USA, we currently have 7 signed LOIs, representing approximately $40 million in annualized revenue. We have a very large pipeline of target acquisitions that we are in a pre-LOI stage with. We have more than 130 targets engaged, representing over $390 million in annual revenue. This pipeline includes more than 130 clinics.\nOur Canadian business -- and including our Canadian Clinics and WELLSTAR businesses are doing exceptionally well and is outperforming many -- in many ways that I've already mentioned earlier on this call. Our pretax unlevered ROIC or return on invested capital in Canada is expected to rise, driven by growth, acquisition integration and cost optimization. Meanwhile, our adjusted EBITDA continues to be driven by organic and inorganic growth.\nNow looking a little bit more closely at our ROIC; WELLSTAR currently operates at a ROIC of 11%. The WELL Health Diagnostic network has achieved a historic ROIC of 12%. Note that the diagnostic network has a lower ROIC than our primary care acquisitions because we had not done any tuck-in acquisitions after acquiring the platform in 2021 until quite recently. We expect that the diagnostic ROIC to improve as we just completed our first diagnostics tuck-in with the acquisition of Alberta-based CHealth in late 2024.\nThe historical ROIC in our primary care business is approximately 22%, demonstrating our ability to create value. We expect our Canadian Clinic ROIC figure should improve given that our costs have reduced and our ability to execute on clinic transformation has improved in recent years. This is also demonstrated by the primary care ROIC for the last three years at approximately 30% per year -- for each of the 3-year cohorts.\nThe 3-year primary care ROIC also benefits from the absorption model, which we started post-COVID and has an extremely high ROIC. WELL's high pretax unlevered ROIC metrics indicate that the company is consistently creating returns well above its cost of capital, demonstrating the company's disciplined approach to capital allocation and operational execution.\nTurning to adjusted EBITDA growth for WELL Canada; as you can see from the graph on the right, our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA of WELL Canada, including Canadian Clinics and WELLSTAR, has been accelerating, while achieved annual adjusted EBITDA of $56.3 million in 2024, a 22% increase as compared to last year. In 2025, we are expecting our adjusted EBITDA in Canada to experience an over 25% growth, inclusive of both organic and inorganic growth.\nWe're very confident in our Canadian business and are now targeting over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA in Canada alone by the end of next year. We think this is very much an achievable goal and are focused on making it a reality. The fourth theme I'd like to talk about is our current strategic review process of Wisp and Circle Medical. First of all, on Wisp, we concluded the first phase of our strategic review process for Wisp, resulting in the receipt of numerous proposals from prospective acquirers.\nWhile interest in Wisp was significant, the Board has determined that none of these proposals adequately reflected Wisp's exceptional operational performance, accelerating growth trajectory and substantial market opportunity in women's healthcare. Throughout the review process, Wisp continued to demonstrate strong business fundamentals with consistent revenue growth and operating margin expansion. This performance reinforces the Board's conviction in Wisp's long-term value potential beyond what was reflected in the proposals received.\nThe company and its advisers continue to actively work on the strategic review process, and we remain committed to our strategy of divesting the company's U.S. digital assets in order to allocate more capital into Canada, and we'll continue to provide updates as appropriate. Operationally, Wisp had a very strong 2024 with record annual revenue of $101 million, an increase of 30% from 2023, and it achieved record adjusted EBITDA of $5 million in 2024, a 235% increase from the previous year.\nWisp is performing very well, and we're expecting Wisp to have improved EBITDA performance in 2025, which we believe may assist in attracting a more favorable valuation. Moving on to Circle Medical; we've already discussed Circle extensively on this call, so we won't go into it too much further, but we will remind shareholders that last year we engaged a global investment bank to consider strategic alternatives for Circle Medical.\nWe're still relatively early in the process, which has recently slowed down due to the regulatory inquiry. Nonetheless, we're still very committed to continue to move forward on the sale of Circle Medical and currently have a number of discussions and engagement occurring with prospective buyers. We do not necessarily believe that the regulatory matter needs to be fully resolved before a sale takes place.\nThis is, of course, after consultation with U.S. legal advisers. We continue to believe that unlocking the value from Wisp and Circle could result in significant cash benefit to WELL, which we would use in a variety of ways, including redeploying the capital into our expanding Canadian Clinic footprint.\nAnd now I will pass the mic over to Eva Fong.\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. Overall, our fiscal year 2024 results were positive, excluding the revenue recognition impact Hamed discussed earlier on the call. As Hamed has already covered revenue and adjusted EBITDA results, I'll focus on WELL's net income. WELL reported net income of $29.1 million or $0.13 per share in 2024, an increase of 75% as compared to a net income of $16.6 million or $0.00 per share in 2023.\nThe higher net income this fiscal year was primarily driven by the fair value gains on the company's investment in HEALWELL. From the graph, you can see that the IFRS revenue recognition impact had a material impact on our 2024 net income figure. Excluding these impacts, WELL was on track to achieve approximately $90 million in net income.\nNow looking at our balance sheet as at the end of Q4 2024; WELL ended 2024 with a solid balance sheet. As at December 31, 2024, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $131.7 million. WELL continues to be in good standing and fully compliance with all covenants related with its two credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. The debt from the two credit lines was approximately CAD 292.4 million as of December 31, 2024.\nOur balance sheet is strong and getting stronger as we continue to grow our free cash flow generation capabilities. We should see 2025 result again in a record year of free cash flow generation. I'm also very pleased to report that we have the cash and available resources to continue to fund our M&A program. This is true for Canadian Clinics, WELLSTAR and CRH Medical, where substantially all our M&A pipeline is focused on.\nThat is my financial update, and I now turn back -- turn the call back to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. In final here, I'm very excited about our outlook for this year, which we expect to achieve record revenue, record adjusted EBITDA, record net income and record free cash flow. First of all, I want to reiterate that our 2025 guidance for revenue of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $190 million to $210 million.\nThis guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions, and we have a tremendous pipeline of potential acquisitions that could significantly boost guidance upwards. In addition, we have not included any amounts from the $24.5 million in delayed earnings on CRH until the claims affected are collected or there is formal agreement with Change Healthcare. Our guidance also includes fully consolidated financial statements from HEALWELL, as we noted.\nWe're also very excited with the potential IPO of WELLSTAR. We're expecting WELLSTAR to reach $100 million in annual revenues by 2026. WELLSTAR will continue to be a guiding light in the delivery of technology and solutions to healthcare providers. Despite the challenging economic and backdrop of the geopolitical instability of tariff, we remain committed to the sale processes of our U.S. digital assets. These businesses continue to be desirable given their historical growth rates, and they both reflect the future of healthcare as telemedicine businesses.\nDivestment of these assets will allow us to redeploy the capital in attractive ways as we discussed. Our Canadian business, including Canadian Clinics and WELLSTAR is outperforming, and we have many tailwinds in the Canadian healthcare market driving and supporting the business, including the strong buy Canadian sentiment that we talked about. And as I noted earlier, we're expecting WELL Canada's adjusted EBITDA to grow by at least 25% in 2025.\nOur longer term view of the Canadian market remains bullish, again, as I noted, with our 2-year goal of achieving $800 million in revenue and $100 million in adjusted EBITDA, inclusive of acquisitions just in Canada. And in addition, our WELLSTAR as a technology leader in Canada, we believe its growth will only accelerate with the future IPO. So in summary, we're very pleased with the strengthening fundamentals of our business and look forward to delivering strong results in 2025 and beyond.\nWELL's growth engine has never been stronger. Our organic growth is operating at its optimal level while we are executing on a very healthy M&A pipeline. We have a strong balance sheet and are well-positioned to improve shareholder value. We have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can execute on our objectives. I'd also like to thank WELL's senior management team and all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort. And in particular, I'd like to thank our team of healthcare practitioners and other frontline workers who continue to provide unbelievable patient care.\nThey remind us every day why we're here and we're here to support them. I also want to thank you all for joining us on this call and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals.\nFinally, on behalf of the management team, we sincerely apologize for the lateness of today's report. In my 27 years as a public company CEO, this was the first and only time I personally or we as a company have experienced anything like this. And I am extremely sure it will never happen again, and we very much appreciate your patience with us. We are accountable to you, and we look forward to delivering for you.\nAnd with that, we will now open the call to questions. Operator, would you please help us take questions?"

Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Ima, and I'll be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that the today's conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Fiscal Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024. Joining me today on the call are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; Eva Fong, the company's CFO.\nI trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today. Please also note that we will be using some slides to assist us in our presentation today. If you are on a webcast, you will automatically see these. If not, you will need to download these from our investor site on our financials page. Portions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use the terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our MD&A.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, I will turn over the call to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. We're extremely pleased to be with you today and discuss our strong momentum and quarter in which we achieved our 22nd consecutive record-breaking revenue quarter, underscoring and the enduring momentum of our company.\nAnd for the first time, we'll be using some slides to assist us in our presentation. As Tyler indicated earlier, if you joined via webcast, you should already see these. If you don't, you can go to our Investors section of our website and either join the webcast or download the slides.\nThe second quarter of 2024 exceeded all our expectations showcasing the continued strength and momentum of our technology-driven Care delivery platforms. We're very proud to report a robust 42% year-over-year revenue growth, of which half or approximately 21% came from organic growth, which includes our clinic absorption. Note that if you exclude our absorption program, enterprise-wide organic growth would have been 16%.\nThe company also experienced 11% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA. We will expand on this later, but we're very pleased to have paid down a significant amount of debt and reduced our leverage ratios in Q2. We're also pleased to have improved annual guidance yet again this quarter. This quarter, we've increased revenue guidance to between $970 million and $990 million for the year. It should be noted that for the purposes of assessing 2024 annual organic growth, we estimate that our 2023 pro forma revenue would have been approximately $849 million if all of our 2023 acquisitions excluding clinic absorptions that occurred on January 1, 2023, and excluding all but one month of Intrahealth, which was sold on February 1, 2024.\nNote that this number differs from what was disclosed in the notes to our 2023 audited financial statements. It's that pro forma number included clinic absorptions, intra health and a number of other adjustments. As such, the midpoint of our updated guidance in further organic growth rate, including absorptions of 15.4% for the year.\nAs for adjusted EBITDA, we are maintaining our previous guidance which was just increased last quarter to the upper range of $125 million to $130 million despite incurring higher costs due to our projection of significantly lower share issuance and stock-based incentives. We also reiterate our guidance introduced last quarter for free cash flow available to shareholders to be approximately $55 million for the year.\nKeep in mind that this target guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. If we include any material acquisitions, there is a fairly good chance that we would be ahead of our current guidance range, notwithstanding any potential material divestments.\nOur pipeline of acquisitions continues to be strong, particularly in our Canadian clinics division, where we have significant opportunities for acquisition or absorption of clinics. In addition, keep in mind that the second half of the year is typically a stronger -- typically stronger for us in terms of EBITDA generation, and we continue to maintain guidance for improving free cash flow attributable to shareholders to approximately $55 million, representing a 30% year-over-year increase from 2023.\nMoving on to operational highlights. Central to our identity is our commitment to providing highly competent, reliable and tech-enabled support to health care providers. As of the end of Q2 2024, over 3,900 providers and clinicians deliver care across our physical and virtual clinics. Of that number, I'm proud to announce that we've achieved approximately 1,000 physicians serving patients within our WELL clinics in Canada. Remember that there are likely less than 100,000 physicians in the entire country, serving our $330 billion health care ecosystem. So we can proudly state that approximately 1% of all health care providers or physicians make a WELL clinic their place of practice, truly remarkable milestone.\nIn addition, there are more than 37,000 providers benefiting from our SaaS and technology services, which is approaching approximately 40% of all physicians in Canada, supported by our platform in some way. WELL achieved a record 1.4 million patient visits in Q2, an increase of 38% as compared to Q2 of 2023, representing 5.6 million patient visits on an annualized run rate basis.\nPatient visits were comprised of 759,000 patient visits in Canada and 640,000 patient visits in the United States. Canadian Patient Services visits increased 41%, while U.S. Patient Visits increased 34% on a year-over-year basis. I'd like to point out that organic growth in patient visits, including absorptions in Canada was 25.5%. If you strip out absorptions, same clinic growth in visits was 11.4%, which one must remember is much higher, and we would guess to be about triple the growth rate of traditional organic growth figures in terms of Canadian health care, which are typically in the 3% to 4% range.\nI would like to now move on to describing some of the key themes for today's call. One, our various strategies to unlock sum of parts value; two, our plans to spin out our SaaS and services provider solutions line of business as a controlled public company; and three, our efforts to improve per share metrics by reducing dilution and stock-based compensation, improving profitability and improving shareholder value; and four, we will also be making some important commentary about our clinic consolidation program and the progress we've been experiencing there, too.\nOn to unlocking some of the parts. This is something that we covered off at Investor Day, but we'd like to revisit a bit today. WELL is a diverse and multifaceted health care technology company with multiple business lines operating across both the U.S. and Canadian markets. While it's natural for there to be a small discount to the multiple holdings of the conglomerate, such as WELL, we believe that the discount currently associated with WELL far exceeds the normal conglomerate or holding company discount. And we believe this is an opportunity for those investors who are looking for hidden but realizable value.\nWhile some of that discount has been corrected since our Investor Day, we believe that there's still an approximately an $800 million to $1 billion discount to our true sum of parts. As you'll see in today's presentation, these overlooked segments are not only strong performance, but they're also experiencing significant growth and momentum. Therefore, we propose a sum of parts valuation approach to more accurately assess the company towards.\nWe believe that unlocking the value of some of our assets through third-party, arm's length investments or divestments, could go a long way to highlight this value. In the case where divestments occur, such cash benefits could be material and could be likely used to pay down debt or to issue a special buyback or make additional accretive acquisitions.\nLast quarter, we indicated that we had begun considering strategic alternatives for our U.S. patient digital patient services businesses, Circle Medical and Wisp. We do not believe that the capital markets are signing a fair value for these 2 assets as part of WELL given their high growth and improving fundamentals. Both Circle and Wisp are higher-growth businesses that would essentially be valued generally on a price to sales basis, given their limited but improving EBITDA generation.\nWhereas WELL is primarily valued on a price to EBITDA basis, which creates a dislocation in value which results in unrealized or hidden sum of parts value. In addition, WELL as a call option for both of these businesses, which provides us with several alternatives, including acquiring the remaining ownership of the businesses, seeking an IPO or RTO or selling the businesses entirely. We have hired professional advisers to help us with these processes.\nIn the case of Circle Medical, the call option as a time line which has now been extended with the approval of the minority shareholders well into 2025. We are pleased to announce that Circle Medical has retained JPMorgan to evaluate strategic alternatives and help identify partner or partners that will support Circle in its next phase of growth.\nOn the win side of things, we're similarly pleased to report that CIBC Capital Markets is assisting us with our evaluation of strategic alternatives. We will provide updates as they become available on both of these processes, but do not expect update until later this year or especially in the case of Circle Medical early next year.\nIn addition to evaluating strategic alternatives for Circle and Wisp, we started to look at additional opportunities for unlocking value. And we're very pleased to disclose that we are working on another important initiative that we believe will yield significant shareholder value. That's -- and that's related to our Platform Solutions business.\nWe believe our SaaS and Services Provider Solutions business is a very strong candidate as a potential spin out as a well-controlled stand-alone public company. Excluding cybersecurity, our Provider Solutions group achieved external revenue of $10.4 million in Q2 2024 with 86% gross margin, 30% EBITDA margins and 24% organic growth, with over 90% of its revenues contractual and recurring in nature. This is a very healthy and profitable SaaS business with great growth prospects.\nWe believe Provider Solutions group would be valued at a much higher valuation multiple than the value that is currently being afforded to WELL health. In addition, we believe we could accelerate the growth of this business as a stand-alone public company, which would then ramp up its own capital allocation program to ensure it is growing methodically, both organically and inorganically.\nThe Provider Solutions group is an integral part of the Canadian clinics ecosystem that tech enables doctors and other health care providers in our clinic. It's also an area where we have clear market leadership to support health care providers nationally, while our market share ownership in EMR in Canada is third. If you look at the full platform requirements of a health care provider, which include billing management, productivity apps, and other elements, to our knowledge, there is no bigger market share owner in the country than WELL's Provider Solutions entity.\nEven after a prospectus spin out of our Provider Solutions group, what could -- this group will continue to work closely with and support our clinics and clinic transformation team as such, WELL's intentions are to maintain a strong economic and voting majority in this entity even after it spun out as a separate publicly listed company. As such, there should be no real changes to how this entity operates and interact with our own clinics, which is very important to our own development within our WELL clinics ecosystem. We're very excited about this initiative, and we'll provide more updates in the coming weeks and months.\nThe third key theme is one of the most important for the call today, our commitment to delivering improved shareholder value. Last quarter in our conference call, we talked about an important inflection point where WELL was going to focus more intently on optimizing our profit per share metrics by not only improving our overall organic growth and profitability, but also paying quick and significant attention to our dilution and pulling all the levers we could to reduce and eventually fully eliminate and then reverse dilution.\nI'm pleased to note that this quarter, we made excellent progress towards these stated goals. And as Eva will demonstrate later, we were able to actually reduce our fully diluted share totals during the quarter slightly by paying out all of our earn-outs in cash, not issuing any new incentive fair awards, and actually electing to pay some of our incentives in cash, which are long-term incentive plan allows for and buying back some stock.\nWe will be applying the same intensity to managing dilution, driving organic growth, and improving our profitability in subsequent quarters as we look -- as we work hard to realize sum of parts value and significantly elevate shareholder value.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will provide some financial context and color on some of the most important themes of unlocking shareholder value. I'll then come back and provide some further commentary on our lines of business. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we have very strong results for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024. Our revenue grew by 42% to $243.1 million, and our adjusted EBITDA grew by 11% to $30.9 million. Our overall second quarter results were very positive. I won't go into too much of the financial details as they are available on SEDAR+, but instead, I will go through our key financial metrics in the next few slides.\nWELL achieved record IFRS net income of $117 million in Q2 2024 compared to a loss of $2 million in Q2 2023. This increase in net income was largely driven by significant unrealized gains of wealth investment in HEALWELL AI. Our net income remains positive even if we exclude unrealized gains from our investments in HEALWELL, which shows the progress we are making overall.\nNotwithstanding this, we think that what is more important than the share price gains HEALWELL has made this year is an incredible improvement it has made in terms of its business execution and fundamentals. HEALWELL current run rate revenue is already surpassing $65 million and it's projected to be approaching $100 million by the end of the year on a run rate basis.\nHEALWELL has also given guidance for reaching profitability in 2025. This is pretty incredible for a company that has less than $10 million in revenues just 10 months ago. At a time line, we may be approaching a period of recession and deflation, it is important to note that HEALWELL is a technology company that is serving the life sciences sector with very steady resilient and defensive revenue streams. This includes doctors, commissions and hospitals for its co-pilot products and the pharmaceutical industry with its real world evidence, scientific research and clinical trials orchestration services. We expect to exercise our call option within the next few quarters, which will further increase growth, economic and voting interest in the company and will end up period of [indiscernible] the unrealized gains on our books.\nAs for the adjusted net income, which adjusts out all unrealized gains such as the HEALWELL share gains recorded in our IFRS net income, it is important to note that we are making progress. I like to point out that last year in Q2 2023, we recorded adjusted net income of $14.4 million. However, this included a onetime realized benefit of $3.5 million worth of income associated with the termination of a management contract by one of the divestment partners of CRH\n[indiscernible] asset. They typically retain a management contract that provides online management fees. If such a contract is terminated, it accelerates the management fees owning. If one were to normalize for this onetime income last year, we see a 13% year-over-year increase to this year's adjusted net income of $12.3 million.\nAs I pointed out earlier by Hamed, WELL is extremely focused on it's per share performance metrics. It has had significant success with its revenue per share going from $0.16 per share in Q1 2021 to over $1 share -- per share as of Q2 2024. But we're much more focused on our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted shareholder EBITDA which removes the noncontrolled interest as well as free cash flow available to shareholders, which we consider to be the most important metric to track as a capital allocator.\nWELL achieved free cash flow to shareholders of $8.7 million in Q2 2024. You'll notice that this shows a sequential decline compared to Q1 2024. This is mainly due to a fact that in Q2, we made 50% of our interest payments for the year for our convertible debentures in the amount of $1.9 million. Also, we were expecting to receive $2.3 million in tax credit in Q2, which were late and actually arrived just a few days ago here in Q3.\nIt is important to note that our Q2 2024 would have been closer to $11 million with these credits added, which would have been a 17% year-over-year increase. We're continuing to maintain our current guidance for free cash flow available to shareholders of approximately $55 million for the year, representing a 30% year-over-year increase, mainly achieved through cost optimization efforts. This is typically important given the current inflationary environment as we do also expect interest rate reductions in the coming months. We're projecting that an expected reduction in interest rates in the coming months will also help with our cash flow.\nIn the past, our focus on M&A has led us to rely on dilution to support our strategy. However, most of this solution has been associated with our acquisitions in previous years rather than our most recent ones, which is evidenced in the decline of our earn-out payments.\nIn 2022, we settled approximately $65.2 million in earn-outs and vendor take back notes and a 10.2% share dilution. In 2023, we reduced our deferred acquisition cost payments by about 55% to $29.4 million and reduce our dilution to 4.4%. Looking forward in 2024, our current expectation is that earn-out payments will further decline by another 20% to approximately $23.5 million, resulting in share dilution of around 3.3% in 2024.\nAs you can see, most of that has already been incurred, and we are only expecting a 30.6% dilution for the balance of the year. Our largest remaining major earn-outs pertain to Ocean, DoctorCare and MyHealth, as we have not committed to a new material earn-out arrangement since 2021. As you can see, next year, we have a $10 million decline in performance earn-out payables and then again a major drop of another $10 million to a very small amount in 2027.\nPlease keep in mind that our performance earn-outs are tied to performance, so we would only be paying these projected figures if assets such as MyHealth, Ocean and DoctorCare, continue to perform, which we expect will be the case.\nTo further decrease our dilution, we are working on moving our employee incentive programs to be more cash based rather than share-based compensation programs, which we expect will result in an over 60% decline in share-based compensation awards in 2024 as compared to 2023, where we have some [indiscernible] plans that exceeded our normal course of grant schedule. We expect this will further decline in 2025.\nWhile we have increased our cash expenses, we are maintaining previous EBITDA and free cash flow guidance, which was recently increased last quarter. In Q2, there were no new incentive shares issued in the quarter. In terms of our share capitalization, as you can see, WELL actually reduced its 40 diluted shares outstanding in Q2 2024. This is because we paid out all our time-based earn-out in cash and did not issue any new incentive shares in Q2 and WELL also purchase and returned 119,000 shares to tertiary in Q2 2024.\nLast year, during Q2 2023, we have issued about 389,000 shares for acquisitions and earn-out payments. Following along with the focus of reducing share dilution as of the end of Q2 2024, the company has used its approved NCIB to repurchase 163,500 shares at an average price of $3.83. Our repurchases are methodical and continuos as we believe that this -- they demonstrate a key focus on managing and reducing share dilution. Our intent is to continue to repurchase shares in the coming months and to extend our strategic alternatives processes, yield additional cash resources.\nWe will undertake to increase our buyback rate as the company's Board of Directors believe WELL current share price does not adequately reflect the underlying value based on WELL's business prospects and financial position.\nLooking at our balance sheet at the end of Q2 2024. While in the Q2 2024 with a solid balance sheet, as of June 30, 2024, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $46.5 million. WELL continues to be understanding and fully compliant with all companies related with its 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and World Bank in Canada. The debt on the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 289 million as of June 30, 2024. [indiscernible] at the U.S. dollar did strengthen during the period, so it's important to note that we were able to reduce our U.S. debt facility USD 152.3 billion to USD 148.8 million during the quarter.\nWhilst shareholder leverage ratio was 2.67x as at the end of Q2 2024 compared to 2.75x as at the end of Q1 2024. We defined leverage ratio as net bank debt less cash on hand, divided by shareholder adjusted EBITDA.\nOn a constant currency basis, our leverage ratio was 2.65x. [indiscernible] includes our convertible debentures, which are turned out for more than 2 years, our leverage ratio would be approximately 3.45x. Given our trajectory of improved EBITDA and capital efficiency, we are projecting improvements to our leverage ratio over the next couple of quarters.\nLastly, one housekeeping item before I turn the call back to Hamed. I wanted to provide some additional commentary on the buildup in our accounts receivable [indiscernible]. As we noted previously, the CRH Anesthesia business has experienced delays in cash collections on anesthesia claims, including delay billing and as a result of this billing change health care, who experienced -- who's experiencing a cybersecurity incident in February 2024.\nCRH has continued to provide anesthesia [indiscernible] outage. And as a result, accounts receivable relating to these claims has increased. Understanding the significant business interruption this has caused, [indiscernible] Healthcare has provided advanced funding to CRH in lieu of the cash collections CRH would normally [indiscernible] related to these claims with the expectation that upon resuming normal billing and collection activities. The advanced funding will be replayed as cash collections from payers and patients [indiscernible] received.\nGiven the contractual terms underlying advanced funding received, these funds have been recorded within other liability as at June 30, 2024, totaling USD 58 million. Hence the related increase in other liabilities during the quarter, which offset the increase in accounts receivables.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. Performance of our Canadian Patient Services business has been exceptionally strong, generating $76.7 million in revenue in Q2 2024. We an increase of 42% from Q2 2023 and is ahead of our previous guidance of achieving $300 million in revenue in 2024.\nLet's first look at the primary care segment as part of our Patient Services group. The company's primary care business unit generated revenue of $45.5 million in Q2 2024, an increase of 83% compared to Q2 2023. This increase relates primarily to the acquisitions of MCI, Ontario and Alberta based medical clinics and the large Manitoba Clinic as well as strong organic growth in existing clinics, including the impact from clinic absorptions over the past 12 months.\nWe are now very closely watching our 2023 cohort of clinic absorptions and acquisitions. Included in the 2023 cohort is the large Manitoba Clinic and the MCI Ontario clinics. Recall these clinics were not profitable and caused downward pressure on our EBITDA margins in Q4 of 2023. I'm proud to announce that the digitization and transformation efforts at these clinics running ahead of plan. And as of today, both Manitoba Clinic and MCI Ontario clinics are running at positive adjusted EBITDA. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase EBITDA margins of these clinics over the next year.\nOur outlook for primary care continues to look strong for the third quarter and beyond, notwithstanding the transformation and digitization work that we are doing on the acquired Shoppers Drug Mart clinics, which have had a temporary negative impact on our P&L. As we go through the process of digitizing and modernizing these clinics, we expect them to become profitable in 2024. And in fact, we are ahead of plan with our work as we are almost at breakeven at these clinics.\nNote that we have owned them for less than 100 days. And when we purchased them, they were significantly negative. So we're very pleased at the progress that we've made here. I will reiterate that we believe primary care will maintain strong absolute and organic growth through 2024 and beyond. Our recruitment absorption and M&A pipelines are very strong and have more than 50 clinics in various stages of pre-LOI DD, LOI and post LOI DD. We believe this is directly correlated with the challenges doctors are feeling in the marketplace and WELL growing brand recognition and ability to execute.\nAnd now a few words about WELL Health Diagnostic centers. WELL Health Diagnostics had a very strong Q2 2024, achieving a total of 172,000 patient visits and record quarterly revenue of $31.2 million, an increase of 7% compared to Q2 2023. Q2 has historically been and continues to be our strongest quarter in this line of business. This performance was driven by organic growth from the expansion of services as well -- and health care providers.\nWe note that both adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to the same quarter in the prior year due to the higher-than-normal EBITDA in the second quarter of 2023 as a result of higher diagnostic consultations in our high-margin nuclear medicine line of business and availability of materials, and lower direct costs due to stock incentives provided to physicians to our earn-out partners of the company, which also occurred in Q2 2023.\nSecond quarter is seasonally our strongest quarter, which is followed by a slower third quarter. For the full year 2024, we are expecting that our WELL Health Diagnostic centers to achieve another year of record revenue and EBITDA. In addition, Cancer Care Ontario has decreased the eligibility age of breast cancer screening from 50 to 40 years of age, which comes into effect in the fall of 2024. This should result in a material increase in demand in mammography screening and overall improvement in Ontario patient care in Q4.\nIn terms of M&A, we continue to have strong discussions with various players in the industry with the hopes and intentions of expanding our diagnostic centers to more provinces and sites in 2024 as well as in Ontario.\nI'll now discuss our U.S. businesses. First, WELL Health USA, which includes CRH and provider staffing. WELL USA increased revenue in Q2 2024 to $93.3 million compared to $63.4 million in Q2 in the previous year. Last year's EBITDA included $4.7 million in revenue directly related with divestment-related impact. If one were to adjust -- Eva has referenced this in her [indiscernible]. If one were to adjust for this, adjusted EBITDA would have increased 7% to $19.6 million.\nCRH has completed the first half of the year now with a full year of integration and operations following the July 2023 acquisition of CarePlus Management. You will recall CarePlus included a traditional practice of anesthesia serving 14 locations. These have now been fully integrated and operate under CRH Anesthesia. CarePlus Management also included the radar provider staffing business, which is a premier and trusted staffing and locum tenens business, specializing in anesthesia across the lower 48 states.\nThis business continues to be extremely complementary to CRH's legacy anesthesia business and provides high revenue growth along with many operating synergies. We expect growth of this segment to continue within anesthesia as well as our plans to expand to other health care specialties.\nDue to health insurance and payer mix shifts, along with patient deductibility -- deductibles, pardon me, generally being met in the last half of the year, we expect both growth and profitability to accelerate in the second half of the year, in line with our seasonal norms.\nAnd now for Circle Medical, where growth accelerated in Q2. Circle's revenue surged to $32 million in Q2 2024, an increase of 53% compared to Q2 2023. It's important to note that we're seeing this along with margin expansion, which is generally not what our competitors are seeing in the industry. Gross margins grew by 500 basis points from 49.4% to 54.4% on a year-over-year basis. Comparatively, if you look at Teladoc, for example, they're citing higher customer acquisition costs which is putting pressure on their margins, while Circle Medical is experiencing lower customer acquisition costs.\nCircle's organic growth was driven by strong patient acquisition, coupled with an expansion of its provider network, we now -- which now consists of 547 medical providers. Looking beyond Q2, the future looks bright. You may have seen that we released a corporate update specifically to update shareholders on Circle Medical yesterday and the company announced that its revenue in July was a record $8.87 million, representing more than 60% increase compared to the same month last year.\nThis means that Circle Medical has now achieved and exceeded the important milestone of USD 100 million run rate while maintaining gross margins of approximately 55%. The company has positioned itself for continued growth with key hires and partnerships. In particular, it is increasing its investment in AI technologies with a focus on leveraging its growing base of data to deliver better care at scale.\nIn July, Circle hired its Head of AI, Miguel Jete. Miguel has over 20 years experience in the field of AI and he most recently was the VP of AI at Rev, a speech technology company, where he built the world's most accurate speech to text engine and previously served as speech scientist at Nuance. Miguel will also lead the company's partnership with Mila, Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute. Mila is the world's largest academic research center for deep learning, bringing together over 1,200 specialized researchers in machine learning.\nAnother key hire is the return of Brent LaRue to Circle Medical in the role of VP product and Patient Experience. Brent's returned to circle signals a renewed focus on product design as a core competency, which will drive further usage and engagement.\nFor Q3, we expect another record revenue quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA as the business goes from strength to strength and we will -- and we reiterate our previous guidance of Circle expecting to be positive EBITDA for the year.\nAnd now an update on Wisp. I'm pleased to report that Wisp reported adjusted -- positive adjusted EBITDA in Q2 '24 with revenue of $24.3 million, an increase of 27% from Q2 2023. More importantly, it improved its profitability with adjusted EBITDA increasing 225% compared to Q2 last year. Adjusted gross margins improved this quarter compared to the same quarter last year due to better pricing negotiations with pharmacy partners as well as prior margins were negatively impacted by significant outage at one of the company's main pharmacy partners.\nAs far as product development is concerned, Wisp has been very busy with its fertility vertical with pre IVF prescription offering. Wisp also launched its new UTI CareKit, while also expanding at home diagnostics, which will be foundational to establishing a longitudinal care model in key new product launches by the end of the year.\nIn July Wisp [indiscernible] was also launched and has seen strong early traction as an annual membership program where patients can access discounts on products as well as exclusive services, think Amazon Prime for Wisp. For Q3, we expect Wisp to see continued growth as the business ramps up marketing spend to lean into summer seasonality.\nAnd finally, our SaaS and services Provider Solutions business. Our SaaS and technology business experienced a revenue increase of 27% in Q2 2024 compared to the previous year. primarily due to the company's cybersecurity division, where external revenue increased by $4.2 million due to acquisitions and timing of larger software project awards. Excluding cybersecurity, revenue from the continuing platform business, meaning excluding IntraHealth, which was sold to HEALWELL in Q1, increased by 22% to $10.4 million. It should be noted that all increases in revenue in this segment were almost entirely organic as there have been no material acquisitions in the last year.\nOn July 10, 2024, we announced the approval of a historic $44 million project, Health Compass II, the largest digital supercluster project ever awarded in advance -- to advance AI-powered tech enablement for care providers. This initiative led by WELL and its consortium partners aims to enhance AI and interoperability in Canadian health care. As a lead commercialization partner and first customer, we will provide expertise and interoperability, enabling the development of new AI tools to support health care providers.\nFurthermore, this quarter, we announced a 5-year collaboration with Microsoft to enhance digital health care across North America, integrating Microsoft's cloud and AI with WELL's platform. This partnership focuses on elevating WELL's scalability and operational efficiency, aiming to transform health care delivery for large enterprises, including the public sector. The collaboration will also modernize WELL's cloud infrastructure, optimize costs, secure data and integrate Azure OpenAI service to advance health care solutions. .\nBefore closing, I want to talk about our path to control investments with HEALWELL AI. When WELL cofounded HEALWELL AI just 10 months ago, its revenues were less than $10 million. The company now has just shy of 400 employees and has surpassed a $65 million revenue run rate, as Eva mentioned earlier, and has provided guidance to approach $100 million by the end of the year, setting the stage for being profitable in 2025, which will be just in time for us to complete our path to control.\nThe company has significantly increased its balance sheet at just this past quarter between reductions in liabilities and new capital injected, there was $43 million of positive impact to its balance sheet. More importantly, the company has established itself as a leader in leveraging artificial intelligence to unlock the value of data for 2 key audiences: health care workers who need co-pilot technologies to better detect disease and pharmaceutical companies who need better real-world evidence and improvements to their research and development processes, leading to better clinical trials orchestration.\nIn fact, HEALWELL is starting to do for CROs or clinical research organizations, what WELL has been doing for health care clinics, which is to modernize and digitize them. This is a trend that we believe will drive the company to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and significant profits in the coming years.\nHEALWELL CRO has already served more than 250 pharmaceutical clients. When one starts to combine the ability for HEALWELL AI to find patients, and support the pharmaceutical industry with the next-generation patient finding technology with the vast network of clinical data at WELL, together, we have something truly valuable and globally relevant.\nWe're pleased to remind shareholders that WELL has a call option on 30 million multi-voting shares of HEALWELL, which will give WELL voting control over the company when exercised. We anticipate doing this at some point in time in 2025. HEALWELL will continue to operate as a stand-alone public company, but we will then add all of HEALWELL's top and bottom line activity to WELL's IFRS statements. We look forward to this.\nIn summary, we're very pleased with our financial performance thus far in 2024 and look forward to delivering strong results for the remainder of the year. Our outlook remains very positive. Hence, we are improving our guidance as previously noted. We have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can execute on our objectives, including our very important strategic initiatives designed to realize sum of parts value, which we believe is central to our plan to drive shareholder value.\nFinally, I want to thank you all for joining us on this call and joining us on this journey. We're thrilled that we get a chance to speak to you and do our best to deliver shareholder value, we're confident that with your support, we will be successful together.\nI would like to thank WELL's senior management team and all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort, in particular, I'd like to thank our team of health care providers and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care. They are the true heroes of our business, and it's our honor to support them.\nAnd with that, we'd be pleased to take some questions. Operator?"

First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Sylvie, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of well's control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management's discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. We're extremely pleased to be with you and discuss Q1 2024, a quarter in which we achieved our 21st consecutive record-breaking revenue. We're also pleased to note another record this was a record-breaking net profit performance in any Q1 period in terms of IFRS net income as well as adjusted net income.\nAs the first conference call for fiscal 2024, we believe this is an important opportunity to update our guidance for revenue and EBITDA while rolling out brand new guidance for free cash flow generation and provide commentary around our improving cash flow per share metrics, demonstrating the strength of our platform and the momentum of our business. The first quarter of 2024 exceeded all expectations, and we're proud to report that we've begun the year with an intense focus on enhanced profitability and capital efficiency and are happy to report an 11% year-over-year shareholders per share metric. I will speak more to this later as it is thematically very important to today's call.\nYou see, we believe we reached an inflection point in the history of the company, where due to the hard work and dedication of our team members and care providers and especially due to our hard work in Q1 2024, where we reduced the significant amount of costs. We can now reduce our share issuances significantly and instead leverage our own cash flow to grow our business, as well as attract and retain the best and brightest people. You may have noticed that we recently started using our stock buyback or normal course issuer bid.\nWhile the number of shares we're buying on a daily basis are not very material as compared to our overall float at roughly $10,000 per day, we want to make sure shareholders understand that this is the beginning of a sustained and purposeful pattern that speaks to optimizing our share structure and reducing share issuances of all kinds, including stock-based compensation, while growing and optimizing our free cash flow available to shareholders. This year, we're absolutely determined to deliver our best cash flow generation performance of our history as well as the lowest amount of dilution since I started the company just over 6 years ago.\nWhile our optimism does stem from a lot of hard work on cost reduction and improved integration, it does also come from sustained and elevated organic growth. We're pleased to report that we achieved organic growth of 13.5% year-over-year with approximately 3.5% contribution from absorptions. As such, you will see over time that our stock buyback is symbolically and thematically very important as it ushers in a new period that we expect to be the norm, a period where that would be characterized by sustained growth in cash flow and improvements in reducing and then reversing dilution.\nBefore I get into the financials, I will first review some key operational metrics. At the end of Q1 2024, 3,900 well providers and clinicians were delivering care across our physical and virtual clinics. [Audio Gap] [ 6,000 ] providers benefiting from our SaaS and technology services that is more than 1/3 of all providers in the country, which we believe will continue to increase materially over time. WELL achieved a record 1.3 million patient visits in Q1 2024, an increase of 34% as compared to the previous year and representing 5.2 million patient visits on an annualized run rate basis. Canadian visits grew by 45%, while U.S. visits grew by 23%. Meanwhile, total patient interactions increased to a total -- to a record 2 million interactions in Q1, an increase of 43% as compared to the previous year.\nTurning to our guidance for 2024 due to the strength that we're seeing we're pleased to increase our annual revenue guidance to between $960 million and $980 million. This increase in guidance reflects the recently absorbed 10 new clinics from Shoppers Drug Mart. We're also improving our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance to be in the upper range of the $125 million to $130 million range we provided last quarter.\nIn support of our operating plan for 2024, we have strategically implemented comprehensive cost-cutting measures, including a streamlined approach to staff restructuring increased utilization of AI and technology for process improvement and optimization, consolidation of suppliers and tighter integration of our business units. These initiatives have not only strengthened our operational efficiency, but resulted in millions of dollars of annualized cost savings, which really permit us to continue our strong growth and limit our dilution. In addition, we're providing new additional guidance for improving free cash flow available to shareholders to over $55 million in 2024, which would reflect an increase of 30% from $42.4 million in 2023. Eva will provide some additional color on this later in the call.\nBut before I turn the call over to her, I'd like to highlight some key themes. One, the strategic alterative process for our U.S. digital health app, our clinic absorption model in Canada; and three, the success of our clinic transformation program. Let's first talk about the strategic alternatives for Circle and Wisp. Last quarter, we indicated that we've begun considering strategic alternatives for Circle and Wisp. We're pleased to report that we've hired 2 different global banks as advisers for each of Circle Medical and Wisp to help us with this process, and we believe that we should have important updates on this by the end of the year.\nYou may be asking why are we seeking strategic alternatives for 2 successful high-growth businesses. Our primary reason is that WELL has a call option for both of these businesses, which provides us with several alternatives, including acquiring the remaining ownership of the businesses, seeking [Audio Gap] for both businesses extend to and conclude in the Q4 time frame of this year. The second reason for seeking strategic alternatives is that mining a fair value for these 2 assets. Both Circle and Wisp are high-growth businesses that are operating at lower EBITDA operating margins than the rest of WELL due to their maturity, while investors today are primarily valuing the entire WELL business as a multiple of EBITDA. Hence, both Circle and Wisp are essentially hidden within the larger well company valuation. We believe that unlocking the value of water, both of these assets could result in a significant cash benefit to WELL shareholder which we will use to reduce our debt, issue a special buyback and/or allocate funds into new funds producing businesses in the Canadian market, where we have a greater synergy potential given our market leadership. As such, we believe this could be -- prove to be a positive catalyst for WELL and returning value to WELL shareholders.\nI want to reiterate that we are very pleased with the success of both [indiscernible]. Recall, when we announced our agreement to acquire a majority position in Circle in September of 2022. It was at an approximately $5 million revenue run rate in U.S. dollars and this year Circle is expected to achieve approximately USD 100 million in revenues. Meanwhile, Wisp had an approximately $30 million revenue run rate, when we acquired a majority stake in the company and this year is expected to achieve around USD 76 million in revenues or approximately CAD 100 million, demonstrating unquestionable value creation through our capital allocation strategy and execution.\nFor the second theme, I'll provide an update on our clinic absorption and acquisition program in Canada. While current pipeline of new clinic opportunities consists of almost 40 clinics under an LOI agreement, of which 10 of these clinics would be actionable under our clinic absorption model, where we absorb clinics into the WELL network and the remaining 30 clinics would be under our regular M&A bolt-on program. Under the clinic absorption model, we are acquiring clinics for nominal cash costs in the range of less than 0.02x revenue multiple compared to our regular M&A program where we may pay up to 0.5x revenue multiple or in the range of 3x to 5x EBITDA.\nThe clinic obstruction model is a very unique opportunity for WELL. Under this absorption model we take over the lease and the staff of the clinic and the doctors join our network. There's minimal upfront capital costs in most of these cases, but there can be some relatively minor costs to secure data protection and improve IT. We're able to absorb these clinics for nominal purchase consideration because the doctors are facing such significant technology challenges, administrative burdens that -- they don't want to run their own clinics and just want to focus on providing care. We believe the consolidation and digitization of over 20,000 primary care diagnostic allied health and longevity clinics across Canada is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with over 15 clinics operating in 97 facilities across Canada, WELL is the clear market share leader. Yet we just represent just shy of 1% market share of the $35 billion market opportunity physician spending, which is a key component of the $330 billion spent every year in all health care costs across Canada. We believe that the Canadian market continues to be an enormous untapped opportunity for [Audio Gap]. We have conviction that we can grow our Canadian business to multiples of its current size in the near future.\nThe third theme is the success of our clinic digitization and transformation program. When we acquire or absorb primary care clinics, they're typically operating at 1% to 3% EBITDA margins. The large Manitoba clinic and the MCI Ontario clinics that we acquired in Q4 were actually operating at a negative EBITDA margin. [Audio Gap] billing improvements as well as our AI suite of products, which are unmatched by any market participants. Our goal is to get these clinics to operating in the 5% to 10% EBITDA margin range within the first year and to over 10% margins within 18 to 24 months. This is not easy. [Audio Gap]. The original cohort of 18 clinics in BC that we acquired from Dr. Franco in 2018 is now operating at over 13% EBITDA margins. Comparatively, the cohort that we acquired in 2022 achieved over 10% EBITDA margins within 18 months and are now operating at over 12% EBITDA margins.\nWe are now very closely watching absorptions and acquisitions. Included in the 2023 cohort is the large Manitoba clinic and NCI Ontario Clinic. These clinics were not profitable and caused downward pressure on our EBITDA margins in Q4. I'm pleased to announce that the digitization and transformation efforts at these clinics is running ahead of plan. And as of today, both Manitoba and MCI Ontario are now running at positive adjusted EBITDA. Going forward, we expect to continue to increase adjusted EBITDA margins at these clinics over the next year.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will provide some financial context I'll then come back and provide further commentary on our business units and outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024. I won't go into details of the financials as they are available on SEDAR+ and on our press release this morning. Instead, I'll touch on our new disclosure in the financial statement and MD&A and our plan to issue less shares this year. First, on our new financial disclosures. At the beginning of this year, we solicited feedback from analysts, shareholders and capital market advisers on how we can improve our financial reporting disclosures.\nBased on this feedback, this quarter, we have included adjusted EBITDA in our segment note in the financial statements. Also in our MD&A [Audio Gap] segmented adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA for all our business units. We believe this will help investors better track margin developments around each line of business and determined that our margin changes as of the last year are more as a result of the blend with new M&A rather than a secular change in any of our margins.\nNow on our plan to issue less shares this year. Last quarter, we indicated that we have a preference for preserving cash rather than issuing shares. We wanted to revisit this and advise that as Hamed noted earlier, we believe we have generally reached a fairly significant inflection point in how we [Audio Gap] given the continued growth of our business as well as the successful cost optimization program, we started executing on in Q1, we will be favoring paying cash over share issuance for M&A purposes as well as looking to materially reduce our share-based compensation moving forward.\nWorld experienced about a 10% share dilution in 2022 as a result of share issuance for all equity issuance, including share incentives for employees earn-out payments, acquisitions and equity financing. Comparatively, our total share dilution declined to 4% in 2023 and we are expecting to reduce this by double-digit percentage in 2024. This is before consideration of our normal course issuer bid or NCIB buybacks which may be increased over time depending on any significant improvements to our cash flows and/or if we were to successfully unlock the value from 1 or more of our U.S. digital assets.\nAs of May 7, we have bought back 75,300 shares under NCIB. We are also switching our employee incentive programs to be more cash-based versus share based which we expect will result in a significant reduction in new share incentive grants in 2024 as compared to 2023. This again will result in a corresponding decrease in stock-based compensation expense this year compared to last year.\nIn terms of our earn-out commitment, in 2023, we settled approximately $29.4 million in earn-outs and vendor take backs, which was a 55% decline from $65.2 million in earn-out and vendor take backs resettled in the prior year 2022. Looking forward in 2024, our current expectation is that earn-out payments will further decline by another 20% to approximately $23 million. In addition, this reduction in earnout payments will have a favorable impact on [Audio Gap] that is issued on a earnout payments.\nIt is also important to note that as of the end of Q1, we've already paid down the vast majority of our earn-outs for the year and are not planning significant share issuance for earn-out payments in the balance of the year. So with improving revenue, EBITDA and cash flow and while reducing our share issuance, this should result in an improvement in our per share metrics.\nLooking at our balance sheet at the end of Q1 2024, while ended Q1 2024 with a solid balance sheet. As of March 31, 2024, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of [Audio Gap] ending and fully compliant with all covenants related with this 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and World Bank in Canada. The debt from the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 303 million as of March 31, 2024. Gross net debt to shareholder ratio for the 2 credit lines was 2.75x as at the end of Q1 2024, in line with 2.69x as at the end of Q4 2023. On a constant currency basis, the net debt to shareholder ratio actually remained unchanged compared to Q4 2023 at 2.69x.\nWe define net debt to shareholder EBITDA ratio as net debt, less cash on hand divided by adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders. We exclude convertible debentures from this calculation because convertible debentures are not included in our bank covenants. If we include our convertible debentures, which mature at the end of 2026, we will be at approximately 3.51x levered. In terms of our share capitalization, as of May 7, 2024, WELL have 263,875,048 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. Before I get into the individual business units, I wanted to elaborate on Eva's comments about reducing our share dilution. This is what I refer to as the fourth and most important key theme for today's call, our commitment to delivering improved shareholder value. The best expression for this commitment is closely looking at and tracking our per share metrics. While our revenue per share and EBITDA per share metrics have generally been favorable as a capital allocation company, we're quite focused on our cash flow per share available to shareholders. This metric is the gold standard in terms of delivering and exemplifying shareholder value.\nWe're pleased to report that in Q1 2024, we've increased cash flow per share available to shareholders more than a 10% increase from the same period last year. This shows that while we have experienced some increases in share count, we've managed to grow our cash flow to overcompensate for this. Moving forward, given that we have improved our cost efficiency in Q1 and are working to further reduce our dilution, we expect cash flow per share figures to increase materially throughout the year. In fact, we expect notable percentage increases in the next 3 quarters and more significant increases each year moving forward.\nSimply put, we've reached an exciting inflection point with the company where our earnouts are decreasing, our cash flows are increasing and our share issuances are dramatically decreasing and eventually reversing. This has the effect of substantially improving shareholder value contributing improved cash flow per share metrics.\nI might add that above dynamic that we just discussed about will be true irrespective of the interest rate environment. If rates start coming down, this will have the effect of increasing our cash flow even more, which will improve these figures. It also doesn't assume any progress or specific outcomes with respect to our strategic alternatives initiatives that we discussed earlier in the call. If any of those initiatives results in liquidity for the company, our cash flow would improve as we would likely significantly reduced our interest costs by paying down more debt and buying more stock.\nIn the past, we had a strategy [Audio Gap] acquisition and structuring our deals and earnouts with the help of share issuances, but now that WELL's cash flows have improved, organic growth has sustainably increased and the company has matured, we are in a phase of the company where we have a preference for using cash, then shares for acquisitions, earnouts and employee incentive programs. Of course, that preference is also partially readed to our own stock price. And at the moment, we feel that we are deeply undervalued given our operational performance as compared to our peers.\nI will now provide some specific commentary on our individual business units. First, our Canadian Patient Services business. which is now overseen by Dr. Michael Frankel, our Chief Medical Officer. This division includes our primary care business and our wealth diagnostic centers previously referred to as MyHealth. WELL owns and operates the largest network of clinics across Canada with physical facilities in the 5 most popular provinces of Canada, namely Ontario, Quebec, BC, Alberta and Manitoba providing multiple services, including primary care, diagnostic Allied Health, Specialty Care and longevity medical services. Performance of our Canadian patient services business has been exceptionally strong, generating $75.7 million in revenue in Q1, an increase of 49% from the previous year and is ahead of our previous guidance of achieving $300 million [ by ] 2024, which had already reflected a 30% increase over 2023.\nCanadian Patient Services generated adjusted EBITDA of $11.3 million for the quarter, representing 15% EBITDA margin and from Q1 of last year. In addition, EBITDA generated in Canada primarily goes to shareholder EBITDA given the small noncontrolled interest that we have in the Canadian market. Let's look a bit closer at the primary care segment. Our primary care business unit includes family practice, walk-in clinics, virtual care, allied health and longevity services. The company's primary care business unit [Audio Gap] of 83% as compared to the same period last year. This increase relates primarily to the acquisitions of MCI Ontario and Alberta-based medical clinics and the large Manitoba clinic as well as strong organic growth of 35% and which includes same clinic growth as well as impact from our clinic absorption program.\nOur outlook for primary care continues to look strong for the second quarter and beyond, notwithstanding the transformation and digital work that we will be doing on the acquired Shoppers Drug Mart clinics, which will have a planned and temporary negative impact on our P&L. As we go through the process of digitizing and modernizing these clinics, we expect them to be profitable in 2024. Our longevity business has had a great start since announcing this in Q4 of last year. We've already generated close to $1 billion in new higher-margin revenues in Q1 2024 as compared to $6.6 million in Q1 2023. And while this is a young program, we believe we've created a truly special and scientifically relevant program that is helping patients with their preventative health goals.\nAnd now for a few words about WELL Health diagnostic centers. WELL Health Diagnostics had a very strong Q1, achieving record number of patient visits and record revenue of $30.4 million, an increase of 17% on compared to the same period last year. It is performed by organic growth from the expansion of services and a number of health care providers, which allows us to serve more patients. Q1 was also boosted by some onetime positive reimbursement, which won't be repeated in Q2. For 2024, we're expecting our WELL Health diagnostic centers to achieve another year of record revenue and EBITDA. We anticipate expanding cardiology services in Q2 to address the growing demand while recruiting more physicians. This will allow for increased demand for cardiology consultations and diagnostic services.\nAnd in terms of M&A, we're now seeing acquisition multiples finally start to moderate in this segment and become more reasonable on specialized care and diagnostic M&A opportunities. We're looking forward to expanding our diagnostic centers to more provinces in 2024 and beyond.\nAnd now I'll discuss the outlook for our WELL Health USA business. First, CRH and provider staffing. CRH Medical entered 2024 and the first quarter after fully integrating its 2023 midyear acquisition of CarePlus management, which included radar provider staffing business. As a reminder, provider staffing is a premier and trusted staffing and locum tenens business, specializing in anesthesia. It provides recruitment and placement services along with temporary staffing, its national network of provider groups, hospitals and ASCs across the lower 48 states. This business is extremely complementary to CRH's legacy anesthesia business and provides high revenue growth along with many operating [indiscernible]. We expect growth of this segment to continue with anesthesia as well as plans to expand to other health care specialties.\nQ1 is typically CRH's weakest seasonal quarter in both revenue and margins due to health insurance and payer mix shifts, along with the renewal of patient deductibles coinciding with year-end. With that in mind, Q1 revenue for the CRH business unit, which includes both anesthesia and [indiscernible] banding was still up 7.4% year-over-year. Also, last year's Q1 included some onetime revenue, which was not repeated this year. We're expecting Q2 revenue to be in line with Q1 levels for both CRH and provider staffing with growth and profitability accelerating into the second half of 2024 as expected.\nAnd now on to Circle Medical. In Q1, Circle Medical saw continued growth in patient visits, an impressive uptick of 32% year-over-year with patient volumes growing from 133,000 to 175,000. Concurrently, revenues surged to $28.7 million in Q1, an increase of 24% as compared to the same period last year. For Q2, we expect another record revenue quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA. We reiterate our previous guidance of Circle expecting [Audio Gap] with improved margins as compared to last year. Some highlights about the Circle Medical business.\nDuring Q1, Circle launched virtual care in 8 new states, bringing their total number of active states of 38. Also Circle's pioneering AI scribe product developed in-house is currently undergoing beta testing with 15 providers and is anticipated to broaden its reach. The platform is slated to deploy to this product to 100 providers in the summer promising enhanced accuracy in medical documentation and time savings for providers. Circle has a compelling AI-inspired product development pipeline, and we look forward to updating shareholders as more products and features are released.\nAnd now a bit of focus on Wisp. I'm pleased to report that Wisp reported adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2024 with revenue of $21.1 million and an increase of 13% from Q1 2023. More importantly, with improved its profitability with adjusted EBITDA increasing 213% as compared to Q1 last year. For Q2, we expect Wisp to see continued growth as the business ramps up marketing spend and continue to lean in on new product development with plans to launch its fertility vertical in June as well as new membership program. With increase in Q2, we expect adjusted EBITDA levels in will decline in Q2 from the level in Q1.\nFinally, our SaaS and technology services business. Our SaaS and technology business units experienced a revenue decline of approximately 20% in Q1 as compared to last year. This was almost entirely driven by less onetime software project revenue in our cyber security division, which tends to be fairly lumpy. However, despite the sale of InterHealth on February 1, 2024, recurring or highly reoccurring external revenue across the SaaS and Technology Services business unit increased by 13% to $11.9 million, strong organic growth in our platform businesses, including Ocean MD.\nDuring Q3 2023, we announced that Ocean MD signed a $38.5 million contract with the province of BC. We've already received onetime consulting and project revenue under this contract and we expect to go live with e-referrals in BC in the coming weeks, at which time we'll also begin to receive recurring subscription revenue. In addition, I'm pleased to know that Ocean MD is in the final stage negotiation with another Canadian [indiscernible] referral solution. Ocean MD is the dominant e-referral solution in Canada and is becoming recognized as the e-referral standard across the country.\nAnd now a little bit about our AI products. In 2023, we introduced well AI voice in AI in box administration and AI decision support. I'll start with AI decision support or wait as some people are starting to call it. This is our physician copilot that compliantly screens patient data and provides physicians with risk stratification and other actionable insights. By risk stratification is what we mean, is that it will segment by disease patients in a physician roster that are high, medium or low risk for a particular disease. This makes it very easy for physicians to scan and determine if there are any patients that are misdiagnosed underdiagnosed were completely undiagnosed for a particular disease, which is pretty incredible support for a physician.\nOur first-generation system was focused more on rare diseases. But with the second-generation version, we now have broadening out support to chronic diseases such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease and diabetes, both in the U.S. and Canada, more than half of all adults reported having one or more chronic diseases. Chronic diseases are the leading causes of risk and disability in both the U.S. and Canada. They're also the leading driver of health care costs. So adding chronic diseases is a game changer for well AI decision support. This is a very special co-pilot program, which is the leading product of its kind in Canada [Audio Gap]. It is powered by our investee and partner HEALWELL AI. More on HEALWELL later.\nWELL AI voice -- a little bit about WELL AI voice now. We discussed this product before. It is a leading medical transcribing product which significantly reduces administrative burden and enhances patient engagement, giving physicians valuable time back in their day. The strong adoption of WELL AI voice underscores its immense value to health care practitioners. having seamlessly integrated into over 131,000 patient consultations in 2023 and substantially enriching the quality of patient care. The 4 months into 2024, and we've already exceeded the entire previous year's volume of encounters with nearly 200,000 documented patient consultations. This growth represents savings of over 10,000 hours for physicians, highlighting our commitment to enhancing physician efficiency and patient care through our advanced AI capabilities.\nWELL AI voice is now operational in over pretty well clinics across Ontario and B.C. and plans for expansion into Alberta sum. This strategic rod is set to further our mission of supporting wealth physicians and extending our network's reach.\nAnd now a bit about WELL AI in Box administration. WELL AI and Box administration significantly reduces clinic administrative burden in facts and document handling. WELL AI Inbox is currently active in 117 clinics and processing over 40,000 faxes monthly. In Q1, WELL AI Inbox introduced full fax automation using AI technology, the application can now automatically file incoming fax documents directly into the patient chart and provider Inbox without any staff input. Based on an initial pilot, up to 50% of documents can be fully triage and assigned for provider review in the EMR, saving clinic admins up to 90% of their time. Overall, our technology platform services group continues to perform with the rollout of AI-based tools, expansion of Ocean referral solution and the continued execution by our EMR and billing solutions groups.\nI'd like to provide some additional commentary now on HEALWELL AI in our partnership. We've been very pleased with the performance of HEALWELL AI. Since it's debut launch on October 1, 2023, WELL has completed -- HEALWELL has completed 3 financings for a total of $29.9 million in convertible debt and equity and just launched what looks like will end up being a $20 million bought deal which will all together total approximately $50 million raised since October, just 7 months ago. HEALWELL has already, during this period of time, completed 2 acquisitions of intra-health and pentamer and made a minority investment in Dr. Lee. HEALWELL is currently on a $20 million revenue run rate, which is expected to more than double in the coming months with additional organic and organic growth based on what they've noted publicly.\nWELL currently owns 18% of the common shares of HEALWELL on a fully diluted basis, taking into consideration our convertible notes and warrants, WELL's ownership is approximately 27%. WELL also has a call option on 30 million multi-voting shares, which will provide WELL with over 40% of economic ownership and 72% of Class B voting shares [Audio Gap]. In summary, we're pleased to have this opportunity to showcase some of our latest thinking on the business including the inflection point we discussed earlier on how we think about our preference for cash usage versus share issuances. We're very focused on improving our free cash flow per share metric and believe that this metric will continue to demonstrate significant improvements throughout the year and beyond.\nOur outlook remains positive, [indiscernible] confident in upgrading our annual guidance and introducing new guidance for the first time on free cash flow generated to more than $55 million for the year. We hope the improvements in disclosure in this call and in our MD&A demonstrates that we're really committed to meeting the requirements of the analyst and investor community. If there's something that you believe is missing, please don't hesitate to reach out to your well Investor Relations team.\nBefore closing, I want to share some important updates with you. WELL Health is hosting its Annual General Meeting on June 12. This is a virtual AGM, and details can be found in our information circular, which will be filed on SEDAR in the coming weeks. We're also hosting an in-person Investor Day on June 18 at the Toronto Hilton Hotel. Details can be found under the Events section of our website.\nFinally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call today and thank our shareholders and investors for continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us that the funding needed to pursue our goals and we are working hard to return the favor and drive exceptional shareholder value. I'd also like to thank Wells senior management team, all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort, and in particular, I'd like to thank our team of talented health care practitioners and frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care.\nAnd with that, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please accommodate?"

My name is [ Ludi ], and I'll be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nManager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Annual Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of wealth control and that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and can be found in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may also use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our MD&A.\nThe company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to follow working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income and loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We hope that you're all keeping safe and healthy, and we appreciate everyone for joining us today. We're extremely pleased to be with you today and discuss our annual 2023 results, which was a record-breaking year in which we achieved record revenue, record adjusted EBITDA, record patient visits and positive net income. We achieved 36% overall revenue growth in 2023 with over 15% organic growth in the business, which includes clinics added to the network for nominal consideration as part of our clinic absorption program.\nWe remain committed to the company's continued focus on tech enabling health care providers and supporting them in simplifying their work lives, modernizing and digitizing their clinical practices and delivering the best health care possible. And this is evident in our increasing patient visits. During the year 2023, WELL delivered over 4.2 million patient visits to our physical and virtual clinics and a total of over 1.77 million patient interactions. WELL now serves more than 34,000 health care practitioners with our SaaS and technology services in Canada alone, which is equal to approximately more than one out of every three health care providers in the country.\nWe're extremely passionate about supporting our providers and every day we focus on supporting them better. This attitude and focus is what allows the company to continue to witness healthy growth across all business segments, including both online and in person care channels. We expect our strong performance to continue into 2024. We do not foresee any material influences or challenges that would impair our ability to deliver solid results in 2024 in any of our businesses as we are poised to maintain and even accelerate our growth without meaningful capital allocation while delivering on enhanced profitability, and I'm pleased to provide our 2024 annual guidance as follows: we are increasing our annual revenue guidance to be in the range of $950 million to $970 million, representing annual revenue growth of up to 25%. In the past, I've mentioned our goal of achieving $1 billion in revenue with the revenue guidance of $950 million to $970 million that I provided today, we're easily within reach of that $1 billion milestone.\nKeep in mind that this annual guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. Even though we're now favoring organic growth over acquisitions, we do continue to have a pipeline of mostly smaller tuck-in acquisition potentials and we expect a number of them will be completed this year, which should put us in a position to report that we crossed the $1 billion in revenue figure on a run rate basis by the end of 2024. For our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance, we expect to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million, representing annual growth of up to 15%. Comparatively, we achieved 8% growth in adjusted EBITDA in 2023 and 73% growth in 2022.\nAs you can see, our expected EBITDA growth is accelerating as our expected EBITDA growth is significantly higher than it was in 2023, and we expect this to happen with less capital allocation activity. Our improvements in EBITDA in 2024 are driven by several factors, but I'll quickly point out four of them. One, WELL has implemented a comprehensive cost optimization program to enhance its operational efficiency and profitability. This program has been implemented in both Canada and the United States and includes a streamlined approach to staff restructuring, increased utilization of technology and where possible, AI for process improvements and optimization, consolidation of suppliers, higher integration of our business units, and other cost optimization initiatives, which are expected to result in millions in annual cost savings; two, continued performance from our Canadian operations which experienced a 39% year-over increase in 4-wall EBITDA to $45.2 million.\nWe will talk a bit more about this later as our Canadian business has significant momentum. Three, last year's acquisitions of MCI and the large Manitoba clinics had a dampening effect on our EBITDA last year. However, our clinic transformation team and shared services teams are already hard at work in their efforts to optimize and digitize these clinics. And as such, we expect them to have improved margins and profitability in 2024. And four, in addition, the acquisition of CarePlus by WELL USA last year, which added incremental revenue and EBITDA to our core anesthesia business as well as our provider staffing services, which had a strong organic growth profile associated with it.\nWe expect strong cash flow generation in 2024 and given that we plan to focus more on organic growth, which includes our clinic absorption program and acquisition volume, we plan to use our positive cash flow to reduce debt levels this year, thereby also reducing our interest expense run rate. 2024 is also a significant milestone year for us as we have important time lines related to both our U.S. digital patient services businesses. Circle Medical and WISP.\nBoth of these businesses have call option and IPO registration option time line that expire in the near future unless extended and result -- and as a result of that, we've begun to partner with minority shareholders and management to consider strategic alternatives for both businesses, which could include a sale for one or both assets. Given how we believe this could be a key positive catalyst for WELL in terms of significantly delevering and returning value to shareholders.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials for fiscal 2023 and fourth quarter of 2023. I will then come back and provide further commentary on our business units. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Our overall annual financial results were as follows. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $776.1 million, compared to total revenue of $569.1 million for the prior year, an increase of 36%, driven by acquisitions and organic growth during the past year.\nWELL organic growth for the year was approximately 15%. Adjusted gross profit was $372.3 million in 2023, an increase of 23% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $303.3 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $113.4 million in 2023, an increase of 8% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $104.6 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA to WELL shareholders was $88.4 million in 2023, an increase of 15% as compared to adjusted EBITDA to WELL shareholders of $76.6 million in 2022. Adjusted net income was $52.4 million or $0.22 per share in 2023, a decrease of 2% as compared to adjusted net income of $53.7 million or $0.24 per share in 2022.\nAdjusted free cash flow was $42.4 million for 2023, a decrease of 13% as compared to adjusted free cash flow of $48.9 million for 2022. The decrease was mainly due to higher tax and interest payments, offsetting the increase in shareholder EBITDA. Net income was $16.6 million or $0.00 per share in 2023, a decrease of 11% as compared to net income of $18.7 million or $0.00 per share in 2022. We calculated earnings per share based on earnings attributable to well. Our fourth quarter financial results were as follows: well achieved record quarterly revenue of $231.2 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 48% as compared to revenue of $156.5 million generated during Q4 2022.\nThis growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $101 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 26% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $80.2 million in Q4 2022. Growth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period. WELL achieved record adjusted EBITDA of $30.8 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 13% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $27.2 million in Q4 20202. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders was $22.6 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 7% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders of $21.1 million in Q4 2022.\nAdjusted net income was $11.2 million or $0.05 per share in Q4 2023 as compared to adjusted net income of $12.5 million or $0.05 per share in Q4 2022. Adjusted free cash flow was $12.7 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 23% as compared to adjusted free cash flow of $10.3 million in Q4 2022. This was mainly due to higher EBITDA generation. Net income was $33.8 million or $0.12 per share in Q4 2023, an increase of 53% as compared to net income of $22.1 million or $0.09 per share in Q4 2022.\nWe calculated earnings per share based on earnings attributable to WELL. In the fourth quarter, while generated 9% of its revenues from truly recurring and subscription revenues and 88% of its revenues from its highly reoccurring patient services revenues. This means that approximately 97% of its revenues are highly predictable. WELL ended 2023 with a solid balance sheet. As at December 31, 2023, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $43 million.\nOn January 26, 2024, the company refinanced its syndicated credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank for USD 300 million, consisting of a primary USD 175 million credit facility with an additional USD 125 million accordion for future growth. The credit facility includes two new syndicate members, Bank of Montreal and Export Development Corporation, which is wholly owned by the government of Canada and the term has been extended to January 26, 2027.\nWELL continues to be in the standing and fully compliant with all covenants related with its two credit lines JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. The company's total bank debt increased to $297 million at the end of Q4 2023 due to cash required for the CarePlus acquisition. This compares to total bank debt of $293 million at the end of the prior quarter Q3 2023. WELL's shareholder leverage ratio also increased slightly as a result of the higher bank debt levels to 2.7x as at the end of Q4 2023 compared to 2.6x in the prior quarter Q3 2023.\nPlease note that we define leverage ratio as total bank debt less cash on hand, divided by shareholder adjusted EBITDA after certain pro forma adjustments. We exclude convertible debentures from this calculation because convertible debentures are not included in our bank covenants. In terms of our share capitalization, as of March 20, 2024, WELL had 264,130,019 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. I'll now provide some specific outlook on the business units. First, our Canadian clinics business, which is now overseen by Dr. Michael Frankel, our Chief Medical Officer. This division includes our primary care business and our well diagnostic centers previously referred to as MyHealth.\nOverall, Canadian clinics achieved total revenue of $230 million in 2023, an increase of 27% from 2022. Fourth quarter was another record quarter for Canadian clinics with revenue increasing 31% as compared to Q4 2022, driven by healthy organic growth in our primary care clinics as well as the acquisition of NCI Ontario clinics and our first clinic in Manitoba. For 2024, we're expecting revenues from our Canadian clinics to be over $300 million, along with strong EBITDA margins as we expand margins for the newer clinics in our network.\nWe believe the Canadian market continues to be an enormous generational untapped opportunity. This is very much a land grab opportunity for the company given its strong digital business that supports over 1/3 of all physicians in the country it's growing brand recognition and the structural advantages we enjoy as a large physician group in the outpatient market. and the largest owner operator of outpatient clinics across the 5 most populous provinces of Canada, namely Alberta, BC, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, providing multiple services, including primary care, diagnostic, Allied Health, Specialty Care and longevity medical services.\nWith 167 clinics and 98 facilities in Canada, we are the largest player, and yet we have only have approximately just under 1% market share of all physician spending in Canada, which is a large multibillion-dollar opportunity. We believe we can grow our Canadian patient services business from $300 million in 2024 to exceed $1 billion as a stand-alone revenue business in the not-too-distant future.\nAnd generally speaking, we don't see why we wouldn't be able to achieve up to 10% of market share over time. Our Canadian clinics business is also generating significant profitability. In 2023, Canadian clinics 4-wall EBITDA grew by 37.8% year-over-year to approximately $33 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is roughly 2/3 of the total 4-wall operating EBITDA profit in our Canadian business, which includes our SaaS and services business as well.\nThis increase in profitability in our Canadian clinics business is proven that our business model is working. For example, in our primary care segment where our outlook for 2024 is very strong. We are at times acquiring clinics that have low EBITDA margins, and in some cases, such as MCI, Ontario clinics and the Manitoba Clinic, these clinics had negative EBITDA margins and will take a couple of quarters to see improved EBITDA margins.\nOnce a new clinic is added to our network under the leadership of Jeremy Mickolwin, our clinic transformation team extensively uses our own digital practitioner enablement platform and shared services program to modernize and digitize these clinics, which results in improved cost efficiency and operating support for physicians, along with a significant improvement in EBITDA margins. We genuinely believe our clinic transformation team and capabilities are a unique superpower of the company and are helping physicians improve their business clinic by clinic.\nWe believe the issue of lack of digitization is existential for our primary care clinic industry in Canada. If a clinic doesn't digitize and relieve low leverage work to software and workflow, it simply cannot survive given the growing cost of labor. Well's current pipeline of new clinic opportunities is roughly 50 clinics, of which approximately third would be actionable under our absorption model where we have minimal acquisition costs and the balance would be under our regular M&A program.\nIn this pipeline, we're still seeing lower multiples and significant opportunities to acquire quality clinics at low prices particularly in primary care. The clinic absorption model is a very unique opportunity for WELL because of our national footprint, increasing brand recognition and the strong support and value proposition that we provide our health care providers, doctors are seeking us out to join the well network and take over the operation of their clinics.\nDoctors are facing such significant technology challenges administrative overhead issues that they're increasingly don't want to run their own clinics and are seeking out well to become their operating partners. Under this absorption model, we simply take over the lease of the clinic and the doctors join our network. There is no capital cost in most cases. And for this reason, we see absorbed clinics as merely an extension of our own recruitment efforts.\nHere, instead of recruiting physicians, we're including entire clinics with a full roster of patient and provider relationships. We believe that our organic growth and recruitment of absorption opportunities will continue to significantly grow in 2024. And now a few words about WELL Health Diagnostic Centers, which is essentially a rebrand of MyHealth centers. WELL Health diagnostic achieved record revenue of $111.3 million in 2023, which was entirely driven by organic growth.\nRevenue in the fourth quarter was a slight decline compared to Q3, which is reflective of our normal seasonality. Q4 revenue was also slightly lower than Q4 of last year as the previous year's cycle, there was irregular due to COVID restrictions being lifted in 2022, which drove increased revenue towards the end of the calendar year. Notwithstanding the lower revenue, unique -- overall unique patients grew by 5% year-over-year for Q4 2023 versus Q4 2022.\nFor 2024, we are expecting our diagnostic centers to achieve another year of record revenue and EBITDA. Organic growth is driven by expansion of services and an increase in the number of health care providers, which allows us to serve more patients. Our operating team led by Dina Sergi, have done a fantastic job optimizing costs, while the business continues to grow and gain momentum. I'm pleased to share a couple of new services also provided by the WELL Health diagnostic centers.\nOne, first, as of Q4 2023, we are participating in the expansion of PET scanning for prostate cancer screening. Previously, such studies were only performed in hospitals, but due to the increased demand and the Cancer Care Ontario guidance, this is now offered in selected integrated community health service centers, such as ours. Secondly, the government of Ontario will allow women to self-refer for mammograms beginning at age 40 under the Ontario breast screening program commencing in the fall of 2024. Although this becomes available this year, we're already seeing a notable increase in mammograms of 11% from Q3 2023 with intensification and awareness.\nWe're also keeping a close eye on Ontario's Bill 60, Your Health Act, which allows out-of-hospital facilities to perform publicly funded surgeries and diagnostic procedures, including MRI and CT scans. We understand that there may be a call for new applications in the coming months, and we intend to support the diagnostic needs of the province of Ontario. We are now seeing acquisition multiples finally start to moderate and become more reasonable on the specialized care and diagnostic opportunities.\nGiven this, we're looking forward to expanding our diagnostic centers to more provinces in 2024. I will now discuss outlook for our WELL Health USA business, our well-held USA patient and provider services revenue was $144 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 55% as compared to $92 million in Q4 2022. Revenue growth over the past year was due to growth in all three of WELL Health USA lines of business: Circle Medical, WISP and CRH. First, on CRH and RADAR, which we are now referring to as provider staffing, CRH closed out another successful year in 2023, while anesthesia continues to be a mainstay for CRH the midyear acquisition of CarePlus Management also added the complementary recruiting and staffing business, which operates under the name of RADAR health care providers.\nThe full integration and related synergies of these businesses are now complete, and we believe this acquisition will prove to be successful for years to come. Q4 is typically CRH's strongest quarter and this year's results were as expected. Overall, Q4 2023 revenue was up 79% versus Q4 of last year, while fiscal revenue was up 50%. Specifically, the CRH anesthesia revenue grew by 24% year-over-year in Q4 and 25% for the year, while the CRH O'Regan business was flat.\nThe rest of what is now known as WELL Health USA's growth was driven by the addition of provider staffing. As a reminder, provider staffing is a premier and trusted staffing and locum tenants business specializing in anesthesia. Provider staffing provides recruitment and placement services, along with temporary staffing to its national network of provider groups, hospitals and ASCs across over 30 states. Provider staffing was an important addition to the WELL USA family as its portfolio of services targeting the GI marketplace now includes three prongs. One, Hemorrhoid Banding with the company's Oregon Medical Device, which is the U.S.'s leading band ligator device, to anesthesia services for routine colonoscopies and of course, three provider staffing solutions. We look forward to adding more services to this GI-focused service bundle. And now on to our U.S. digital patient services businesses.\nFirst, Circle Medical. Circle Medical continues to successfully execute on its direct-to-consumer patient acquisition strategy, which resulted in a record quarter. Growth accelerated to Q4 to $29.9 million, representing 32% growth compared to the same quarter of the previous year, all organically driven. Patient volume grew from 422,000 to $563,000. Circle ended 2023 with year-over-year revenue growth of 39%. Circle's fourth quarter results also benefited from a onetime billing true-up at the end of the year from services provided in prior quarters.\nThe company is increasing its investment in R&D where it expects to double the head count this year with technical hires in its Montreal facility being a priority. Key focuses for 2024 will be mainly related to platform upgrades including the company's aggressive AI road map, which is quite exciting as Circle Medical is launching its own AI scribe and AI-powered physician copilot capabilities to support its own provider network workforce of over 300 providers.\nCircle has also entered into a partnership with the Mila Quebec AI Institute, giving it access to collaborate with the institute 1,200 AI researchers while retaining IP. Circle has also resumed state expansion for the first time in 2 years since the beginning of 2024, Circles launched virtual care in 4 new states, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio and is expecting to launch an additional 4 states by the end of Q1, bringing the total number of active states, 38.\nLooking ahead to 2024, Circle Medical is on track to match its previous year's revenue growth rate of over 30% year-over-year while maintaining EBITDA positive. And now a few words about WISP. I am pleased to report that WISP reported record revenue in Q4 with improved profitability, which also successfully completed its plan to launch 10 new products in 2023. From a cost optimization perspective, WISP did successfully renegotiated pricing with the pharmacy partners and is committed to more cost-effective nurse practitioner hiring on the provider team. We expect WISP to report record revenue again in Q1 with continued profitable growth as the business ramps up marketing spend and continues to lead into new product development with plans to launch its new fertility offering shortly.\nFinally, our SaaS and Technology Services businesses. SaaS and Technology Services revenues from our Platform Solutions group were $20.2 million in Q4 2023, a year-over-year increase of 60% and as compared to $12.6 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 27% as compared to $15.9 million in the prior quarter Q3 2023. The increase in revenue was due to a bounce back in our cybersecurity and data protection business in the fourth quarter as well as organic growth in our remaining SaaS and services platform business.\nLast year, well bolstered its cybersecurity portfolio with tuck-in acquisitions of Seek Into and Proact security, bringing on board seasoned cybersecurity professionals in the process and strengthening our ability to serve over 190 corporate and government customers across North America. These acquisitions are performing well, and we expect cybersecurity to have an improved overall year in 2024 as compared to 2023. In 2023, we announced that OceanMD signed a $38.5 million contract with British Columbia's Public Health Service Authority to provide an array of digital services such as eReferral, e-consult and e-orders to help further tech enable providers with best-in-class digital interoperability tools. Thus far, our implementation in BC has been proceeding as planned, and I'm pleased to announce that Go Live is expected in the first half of 2024, at which time, we will also start to receive high-margin license revenue from this relationship.\nOceanMD is already the dominant eReferral solution in the province of Ontario. In Q2 2023, we announced and OceanMD went live across Nova Scotia. And with the recent win in BC, we feel OceanMD has the potential to become the eReferral standard across the country. OceanMD is a key component of WELL platform and is emerging as a leader in patient engagement in e-referral solutions. Ocean's eReferral software allows primary care providers to send their request to specialists through the Ocean eReferral network instead of faxing, e-mailing or mailing, which makes surgical consult referrals easier and reduces wait times for patients.\nWe're pleased to report that Ocean delivered more than 876,000 eReferral in 2023. And a couple of weeks ago, we announced that -- thus far in the year, we're at 1.2 million eReferral in the last 12 months, demonstrating already significant growth and acceleration over the past year. This is a real achievement, and we're very proud of the Ocean team for making this positive impact in the Canadian health care ecosystem. In 2023, we launched WELL AI voice which has been a big hit with health care providers because of its ability to cut down on administrative time and increase patient engagement, giving physicians time back in their day. The adoption metrics of WELL AI voice are a testament to the value created for physicians.\nWELL AI voice has seamlessly integrated into 131,000 patient consultations in 2023 reclaiming time for clinicians that was previously lost to administrative tasks, while enriching patient care quality. WELL AI voice has been successfully rolled out to over 25 well-known clinics. Our continued expansion of WELL AI voice within our own clinic network demonstrates our dedication to leveraging our AI capabilities to also benefit WELL physicians as well as our broader clinic network.\nOverall, our technology platform services group continues to perform with the rollout of AI-based tools and achieving record sales in Q4. Lastly, our Platform Solutions group, which is under the leadership, now under the leadership of our COO, Amir Javidan, formed a dedicated public sector group to support large-scale health systems and care delivery networks that underpin the public sector. The objective of this group is to combine and deliver product offerings that are specifically suited for public sector's unique scale and requirements. If you'd like to learn more about this, please visit our new dedicated public sector website at WELL Health solutions. That's wellhealth.solutions as the URL.\nAnd now I'd like to provide some commentary on our partnership with HEALWELL AI. As you may remember, on October 1, we completed the transaction with MCI One Health, whereby well acquired the clinical assets from MCI and the remaining business of MCI was recapitalized and launched as HEALWELL AI, a company focused on AI and data science for preventative care. While it's currently the largest shareholder of HEALWELL with an option that would give WELL the control position in HEALWELL as defined on an IFRS financial reporting basis. WELL currently holds 22.7 million shares of HEALWELL, thereby representing 20.8% of the issued and outstanding voting securities of HEALWELL. WELL's call option gives WELL the right to acquire up to an additional approximately 30 million Class A subordinate voting shares and the same number of Class B multiple voting shares of the company.\nIf WELL exercises its option, WELL will have -- WELL over 40% ownership on an as-converted basis. We're extremely happy with the progress that HEALWELL team has made in such a short period of time. Since its launch, HEALWELL has raised approximately $29.5 million in convertible debt and equity funding, completed two acquisitions of Pentavere and intra-health made one minority investment in doctorly.\nMore recently, you may have seen the announcement that I've taken on the Chairman role at HEALWELL. I took on this role because the Boards of both WELL and HEALWELL felt that there is strong alignment between WELL and HEALWELL. I believe my appointment is also strategically very important for shareholders of both HEALWELL and WELL given the shared objective between the companies to create the most advanced and easy-to-use AI-inspired tools that can equip care providers with various copilots that can help them improve diagnosis of rare and chronic diseases, improve efficiency of their practice and improve patient health outcomes.\nWELL has also entered into a strategic alliance agreement with HEALWELL that enabled us to launch well AI decision support to our network of clinics and doctors. Given that some patients who have chronic or complex care needs may have hundreds or even thousands of pages of clinical notes, it's unrealistic for physicians to be expected to have a dynamic understanding of all patients' charts and detailed requirements. As such, we expect that over time, decision support will support physicians in numerous ways.\nMore recently, HEALWELL announced that it has signed a services agreement with both WELL Health USA and our U.S.-based subsidiary, Circle Medical, which expands its footprint in the United States and will enable U.S. health care providers with a suite of AI-powered preventative care solutions. HEALWELL Pentavere Division has partnered with WELL Health USA's CRH Medical to access anonymous U.S. health care data to gain insights in supporting patients who are dealing with inflammatory bowel disease and other GI conditions.\nThrough the agreement, Pentavere [ Starwood ] AI platform will analyze over 200,000 U.S. patients in a secure and compliant manner across 21 states to understand the real-world dynamics between biological prescribing and treatment outcomes. Meanwhile, HEALWELL's Care Health will integrate its proprietary AI platform with Circle Medical's electronic medical record system, expanding its footprint to over 30 U.S. states. Here's AI will screen for and flag for individual patients with whom the health care practitioner might consider for future investigation for potential earlier diagnosis of rare disease. We believe HEALWELL can be one of the most consequential AI health care companies in the country and also with global appeal, given its partnership with WELL and given the technology it has already acquired and developed.\nHEALWELL's ability to unlock insights from data that inform the creation of AI-powered physician co-pilots will be very key moving forward in an industry that badly needs to support its care providers better. Before we take questions, I'd like to provide some additional color on our Q1 2024 expectations. Despite our bullish annual look for 2024, we're expecting some normal seasonal weakness in the first quarter. Q1 has typically been the weakest quarter for CRH and its anesthesia business due to payer mix shifts and the renewal of patient deductibles coinciding with year-end.\nWe're also expecting Circle Medical revenues to decrease from Q4 and 2023 to 2024 as there were some onetime items in Circle Medical's Q4 results that won't be repeated in Q1. In addition, our cybersecurity revenues can be lumpy and our strong results in the SaaS and technology business aren't likely to be repeated in Q1. In terms of our adjusted EBITDA, due to the seasonal and onetime revenue factors in Q4 2023, we expect our Q1 adjusted EBITDA will not reach the same level as Q4 2023. Furthermore, the positive results from our cost optimization and staff restructuring efforts will begin to materialize until the second quarter due to these factors, we expect a sequential decline in our adjusted EBITDA from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. Nonetheless, we're expecting continued revenue and EBITDA growth in Q2 and into the back half of 2024.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our financial performance in 2023 and look forward to delivering strong results again in 2024. Our outlook remains very positive. Hence, I'm confident in our upgraded annual guidance. We have many tailwinds driving growth in the business, and we have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can deliver on our objectives.\nFinally, I want to thank you all for joining us on this call and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals. I would also like to thank WELL's senior management team and all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort, and for creating a strong and inclusive culture that has helped us be recently independently certified as a Great Place to Work by the Great Place to Work Institute of Canada. This is a fully independent process. And as such, certification is a reflection of the company's strong commitment to creating a positive and progressive workplace culture. As per usual, I would also like to thank our team, health care providers and frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care every single day. They remind us why we are here and we are here to support them.\nAnd with that, we'd be very pleased to take some questions. Operator?"

My name is Jenny, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later in the call, which will be restricted to analysts only. Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Tyler Boba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone to WELL Health fiscal third quarter financial results conference call for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL control and that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans regarding the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law. We may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures.\nFor more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments, and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be constructed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We hope that you're all keeping safe and healthy. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. We are extremely pleased to be with you today and discuss our strong momentum and record-breaking quarter in which we achieved record revenue, record adjusted EBITDA and record patient visits. We remain committed to the company's continued focus on tech-enabling healthcare providers and supporting them and simplifying their work lives, modernizing and digitizing their clinical practices and delivering the best healthcare possible.\nDuring Q3 2023, WELL delivered over 1 million patient visits in the quarter through our physical and virtual clinics and over 1.58 million technology and care interactions. WELL now services more than 33,000 healthcare providers with our SaaS and technology services in Canada, which is equal to approximately 1 out of every 3 healthcare providers in the country. We're extremely passionate about supporting our providers. And every day, we focus on supporting them better. This attitude and focus is what has allowed the company to continue to witness healthy growth across all its business segments, including both online and in-person care channels with minimal impacts due to recession, inflation, supply chain, or other macroeconomic effects.\nWe're pleased to report that all of our business units are executing very well, and we're expecting to have strong performance for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. We do not foresee any material influences or challenges that would impair our ability to deliver solid results in 2024 as we're poised to invest in and achieve significant growth while delivering on sustained profitability. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting to achieve record revenue in both our Canadian and U.S. patient services businesses. With continued improvement in our outlook, I'm pleased to provide an upgrade to our revenue guidance for 2023, which we now expect to be between $755 million to CAD 765 million. Just a reminder, our guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. In terms of profitability, we are providing guidance for 2023 annual adjusted EBITDA to increase by a figure approaching 10% over 2022 levels.\nOur revenue growth continues to outpace our EBITDA growth due to the following 2 reasons: One, we continue to reinvest any excess cash flow back into the business for growth. This is most demonstrated in the case of our U.S. digital healthcare businesses, Circle and WISP, who have had strong top line growth but who have both gone through a period of heavy reinvestment over the past few quarters. Two, the recent acquisitions of the MCI One Health clinics have and will have a negative impact on our EBITDA profile Q4 performance. As we've conveyed at the time of our acquisition, these clinics were not profitable, but we have initiated our clinic transformation process, where we have had an excellent track record in digitizing and modernizing our acquired clinics and improving their operating profit margins.\nThis is what we do, and we have a proven track record of improving growth and profitability of our acquired assets. As such, we continue to believe that they will be profitable in 2024 and thus accretive to our results. Looking forward to next year, I'm really excited to introduce our revenue guidance of achieving more than $900 million in 2024 in revenues. We will provide more detailed guidance ranges for 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA when we report our 2023 annual results in March 2024. However, we wanted to provide you with some early indications of our confidence level in 2024. In the past, I've mentioned our goal to achieving $1 billion in annual revenue within 2 years. With the revenue guidance of $900 million that I provided today, we're clearly within reach of that $1 billion milestone, likely a little quicker than I had mentioned before. Keep in mind that our target of achieving over $900 million next year does not include any unannounced acquisitions. Given our current pipeline of compelling acquisition opportunities, we have visibility into potentially achieving $1 billion revenue run rate by the end of 2024.\nBefore I turn the call over to Eva, I'd like to highlight our Canadian clinic business. Our Canadian business is firmly the largest and most comprehensive provider of tech-enabled care in Canada and is generating significant profitability. In Q3, we achieved $12.3 million in adjusted EBITDA in Canada, an increase of 24% compared to Q3 2022. Furthermore, EBITDA generated in Canada primarily goes to shareholder EBITDA given the small noncontrolled interest that we have in the Canadian market. This increase in profitability in our Canadian business is proof that our business model is working. As we've indicated before, our business in Canada is to tech-enabled healthcare providers. We have the most comprehensive digital platform in the country that covers practice management, billing, digital patient engagement capabilities, data protection, and a lot more.\nWe have 2 ways in which doctors can interact with our platform. One, on an a la carte basis, they can subscribe to whichever services they like and have them implemented in their patient services business; or two, they can join one of our physical or virtual clinics where our technologies and tools are provided on a fully managed service. What we have learned since providing our services is that increasingly, doctors don't want to run their own clinics and are seeking us out to become their operating partners. As such, we have purchased or recruited entire clinics in order to better support doctors that work in such clinics. Once the new clinic is added to our network, our team employs our clinic transformation program, which includes extensive use of our own digital practitioner enablement platform and shared services program to modernize and digitize these clinics, which generally result in improved cost efficiency and operating support for physicians. Depending on the state of the acquired absorb clinics, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, and in some cases, can take more than 1 year.\nWe believe the Canadian market continues to be an enormous untapped potential for WELL and very much remains a land grab opportunity, while O'Regan operates the largest network of clinics across the 4 most populous provinces of Canada, namely Ontario, Quebec, BC and Alberta, providing multiple services, including primary care, diagnostic, allied health, specialized care, and now our recently announced Longevity medical services. With 168 clinics in 98 facilities in Canada, we are the largest player, and we've just achieved just shy of 1% market share of this large multibillion-dollar opportunity. We believe we can grow our Canadian business to multiples of its current size, which could on a stand-alone basis, exceed over $1 billion in business in the future on its own.\nAs we have indicated before, the Canadian market for healthcare clinics is extremely fragmented with very few large clinic chains existing in the country, which have 20 or more clinics. Acquiring smaller clinics can be laborious and difficult work, but we are pleased to report that the number of clinics and physicians that are now seeking WELL out specifically due to our growing posture in the industry has been tremendous awareness and affinity to our brand continues to grow. And due to this reason, we believe that our organic growth in recruitment will significantly grow in 2024.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials for the fiscal third quarter 2023, and then I'll come back and provide further commentary on our business units and outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023. Our overall third quarter results were as follows: WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $204.5 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 40% as compared to revenue of $145.8 million generated during Q3 of last year. This growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Year-to-date, WELL has achieved organic growth of 16%. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $94.2 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 21% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $78.2 million in Q3 of last year. Growth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period. Adjusted gross margin percentage was 46.1% in Q3 2023 compared to adjusted gross margin percentage of 53.6% in Q3 of last year. The decline in adjusted gross margin percentage is mainly attributed to the acquisition of businesses with lower gross margin percentage.\nWELL achieved record adjusted EBITDA of $28.2 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 3% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $27.5 million in Q3 of last year. For context, last year's results included $4.8 million more EBITDA from our U.S. digital health subsidiaries, Circle Medical and WISP prior to our decision to reinvest more of this EBITDA to continue to drive growth in their businesses. Shareholder EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders was $22.9 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 13% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders of $20.2 million in Q3 2022. Adjusted net income was $12.8 million or $0.05 per share in Q3 2023 as compared to adjusted net income of $14.8 million or $0.07 per share in Q3 2022. Shareholders' free cash flow was $9.6 million in Q3 2023, a decrease of 16% as compared to shareholder free cash flow of $11.4 million in Q3 of last year. WELL generated 10% of this revenues from truly recurring and subscription revenues and 88% of its revenues from its highly recurring patient services revenues in Q3 2023. This means that approximately 98% of its revenues are highly predictable. I will now review our cemented third quarter results.\nOur Canadian Patient Services business achieved another record quarter with revenue of $57.8 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 27% as compared to $45.5 million in Q3 2022, driven by healthy organic growth in our primary care clinics and the acquisition of the MCI clinics in Alberta. Our WELL Health USA Patient Services revenue was $130.7 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 52% as compared to $85.8 million in Q3 2022. Revenue growth over the past year was due to growth in all 3 of WELL Health USA lines of business, Circle Medical, WISP and [indiscernible]. SaaS & Technology Services revenues were $15.9 million in Q3 2023, a year-over-year increase of 10% as compared to $14.5 million in Q3 of last year and an increase of 20% as compared to $13.3 million in the prior quarter Q2 2023. The increase in revenue was due to a bounce back in our cybersecurity and data protection business in the third quarter as well as organic growth in our remaining SaaS and services platform business.\nWELL ended Q3 2023 with a solid balance sheet. As at September 30, 2023, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $42 million and restricted cash of $3 million. WELL continues to be in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related with this 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. The debt from the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 293 million as of September 30, 2023. I'm also pleased to report world's shareholder leverage ratio reduced from 2.9x as at the end of Q3 2022 to 2.6x as of Q3 2023. We defined leverage ratio as net bank debt less cash on hand, divided by shareholder-adjusted EBITDA. We exclude convertible debentures from this calculation because convertible debentures are not included in our bank covenants. Over the past year, the improvement in WELL leverage ratio was achieved by an increase in shareholder-adjusted EBITDA. In terms of our share capitalization, as of November 13, 2023, WELL had 258,385,460 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. I'll now provide some specific outlook on our business units. First, our primary care business. During the third quarter, Canadian Primary Care revenue increased by 51% compared to Q3 2022 driven by the acquisition of 5 Calgary-based clinics from MCI One Health and organic growth of 16%, which is much higher than industry averages. I've already commented extensively on our primary care growth opportunity at the beginning of our remarks, but I'll just reiterate that we believe primary care will maintain strong absolute and organic growth, not only through Q4, but all through 2024 and hopefully beyond. Our outlook for primary care continues to look strong for the fourth quarter and beyond, notwithstanding the transformation and retooling work that we've been doing on the acquired MCI clinics in Q4, which will have a temporary negative impact on our P&L. As we go through the process of digitizing and modernizing these clinics, we expect them to become profitable in 2024.\nLast thing I'll say about primary care is that our recruitment pipeline is very strong and perhaps the best we've ever seen it. We believe this is directly correlated with the challenges doctors are feeling in the marketplace and WELL's growing brand recognition. We believe 2024 could be a breakout year for primary care. Now a few words about MyHealth. MyHealth had an outstanding third quarter with strong year-over-year growth of 9%, which was all organic and improved profitability. MyHealth's revenue had a slight decline in Q3 compared to the prior quarter Q2 2023 due to normal seasonality as we had anticipated. In reference to Ontario's built 60 Your Health Act, which allows out-of-hospital facilities to perform publicly funded surgeries and diagnostic procedures, including MRI and CT, we continue to await the final regulations and call for applications for licensing, which experienced some delays.\nAlthough exact timelines are not publicly released, we anticipate a call for applications to occur by the end of this year or in early Q1 2024. MyHealth Center continues to be highly engaged through the process with the optimism of serving the patients of Ontario and helping reduce MRI/CT patient wait times the following calendar year. Notwithstanding our continued progress on profitable organic growth, we are also ramping up our M&A efforts at MyHealth to find suitable acquisitions to grow the business. Given our corporate discipline, we have not made any acquisitions here in the last couple of years, mainly due to the persistently high multiples we've been seeing. We're starting to see signs of improvement in this area and are eager to report wins in the future. I will now discuss the outlook for the WELL Health USA business.\nThe different lines of business under WELL Health USA include CRH, anesthesia, CRH O'Regan, RADAR Healthcare Providers, Circle Medical and WISP. First, CRH and RADAR. CRH having an outstanding year so far with Q3 revenues up 73% compared to Q3 of last year. Anesthesia cases continue to grow and ligator sales also increased 12.5% in Q3 compared to the prior quarter. The CRH received a boost in revenues in Q3 from the CarePlus acquisition, which included the addition of ASC practices and radar, which is a staffing and low-component service, which specializes in anesthesiologist recruitment and placement for its network of customers, which includes provider groups, hospitals and ASCs across 29 states. RADAR adds significant upside for growth and diversification beyond clinical anesthesia services to include recruitment services. We're very pleased to be welcoming RADAR Healthcare Providers to the WELL family. We expect continued growth in Q4 for both CRH's anesthesia services and RADAR. Q4 is usually the strongest seasonal quarter for CRH.\nAnd now a few words about Circle Medical. With less energy being devoted to regulatory issues, Circle Medical is again poised to resume its growth trajectory. Circle Medical continues to grow its provider network, ending the quarter with 341 active medical providers, a year-over-year increase of 48%. This is a significant achievement and one that we know is the key to see more growth and profitability. We're seeing record growth in new patients with new patient acquisitions up 30% in Q3 sequentially. New patient acquisitions were up a further 14% month-over-month in October alone. As these new cohorts mature, they will produce additional revenue in Q4 and beyond.\nTo support its growth plan, Circle Medical is investing heavily in its technology platform by growing its product and technology team with most hires based in the Montreal office. Product development is currently focused in 2 areas: one, patient-facing features designed to strengthen the longitudinal primary care relationship, which will drive engagement and clinical outcomes and eventually lifetime value; and two, technology to help scale operations, especially via automation and artificial intelligence. Circle Medical has begun using its own AI scribed to document encounters and is working on extending the use of AI to help monitor clinical quality. Moreover, MedCircle Medical is in the early discussions with HEELWELL to pilot a program to use AI to identify patients who may benefit from being screened for rare diseases or other medical interventions. In September, the company hired a new head of Growth, Catherine David, in Catherine's previous role, she grew a venture-backed U.K. company from GBP 20 million to GBP 400 million in annual revenue over 5 years. With 1 month down in Q4, we can already tell that Circle Medical will likely deliver record revenues and positive EBITDA in Q4.\nAnd now for WISP, I'm pleased to report that WISP reported record revenue in Q3 as the company returns to its focus to growth and profitability. Last quarter, we discussed how WISP is recooling some of its key product and distribution partners, which resulted in slower growth and minimal adjusted EBITDA contribution in the first half of the year. With has been able to successfully balance growth initiatives, along with the launch of an improved e-commerce-enabled marketing site, which also is enhancing its supply chain redundancy and partnerships. Last quarter, we discussed with plan to launch 10 new products before the end of the year and remain on track to hit this goal. Most notably, WISP launched 5 new products in Q3, including Estradiol, marking the company's entrance into the menopause vertical. We expect WISP to report record revenue in Q4 with improved profitability as the business leans into the holiday season. In addition, we expect pulling back on some of our marketing spend due to high seasonal cost of advertising, while accelerating marketing spend again in January of 2024 when we have lower seasonal cost of advertising.\nAnd finally, our SaaS and technology services business. SaaS and technology, our business unit had a bounce back in -- bounce back quarter in Q3. As we discussed last quarter, the cybersecurity and data protection segment is a lumpy business, whose revenues declined in the second quarter as we had expected. Cybersecurity revenues can sometimes be impacted by timing of hardware shipments at the end of the quarter. Revenues improved in Q3 with several contracts delivered while the rest of the SaaS and services business continue to perform with steady growth and profitability. We also recently announced the acquisition of 2 strategic tuck-in cybersecurity businesses Seek Into and Proact security.\nThese acquisitions demonstrate well steadfast commitment to safeguarding patient trust and operational integrity. WELL has bolstered, its cybersecurity portfolio with these 2 strategic tuck-in acquisitions, bringing on board seasoned cybersecurity professionals in the process and strengthening our capability to serve over 190 corporate and government customers across North America.\nDuring Q3, we announced also that OceanMD signed a $38.5 million contract with British Columbia's Public Health Service Authority to provide an array of digital services such as eReferrals, e-consult and e-orders to help further tech enable providers with best-in-class interoperability tools. OceanMD is already the dominant eReferral solution in the province of Ontario. In Q2, we announced OceanMD had 1 that Nova Scotia eReferral bid. And with this win in BC, we feel OceanMD has the potential to become the eReferral standard across the country.\nThus far, our implementation in BC has been proceeding as planned. We've received tremendous interest with over 250 doctors signed up to participate before any participant recruiting has even begun. Doctors of BC has been fully engaged and supportive. We've already begun to receive services revenue as our teams are fully engaged with training and planning for launch. Go Live is expected in the first half of 2024, at which time we will also start to receive high-margin license revenue. OceanMD is a key component of our SaaS and technology services group and is emerging as a leader in patient engagement and eReferral solutions. Ocean's eReferral software allows primary care providers to send their request to surgeons through the Ocean eReferral Network instead of faxing, e-mailing or mailing, which makes up surgical consult referrals easier and reduces wait times for patients. OceanMD has notably proven its ability to reduce wait times by as much as 52 days and a 12% reduction in medically unnecessary MRIs, underlining a direct cost savings impact for provincial health systems.\nWe're pleased to report that Ocean is now delivering approximately 1 million eReferral events per year. This is a real achievement, and we're very proud of the Ocean team for making the positive impact it is making in the Canadian healthcare ecosystem. In Q3, healthcare providers also continue to embrace WELL AI voice and its ability to cut down on administration time and increase patient engagement, giving physicians back time in their day. The adoption metrics of WELL AI voice are a testament to the value created for physicians. WELL AI voice has seamlessly integrated in over 15,000 patient consultations in Q3. Reclaiming time for clinicians that was previously lost due to administrative tasks, while enriching patient care quality. In Q3, we've seen a surge in platform users as WELL AI voice saw paid user growth of over 500%. Q3 also marked a successful first rollout to WELL-owned clinics, including WELL AI voice to 23 clinics in British Columbia, WELL physicians leverage WELL AI voice and been scribing over 2,400 patient encounters. Our continued expansion of WELL AI voice within our clinical network demonstrates our dedication to leveraging our AI capabilities to benefit WELL physicians and our broader clinic network. Overall, our technology platform services group continues to perform with the rollout of AI-based tools and achieving record sales in Q3 in both Oscar EMR and our billing RCM products.\nI'd now like to provide some additional commentary on the launch of HEALWELL AI. We recently completed our oversubscribed financing transaction with previously named NCI One Health, resulting in the relaunch of a new senior-listed public company called HEALWELL AI, a pure-play healthcare AI and data science technology company focused on preventative care. We are very pleased with the successful launch of HEALWELL, who has garnered immense interest and raised additional equity financing to strengthen its balance sheet. Since WELL's involvement was initially announced, the company has gone from a market capitalization of less than $10 million back in May to more than $100 million on an as converted basis. WELL has entered into a strategic alliance agreement with HEALWELL that enabled us to launch WELL AI decision support to our network of clinics and doctors.\nWe believe this will become one of the most important services that we offer. This is because we believe the experience of being a physician will profoundly change over time. Physicians are currently expected to know everything about their patients, including patients that they haven't even had long tenured relationships with. Given that some patients who have chronic or complex care needs may have hundreds or even thousands of pages of clinical nodes, it is unrealistic for physicians to be expected to have a dynamic understanding of all their patients' charts and detailed requirements. We believe this is where AI technology can be extremely useful and helpful. We expect that over time, decision support will support physicians in the following ways: one, help them improve their accuracy of diagnosis, particularly for the thousands of rare and ultrarare diseases, many of which have known successful interventions once identified. Two, help physicians search patient records with much greater ease as unstructured clinical nodes become structured and searchable through the use of artificial intelligence. And three, allow patients to see more patients as they're able to more effectively and rapidly triage patients, especially as such patients have complete health history available within the provider network.\nWELL AI decision support will be a project that will entail progress over a multiyear period given the enormity of the scope and the objectives being sought out. We will keep shareholders posted on our progress with this initiative. Currently, on an as-converted basis, WELL owns approximately 17% of HEALWELL. As part of the investment in strategic alliance, 2 members from WELL were appointed to HEALWELL's Board of Directors and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, WELL will also hold an option to acquire up to 30 million Class A and B shares in HEALWELL over the next couple of years. Assuming these shares are acquired WELL's economic ownership would be approximately 40% and its voting ownership would be well above 50%. This means that WELL will have an opportunity in the future to acquire control of HEALWELL in the event it elects to acquire the multi-voting shares it is optioned out subject to the terms and conditions of the various agreements, covenants and rights.\nGiven the strong alignment, WELL is spending time and resources to support HEALWELL's growth plan, which is compelling. In summary, we're very pleased with our financial performance thus far in 2023 and look forward to delivering strong results again in 2024. Our outlook remains positive. Hence, I'm confident in upgrading our annual guidance again. We have many tailwinds driving growth in the business, and we have a committed and disciplined team to ensure we can execute on our objectives.\nFinally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call today and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals. And thus, we are very grateful to the capital markets for that. I would also like to thank WELL's senior management team and all of our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort. In particular, I'd like to thank our team of healthcare practitioners and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care. They remind us every day why we are here and why we are here to support them. Thank you.\nAnd with that, we are now open to take some questions. Operator, would you please facilitate?"

My name is Jenny, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later in the call, which will be restricted to analysts only. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nTyler Baba\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health Fiscal Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for the 3 months ended June 30, 2023. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today. Portions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies.\nThese forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our management's discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS. And with that, I will turn over the call to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We hope that you're all keeping safe and healthy. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. We're very pleased with our record-breaking quarter and to be visiting with you today. In our quarter, we achieved record revenue and growth across all key metrics. Our record revenue, adjusted EBITDA, patient visits and provider count are a testament to the company's continued focus on tech enabling health care providers and supporting them and simplifying their work lives, modernizing and digitizing their clinical practices and delivering the best health care possible while exited Q2 2023 with over 3,200 providers and clinicians delivering 1 million patient visits, over 1 million patient visits. In fact, in the quarter through our own physical and virtual clinics without counting any of the technology interactions or technology-enabled visits that happen with other people's providers.\nIn addition, WELL had more than 31,000 providers -- supported by our own SaaS and technology services. We are extremely passionate about supporting our providers and every day, we focus on supporting them better. And this attitude and focus is what's allowed our company to continue to witness healthy growth across all its business segments, including both online and in-person care channels with minimal impacts due to recession, inflation, supply chain or other macroeconomic effects.\nThematically speaking, there are a few catalysts that I wanted to touch on in today's presentation and they are as follows: one, continued resilience in our multidimensional health care delivery platform that has allowed us to continue to deliver outstanding record results 18 quarters in a row and allowed us to yet again upgrade our guidance this quarter for the balance of the year. The growth of our R&D teams and costs demonstrate that we continue to invest in our growth, not only with M&A, but with internal investment, constantly strengthening our internal ability to grow and innovate. This is not only contributing to the health of the company, but positioning us to grow organically, as evidenced by our big Ocean MD contract win today; three, our continued focus on artificial intelligence and strategic internal and external planning and investments that allow us to leverage AI to help our providers and patients at scale while becoming a more efficient company. Four, our disciplined M&A growth engine and how it continues to yield tremendous results; and five, our relentless focus on integration and digitization.\nWELL has exhibited a keen focus both in the U.S. and Canada to improve efficiency and leverage our size and scale by integrating aspects of our business. Our efforts to constantly improve and tighten up our integrations never really stops due to our growing capabilities, new innovations and our dynamic company culture. As we've discussed before, at the heart of our company is our digital platform, which is being worked on by an internal team of over 100 dedicated product and engineering professionals and several dozen more externally on both sides of the border.\nIn Canada, our platform is quickly becoming one of the most important stretches of the digital health super highway for health care communications by enabling interoperability between HIS systems and core EMR systems and primary and specialized care providers. This was recently evidenced by our recent win with Ocean MD in British Columbia, where we were awarded a significant $38.5 million contract by the PSSA to help modernize and digitize the province's workflows with our next-generation e-Referral any consult platform. This contract win exemplifies just how strong our platform is, especially given that we now have substantial contracts with Ontario, Nova Scotia and now BC with other provinces engaged deeply with our business development teams. We are now working on taking our platform to the next level by elevating our product road map with the help of AI-related technologies.\nWe're pleased to report that all of our business units are executing well, and we're expecting to have strong performance for the remainder of 2023. The company does not foresee any material influences or challenges that would impair its ability to deliver solid results in 2023 as we are poised to invest in and achieve significant growth while delivering on enhanced profitability. Just last month, we increased our annual guidance by $50 million to be in between $740 million and $760 million for the year. We continued improvement in our outlook, and I'm pleased to provide an upgrade to our revenue guidance, which we now expect to be in the upper half of the $740 million to $760 million annual guidance. Essentially, we're expecting annual revenue to exceed $0.75 billion, representing annual revenue growth of at least 32%.\nJust a reminder, our guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. We also continue to guide for maintenance of Rule of 30 performance for the year. Achieving $0.75 billion in revenue this year is a significant milestone, which demonstrates that we're well on our way to reaching $1 billion in annual revenue. Our strong organic growth profile and compelling acquisition opportunities gives us visibility into achieving $1 billion revenue run rate within 2 years. Our adjusted EBITDA -- for our adjusted EBITDA, we're also pleased to reiterate our guidance for annual adjusted EBITDA to increase by more than 10% over 2022 levels. Our revenue growth continues to outpace our EBITDA growth in 2022 due to the reinvestment of any excess cash flows back into the business for growth. In addition, our acquisitions this year have had lower operating margins than our existing businesses. It is quite common for us to acquire businesses that aren't as profitable as our own as we then digitize and modernize these assets and increase their operating margins to be more in line with our own profitability profile. This is what we do, and this is what we have a proven track record of doing, improving the growth and profitability of our acquired assets. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the financials for fiscal quarter -- second fiscal quarter 2023. I will then come back and provide further commentary on our business units and outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months ended June 30, 2023. Our overall second quarter results were as follows: WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $170.9 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 22% as compared to revenue of $140.3 million generated during Q2 of last year. This growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Year-to-date, WELL has achieved organic growth of 15%. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $90.8 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 20% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $75.5 million in Q2 2022. Growth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period. Adjusted gross margin percentage was 53% in both Q2 2023 and 2022.\nWELL achieved record adjusted EBITDA of $27.8 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 5% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 million in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders was $22.3 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 16% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL shareholders of $19.2 million in Q2 2022. Adjusted net income was $14.4 million or $0.06 per share in Q2 2023 as compared to adjusted net income of $17.5 million or $0.08 per share in Q2 2022. WELL generated 11% of its revenues from truly recurring and subscription revenues and 87% of its revenues from its highly recurring patient services revenues in Q2 2023. This means that approximately 98% of its revenues are highly predictable.\nI will now review our cement Q2 results. Our Canadian Patient Services business achieved another record quarter with revenue of $54.2 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 24% as compared to $43.7 million in Q2 of last year. With both primary care and my Health specialized care clinics achieving record revenue in this quarter. Primary Care revenues increased 39% to $24.9 million in Q2 2023 compared to $17.9 million in Q2 2022, primarily due to organic growth and acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of 5 primary care clinics located in Calgary, Alberta from MCI One Health Technologies, which are expected to generate approximately $10 million in annual revenue.\nIn Q2 2023, MyHealth revenue increased 13% to $29.3 million as compared to $25.8 million in Q2 2022. This year-over-year growth is attributable to an increase in diagnostic procedures performed and the addition of new cardiologists to MyHealth practice. The second quarter is also the seasonally strongest quarter for MyHealth, resulting in a 12% increase in revenue compared to prior quarter Q1 2023. Our WELL Health USA Patient Services revenue was $103.5 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 30% as compared to $79.6 million in Q2 2022, driven by growth over the past year in all 3 of WELL Health USA's lines of business, that is Circle Medical, Wisp and CRH. In Q2 2023, CRH revenues were $63.4 million, an increase of 25% as compared to $50.9 million in Q2 2022. CRHs case volumes also continued to be very strong with over 135,000 anesthesia cases completed in Q2 2023, an increase of 8% compared to Q2 2022.\nCase volumes in the second quarter were positively impacted by the acquisition of affiliated Tampa Anesthesia Associates, which closed in the prior quarter in Q1 2023. CRH sold more than 32,000 O'Regan [indiscernible] units in Q2 2023 compared to over 45,000 units sold in Q2 2022. This year-over-year decline was due to a promotional campaign in the prior quarter, Q1 2023 when CRH sold a record of over 59,000 O'Regan\n[indiscernible] units. With the conclusion of this promotional campaign, [indiscernible] unit volumes decreased in Q2 but have now returned to near normal levels in Q3.\nCircle Medical revenues were $21 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 34% as compared to revenue of $15.6 million in Q2 of last year. Although Circle Medical experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth as we had guided in our Q1 conference call, we were expecting softer results as compared to Q1 2020. Circle Medical has been focused on expanding its physical clinic footprint over the first half of the year to support the forecasted end of the public health emergency by the U.S. federal government. That would end some COVID regulations associated with telehealth medicine, which more in-person business is required.\nCircle Medical now has 27 physical clinic locations across 21 states in the U.S., a significant increase compared to last year when Circle Medical only had 2 physical locations in the state of California. As Hamed will cover in the outlook portion of our comments today, Circle Medical is back in growth mode now, and we're expecting a healthy finish in the back half of the year. With achieved revenue of $19.1 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 46% as compared to revenue of $13.1 million in Q2 of last year. In the first half of the year where customer acquisition costs are lower, we were intentional in reinvesting operating cash flows generated by this business back into WISP growth. The balance of the year should continue to see strong growth with slightly improved profitability.\nSaaS and Technology Services revenues were $13.3 million in Q2 2023, a decrease of 22% as compared to $17 million in Q2 2022. This decline was due to timing of contracts in the company's cybersecurity-related business. Cybersecurity and data protection revenue tends to be lumpy, which resulted in strong quarterly revenue in Q1 2023, followed by lower revenue in this quarter. We are expecting Q3 revenue to bounce back again for this segment. Outside of cybersecurity, our remaining SaaS and services platform business increased 29% on a year-over-year basis to $11.3 million in Q2 2023 from $8.8 million in Q2 2022.\nWELL ended Q2 2023 with a solid balance sheet. As of June 30, 2023, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of $35.6 million. WELL continues to be in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related with this 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. The debt from the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 233 million as of June 30, 2023. I'm also pleased to report we have further reduced WELL's shareholder leverage ratio to 2.3x as at the end of Q2 2023 compared to 3x as of Q2 2022, and compared to 2.6x in the prior quarter as at Q1 2023. We define leverage ratio as net bank debt, excluding convertible debentures, less cash on hand, divided by shareholder adjusted EBITDA. The improvement in WELL's leverage ratio was achieved by a decrease in the company's debt levels and an increase in shareholder adjusted EBITDA over the past year.\nIn terms of our share capitalization, as of August 9, 2023, WELL had 257,539,249 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding. That is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. I will now provide some specific outlook on our business units. First, with primary care. We're expecting our primary care business to exhibit healthy growth in the second half of the year due to both organic growth and the acquisition of clinics from MCI One Health in Alberta and Ontario. During the second quarter we completed the acquisition of 5 clinics from MCI, which are located in Calgary and will have a positive revenue impact to our Q3 results. We've already started the integration of these 5 clinics into our national clinic network and things are going WELL. Then on July 19, WELL entered into an agreement with MCI that includes the acquisition of all but one of their clinical assets located in Southern Ontario, which are expected to generate annual revenues of more than $21 million. This acquisition brings more than 130 physicians to the WELL family and significantly expands WELL's footprint and breadth of services in Ontario. These MCI clinics in Ontario are expected to come on board in October and provide a revenue boost to our primary care business in the fourth quarter.\nInitially, we're expecting EBITDA to be negatively impacted by the acquired MCI clinics in Alberta and Ontario. Notwithstanding this, we've established a strong plan to improve the efficiency and output of these clinics by leveraging WELL's operating playbook, which includes extensive use of our practitioner enablement platform. As we go through the process of digitizing and modernizing these clinics, we expect them to become profitable in 2024. One of the exciting aspects of this acquisition is the fact that we will now have a much larger base of primary care clinics in Ontario and can refer into our MyHealth specialized care network, which will only strengthen our overall business in Ontario.\nAnd that leads us to MyHealth. My Health had an outstanding quarter with strong year-over-year growth and improved profitability with Q2 being seasonally the strongest quarter for MyHealth. We do expect MyHealth revenue to decline in Q3 2023 compared to Q2 due to seasonality, however, we anticipate a healthy trajectory is demonstrated in year-over-year strength in the back half of the year. In reference to Ontario's Bill 60, your Health Act, which allows out-of-hospital facilities to perform publicly funded surgeries and diagnostic procedures, including MRI and CT, we continue to await the highly anticipated final regulations and call for applications for licensing. Although exact timelines are not publicly released, we anticipate a call for applications to occur in Q4.\nMyHealth Center continues to be highly engaged throughout the process with the optimism of serving the patients of Ontario and helping reduce MRI and CT patient times the following calendar year. If successful in obtaining MRI/CT licenses additional capital cost to purchase the scanners and extensive leasehold improvements would be required. We anticipate lead times of close to 9 months to have these services fully operational clinics. As such, we don't expect any revenue in 2023 from the release of this regulation.\nI'll now discuss the outlook for our newly branded WELL Health USA business. On July 27, the company announced that it had rebranded CRH Medical and launched WELL Health USA, a multidisciplinary health care business spanning primary and specialized care with on and off-line operations at scale. Well Health USA's goal is to mirror WELL's mission of tech-enabled care providers in the United States, while digitizing and modernizing their health care businesses.\nIn addition, WELL Health USA will leverage its deep U.S.-based health care expertise and structural advantages to create a whole new category of shared services that will benefit and deliver improved integration and facilitate further growth between WELLs U.S.-based lines of business. WELL Health USA is a highly profitable and rapidly growing business with operating run rate revenues of approximately CAD 0.5 billion. It's also important to note that we have a really outstanding team there with over 100 years of combined experience in allocating capital, integrating and growing health care businesses and working inside of some of the largest and most prominent health care companies in the United States.\nThe different lines of business under WELL Health USA includes CRH Anesthesia, CRH O'Regan, Radar Healthcare Providers, Circle Medical and WISP. I'll now provide a quick update on these businesses. First, CRH. CRH is having an outstanding year so far. We expect CRH anesthesia case volumes to continue to follow normal seasonal patterns in 2023 with the highest number of cases increasing in each quarter, with Q4 2023 again being forecast as strongest revenue quarter again this year for CRH. CRH anesthesia services should get a boost in revenue in Q3 from the addition of 18 ASC practices from the CarePlus acquisition as well. Also, CRH's efforts to digitize operations are bearing fruit. CRH has invested substantially into its revenue cycle management program with implementations of numerous new digital tools designed to improve business intelligence, collections visibility and collections performance.\nOn June 22, 2023, the company announced that CRH had made strategic investment in Graphium Health, a leading EMR company focused on anesthesia practices. The investment is part of a strategic alliance designed to further digitize and modernize CRH's back, billing and back office processes. Based on a recent pilot project with Graphium Health, CRH has demonstrated that it had improved its time to capture billable charges by 58% or 5.6 days and reduced its overall accounts receivable balance as the pilot project sites by 24%. As a result of the successful pilot investment, CRH Medical plans to expand this initiative to at least 54 additional ASCs over the next 3 years where CRH provides anesthesia services.\nSecondly, Radar. We're very pleased to be welcoming the Radar Healthcare Providers team to the WELL family as part of the CarePlus acquisition. Radar provides staffing and locum tenant services, focus on anesthesia providers with a specialization in anesthesiologists recruitment and placement for its network of customers, which include provider groups, hospitals and ASCs across 29 states. With a database of over 70,000 anesthesia providers to leverage, Radar has served over 150 clients to date and is well positioned to further increase its footprint of providers and clients. Greater adds significant upside for growth and diversification beyond clinical anesthesia services to include recruitment services. Radar is also well positioned to serve as a shared service provider -- shared service for provider recruitment and billing services to the other U.S.-based businesses in WELL's portfolio.\nFurthermore, WELL Health USA intends to expand the scope of Radar to other specialties and health care professionals such as physician specialists, primary care and nursing professionals. We're off to a great start with Radar so far and seeing revenues and growth in line with our expectations.\nAnd now for Circle Medical. Last quarter, we mentioned that there would be some temporary softness in medical -- Circle Medical's Q2 results as management's focus had shifted from expanding its physical clinic network and the prompt return to growth as the company makes growth it's primary priority again, we were right on both accounts. The Circle Medical team put an enormous amount of focus and energy into being compliant with the end of the public health emergency in May and expected removal of COVID era waivers allowing companies such as surgical medical to prescribe controlled substances via telemedicine. This involves expanding its in-person clinic network from a few clinics to 27 and seeing over 13,000 telemedicine patients, 66% of our target in person within 1 quarter, a logistical feat unmatched by Circle's competitors.\nThe waivers were extended at the last minute, and we are optimistic that recent moves by the DEA will lead to a more flexible regulatory environment that allows for prescription of controlled substances without an in-person appointment where clinically appropriate. Either way, we are resilient and extremely well prepared for any direction that the DEA takes given our robust in personal clinical network and proven ability to rapidly adapt to changing circumstances. We were accurate in our prediction of a rapid return to a focus on growth post public health emergency. Based on booking data, we have high confidence that Circle Medical is already exceeding a run rate of over CAD100 million and profitable in August, and we expect strong month-over-month growth for the balance of the year.\nThe growth in revenues and our projections for the balance of the year has primarily to do with Circle Medical growth team turning their attention from establishing a strong physical network to onboarding physicians. In fact, in the last 4 weeks, we have increased the number of physicians onboarded by more than 25% over the previous month and continue to ramp up as we have retooled our provider recruitment process to onboard more providers in the less time than before.\nAnd now a few words on WISP. Last quarter, we discussed how West is retooling some of its key product and distribution partners, which resulted in slower growth in Q2 and minimal adjusted EBITDA contribution in the first half of the year. I'm pleased to report that WISP has mostly completed this work and we are now expecting revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of the year with improved profitability. Additional spending in Q1 and Q2, primarily on marketing costs, to gain new patients and drive additional revenues is already starting to pay off thus far in Q3. In fact, July was a record month of revenue for the company with USD 5 million in revenues.\nWith the recent launch of our new and improved online platform, we are now able to launch new products more quickly and efficiently and have plans to launch 10 new products over the next several months. For example, just a couple of weeks ago, WISP became the first telehealth brand in the United States to bring DoxyPEP, the morning after pill for STDs to market.\nFinally, our SaaS and Technology Services business, as we had previously guided in our last call, cybersecurity and data protection business had close to its best quarter ever in Q1. But being a lumpy business, revenues declined in the second quarter as we had expected. Cybersecurity revenues can often be impacted by the timing of hardware shipments at the end of the quarter. Thus far, Q3 is looking like a stronger quarter again with several contracts delivered. We're expecting a bounce back in cybersecurity revenues, while the rest of the SaaS services business continues to perform with steady growth and profitability. OceanMD is a key component of our SaaS and technology services group and is emerging as a leader in patient engagement and e-referral solutions. Ocean's e-referral software allows primary care providers to send their request to surgeons through the Ocean e-Referral network instead of faxing, e-mailing or mailing, which makes surgical console easier -- referrals easier and reduces wait times for patients.\nOceanMD is already the dominant e-referral solution in the province of Ontario. Last quarter, we reported that OceanMD has been selected by the province of Nova Scotia first referral solution. And this week, obviously, today, OceanMD, we reported signed a $38.5 million contract with BC PSSH providing an array of digital services such as e-referrals, e-consults and e-orders to help -- tech-enable providers with the best-in-class digital interoperability tools. With this win in BC, we feel OceanMD has the potential to become the e-referral standard across the country.\nOceanMD has notably proven its ability to reduce wait times by as much as 52 days, including a 35-day reduction in referral processing time alone, thereby significantly improving access to care. In Ontario, the implementation of OceanMD's platform was shown to result in a 12% reduction in medically unnecessary MRIs, underlining a direct cost saving impact for provincial health systems. One of the things that is really truly special about Ocean is that it's the only piece of commercial software that we know of that connects with all the major EMR NHIS systems in the country. That means that it connects into TELUS Health, Accuro, Wells Oscar and other EMR systems in addition to major EMR and EHR systems for hospitals such as Epic and Cerner.\nMoving on to the WELL EMR Group. We're also very excited to report that our intra-health EMR team was selected by another government agency in New Zealand on a significant multimillion dollar contract, which includes over $1 million in ERR and more than $1 million in implementation services.\nI'll now provide an update on our AI-related activities. We're incredibly excited about the potential of AI and healthcare. Our vision is that AI-powered solutions can have positive impact on the health care sector by giving health care providers clinical and decision support tools that will give them their time back, enhance clinical productivity and provide a better patient experience. We are determined to faithfully support and tech-enabled health care professionals with the very best technology available, which now includes significant investments in AI-based products and services.\nLast quarter, I highlighted that WELL had made AI a priority, and I'm pleased to report that we're starting to see some of the operating improvements as a result of leveraging AI internally, including: one, reduced team member Q-monitoring. One of our platform teams first-line support group now leverages GPT4-powered AI solutions that pull answers from internal resources and automatically response to acquiring customers; two, we're leveraging intelligent chat bots to provide improved access to knowledge outside of support hours as well as improved response rates and experience for patients who are reaching out for support; and three, a number of our internal development teams have been heavily leveraging Microsoft Copilot and starting to benefit from generative AI solutions that can significantly increase developer productivity.\nIn addition to this, we're working on compelling new products and enhancements to roll out to our provider network. In Q2, we did just that with the launch of several key initiatives, including WELL AI voice and the WELL AI investment program. And a few words on AI voice. WELL AI voice is a transformational ambient scribed product that leverages generative AI to dramatically reduce the providers' administrative burden by privately and securely capturing a patient encounter in conversation and automatically generating a succinct and medically relevant chat note for the patient interaction. WELL AI voice is a powerful tool that is able to communicate seamlessly with WELL's EMR products, making it easy for providers to deploy, manage and benefit from the technology quickly without having to harmonize the usage of disparate tools.\nProviders love WELL AI voice because it allows them to focus more of their consultation time on the patient and spend less time taking notes. Patients love the experience because they no longer have to compete with the doctor's laptop for attention. One of our physicians was recently quoted by our sales team as saying, WELL AI voice has made my work life amazing, and now I look forward to coming to work to use it. Strong statements like this demonstrate the value of WELL AI voice and the real impact it has on day-to-day lives of positions. We've had a controlled rollout to ensure quality, safety and security and ensure that results are as intended to date.\nAnd we can say that WELL AI voice has seamlessly integrated into more than 5,000 patient visits so far. We've seen strong user growth with the average physician using the tool for more than 230 sessions per month. All of this demonstrates growing trust in our product and its efficiency in the real-world healthcare setting. While we are providing this technology for subscriptions in our EMR network, we are also planning to roll it out to the majority of WELL's primary care operations in the balance of the year and are excited about the benefits that it affords our internal network.\nAs part of our commitment to developing AI technologies, WELL announced the AI investment platform, whose goal it is to invest in at least 10 companies and to ensure that each investee has a strategic alliance agreement with WELL and allows it to benefit from WELL's health care ecosystem. Since launching the program, we've already connected with more than 125 new companies and have spent considerable time to narrow down the group to approximately 2.5 dozen companies where we're having deeper conversations.\nWe are already in discussion on terms with a handful of these companies and expect to have some exciting developments to share soon. Before we conclude the call, I'd like to provide some additional commentary on the MCI strategic alliance and investment. As part of the agreements with MCI, WELL purchased the MCI Ontario clinics for consideration of $1.5 million and acquired the debt of a key creditor for $3.5 million to help facilitate the deal.\nFinally, WELL will also lead a new investment round into MCI in which WELL will commit at least $2.5 million as part of a convertible debenture financing of up to $10 million. Going forward, MCI will be strategically focused on its leading AI, data science and rare and complex disease detection platform. WELL also intends to enter into a strategic alliance agreement designed to provide WELL clinics with leading-edge technology from MCI and better position MCI as a key national leader in Canada.\nAs part of the strategic alliance, WELL has joined MCI's Board of Directors and subject to satisfaction of certain conditions. WELL will also hold an option to acquire up to 30.8 million Class A and Class B shares in MCI over time. This means that WELL will have an opportunity in the future to acquire control of MCI One Health. In the event elects to do so -- it elects to acquire the multi-voting shares it has optioned out subject to the terms and conditions of its various agreements, covenants and rights.\nWe believe the multibillion-dollar disease detection industry is a big opportunity for MCI with its Cure Health platform. Cure Health is already available on the apps.health platform and is integrated into WELL's Astepro EMR. We're looking forward to working with MCI in developing and amplifying this world-class technology. In addition, we believe MCI is an ideal company for building additional healthcare-related data science and AI technologies.\nWe're really excited about the upside investment potential offered by the new strategic direction and the recapitalization of MCI One Health. We have big and extensive plans here folks, stay closely tuned.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with our financial performance thus far in 2023 and look forward to delivering strong results again for the balance of the year. Our outlook for 2023 remains positive. Hence, I am confident in upgrading our annual guidance again with more of our guided EBITDA appearing in Q4 versus Q3. And please keep in mind that the big contract win announced today doesn't contribute meaningfully to this year's results. We have many tailwinds driving growth in the business, and we have a committed and disciplined team to ensure that we're able to execute on our objectives.\nIn closing, I will provide an update on our ongoing ESG program. I'm proud to have released WELL's second ESG report on July 7, entitled, 'Taken care of the care providers'. This report highlights WELL the ESG strategy, reporting initiatives and targeted actions. WELL is a purpose-driven company that aims to transform the world for the better, as such, our ESG report outlines this objective.\nFinally, I want to thank you all for joining us on this call today, and thanks to our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals and support our providers. I would also like to thank WELL's senior management team and all our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort. In particular, I'd like to thank our team of healthcare practitioners and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care. They remind us every day why we're here, and we are here to support them. With that, we will be open to receive some questions now. Operator, can you please facilitate."

Q1 2023 Earnings Call\n\nWELLTORONTOMAY 12, 1:00 PM\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome to the WELL Health Technologies Corp. First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Laura, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Tyler Baba, Manager, Investor Relations. Mr. Baba, you may begin.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Fiscal First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO. I trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today.\nPortions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities law, including future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL control that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements as well to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except if it is required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, all of which are non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Tyler, and good day, everyone. We hope you're all keeping safe and healthy, and we appreciate you for joining us today. Overall, we're very pleased with our record-breaking quarter in which we achieved record revenue and growth across all key metrics. WELL achieved revenue of $169.5 million in the first quarter, representing 34% year-over-year revenue growth. The first quarter of 2023 also marks our 17th consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company's growth was driven by acquisitions made over the past year as well as solid year-over-year organic growth of 21% in the first quarter. So most of our 34% year-over-year growth came from organic growth.\nI'm proud to report that WELL has healthy cash flows having achieved almost $26.7 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2023, resulting in adjusted free cash flow available to shareholders of approximately $10.8 million. Our record revenue, profitability and patient visits are a testament to the company's continued focus on tech-enabling health care providers and supporting them in terms of simplifying their work lives, modernizing and digitizing their practices and delivering the best health care possible. We're extremely passionate about supporting our providers as we set up our business in a way that we only succeed if they do. This attitude and focus is what allows the company to continue to witness healthy growth across all its business segments, including both online and in person care channels, with minimal impacts due to recession, inflation, supply chain or other macroeconomic effects.\nLast quarter, we discussed a number of new catalysts that we felt were going to act as key tailwinds for WELL. We'd like to reiterate and update them as follows: one, the emergence of artificial intelligence, including generative AI to power revolutionary tools that can dramatically improve the productivity of the health care provider. We will spend a considerable amount of time on -- later on today's call discussing our AI strategy and key progress updates. Two, the increased likelihood of more public and private partnerships announced by political and public health leaders most recently in Ontario earlier this year. Three, a commitment by federal authorities in Canada to add significant additional funding to help Canada, not only improve sustainability of its health care system, but to also digitize and modernize it. Four, the demonstration, particularly in the United States of how valuable hybrid care networks are based on a string of highly visible multibillion-dollar acquisitions, where major companies such as Amazon and large pharmacy chains have been acquiring providers of scaled hybrid health care providers, particularly in primary care with strong physical and telehealth offerings. To that end, WELL has considerably grown its physical infrastructure in the U.S., ending the quarter with 23 physical facilities from 5 at the end of December 2023 -- 2022, pardon me. Five, our own M&A pipeline is very strong, and we are seeing some of the best opportunities we have seen in a while. We'll give this topic some due focus today.\nBefore I hand the call over to Eva to review the first quarter financial results, I'd like to provide some additional background on WELL and our growing patient volume metrics.\nOver the past 5 years, we have grown both organically and inorganically into 1 of the leading digital health care companies in North America. In Q1 2023, WELL achieved record patient interactions of approximately 1.4 million patient interactions, an increase of 27%, representing 5.6 million patient interactions on an annualized run rate basis. In Q1 2023, WELL achieved 975,500 total omnichannel patient visits, including both Canadian and U.S. patient visits, an increase of 25% compared to the prior year. The growth of our patient visit metrics demonstrate the company's continued leadership position as the preeminent end-to-end health care company in Canada with increasing market share in the United States. I'm also pleased to announce that WELL has now surpassed over 3,000 practitioners who deliver patient care from 1 of WELL's owned clinics or business units.\nWe offer these practitioners a fully managed service, where the practitioners can focus on delivering care while WELL takes care of everything else. Furthermore, there are now over 28,000 unique practitioners who rely on WELL in some way to power their medical practices. That equates to more than 1 out of every 4 health care providers in Canada who uses 1 of WELL's technology solutions. These practitioners can pick tools and solutions on an a la carte basis, such as practice management, telehealth, revenue cycle management or patient engagement tools such as online patient booking or e-referrals. If you haven't had a chance to look at our Q1 2023 MD&A, or management discussion and analysis report posted to SEDAR this morning, I urge you to take a look. Inside, you'll find that we provided some enhanced segmentation, which now breaks down the business between our fully managed patient services and SaaS and technology services businesses. You'll find a lot of new detailed metrics across both U.S. and Canadian businesses as well as detailed KPIs on our SaaS and services businesses.\nWe'd like to continue to shine a light on all the different levers of the business to help investors and analysts better understand WELL and how we're delivering on our mission of tech-enabling providers. Let's look at this new lens on segmentation and how it reflects our business. First, we've got our Patient Services business. This segment includes WELL's owned and operated network of clinics, which is Canada's largest network of clinics consisting of 139 clinics operating out of 77 physical facilities. WELL's strongly believes in the benefits of an integrated health offering and bringing together a diverse multidisciplinary offering of providers in the same setting. As such, many of these physical facilities have multiple clinics operating within the same location. Keep in mind that the total number of clinics across both the U.S. and Canada is north of 160 clinics operated out of 100 physical facilities, not including any ASCs, or ambulatory surgery centers, served by CRH Medical.\nOur Canadian Patient Services business includes primary care, Allied Health, Executive Health, and diagnostic clinics delivered through in-person and telehealth means, which, combined, generating almost 504,000 patient visits in Q1 alone, a 14% increase over Q1 2022.\nSecondly, in terms of segments, our Patient Services business in the United States. This group includes omnichannel health care services and solutions WELL provide in the United States targeting specialized markets such as the gastrointestinal market, women's health, primary care and mental disorders under the CRH, Circle Medical and Wisp business units. Our U.S. patient services business generated almost 472,000 patient visits in the first quarter an increase of 40% as compared to the same quarter last year, driven mostly by the organic growth at Circle and Wisp, in addition to the acquisition growth at CRH. Under the CRH brand, we are the leading provider of sedation services for colonoscopies in the U.S. in an ambulatory setting. In the U.S., WELL continues to expand its clinical presence with anesthesia services now being offered in 128 ASCs and GI clinics across 18 states. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Circle Medical is a leading provider of telehealth based primary care, with an emphasis on mental health services, with a growing physical clinic network.\nAnd then also part of this segment is, of course, Wisp, 1 of the largest and fastest-growing specialty telehealth businesses focusing uniquely on women's reproductive and sexual health. And then the third segment that you'll see is our SaaS and Technology Services segment. This group includes all of our best-in-class platform tools and services that help providers digitize, modernize and support their clinical operations, inclusive of EMR, billing, revenue cycle management, digital apps, including OceanMD and of course, cybersecurity and data protection divisions, which essentially form the entire practitioner enablement platform.\nKeep in mind that WELL is a unique company with both patient services and technology. We own significant intellectual property which drive our industry-leading solutions and has created compelling and relevant links with health care providers all over the country. What is really interesting about the link between our SaaS and Patient Services segment is that WELL is the largest customer of our own platform. How is that for authenticity, a company that uses its own software at scale and demonstrate that it works every day.\nAdditional key metrics for this business unit include the fact that now the WELL EMR Group serves 3,900 clinics in Canada. OceanMD reported 190,000 e-referrals just in Q1. Our billing and revenue cycle management business has expanded to serving over 5,700 health care practitioners. And our apps.health now has 54 digital applications or apps on its platform, making it the largest health care-focused app marketplace in Canada.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong Fong, who will review the financials for fiscal quarter 2023. I will then come back and provide further commentary on our business units and, of course, our outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2023. Our overall first quarter results were as follows. WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $169.4 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 34% as compared to revenue of $126.5 million generated during Q1 of last year. This growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $86.2 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 24% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $69.4 million in Q1 last year.\nGrowth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $26.7 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 14% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $23.5 million in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders was $20.6 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 28% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders of $16.1 million in Q1 2022.\nAdjusted net income was $14.1 million or $0.06 per share in Q1 2023, an increase of 58% as compared to adjusted net income of $8.9 million or $0.04 per share in the same period last year. WELL generated 12% of its revenues from truly recurring and subscription revenues and 83% of its revenue from its highly recurring patient services revenues. That means that approximately 95% of its revenues are highly predictable.\nI will now review our segment results, as described by Hamed earlier. Our Canadian patient services business achieved another record quarter with revenue of $50.9 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 23% as compared to $41.3 million in Q1 2022. Canadian Patient Services revenue includes revenue generated from our primary care and MyHealth. divisions. Primary Care revenues increased 45% to $24.8 million in Q1 2023 compared to $17.1 million in Q1 2022, primarily due to organic growth and the addition of new clinics. Primary Care revenue also benefited from a onetime stabilization payment from the BC government of approximately $0.5 million in the first quarter as well as higher billings from the new payment model for BC doctors that was implemented in February earlier this year.\nIn Q1 2023, MyHealth revenue increased 8% to $26.1 million as compared to $24.2 million in Q1 2020. The growth in MyHealth revenue is attributable to continued effort to alleviate staff shortages experienced last year leading to higher billable time for many of its diagnostic procedures. MyHealth also benefited in the quarter from the addition of new cardiologists to its practice.\nOur U.S. patient services revenue was $99.2 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 38% as compared to $72.1 million in Q1 2022. U.S. patient services includes our CRH, Circle Medical and Wisp businesses. For Q1 2023, CRH revenues were $57.5 million, an increase of 19% as compared to $48.2 million in Q1 last year. CRH case volumes also continue to be very strong, with 132,580 anesthesia cases completed in Q1 2023, an increase of 13% compared to Q1 last year.\nCase volumes in the first quarter were positively impacted by the acquisition of affiliated Tempa Anesthesia Associates in the quarter.\nGiven the nature of how health plans and their deductibles work through the year for elective procedures, such as colonoscopies, fourth quarter is usually CRH's strongest seasonal quarter. And normally, we would expect CRH's Q1 revenue to decline from Q4. However, this quarter, we witnessed an increase of 10% in CRH's revenue from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023, which was largely due to a onetime promotional campaign for its O'Regan product, resulting in a record 59,620 O'Regan negator units being sold in the first quarter, an increase of 41% and as compared to 42,280 negator units sold in Q1 2022, and an increase of [ 39% ] compared to 42,750 negator units sold in Q4 of last year. The O'Regan product promotional campaign has now ended and negate unit volumes have returned to normal levels.\nCircle Medical revenues were $23.1 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 93% as compared to revenue of $12 million in Q1 of last year. Wisp achieved revenue of $18.6 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 56% as compared to revenue of $11.9 million in Q1 2022. Both Circle Medical and Wisp have achieved tremendous revenue growth over the past year, which has been entirely organic in nature. Of note, we increased our ad spending in Q1 2023 for Wisp to take advantage of much lower ad rate in the first 3 months of the year as compared to the last 3 months of the year. Although this did have a softening effect of our overall adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, I'm pleased to report that Wisp still managed to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter.\nSaaS and Technology Services revenues were $19.3 million in Q1 2023, an increase of 47%, as compared to $13.1 million in Q1 2022. The vast majority of this growth came organically, which was 42% growth year-over-year. Also in Q1, SaaS and Technology Services revenue growth was driven by exceptional growth in the cybersecurity and data protections business, which achieved its best quarter ever. Cyber security and data protection revenue tends to be lumpy, and we are not expecting this growth to continue into Q2 2023.\nWELL ended Q1 2023 with a solid balance sheet. As at March 31, 2023, WELL had cash and cash equivalents of CAD 41.7 million. While continues to be in good standing and fully compliant with all covenants related with its 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and World Bank in Canada. The debt from the 2 credit lines was approximately CAD 253.4 million as of March 31, 2023.\nI'm also very pleased to report that we have reduced WELL's leverage ratio to 2.6x as at the end of Q1 2023 compared to 3.5x as at Q1 of last year. We define leverage ratio as total debt excluding convertible debentures, less cash on hand, divided by shareholder adjusted EBITDA. The improvement in WELL's leverage ratio was achieved by a decrease in the company's debt levels and an increase in shareholder adjusted EBITDA.\nIn terms of our share capitalization, as of May 11, 2023, WELL had 253,787,569 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO\n\nThank you, Eva. Before I speak to our outlook, I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about the development use and proliferation of artificial intelligence or AI-based technologies and solutions at WELL. I'm pleased to report that as a company with deep tech experience and capabilities, we have made AI a key priority within the company and are working on compelling new products and enhancements to roll out to our provider network. At WELL, we have developed a 3-pronged I strategy as follows: first prong is to develop and deploy new physician tools and technologies that better support our providers. Earlier this week, the company launched WELL AI voice, transformational ambient scribe product that leverages generative AI to dramatically reduce the providers' administrative burden by privately and securely capturing a patient encounter conversation and automatically generating a succinct and medically relevant chart notes for the patient interaction. What makes WELL AI voice so powerful is not only its ability to leverage generative AI, but also its ability to communicate seamlessly with WELL's EMR products, making it easy for providers to deploy, manage and benefit from the technology quickly and easily without having to harmonize the usage of [indiscernible] tools.\nOur focus is on provider-facing technologies in AI and thirdly, derisking and creating barrels for this sort of technology for health care providers. We believe that AI technologies can be used safely and securely to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of health care providers and to deliver better patient outcomes.\nThe second prong for us is to establish centers of excellence at WELL to help our employees become better users of AI. Long term, this may end up being the most important facet of AI for us. We have placed high priority on the safe and secure usage of AI technologies as well and are well on our way to embrace the technology to increase the core productivity of the company. We are thoughtfully considering different ways of putting the technology to work, including hosting internal hackathon sessions to help us coalesce around best ideas. We're also in the process of hiring AI facilitators to help ensure that our teams are driving maximum benefit from AI.\nThird prong is to place more bets or investments on AI and health care-focused companies. As part of our commitment to developing AI technologies, WELL recently announced that it was launching the WELL AI investment platform in our WELL Ventures group. whose goal it is to invest in at least 10 companies this year with a minimum investment of $250,000 and to ensure that each investee has a strategic alliance agreement with WELL that allows it to benefit from WELL's health care ecosystem. Since launching this program, we have already seen more than 100 companies come inbound into our channels.\nIn addition, our apps.health platform is a very attractive aspect of the AI investment program as it provides a framework for AI-based technology companies to integrate with our Oscar EMR as well as other EMRs and health care-related applications. We already have several AI-focused applications in our apps.health platform.\nLastly, for AI, we're also investigating opportunities to unlock the value of our own data to help further propel our providers and help them not only create more efficiency and productivity in their practices, but also importantly, better -- drive better patient outcomes. We believe that our data can help create new decision support systems in the future.\nThis is actually a good segue to WELL's ESG program. As you may be aware, WELL has a fulsome ESG program that is expressed at its dedicated ESG website at esg.well.company. There are effectively 3 key pillars to this program: One, our practitioner support and digital enablement, which, of course, is our mission and mandate. The second is the safeguarding of patient data. And the third is to be a very healthy place to work. We believe AI will profoundly impact and strengthen WELL's ESG program at all levels, but I'd like to zoom into pillar #2 for a minute and discuss how we believe WELL can add societal value using its ESG program and commitments.\nYou see we believe that WELL's commitment to champion the cause of privacy, safety and security of patient data now needs to be achieved within the context of allowing patients to knowingly, in a clear and unambiguous manner, be able to have their data work for them and help them create personal insights for them that can help them acquire life-changing insights, but also support the greater good by allowing their data to be shared, again, knowingly for neural networks that are powering deep learning. This is a very important, but highly fundamental shift. Data security is not good enough. It does not allow me as a consumer or as a patient to derive benefit from my data, especially as we shift into a world where we finally have the technology that allows machines to learn, find that needle in the haystack problem and provide outstanding insights.\nAnd now I'd like to speak a bit about our outlook for 2023. We're pleased to report that all of our business units are executing very well, and we are expecting to have very strong performance in 2023 across all of our BUs and for the entire company as a whole. The company doesn't foresee any material influences or challenges that would impair its ability to deliver solid results in 2023 as we're poised to invest in, achieve significant growth while delivering on enhanced profitability. As such, management is pleased to provide the following guidance for 2023.\nWe are increasing our guidance for annual revenues to between $690 million and $710 million, representing 21% to 25% annual growth. This is an increase from our prior guidance of annual revenue, which was between $665 million and $685 million. We're also pleased to reiterate our guidance for annual adjusted EBITDA to increase by more than 10% over 2022 levels. Our guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. Previously, we've indicated that between our organic growth and steady acquisition program, we believe we have a clear line of sight to $1 billion in revenues in 3 years. Today, we'd like to report that we are now seeing 1 of the most compelling pipelines of acquisitions we've ever seen. This doesn't mean we're going to rush out and execute on all of them as we're going to continue to be extremely disciplined in terms of our due diligence and our capital allocation processes. However, it does mean that if we are able to execute on some of these opportunities, we could potentially reach $1 billion in sales in less than a time in 3 years. Again, this is highly conditioned on our ability to execute on some of these opportunities, but highly encouraging to know that this potential exists, especially given the health of our balance sheet. Stay tuned on this as your team here at WELL executes.\nI will now provide some additional outlook for our business segments. First, our Canadian patient services business, including primary care and MyHealth. And it's become a lot more difficult for doctors to run their own clinical businesses. We talked about this in the past due to the increasing complexity brought about by hybrid and complex workflows, IT security and other challenges, making it very difficult for the physicians to run even small practices. For this reason, we are seeing more physicians seek WELL out as a professional partner to help them run their businesses so they can focus on providing patient care. Our model allows for health care providers to maintain similar pre unit economics, but end up seeing a lot more patients if they don't have to run a practice, which allows them to elevate care, improve earnings and better support the health care ecosystem.\nGrowth in our Patient Services business in 2023 will be driven by continuing to focus on organic growth and executing on a highly disciplined clinic acquisition program. Our organic growth includes recruiting more physicians and recruiting or absorbing clinics themselves. In addition, we have a very active pipeline of clinic acquisition opportunities ranging from single clinics to small networks.\nI'd like to now comment on our MyHealth business in Ontario. WELL's Ontario-based MyHealth Partners is the largest single mentions holder and service provider for specialty clinics providing diagnostics in the province of Ontario, and we believe it is very well positioned to support the Ontario government's mandate particularly in the areas of diagnostic imaging. Last quarter, we discussed the Ontario government's new multipronged strategy to reduce wait times by partnering with independent service providers for Ontarians, including areas associated with MRI, CT, colonoscopy and endoscopy services. We intend to apply for new MRI and CT licenses, which will be provided by the province of Ontario under the SE program.\nWe anticipate that new licenses will be awarded in the second half of 2023. If MyHealth is successful in its application, we would need to incur additional capital costs to purchase imaging equipment and for leasehold improvements. We anticipate lead times of several months to having these services fully operational in clinics. As such, we don't expect a meaningful contribution in 2023 if we were to win these licenses.\nOur outlook for Q2 remains positive as we're expecting MyHealth to report a strong quarter as the second quarter is seasonally the strongest for MyHealth historically. Almost all of MyHealth's revenue arises from referrals from physicians, and as such, as they are more working days in Q2 compared to the slower summer months, or the December flooding season, MyHealth therefore, experienced more patient volumes in the second quarter.\nAnd now some commentary on U.S. patient services businesses, including CRH Circle and Wisp. For the CRH business, we expect CRH case volumes to follow normal seasonal patterns in 2023, with the number of cases increasing in each subsequent quarter as we expect Q4 2023 will again be the strongest revenue quarter for CRH. It should be noted that between Q1 and Q2 2022, CRH received more than $2 million in U.S. in pandemic-related government assistance. This grant helped offset labor costs and thus improved EBITDA in Q1 and Q2 last year, which will not be repeated in Q2 2023. Also, as you previously mentioned, CRH revenue in Q1 was boosted by a onetime promotion on Oregon product sales. We're not looking to repeat this product promotion in Q2. Hence, we do expect Origin product sales to decline in the second quarter, which should not materially impact overall results. For our circa Medical business, Q1 will be a transformative quarter in which circle built out its physical clinical network already a leader in providing telehealth services for primary mental health. I'm pleased to report that Circle Medical aggressively grew its physical clinic network to 18 clinics across the United States as of the end of Q1 2023 compared to only 2 clinics at the end of December. The expansion of Circle Medical's physical clinic network will improve its hybrid care capabilities and strengthen its ability to better support its patients. The new clinics strategically located in cities across the United States offer a range of medical services, including primary care and specialty care. The clinics are equipped with state-of-the-art technology staffed by highly qualified health care professionals and designed to provide a seamless health care experience for Circle Medical's excellent telemedicine platform. The clinic expansion of our Circle Medical network positions the company well for the public health emergency in the United States. Going forward, our plan is to follow a slower and more measured patient expanding circle physical clinical network as compared to the aggressive pace that we've witnessed, we expect the expansion of Circle Medical's physical footprint and related investments to create some softness around their results in Q2, but we believe this will further fuel their growth in the back half of the year and have considered this as part of our overall guidance.\nOur Wisp business is expected to continue to experience healthy revenue growth in 2023. However, we are purposely reinvesting any cash flows generated by this business back into growth. The additional spending is primarily on marketing costs, taking new patients and drive additional revenues. As a result of this reinvestment, we are expecting minimal adjusted EBITDA contribution from Wisp in the first half of the year, which is also retooling some of its key product and distribution partners in Q2. So while we expect revenues to be strong over the full year, we will have lower growth temporarily next quarter in Q2 2023.\nFinally, SaaS and Technology Services. The outlook looks promising for our SaaS and tech services group. And as Eva noted earlier, this group had incredible growth in Q1 with 42% organic growth. Also for the first time in a while, SaaS and services comprised more than 10% of WELL's overall revenues, which is really great to see. As part of the SaaS platform, let's talk about Ocean. Ocean is emerging as a leader and patient engagement and referral solutions. Most recently, OceanMD referral platform was selected by the province of Nova Scotia, which will make a surgical consult referrals easier and reduce wait time for patients. The referral software allows primary care providers to send the request to surgeons through the Ocean referral network instead of faxing, e-mailing or many. Already, the dominant e-referral solution in the province of Ontario, we feel OceanMD has the potential to beat the e-referral standard across the country. And we are currently [indiscernible] process for additional e-referral related proposals in other provinces across Canada.\nMeanwhile, the technology assets acquired from CloudMD have been well integrated into our Provider Solutions group with [indiscernible] EMR completing our acquisitions for the [indiscernible] EMR-based providers and clinic a sitting in with our building and revenue cycle management division. Also, as [indiscernible] pointed out earlier, cybersecurity and data protection had its best quarter ever in Q1. But being a [indiscernible] business, we don't expect this level of activity in the second quarter. Hence, we are expecting our overall SaaS and technology services revenue to experience a slight decline in Q2 as compared to Q1.\nIn summary, we're very pleased with our financial performance thus far in 2023 and look forward to delivering strong results again for the rest of the year. Our outlook for 2020 remains positive. Hence, I'm confident in raising our annual guidance again. We have many tailwinds driving growth in the business, and we have a committed and discipline to ensure that we're able to execute on our objectives. Finally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the call today and thank our shareholders and investors for all of their support. The capital markets has been supportive of our vision and provided us with the funding needed to pursue our goals and, of course, power and tech enable our health care providers. I would also like to thank WELL's senior management team and our employees and contractors for their tremendous effort. In particular, I'd like to thank our team of health care practitioners and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care every single day. They remind us why we are here and what we are doing to support them. Thank you. And with that, we'd like to open the call for questions. Operator?"

My name is Michelle, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Pardeep Sangha, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Sangha, you may begin.\n\nPardeep S. Sangha\n\nVP of Corporate Strategy & IR, WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to WELL Health's Annual 2022 and Fiscal Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for 12 and 3 months ended December 31, 2022. Joining me on the call today are Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO; and Eva Fong, the company's CFO.\nI trust that everyone has received a copy of our financial results press release that was issued earlier today. Portions of today's call, other than historical performance, include statements of forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws. These statements are made under the safe harbor versions of those laws. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management, are inherently subject to significant business economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are outside of WELL's control and will cause the actual results, performance or achievement of WELL to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThese factors are further outlined in today's press release and in our management discussion and analysis. We provide forward-looking statements solely for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans [remain] to the future. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publically any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements based except as required by law.\nWe may use terms such as adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, shareholder EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow on this conference call, which are all non-GAAP and non-IFRS measures. For a more information on how we define these terms, please refer to the definition set out in today's press release and in our main discussion and analysis. The company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful financial metric as it measures cash generated from operations, which the company can use to fund working capital requirements, service future interest and principal debt repayments and fund future growth initiatives. And adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Mr. Hamed Shahbazi, Chairman and CEO. Go ahead, Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Pardeep, and good day, everyone. We hope that you're all keeping safe and healthy. We appreciate everyone for joining us today. To start, I'd like to provide some historical perspective on WELL. We recently celebrated the 5-year anniversary of the acquisition of our first 6 clinics in British Columbia, which took place in February of 2018.\nThat was WELL's first acquisition and began our journey into the health care market by tech-enabling health care providers in helping them modernize and digitize their businesses. We've seen an amazing journey, during which time WELL's grown from 0 revenue to completing a record year in 2022, in which we achieved over $625 million on a Q4 annualized revenue run rate basis. More than 1 out of every 4 providers in Canada rely on WELL in some way to power their businesses from practice management solutions to revenue cycle management to provider and patient communication tools such as online patient booking or e-referrals.\nOver the past 5 years, we've both grown organically and inorganically into one of the leading digital health care companies in North America. I'd like to thank the amazing team at WELL, including the health care providers who help make all of this possible. During the past 5 years, we went through an unprecedented global pandemic, during which our health care providers continued to provide incredible care under difficult conditions. The pandemic also accelerated the adoption of virtual care and digitization in the industry. More recently, we've also had to deal with very challenging circumstances, including worker shortages, supply chain difficulties and rising costs brought about by high inflation. On all occasions, our management team, employees and health care providers continued to overcome all these challenges, enabling the company to deliver phenomenal performances quarter after quarter.\nWe are now firmly in the post-pandemic period and witnessing a host of new catalysts that speak to WELL's relevance as a company, and our role in helping health care providers digitize and modernize their practices. And in many cases, help make those practices more economically sustainable.\nCatalysts that we are watching closely as a team and believe active tailwinds for the company are as follows: one, the increased likelihood of more public and private partnerships to support our health care ecosystem announced by political and public health leaders, most recently in Ontario; two, a commitment by federal authorities in Canada to add significant additional funding to help Canada not only improve the sustainability of its health care ecosystem, but also digitize and modernize it; three, the emergence of artificial intelligence, including generative AI to power tools and tech enablement for health care providers, never even conceived or thought before. By the way, this is an area of intense focus for your management team at WELL. We'll discuss this more later. The demonstration, particularly for -- the demonstration, particularly in the United States of how valuable hybrid care networks are to major pharmacies and other institutions. We seem to be in a new golden age of primary care, where there is ramp in innovation and an opportunity to elevate care and better support providers.\nMoving on to WELL's financial performance. We're thrilled to report another record-breaking year, with strong fourth quarter results and significant growth across all key metrics. WELL achieved record annual revenue of $569.1 million for 2022, an increase of 88% over the prior year. I'm proud to report that WELL has healthy cash flows having achieved almost $105 million in operating adjusted EBITDA in 2022, resulting in adjusted free cash flow to shareholders of approximately $49 million. Q4 2022 was also a tremendous quarter for the company. WELL achieved revenue of $156.5 million in the fourth quarter, representing 35% year-over-year revenue growth, most of which was organic.\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 also marks our 16th consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company's growth was driven by acquisitions made over the past year as well as solid year-over-year organic growth, which was 19% for the full year and 20% organic growth in the fourth quarter. WELL achieved record patient engagements over the past year with approximately 3.5 million omnichannel patient visits and 4.9 million patient interactions in 2022. Omnichannel patient visits grew 50% in 2022 compared to the prior year, and total patient interactions grew 86% over the same period.\nThis demonstrates our continued leadership position as the preeminent end-to-end health care company in Canada, while our U.S. businesses continue to exhibit industry-leading growth metrics. Our record revenue, profitability and patient visits are a testament to the company's continued focus on delivering accessible and innovative health care solutions. Additionally, our U.S.-based virtual services businesses continue to perform exceptionally well, further strengthening our position in the North American digital health care market.\nThe company continues to witness healthy growth across all its business segments, including both online and in-person care channels, with minimal impacts due to recession, inflation, supply chain issues or other macroeconomic effects.\nWith that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Eva Fong, who will review the annual financials for 2022 and fiscal fourth quarter, and we'll then come back and provide further commentary on our business units and outlook. Eva?\n\nEva Fong\n\nCFO, WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Hamed. I'm pleased to report that we had very strong results for the 3 months and year ended December 31, 2022. Our annual 2022 and fourth quarter results were as follows: WELL achieved record annual revenue of $569.1 million in 2022 compared to revenue of $302.3 million generated during 2021, an increase of 88%, driven by acquisitions and organic growth.\nAdjusted gross profit was $303.3 million in 2022, an increase of 97% compared to $153.7 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $104.6 million in 2022, an increase of 73% compared to $60.4 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders was $76.6 million in 2022, an increase of 82% compared to $42 million in 2021. Adjusted net income was $53.7 million in 2022, an increase of (inaudible) compared to [$16.3] million in 2021. Adjusted free cash flow attributable to WELL's shareholders was $48.8 million in 2022 as compared to $34.2 million in 2021. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders, minus cash taxes, minus cash interest costs and minus CapEx.\nOur fourth quarter results were as follows: WELL achieved record quarterly revenue of $156.5 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 35% as compared to revenue of $115.7 million generated during Q4 2021. This growth was driven by acquisitions and organic growth. WELL achieved record adjusted gross profit of $80.2 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 26% as compared to adjusted gross profit of $63.5 million in Q4 2021. Growth in the company's adjusted gross profit is attributable to higher revenue in the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $27.2 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 6% as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $25.7 million in Q4 2021. It is worth noting that we had really strong results in the prior period to Q4 2021, with the highest margins in the CRH history, which included more than $2 million of pandemic-related government incentives, which resulted in exceptionally strong EBITDA performance in Q4 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders was $21.1 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 18% as compared to adjusted EBITDA attributable to WELL's shareholders of $17.8 million in Q4 2021. Adjusted net income was $12.5 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 24% as compared to adjusted net income of $10.1 million in Q4 2021.\nI will now review the financial performance of our business segments. First, primary care, which includes our primary care clinics, Allied Health and executive health businesses in Canada. Primary care revenues were $70.5 million in 2022, an increase of 36% as compared to $51.7 million in 2021. Annual results were driven by healthy organic growth, clinic acquisitions and higher government payments for health services. Primary care revenues were a record $21.8 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 55% as compared to $14.1 million in Q4 of last year. The (inaudible) acquisition completed in the third quarter and 3 new clinics acquired from CloudMD in the fourth quarter positively contributed to strong Q4 results.\nIn addition, primary care revenues in Q4 2022 benefited from a stabilization payment from the BC's government. This onetime payment of approximately $1.5 million in the fourth quarter is meant as interim funding to help stabilize family practices until a new payment model was implemented in February 2023. Compared to Q3 2022, primary care revenue was positively impacted by seasonality, as the fourth quarter is a seasonally stronger quarter as compared to Q3 as there tends to be an increase in colds, flus and other elements contributing to higher patient volumes.\nSecondly MyHealth. MyHealth achieved record revenues of $104.2 million in 2022, an increase of 146% as compared to $42.5 million in 2021. MyHealth was acquired partners through 2021 and hence, the large revenue growth from 2021 to 2022. In Q4 2022, MyHealth achieved record quarterly revenue of $28.1 million, an increase of 21% as compared to $23.2 million in Q4 of last year. MyHealth benefited in Q4 2022 from management's hard work and continued efforts to alleviate staff shortages experienced in the first half of the year, leading to a higher billable time for many of its diagnostic procedures. MyHealth also benefited in the quarter from the addition of new cardiologists and key management specialists.\nAnd third, I will now talk about CRH performance. CRH revenues were $202 million in 2022, an increase of 52% as compared to $132.5 million in 2021. As CRH was acquired in April 2021, the increase in revenue is mostly attributable to a full year's contribution of CRH revenue and acquisitions. For Q4 2020, CRH revenues were $52.1 million, an increase of 11% as compared to $47.1 million in Q4 of last year. In addition, revenues also benefited from having a full quarter of contribution from the Grand Canyon Anesthesia acquisition, which is one of the largest acquisitions that CRH has completed since WELL acquired CRH. Compared to Q3 2022, CRH's Q4 2022 results benefited from seasonality as Q4 is CRH's strongest quarter. Case volumes were also very strong for CRH in Q4 with a record of 133,654 anesthesia cases completed in Q4, an increase of 11% compared to Q4 of last year.\nCRH sold 2,138 O'Regan boxes in the fourth quarter. And since each box has (inaudible) units, a total of 42,000 (inaudible) units were sold in the quarter.\nI would also like to provide an update on CRH billing service provider. CRH entered into a relationship with a new billing service provider, Change Healthcare in Q4 2021. Switching to a new provider has benefited the company with a reduction in payment processing fees, resulting in higher margins. However, CRH also experienced a number of onetime transition-related issues, which includes the predecessor billing service provider subsequently resolved and was not able to carry out normal accounts receivable collections, which resulted in bad debt losses related to 2021 revenue.\nAs a result of these events, CRH took this onetime loss and was also precluded from recognizing certain patient services revenue under IFRS 15, and as such, revenues would have been higher had this billing change not occurred. Altogether, (inaudible) has been excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA and these are nonrecurrent and not reflective of ongoing operations. Despite these transition issues and related impacts, we remain confident that the long-term savings from switching to a new billing provider will provider -- will more than compensate for the losses experienced over the past year, as we will ultimately be able to reduce our effective collection rate cost by more than 50%, reflecting over $5 million savings per year.\nIt is also important to note that our new billing service provider offers better data and business intelligence as far -- as well as far superior risk management characteristics, including much better data security. This was a joint undertaken by our CRH team, and I'm very pleased that we are on the other side of this transition as it substantially derisked both the company and position us for better operating performance and improved data quality.\nLastly, virtual services, which includes WELL's U.S.-based Circle Medical and Wisp as well as the company's technology-based solutions, including EMR, billing and revenue cycle management, OceanMD, digital apps and cybersecurity. Virtual services revenues were $192.4 million in 2022, an increase of 154% as compared to $75.6 million in 2021. Virtual services revenue growth was driven by the exceptional growth in the U.S.-based businesses of Circle Medical and Wisp. On a combined basis, these 2 businesses achieved almost $160 million on a revenue run rate basis at the end of 2022.\nVirtual services revenues were $54.5 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 74% as compared to $31.3 million in Q4 of last year.\nWELL ended 2022 and Q4 with a solid balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, WELL have cash and cash equivalents of $48.9 million. WELL continues to be in good standing and fully compliance with all covenants related to with its 2 credit lines, JPMorgan in the U.S. and Royal Bank in Canada. During the year 2022, we paid down about USD 31 million of the JPMorgan line in the U.S. to arrive at a balance of USD 131.7 million as of the end of the year. In Canada, we borrowed a total of $2.5 million in the year to arrive at the balance of $75.3 million. The total value of our credit line debt as of December 31 was approximately CAD 253.7 million.\nKeep in mind that USD strengthened from an average of $1.26 in Q4 2021 to $1.36 in Q4 2022. And as such, due to the higher exchange rate, our overall debt level would have been lower on a constant currency basis.\nIn terms of our share capitalization, as of March 20, 2022, WELL had 253,793,194 fully diluted securities issued and outstanding.\nThat is my financial update, and I turn the call back over to Hamed.\n\nHamed Shahbazi\n\nFounder, Chairman & CEO, WELL Health Technologies Corp.\n\nThank you, Eva. Now I'd like to speak a bit about our outlook for 2023. We're pleased to report that all of our business units are executing very well as we're expecting to have a strong performance in 2023 across all of our units and for the entire company as a whole. Despite the current geopolitical, inflationary and turbulent economic environment, the company does not see any material influences or challenges that would impair its ability to deliver solid results in 2023. Many of the key variables inherent in the execution of WELL's business are firmly in its own grass and not dependent on outside factors. The company is poised to achieve significant growth, while effectively managing its cost this year. Management is pleased to provide the following guidance for 2023.\nWe expect annual revenues between $665 million and $685 million, representing 17% to 20% annual growth as compared to 2022. Our revenue guidance is above current consensus estimates for 2023. We expect annual adjusted EBITDA to increase by more than 10% over 2022 levels. Our guidance does not include any unannounced acquisitions. As we indicated last quarter, with future acquisitions, we see a clear line of sight to $1 billion in revenues within 3 years as we continue our organic growth and highly accretive clinical tuck-in program.\nAs you may have seen from the guidance, we're expecting our revenue to increase at a higher rate than our adjusted EBITDA this year. There are a few reasons for that. Firstly, we're aggressively reinvesting in growth in our Circle Medical and Wisp businesses. While we expect these 2 businesses to have higher EBITDA contribution this year overall, they will still be immature compared to our other revenue streams and pull down the average a little bit. We are very comfortable with this approach as we're confident that both Circle Medical and Wisp continue to acquire market share and improve their operating EBITDA margins over time as they become more mature businesses. Secondly, we continue to experience the effects of inflationary cost pressures and wage increases. These cost increases are prevalent in all industries today. Although we've implemented cost-saving initiatives, we're still expecting additional cost increases this year as inflation remains at elevated levels.\nAnd lastly, in our CRH business, there are a few factors to be aware of. One, we don't have the benefit of some of the pandemic-related incentives provided by the U.S. government that Eva just spoke about during early 2022, which was equaled more than USD 2 million between Q1 and Q2 last year in 2022. We had some of those incentives in 2021 as well that Eva spoke about.\nTwo, the combined effect of the NSA were No Surprises Act, and our continued move to have our entire payment activity in network will remove some of the elevated billings associated with our out-of-network billings, which we are all anticipating when we bought the company. And three, our most recent large acquisition in the CRH business, Grand Canyon Anesthesia has a lower margin profile than our historic margins for CRH.\nNotwithstanding the above, we're still firmly within the Rule of 30 territory as per the company's previous guidance and direction.\nI'll now provide some commentary on the business units themselves, segmented first with the Canadian Patient Services Group, then U.S. patient services and then SaaS and technology. First, with the Canadian Patient Services business unit. In Canada, WELL owns and operates the largest network of clinics in the country, which includes over 130 clinics being operated in over 80 physical facilities, consisting of primary care, Allied Health, executive health and diagnostic clinics. As we described on our prior calls, WELL strongly believe in the benefits of an integrated health care offering and is bringing together a diverse multidisciplinary offering of its providers in the same setting. This benefits both patients and providers as many of these physical facilities have multiple clinics operating within the same location. For example, we could have a primary care and Allied Health clinic operating out of the same location, or a cardiology clinic and a diagnostic clinic operating out of one of our MyHealth Ontario facilities. That's how we can have more than one clinic in a facility.\nWith over 30 clinics across Canada -- 130 clinics across Canada, we own and operate the largest network. To our knowledge, we deliver more omnichannel patient visits than any other nongovernmental entity in Canada. Furthermore, we're 1 of the top 3 providers of telehealth services in the country. WELL's objective is to continue to grow its patient services business unit, both organically and inorganically and increase its market leadership as the country's first pan-Canadian clinical network with a highly integrated network of tech-enabled outpatient health care clinics. Growth in our Canadian patient services business in 2023 will be driven by continuing to focus on organic growth, which includes recruiting more physicians and absorbing or recruiting clinics themselves and executing on highly disciplined capital allocation opportunities to acquire capable new clinics and networks into the business. These would mostly be small acquisitions.\nI'd love to share with you what we're seeing and why we're so excited about our growth in primary care in Canada. Given recent times where there are challenges with inflation, shortages of health care workers and other issues, WELL has seen dramatically increased relevancy, which is translating into significant growth in interest from care providers that want to join tbis network. As I've mentioned before, in Canada, historically, in many cases, we force health care providers to provide care and run a business, except that now it's become a lot more difficult to run these businesses due to the increased complexity brought about by hybrid and complex workflows, IT, data security and other challenges, making it very difficult for physicians to run even small practices.\nFor this reason, we're seeing more physicians seek WELL out as a professional partner to help them run their business so they can focus on providing care. This is working, and providers are really generating benefits from it because they maintain similar per unit economics, but end up seeing a lot more patients which allows them to elevate care, improve earnings and better support the health care ecosystem.\nI'd like to now quickly comment on opportunities associated with expanding our MyHealth network in Ontario. On January 16, Premier Doug Ford and Health Minister Sylvia Jones announced the Ontario government's new multipronged strategy to reduce wait times by partnering with independent service providers for Ontarians, including areas associated with MRI, CT, colonoscopy endoscopy services. While Ontario-based MyHealth partners is the largest single license holder and service provider for specialty clinics providing diagnostics in the province of Ontario, and we believe is very well positioned to support Ontario government's mandate, particularly in the areas of diagnostic imaging. We intend to apply for these new MRI and CT licenses, which will be provided by the province of Ontario. We anticipate the new licenses will be awarded in the second half of 2023. Although we don't know -- we won't know for several months yet if MyHealth will be ultimately successful in its applications, we would likely incur additional capital cost to purchasing imaging equipment and for leasehold improvements.\nWe anticipate lead times of several months to have these services fully operational in clinics, and as such, we expect minimal revenue generation in 2023. Any such meaningful revenue impact would occur in '24 and beyond.\nI'll now provide some commentary on our U.S. patient services businesses, including CRH, Circle Medical and Wisp. WELL provides omnichannel health care services and solutions across the United States, targeting specialized markets such as the GI market, women's health, primary care and mental disorders. I'll start with CRH. CRH continues to be a nice cash cow for the company. And as a reminder, under the CRH brand, we are the leading provider of sedation services for colonoscopies in the U.S. in an ambulatory setting. In the U.S., WELL continues to expand its clinical presence with anesthesia services now being operated in 126 ambulatory surgery centers and GI clinics across 18 states. In 2022, CRH continued to benefit from post-COVID pent-up demand for endoscopic procedures, and our team's excellent execution in being able to support that elevated demand. We continue to see elevated interest in demand in CRH services and expect another record year of performance by CRH.\nGiven the nature of how health plans and their deductibles work, through the year for elective procedures such as colonoscopy, the fourth quarter is CRH's strongest seasonal quarter. We are expecting CRH revenues to decline in Q1 compared to Q4 and then increase again in each subsequent quarter in 2023, with Q4 2023 again, being the strongest revenue quarter this year. It should be noted that between Q1 and Q2 2022, CRH received more than USD 2 million in pandemic-related government assistance.\nThis grant health offset labor costs and improved EBITDA, which will not be repeated in 2023. In addition, CRH continues to execute on unlocking the value of its O'Regan hemorrhoid banding device intellectual property by creating a clinical offering called GI Rapid Relief that leverages this technology. As of March 21, we now have 11 banding clinics across the United States and Canada.\nI'd now like to discuss WELL's U.S. virtual patient services business, which includes Circle Medical and Wisp. Under the Circle Medical and Wisp brand, we are one of the fastest-growing specialty telehealth businesses focusing on areas such as behavioral health and women's health. Our Circle Medical and Wisp businesses are expected to continue to experience healthy revenue growth in 2023. However, we're purposely reinvesting any cash flows generated by these businesses back into growth, primarily on marketing costs to gain new patients and drive additional revenues. As you may be aware, ad rates are much lower in the first 3 months of the year as compared to the last 3 months of the year. As such, we're taking advantage of this and increasing our marketing spend earlier this year.\nWe will particularly see this effect with Wisp as we're targeting a slightly adjusted EBITDA negative performance in Q1, which will more than be made up in the balance of the year. Our current plan for Circle Medical is to continue to scale their telemedicine business but also now aggressively grow its physical clinic performance or network in 2023, which will improve its hybrid care capabilities and strengthen the company's ability to better support its patients, especially as we see the Biden administration sunset the public health emergency.\nAs of March 1, Circle Medical already had added 3 new clinic locations in Illinois, Florida and New York in addition to its existing operations in San Francisco. Circle Medical is now in the process of adding additional clinic locations in Washington, D.C. and 10 additional states, including Arizona, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Texas, Massachusetts, Virginia, Colorado, Tennessee and Maryland. We expect to have clinical coverage across all these states in the coming weeks.\nFinally, SaaS and technology. SaaS and technology includes our WELL EMR Group, billing, revenue cycle management, digital apps, OceanMD and cybersecurity. WELL is a unique company with both patient services and technology capabilities. We owe significant intellectual property, which drives our industry-leading solutions and has created compelling and relevant links within health care providers all over the country. We have created a best-in-class digital platform with significant IP that we call the practitioner enablement platform.\nThis platform aims to digitize, modernize and support providers and their clinics. With well over 23,000 medical providers in Canada that are leveraging the platform in some way. What is unique about WELL is that we are the biggest users of our own platform as the vast majority of our revenue is derived by our own patient services businesses. This is because we found that the best way to support providers is to help them run their businesses. When a provider joins WELL, we provide a fully managed solution. This means we look after all aspects of their business from front office, patient management to the management of all staff and back-office execution so they can focus on providing care.\nWe are industry leaders in technology and innovation in digital health care in Canada. Some of our examples of leadership include: one, we're one of the top 3 practice management service providers in Canada, including EMR, or electronic medical records software; two, we're one of the leading providers of digital patient engagement services, which includes all aspects of connecting patients and doctors digitally; three, we're one of the largest providers, in fact, the largest provider of revenue cycle management and outsourced billing services for doctors in Canada; five, (sic) [four,] we are the largest provider of e-referral software services in Canada. And we operate the Canada's only app marketplace for integrated EMR apps called apps.health.\nOur outlook looks promising for our SaaS and technology group. OceanMD, in particular, is emerging as a leader in patient engagement at e-referral solutions in the country. Already, the e-referral solution provided by Ocean is in place in the province of Ontario. We feel OceanMD has the potential to become the e-referral standard across the country. Ocean's platform is used at over 2,700 clinics in the country by over 25,000 clinicians with more than 1 million monthly patient users. It is emerging as one of the most important digital gateways for health care in Canada with connectivity to more than 30 integrated solutions in EMRs and provincial assets. To our knowledge, there's no other software or digital health system in Canada that is as deeply connected and embedded in the Canadian health care landscape as Ocean.\nWe have recently updated Ocean's web presence and invite you to spend some time learning about this amazing network. You can visit the site at oceanmd.com. I'm also pleased to report that as a company with deep tech experience and capabilities, we have made artificial intelligence a key priority within the company and are working on compelling new products and enhancements to roll out to our provider network. Our teams and partners are integrating different forms of AI technology, including generative AI solutions such as ChatGPT. We look forward to unveiling these solutions in the coming weeks and months ahead.\nIn summary, we're very pleased with our financial performance in 2022 and look forward to delivering the strongest results yet as a company. Our outlook for 2023 remains very positive. Hence, I can confidently provide annual guidance for revenues between $665 million and $685 million for this year, and a material improvement in our adjusted EBITDA to exceed at least $115 million.\nFinally, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on this call today and thank our shareholders and investors for their continued support. The capital markets have been very supportive of our vision and have provided us with the funding and patients needed to pursue our goals. I'd also like to thank WELL's senior management team, our employees and contractors, and in particular, our network and team of health care practitioners and other frontline workers who provide unbelievable patient care every single day. They remind us every day why we're here and we're here to support them. Thank you very much.\nAnd with that, we're very pleased to take some questions. Operator, could you please assist?"

My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatthew Grant McQueen\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to describe our capital allocation priorities, ProMedica Senior Care transaction and the rapidly evolving capital markets environment. I will also review some high-level business trends before handing the call over to John, who will provide details on operational trends and a brief update on our operating platform. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since we last spoke 90 days ago. Despite a flattish earnings trends on a sequential basis, driven by several (inaudible) headwinds, including FX, interest rate and utility expenses, our underlying business is actually improving meaningfully and setting up for the coil spring recovery that we hoped for.\nIn our senior housing operating business, same-store revenue is up 10.8% year-over-year, driven by strong occupancy gains and most importantly, pricing power. 5.3% same-store rate growth is the best we have seen in our recorded history. And I want to remind everyone that we're compounding already industry-leading rate growth from last year.\nFrom these early trains, I believe we will see a further improvement in Q4, which will create a strong setup for 2023. However, perhaps what I'm most excited about is the progress we are making on the labor front with compensation per occupied unit is up 4.3% year-over-year, the lowest level of growth we have reported since the beginning of pandemic.\nOur operating partners are experiencing a significant surge in applications which has translated into a strong increase in net hiring. In fact, in September, total portfolio monthly contract labor spend was the lowest since August of 2021 and subsequently improved in October. We believe this trend will continue into year-end outside the normal pickup of agency use during the holiday season and into -- well into the next year.\nWe strongly believe that labor market is changing for the better, and it will help our sector to be a total standout amongst all real estate sectors next year on a relative basis. Show portfolio same-store NOI growth was 17.6% in the quarter, led by U.S., which posted third quarter of 20-plus percent growth, an assisted living product type reported same-store NOI growth of an impressive 25.1%.\nLet me highlight 3 operating partners for you that provide further insight into why I'm so pleased with our progress over the last 90 days. Number one, Oakmont. As you'll recall, we transitioned 10 top California assets to Oakland in August, while we expected some initial disruption to occupancy NOI during the transition in actuality, we recognized an immediate benefits due to remarkable performance from Courtney's team.\nThese assets have experienced a slight increase of NOI and occupancy despite challenges that are normally incurred during a transition. This is the first time we have seen a transition with no negative P&L impact apart from the 6 assets we transitioned to Oakmont last year. I expect these properties as well as the other assets that we transitioned to Oakmont to add significantly to our 2023 growth.\nIf you are visiting San Francisco this month for an NAREIT conference, I recommend you to join our property tour and experience firsthand the remarkable job this team has done. To my earlier point on shift of labor market during the summer, open positions across Oakmont platform was 16% of total jobs. It is down to low single digit at this point. Number two, StoryPoint.\nStoryPoint is 1 of our best operating partners, perhaps will be the source of biggest NY swing next year. We have $1 billion of investment with low occupancy properties, which is generating approximately 2.7% yield in Q3. StoryPoint made remarkable improvement in our top line on both occupancy and rates, but the properties have not generated significant NOI in 2022 as these properties were just over the breakeven occupancy and the agency cost was very detrimental. Their open positions are now down more than 50% through the end of October, and we expect 80% reduction of agency by end of this month.\nWe believe that stabilized NOI for this group of portfolio is about circa $80 million, which will be substantially achieved in 2024. While we'll not close this gap in 2023, I expect we'll make significant strides next year and will be over the half year (inaudible). We cannot be more [flushed] with the execution than and team has pulled off. Number three, Sunrise. Sunrise is our largest operator due to a national presence. Sunrise experienced significant labor challenges and that has had to rely on contract labor for last many quarters.\nJack and his team has made remarkable progress in this area over the last 60 days. contract labor down 52% from year-to-date run rate, and I believe Sunrise will be the biggest contributor to contract labor improvement in the coming months and quarters. Given strong rate Sunrise benefit from in this incredibly well-located Welltower billings, we should see extremely strong NOI growth contribution from Sunrise. While we are encouraged -- very encouraged by the trends and our fourth quarter guidance of 21% growth at the midpoint, I'll remind you that we are at the very early inning of senior housing recovery. We'll remain as excited as ever about the growth prospects in coming years and the 80-plus population growth will continue to accelerate. And as new construction in the sector will come to near a standstill.\nIn fact, 2023 should see 4.5% increase in AD population, as you may have observed only 2,700 units got started in Q3. And frankly, I don't even understand how these people will make any money in development. While new development should continue to come down, assuming people want to develop to make any money, another interesting phenomenon we are observing is that the thousands of units are being taken offline either because of obsolescence or because of higher and better use like behavioral health.\nAs of 9/30, almost 15,000 units were taken offline on a TTM basis. I also want to highlight consistent and steady performance of our outpatient medical group under Ryan's leadership, our retention rate for the quarter is a remarkable 92.7% and rent rates are ticking up into the mid-3s. Both new and renewal leases -- for both new and renewal leases, I'm pleased that our weighted average escalators are now above 3%. I'm also pleased that the low interest rate environment and the wall of capital that drove due to low 2% escalator seems to be a thing of the past.\nKLCC Bolt, which is our largest MOB tenant and also represents into a very significant portion of our development pipeline was acquired by United Health during this summer. The significant credit upgrade of our largest tenant and our development client represents a meaningful value creation for our shareholders. The most significant change we observed in this -- however, in the MOB space is the remarkable widening of cap rates. I've said it like a broken record for a long time that MOB cap has made no sense to us, given where the forward view of inflation was relative to underlying growth rate of the cash flow. I'm pleased to see other capital sources are now waking up to the ugly realities of real return on capital in this inflationary environment.\nThere was nothing wrong with this asset class except price, and I am relieve to see that has finally changed. Billions of dollars of transactions were consummated at low cap rates often with short-term floating rate debt. The party is over a with capital structure and cash flow as many of these vehicles are now upside down. We'll be observing the space closely in the coming months and quarter.\nNow I would like to discuss our recent restructuring of our lease with ProMedica Health System. I'm not going to bore you with the details of our fundamental thesis of this investment in 2018. I laid it out clearly when we did this transaction. We didn't predict COVID and its impact on the cash flow portfolio and frankly, were underwhelmed by the execution.\nBut the fundamental investment thesis of the original transaction should still protect our shareholders' capital that basis an appropriate structure are critical to any real estate investment. While we have historically relied on our operators' ability to drive cash flow and that yield, we never make real estate investment decision based on yield. We believe success in real estate investment over a long period of time is a function of right basis and staying power. If we own an apartment in New York City for $400,000, while everybody owns equivalent apartment for $1 million, you can still charge rent for that unit and generate strong returns.\nThat is such a simple yet perhaps one of the most overlooked concept on Wall Street. The capital funding of noise on ProMedica's negative EBITDA coverage over the last few months have reached a fever pitch. And we honestly understand and empathize with this Pavlovian response as the history of health care REIT sector is full of remedies such as massive rent cuts or disposal of assets at fire sale prices that result in significant value destruction to shareholders.\nEven though I'm personally humbled by the cash flow deterioration in the ProMedica portfolio, let me repeat that we are not experiencing a rent cut on a cash basis and our investors are the beneficiary of a satisfactory total return to date. And that goes back to our incredibly favorable basis and structure.\nTo continue my metaphor -- previous metaphor, Manhattan apartment rent might come down from $5,000 to $4,000 in a bad year, but we never hypothetically even charge $4,000 as we bought our unit at such a low price. That is why our rent is now going up, not down after this transaction. And I continue to believe it remains below market and will be a source of future value creation.\nAs I mentioned in our last call, ProMedica has made significant strides in reducing its operating losses, which have further narrowed in the last 90 days through both occupancy gains and lower labor costs -- contract labor costs, particularly. Integra brand entity, which we have done multiple transactions previously has successfully executed many turnarounds, including those involving HCR assets that we sold it to them in the last couple of years, and is well positioned to return these assets to its previous glory, using a regional operative strategy, just like they have done over the last couple of years.\nWe are looking through Integra's brand entity and the owner for the downside protection through subordination of their equity as well as significant other guarantees and will subsequently share significant value creation with us. But I cannot overemphasize that the fundamental idea of below-market rent -- basis equals to below market rent is not about ProMedica. It is about our belief how we invest and protect our shareholders' capital. If a business has demand growth and you can own it for significantly less than what it cost to build and a low leveraged capital structure, it is challenging for me to see how we lose money in most scenarios.\nWe remain partnered with ProMedica, all be done as such on a much smaller scale, and we'll be delighted to see the significant credit improvement of this important institution in Toledo.\nFinally, let's discuss the current capital markets environment, which excites me to know end. Before I go into what we might do in the future, let's discuss what we have done in the past under this leadership team. If we go back and read all our comments about capital deployment in the last few years, you will notice a few attributes.\nOne, we're unlevered IRR buyers and we underwrite significant cap rate expansion at exit. Hence, the recent rate increase don't fluster us just as we have never chased low rates down under the guise of low cost of capital. Two, our unrelenting focus on basis relative to replacement cost, and as a result, we seriously dislike low cap rates in stabilized occupancy scenarios. Nothing has happened so far, even in this turbulent capital markets backdrop that require us to change how we invest capital. We are experiencing historic volatility in the treasury market with every part of the yield curve inverted right now, with significantly the most important due to [10] curve is as inverted as it was during [Paul Walker's] time 40 years ago.\nOne approach for us would be to ride out this storm in a shelter and do nothing. But those of you who know us well, no, we're unlikely to do so. We maintain a very favorable capital position and a [warchest] due to our extremely talented capital markets team under the leadership of Tim. Despite our unfavorable public cost of capital on a spot basis today, we have no doubts of global institutions who want to partner with us. And let me remind you again, a simple capital allocation framework I've described to you before.\nEvery company effectively has 4 choices of raising capital: one, tapping internal cash flow; two, issuing debt; three, issuing equity; and four, disposition of existing assets. It also has 5 essential choices of deploying that capital: one, investing in existing assets; two, acquisitions; three, buying debt at a discount; four, paying a dividend; and five, buying stock at a discount. You can loosely call the first set of choices at selling, but the right description would be sourcing or raising capital. You can loosely call the second set of choices as buying, but perhaps the correct description will be deployment of capital. Following the same line of thinking, loosely speaking, consistently buying low and selling high creates value for shareholders.\nIn a more wholesome and thoughtful description, optimizing these choices from this menu of sources and uses in a tax-efficient manner creates meaningful value for continuing shareholders on a per share basis. Our goal is to maximize per share value and per share cash flow, not to become the biggest or the most revolutionary. Our capital allocation team on both sides of the balance sheet is poised to pound on this great menu of opportunities, while the most volatile interest rate environment in 4 decades has put in front of us. And at the same time, John's team is just getting started on the journey of cash flow and platform optimization.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to John. John?\n\nJohn F. Burkart\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Shankh. I'll provide some insight into our operating business, starting with the medical office portfolio. In the third quarter, same-store NOI growth for our outpatient medical business was 1.4% over the prior year's quarter, which was below trend due to some timing issues on tenant improvements, delay in move-ins and higher utility expenses. We continue to see strong retention levels at 93% in the quarter and accelerating renewal rates in the marketplace.\nTurning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The recovery in this sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio came in at 10.8% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All 3 regions showed strong revenue growth, starting with Canada at 4.4%, the U.S. and U.K. growing at an impressive 11.6% and 18.9%, respectively.\nRevenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 390 basis point increase in occupancy and another quarter of healthy pricing power with REVPOR growth of 5.3%, as Shankh mentioned, the highest we've witnessed.\nSequentially, the portfolio occupancy continued to improve with the gain of 110 basis points during the quarter. While expenses remain a challenge, our operators continue to control expense for or expense per occupied room. The comp for or compensation per occupied room only grew at 4.3% in the third quarter over the prior year's quarter, the lowest growth rate since 2019. Expense for grew at a rate of 3.7% in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, well below our REVPOR growth of 5.3% and driving expansion of 130 basis points on a year-over-year basis in our margins.\nAs our operators have pivoted from the COVID state to normalized operations, and as labor and materials have become more available, we have aggressively addressed maintenance that was delayed during COVID, which resulted in slightly elevated repairs and maintenance during the maintenance expense during the quarter.\nOverall, the quarter's occupancy gains, strong REVPOR and expense controls enabled the senior housing operating portfolio to deliver 17.6% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period led by the U.S. with over 20% year-over-year growth, while Canada NOI grew at 6.3% and the U.K. was up 9.8%. Going forward, we expect the operating portfolio to continue to deliver outside NOI growth with each geography expected to experience accelerating NOI growth in the fourth quarter.\nAs we look forward to what many believe will be a weaker labor market in 2023, it's important to realize that labor as an expense represents about 60% of our total expenses. Additionally, nurses are only about 5% of the labor force at the communities. And although there are other more specialized positions at the communities, most of the positions require skills that are transferable from other sectors of the economy, allowing us to benefit from the softer labor market, as Shankh noted.\nRegarding our operating platform, we continue to quickly move forward on plans to pilot our first module in early 2023 with several other modules in the works. Like all technology rollouts, it's about people, processes, data and then technology. So it's not about flipping a switch. It takes team works. The results will show up over time. Our meetings with our operators have been very productive as we bring together their skills and experience with our own to build a better future for the industry.\nFinally, I would like to thank our operators and their employees for making these results possible. It's been a full sprint since the beginning of COVID, and they have addressed 1 challenge after the next. We are finally at a point where it seems like there's light at the end of the tunnel, occupancy continues to rise. Net hiring is occurring month after month REVPOR continues to outpace expense for, which will drive further margin expansion and so much more. We wish to thank everyone and wish them a wonderful Thanksgiving, and thank you for your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy G. McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter are capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update and finally, our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported third quarter normalized bunds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share, representing 6.2% growth over the prior year period when adjusting for HHS funds received and changes in FX rates. And marking our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. We also reported our second consecutive quarter of positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth with 7.2% year-over-year growth.\nTurning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30, 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 1.6% year-over-year, below the low end of our guidance range, which is primarily timing related. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.83x in the quarter. Next, same-store NOI in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage 1.31x.\nAnd lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our joint venture with ProMedica Health System. As same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages were negative 0.01 and negative 0.6, respectively, as operations continue to be impacted by high agency utilization costs in the second quarter relative to the prior year.\nPutting these coverage figures in context of our announcement last night, trailing 12-month ProMedica Senior Care EBITDARM coverage of negative 0.01 implies trailing 12-month EBITDARM of negative $1.6 million. relative to $168 million of cash rent paid in the trailing 12-month period ending 6/30, 2022. The transition of the skilled nursing business will bring the remaining ProMedica Senior Care EBITDARM back to profitability with the trailing 12-month coverage of nearly 2x relative to the remaining rent on the 58 assisted living facilities that will continue to operate.\nThus, the transition to Integra Health has a dual benefit to providing us a well-capitalized and strategic partner to focus on the skilled nursing properties, while also leaving ProMedica Senior Care a substantially better financial state following the transaction.\nTurning to capital market activity. In the quarter, we continued to enhance our balance sheet strength by utilizing our ATM program to raise approximately $760 million of forward equity at an average price of $80.12. We settled 9.1 million shares for total proceeds of $842 million to fund $1 billion of net investment activity, leaving $1.5 billion of unsettled forward ATM as of 9/30.\nPost quarter end, we settled additional ATM proceeds to fund investment activity and pay down $850 million of total debt, $817 million of which was floating rate. Post that paydown, we have the full $4.0 billion available borrowing capacity on our line of credit and no unsecured maturities until 2024.\nWe expect to finish the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt to EBITDA below 6.5x for the first time since 2020. From a liquidity perspective, in addition to the $4 billion we passed in line of credit, we have $1 billion of cash and forward equity and $580 million remaining near-term dispositions and loan paydown proceeds at a 4.6 yield, representing $5.6 billion of total near-term liquidity.\nLastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.08 to $0.13 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $0.80 to $0.85 per diluted share or $0.825 at the midpoint. As mentioned in the release, our fourth quarter guidance contemplates no HHS funds to be received in the fourth quarter.\nSo after adjusting for $0.015 of nonrecurring items, including HHS funds received in the third quarter were effectively flat for sequential FFO. The sequential change is composed of $0.02 from sequential increases in senior housing operating portfolio and $0.01 from sequential increases in outpatient medical and senior housing triple net. These are offset by $0.03 of interest expense and foreign exchange headwinds.\nUnderlying this FFO guidance is estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8.5% to 10.5%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1.5% to 2.5%, long-term post-Q 2.5% to 3.5%, senior housing triple net 5% to 6%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 18.5% to 23.5%, driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5% year-over-year. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 200 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 7%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim. One of my mentors, Peter Kaufman often says, life is not about predicting it's about positioning. Did we predict that ProMedica's EBITDA coverage will turn negative? Absolutely not. But we positioned for it and structured as such. Did we know it will happen and availability of credit in senior housing sector will weaken? No, but we positioned for it. We own more than 11,000 units of age-restricted and age-targeted apartments that will benefit from government agency backstop financing at very attractive pricing, from which we can generate a couple of millions of dollars of proceeds.\nDid we predict that our stock will be in the low 60s and we'll lose our access to equity capital? No, we didn't. But we positioned for it and raised $3.28 billion of capital at an average price of $86.55 this year. We have no idea if rates are going back down or going back up, and how ugly the capital markets environment might turn before it gets better. We are laser focused on what we can control and have an incredible organization that is railing to take advantage of the opportunities with house odds as opposed to gamblers odds. I cannot be more excited about the period of unprecedented per share value creation that we are embarking on for our existing owners. And with that, I'll open the call up for questions."

My name is Chantal, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin.\n\nMatthew Grant McQueen\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review high-level business trends and describe our capital allocation priorities before handing the call over to John, who will detail the operational trends and provide more details on the operating platform that he is building.\nOur total revenue is up 29% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth and contribution from significant capital deployment activity over the last 18 months. On a same-store basis, our senior housing operating portfolio revenue is up 11.5% year-over-year, driven by a 5% occupancy growth and a 4.5% REVPOR growth. All this translated into a 15.4% same-store NOI growth in Q2. Our annual EBITDA is back above $2 billion. Annualized in-place SHOP NOI is at $895 million. Though shy of $923 million of pre-pandemic numbers, our revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels.\nHowever, I'm not happy with these results, which I would characterize mediocre at best. Why? Because the size of our portfolio is much bigger today, given the significant amount of capital deployment over the last 18 months and yet our quarterly results are not reflecting the cash flow that this portfolio is capable of generating. I'll give you a few things to reflect on.\nFirst, we have about 120 senior living -- senior housing properties that are generating negative cash flow today. In other words, if we just shut down these buildings, our earnings would be significantly higher. Clearly, we would not do such a thing as they were recently developed or going through a value and repositioning program. Hence, the timing mismatch. Second, while I don't like to fix it on short-term trends and instead focus on long-term prospects of the business, I'll offer a few observations on the second quarter.\nWe started the quarter with results coming in better than expected, only to get hilt simultaneously by multiple challenges primarily related to another COVID spike during the last couple of weeks of June. Only this time, we didn't see it coming as the testing requirements have been lowered in recent months, particularly for those residents who are not experiencing symptoms.\nIn instances, while few residents or team members develop symptoms in an entire building, would be tested only to find out many asymptomatic residents and staff actually were COVID-positive. This created some disruption to move-ins, but particularly impactful to the use of agency labor in June.\nOur operators are walking through as we speak and made very good progress in July. Let me dig into some recent trends even a bit more. From a demand standpoint, we always see first half of July as 2 last weeks, similar to the last weeks of December as families celebrate 4th of July weekend and don't usually move parents and grandparents in. This July, we lost an additional week. And as a result, almost a whole month was shut from a move-in perspective before we gain significant traction later in the month with tour activities returning to the levels experienced in June.\nWe and our operators have a few theories of why that might be the case. One, the hyper positivity rate of COVID over 20%. Despite people on a reporting to government, families know from home testing they're COVID positive and are delaying move-ins as they wait for this wave to subside. And number two, travel. Summer travel has surged as families took advantage of looser COVID restrictions. Again, I would describe this as our conjecture because we don't know for sure. But we are clearly seeing broad-based demand recovery continues, particularly towards the second half of the month in terms of leads and tours, which led to a recent rebound in move-ins across the portfolio over the last couple of weeks.\nOn the cost side, it is important that you understand the progress we made on the agency labor. In the U.S., most of our operators are decreased from June to July, resulting largely from a favorable net hiring trends. The July books have not closed yet, we're expecting a decline in agency labor expense in high-single digit from month of June.\nIn terms of net hiring, our operators have continued to make significant momentum with July increase alone in headcount nearly equal to the net hires of past 6 months of the year combined. As a result, we're already starting to see benefit of this trend, which should reduce the dependence on agency labor in the second half of the year.\nThe downside of high-frequency data is that you get a lot of noise. And I strongly believe that's what you're seeing in the numbers today, a lot of noise. I encourage my team and will encourage you not to confuse any short-term high-frequency noise whether good or bad as a signal and project that into the future prospect of the business.\nFor a few quarters, I've been talking about the run rate earnings or the true earnings part of this portfolio being significantly different from our current reported earnings. Clearly, some of the anticipated second half growth has slipped into the next year, but this should only be a timing mismatch. As we focus on '23 and '24, I continue to believe that this earnings part will shine through.\nBefore I move on to the capital allocation priorities, let me make a comment on ProMedica. When we bought HCR ManorCare portfolio out of bankruptcy, we did not outsource our underwriting to rating agencies. Clearly, there was no way for us to predict a global pandemic or a day when almost every hospital system in the country would lose money similar to what happened in Q1 of this year because of COVID.\nWe got comfortable because our basis of $57,000 per skilled nursing bed, we saw very minimal risk of pharma and capital loss, which is at the core of how we think about risk. Of all the structuring belts and whistles aside, which we're very proud of, we fundamentally believe investment basis not cash flow in a given building at a given point in time determines investment success. Having said that, the ProMedica team has been able to make reduced agency labor almost by half over the last 4 months and significantly narrowed their operating losses.\nWe have below-market basis and thus, below market rent here. I remain very comfortable with our rent and longer-term expected IRR from this investment that we discussed with you when we did this deal 4 years ago. Turning to the capital deployment. I cannot overstate how favorable of an environment we find ourselves in today. During the second quarter, our off-market, privately negotiated transaction machine kept humming, having deployed an additional $1.1 billion of capital. Today, there is definite stress in the lending environment given the significant rate and credit volatility and increasing recession talk.\nCap rates are going up across the board and most institutional capital is waiting to see where the chips fall. We're seeing many high-quality opportunities, and we think the environment will only get more favorable as Fed continues to raise rate at a rapid clip. Our pipeline remains robust, having replenished after all of our Q2 and Q3 closings. Our fundamental investment thesis remains intact.\nOne, we need to buy at a favorable basis relative to replacement cost; and two, we need to be able to add value through our platform. We're not spread-investing deal junkies and instead remains laser focused on total return or unlevered IRR. I continue to believe this year will be a record year for Welltower from a capital deployment standpoint. Cost of capital has surged for everybody, including governments and access to capital remains very sparse for most people. In this environment, we remain in a very favorable capital position with $2-plus billion of equity capital that is raised but not settled and almost full availability of our $4 billion line.\nSellers who did not like our price 6 months ago are realizing that glossy broker package and nonbinding LOI are not cash in a bank. This environment reinforces the value of a counterparty like Welltower, which always acts on a very simple principle. We say what we do and we do what we say. And in that vein, as our long-term investors have come to expect from us, we exercise utmost discipline on every transaction we look at, large or small and will not chase any deal.\nAs we have said in the recent past, price is the price, and we only act in a manner that creates long-term value for -- part share for our owners. With respect to capital deployment over the last 18 months, some of you have asked me if I'm satisfied with the performance of these properties. In many cases -- in the case of many of these acquisitions, including some larger ones, the answer is no. The same-store challenge that I have described above are accentuated in many non-same-store properties, which are being repositioned through operator changes.\nHowever, I do believe that we have turned the corner as we approach the completion of our operator transition and system integration for the COVID class of acquisitions. We should see significant progress from these properties as we enter next year. Please recall, we make investment decisions based on long-term IRR with an exit cap rate going up every single year from the duration of the ownership. And we feel strongly about achieving those return targets as we have discussed with you.\nAs frustrating as near-term challenges of operator transition might be for reported earnings and trust me, I share those frustrations with you, we have to do what's right for long-term interest of our owners. I will give you 2 examples. Vintage and Gracewell, 2 of the most ill-fated HCN acquisition from many months ago. Despite some of the most coveted locations and CapEx plans, these assets did not live up to our expectations. We finally pulled the plug over last 12 months, frankly, because we're not permitted to do so earlier.\nOur Gracewell assets were transferred to Care UK and the Vintage assets were mostly transferred to Oakmont with one each to Kisco and Cogir. Oakmont has already made incredible progress with the first tranche of the asset they received last fall, with occupancy up 13%, and I believe you will see this repeated in the most recent tranche as well. Care UK is having similar success with Gracewell assets taking occupancy above 80%. And I believe they will be stabilized or get close to it in 2023.\nWe made similar decisions for our other properties, which come with some short-term gain. But as we capital allocators strive every day to create per share value by compounding over a long period of time. While we hope near-term priorities do not conflict with those long term, practically speaking, we often encounter situations where those time horizons diverge. And it is critical for our investors to understand that at these crossroads, we'll always follow the path to long-term value creation at the expense of short-term gains.\nThe good news is that all of these, as my partner, John Burkart, would say, is baked in the cake. With that, I'll hand the call over to John, who will describe to you perhaps the most exciting set of initiatives that will transform the business as we know today and creates tremendous value for our residents, team members, operating partners and most importantly, our shareholders. John?\n\nJohn F. Burkart\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business and provide additional color regarding our vision for senior housing as well as an update on our platform initiatives. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the second quarter, our outpatient medical business sequentially increased occupancy by 30 basis points and delivered 2.5% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter. We continue to see strong retention rates over 89% in the quarter, good demand and rising new lease rates.\nNow turning to our senior housing operating platform portfolio. The recovery in the sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio accelerated to 11.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All 3 regions showed good revenue growth led by the U.S. and U.K. with growth of 13.1%, 14.7%, respectively. The revenue for the quarter was driven by a 500 basis point increase in occupancy and another quarter of healthy rate growth.\nSequentially, the portfolio increased occupancy 100 basis points during a period in which sequentially average occupancy has historically been slightly negative. While expenses grew at a rate of 10.5%, our operators continue to control export or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3.5% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. And as Shankh indicated, we're encouraged by recent trends in terms of agency hiring and new hiring, which we believe should drive a deceleration in the second half expense growth.\nDespite short-term challenges driven by COVID, the tight labor market and inflationary pressures, the portfolio delivered 15.4% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period, the second highest in the company's history with the U.S. portfolio generating over 20% same-store NOI growth. Going forward, we expect the portfolio to deliver outside NOI growth over a multiyear period with strengthening supply-demand backdrop compounded by our efforts to optimize the business, which I'll get to shortly.\nRegarding the overall market, the traffic this summer has been influenced by COVID in various ways. For example, the traffic was very good in June and then fell significantly as expected for the 4th of July weekend and continue to remain low until it accelerated in the last couple of weeks of July. We had total July traffic was about equal to total June traffic. We expect to increase traffic in the later part of July to lead to increased move-ins in August. The average occupancy for the portfolio in July was up over 40 basis points in the same-store portfolio.\nI also want to quickly comment on recent management transitions within the SHO portfolio. As we make adjustments to our operators' portfolios and the related assets are in transition, we appropriately remove them from the same-store portfolio as they tend to underperform early in the transition and subsequently outperformed later in the transition which can create noise in the same-store portfolio performance. This is very similar to removing an asset for full renovation.\nTransitions take substantial amounts of time from the point of notice to the actual transition of management which negatively impacts staffing, sales leads and other operational aspects of the asset. The challenges the new operator faces upon takeover are significant. However, over time, they get resolved. And of course, the assets performance improves over the pre-transition baseline, which is the purpose of the transition to begin with. The fact that we have 59 assets in transition is meaningful and that management is willing to take short-term earnings pain for improved performance in the future.\nIf we had not removed transition assets from the same-store portfolio, our year-over-year NOI growth for the quarter would have been 14.9%. Bottom line, strategic transitions are undoubtedly worth it, and they can drive significant value despite creating near-term noise for the same-store portfolio. Shifting to an update on the operating platform. Previously, I mentioned the opportunity to fundamentally change the growth potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to our senior housing portfolio.\nIn terms of industry life cycle, I would place the senior housing business in the infancy phase, but rapidly transitioning into the growth phase. This is very similar to the multifamily business years ago, whose transformation I witnessed firsthand. Businesses that are in infancy phase of the industry life cycle focus on effectiveness, which is essential. Without it, the business would not be able to exist long term.\nAs an industry transitions from the infancy phase to the growth phase continuing to remain effective as the core objective is essential. However, the winners focus on operational excellence, including efficiency. The analogy that I've used is the diner business of the 1950s. To survive and thrive, you had to serve a good meal, a good burger, fries and shake in the case of the McDonald Brothers. However, to grow as the industry moved from its infancy to growth phase, a focus on operational excellence was imperative, including an obsessive focus on efficiency, which is what Ray Kroc did when he franchised McDonald's.\nThe senior housing operators faced many small business challenges, including the inability to recruit and retain top talent and key functions from technology and data analytics to process and facilities management due to their size and inability to compete from a compensation perspective. Additionally, the fee-based structure limits the economic incentive to fully invest in optimizing the business as an owner operator would.\nFor example, if a fee manager has paid 5% of revenues, the most they would logically spend to collect $1 of revenue is $0.05, whereas owner operators would theoretically invest $0.99 to collect $1. As you all know, we have worked to change this unfavorable incentive structure through our aligned RIDEA 3.0 contracts. And we are now working on our next generation of contracts that will provide Welltower with a greater ability to help address senior housing operators small business challenges. These challenges are across the board, including basic functions to illustrate in a relatively simple areas such as billing.\nIn the 2 reviews we performed, we identified that Care revenue was underbilled by 25% or more, meaning that the necessary quality of care was provided to the resident. However, they were under billed. Other challenges are much greater, including keeping up with modern consumer expectations such as building-wide, high-speed internet connectivity, identifying and integrating quality technology systems and creating and delivering real time, insightful and actionable reporting to improve operational results.\nFocusing on operational excellence is more than a digital transformation. It's about people, processes, data and technology, recognizing that everything starts with people. Our residents living at our communities, the employees serving those residents and the operators leading the effort. We start by focusing on the customer experience and the employee experience and optimizing the various processes. Then we evaluate the data that may -- that we may leverage to draw meaningful insight into the business in a way that improves the experience of the various stakeholders.\nFinally, we implement cutting-edge technology to simplify and automate the processes as we will provide real-time actionable, insightful information, improving the customer and employee experience while optimizing results. This isn't simply about buying the latest software. It's about fundamentally transforming the business. Over the years, many businesses have transformed from buying books to used cars to buying homes and finding vacation rentals.\nDigital transformations have fundamentally changed these businesses and improved the overall experience. One of the key imperatives of operational excellence is the recognition that data is the asset. There is no entity in this space better positioned to leverage data than Welltower as we are effectively building the operating platform to improve the overall experience on what we call Alpha, our data analytics platform that has been developed over the last 6 years.\nWelltower will improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading transformation of the business. I have gone from full immersion and observation to planning and now action mode. I will not give away all the details of my future playbook, but I will say the following. We are moving very fast. Several recent highlights include forming an internal multidisciplinary team of experts focused on improving the senior housing operations in Q2, hiring a Chief Technology Officer in Q2 to lead the technology aspect of the operating platform, completing the implementation of Welltower's ERP last week, which is central to this effort.\nAnd frankly, I want to thank the Welltower team that executed this massive project with great speed and excellent execution. Initiating a data analytics pilot on the correct information that we have available with an expected rollout over the next 6 months, this step alone will enable us to start driving value. Finally, creating the sales force automation plan with expectations to launch a pilot in early 2023. We have numerous other modules in the works and we'll update as appropriate.\nAlthough this is a huge effort, Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute it faster than historically possible. Our strategy is to leverage existing quality modules and only create new modules where they don't exist or where they give us a strategic advantage, such as our revenue management module, which we're developing. Another unique benefit that Welltower has relates to the number of top quality operators in our portfolio. We are separating the pilots of the modules into parallel initiatives, each with a different operator, which will minimize the potential delays that can be caused by a lack of employee bandwidth or overall fatigue and have slowed down other transformations. Ultimately, as we perfect each module, we will then rapidly roll it out to the broader group. This business transformation will continue to deepen and widen the moat Welltower has built while improving the overall experience of all stakeholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy G. McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, John. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple net investment by each quarter, our capital activity, balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the third quarter. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.86 per diluted share, which included $17 million of private relief funds from the Department of Health and Human Services, approximately $11 million or $0.02 per share more than what was assumed in our initial guide for the quarter.\nThis quarter representing our second consecutive quarter with a year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic, a positive 8.9% or 7.7% when normalized on HHS funds received and year-over-year changes in FX rates. We also reported our second consecutive quarter of positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 8.7% year-over-year growth.\nTurning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 9.9% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections and leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI.\nTrailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage increased 0.01x to 0.83x in the quarter. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio grew same-store NOI by positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage is 1.31x.\nAnd lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health system, which had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was negative 0.29x as operation continued to be impacted by high agency utilization in the first quarter.\nTurning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company and capitalize on our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transaction. At the start of the second quarter, we sold 18 million shares via forward sale agreement at initial weighted average price of approximately $87.67 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion.\nWe currently have approximately 22.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $2.0 billion. Taken together, our unsettled equity proceeds includes some committed OP units on pipeline deals and $257 million of expected property dispositions and loan payoff proceeds, totaled $2.3 billion in equity capital, providing ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline.\nDuring the quarter, we closed on an amended $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, along with an upsized term facility comprised of a USD 1 billion term loan and a CAD 250 million term loan. At quarter end, when factoring cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previous mentioned $2.3 billion of unsettled equity proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position.\nLastly, moving to our third quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributable to the common stockholders per diluted share of $0.12 to $0.17. And normalized FFO per share of $0.82 to $0.87 or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance includes $7 million with HHS funds expected to be received in the third quarter.\nExcluding HHS funds, guidance represented a $0.005 increase at the midpoint from 2Q normalized FFO. The $0.005 increase composed of $0.025 from incremental SHO NOI growth and SHO investment activity and $0.01 from performance across the rest of our investment segments and from lower sequential G&A costs. This is offset by $0.03 of higher floating rate interest costs and unfavorable FX rates.\nUnderlying with FFO guidance is estimated third quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 7% to 9%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1.75% to 2.75%, long-term post acute of 2.5% to 3.5%, health systems of 2.75%, senior housing triple net of 5% to 6%, and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by year-over-year revenue growth of 10%.\nUnderlying this revenue growth is an expectation for approximately 400 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy growth and continued robust rate growth. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth. As I remarked last quarter, as we realize the recovery in our core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distress under-operated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects. While this capital allocation is the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, it was substantially amplified in years to come.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim. If I may distract you all from the short-term noise and focus on the main drivers of long-term earnings and cash flow per share growth, there are really 4 large buckets that we must pay attention to: occupancy, rates, labor cost and external growth.\nIn 2021, whenever we're hit by a massive COVID wave, it felt as though we are taking one step forward and two steps back in terms of occupancy, rates and labor costs. Thankfully, the health impact of COVID has been getting more mild and the psyche of the population has significantly improved. Now we are taking 2 steps forward and one step back in terms of occupancy and labor cost and it appears from the July trends that we're making that one extra step back forward very quickly. So COVID impacts are getting less pronounced and rebounds are getting quicker as we learn how to live with COVID.\nDespite the reported issues of agency labor, the team member count in our communities has grown significantly offlet and we have not seen any let up -- though we have not seen any let up of the cost of labor, there is no question that we have seen the availability of labor increase meaningfully offlet. The portfolio has almost the same net hiring in July as we had in the first 6 months of the year combined.\nThough our operators have had success in net hiring members over the last few months, as you can see from the case studies on Slide 7 and 8, it appears that the labor market is finally on demand from the significant success of hiring trends in July. Assuming these trends continue, this bodes very well for agency labor cost as we get a second half of the year. And where we continue to make the largest strides is through pricing power. The recent COVID spikes have not in any way dulled our operators' ability to push through strong rates. What is particularly encouraging is the street rates, which are up from high-single digits all the way up to 15%, 20% in case of some large operators.\nGiven the sharp acceleration in growth of the senior population and plummeting new supply of few projects penciling for developers today, our confidence in driving occupancy and rate growth for the next few years continue to strengthen. As for external growth opportunities, our prospects, which have been very good are only getting better, the willingness of owners to transact has grown over the last 2 years as they struggled with COVID-related challenges and debt maturity.\nAnd now with recent surge in borrowing costs and tighter lending standards that are keeping many bars at bay. If we overlay all this with how John is fundamentally transforming our business, I have not been more excited of the future prospect of our firm. We know we need to translate all of this into significant higher earnings run rate and cash flow per share and our team, which thinks and acts like long-term owners is hyper focused on that mission. With that, we'll open the call up for questions."

Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce General Counsel, Matt McQueen.\n\nMatthew Grant McQueen\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.\nAlthough Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that best projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll describe our capital allocation priorities in the rapidly evolving investment environment and review high-level business trends before handing the call over to John, who will detail operational trends. .\nA little over 1 year ago, our seniors housing operating business witnessed a powerful inflection point with occupancy gains and pricing power sustained through the remainder of the year despite Delta and Omicron variants.\nThis momentum continued into first quarter of this year and translated into the first period of year-over-year bottom line growth for our company since the beginning of pandemic. Our total portfolio revenue is up 32.7% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth as well as a significant volume of high conviction capital deployment during the last 18 months.\nOn a same-store basis, our Senior Housing Operating portfolio revenue is up 11.2% year-over-year. driven by a 4.6% occupancy growth and 4.6% rate growth. Encouragingly, we saw sequential pricing growth was 4.3%, the fastest growth recorded in our history despite only half of our operators pushing through in-house rent increases on Jan 1 schedule.\nAll of these translated into 18.4% same-store NOI growth in Q1, an impressive number that surpassed our expectations. We're all very encouraged by the speed at which pre-trades are moving up. And we expect same-store NOI growth will accelerate into the second half of the year, barring another COVID spike.\nAll of this setting up to be a powerful earnings recovery that we anticipate in 2023 and beyond. Before I turn into investment environment, I want to make 2 things here that are very important for multiyear earnings growth path. Number one, in 2018, when we converted our Brandywine Senior Living lease to RIDEA, I mentioned there are 2 other portfolio we had in triple-net structure that we hope to convert.\nOne of them was Legend Senior Living. After many years of discussion with Tim Buchanan, Legend's legendary founder and CEO, I'm pleased to report that we have converted this relationship into RIDEA. Recall that we had an 88% and 20% propco JV between Welltower and Legend.\nAt conversion, Tim contributed a portion of his propco, 5 brand-new assets and has agreed to a future development agreement to create a powerful 93%, 7% equity partnership going forward. Finally, after years of persuasion, we have convinced him that we can grow the pie using our data analytics platform so significantly that he will still be better off despite owning a smaller portion of the pie.\nA partner of our company since '90s, Legend has paid every single dollar of rent that was owed to Welltower regardless of their coverage on a given day. Though these deals is dilutive to our FFO in 2022 due to significant agency leverages today, we expect cash flow relative to the previous rent will breakeven in beginning of 2023, and our shareholders will enjoy upside from there on.\nWe hope for extraordinary partnership over last week -- had extraordinary partnership over the last 3 decades, and we hope that it will continue for many more to come. This transition, along with acquisition and future development partnership exemplifies our sole focus on enhancing long-term value of the portfolio and is indicative of the potential earnings upside in the portfolio that can be captured through a simple cap rate or multiple valuation methodology.\nNumber two, historically, our SHO business focused on managing managers and assets. Now that we have significantly upgraded our operational capabilities, including through the hiring of John Burkart, our COO, our focus in the SHO business will mirror the real estate and management services that we provide in our medical office business or what an apartment rig does with an understanding that we're limited in providing care services in a health -- qualified health care property.\nThis fundamental shift in our approach has a profound impact on how we think about our role in the operating stack. This is particularly important as we think through the most important part of that operating platform, which is the technology stack. John will get into the details as part of his script, but we are delighted that he is in full scale development and implementation of a true operating platform at Welltower.\nJohn is working closely with some of our best operating partners to launch this, call it RIDEA 4.0 for now, but honestly, that doesn't do our new approach justice, as to the scale and impact, we think his plans will have on the customer experience and value creation overall. Needless to say, we expect this multiyear initiative will have a tremendous impact on our earnings growth trajectory and long-term compounding machine that we are setting up at Welltower.\nNow let's talk about capital allocation. As you know, my team is extraordinarily focused on allocating capital to create part share value for existing shareholders. The keyword is existing. We'll favor our existing shareholders who have been our partners through thick and thin, especially through thin. We are fiercely protective of their interest on a per share basis, and won't act in a manner that does not create significant value for them.\nBecause we're extremely transparent and genuinely dislike drama, I will mention to you that Welltower is the party F referenced in the HTA HR merger proxy a couple of weeks ago. Every week, we call owners of assets and express our interest to buy them at a price. This was no different.\nI am genuinely disappointed that HR Board and management did not engage with us, but that is their prerogative. It is completely up to their shareholders and the Board, which presents those shareholders to decide how to maximize value. Because of the many rumors circulating and the reports and articles about this, I'll mention a few things before moving on to much more important items.\nNumber one, we're fair win-win people, we offer to buy the company on public information at $31.75 per share, plus a breakup fee of $163 million from a merger which as you have seen, the market reported at significantly value destructive per analyst reports.\nWe believe that our cash offer provided better value to HR shareholders than the HTA merger, and it was fully financed and were prepared to move within days. I read research notes that described our unfair pricing relative to what might be quoted in market cap rate.\nPlease understand that we did not offer to buy an asset, we offer to buy a company that we are willing to pay for assets and pay a breakup fee that bails out company out for company's existing shareholders for potential dilution that well respected analyst community has been writing about.\nI hope this will stop mischaracterization of our offer and our intent. Number two, Welltower always has and always will honor its agreement with third parties, including that with HTA. In fact, HTA itself piloted our NDA with them by providing -- by first disclosing it to HR and then later to the public in the joint proxy.\nFurther our NDA with them does not contain a standstill that will apply us to making an offer for HR as a stand-alone entity. As you would expect, we signed it with HTA in order to access information regarding HTA and its properties, therefore, the Standstill only applies to HTA and its properties.\nOur proposal was expressly conditioned on HR not completing their HTA transaction. Number three, we have never chased the deal and never will. We buy everything at a price and sell everything at a price. Although I'm disappointed that HR did not engage with us, as our offer -- we thought our offer would result into a superior outcome for HR shareholders, I have no intention of being hostile.\nI personally like Todd, I called him and expressed our interest. We didn't buy shares in the public market, nor did we act in anything but a friendly way. They did not engage. Under these circumstances, we have nothing to do here.\nNumber four, contrary to what some analysts might have written, this deal would not have been dilutive to our senior housing growth. You don't know what proportion of equity, debt or joint ventures we might have contemplated for the transaction. But even if you think we were to do this entirely on the balance sheet, it would be a rather simple exercise.\nLook at the NOI bridge in our business update, divide that NOI by existing number of shares, calculate the additional shares required by the HR transaction to calculate dilution on a part share basis and then add back the accretion from the deal. You will see our existing shareholders would have covered ahead.\nWe look at every single investment through the lens of opportunity costs. Specifically, we have to satisfactorily answer three questions that Buffett has taught us. And then what, compared to what, at the expense of what. This is no different. And number five, we're not disappointed nor we are concerned about our growth of our senior housing business. While the contrary, in fact, we just reported 18.4% same-store NOI growth and expected to meaningfully accelerate in the second half of the year.\nNow that I have put all these rumors to bed, let's talk about the 30 or so owners who did engage with us to create win-win partnership transactions. Year-to-date, we have closed $1.2 billion of acquisitions across 21 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. This is a remarkable stat given the torrid pace of activity last year.\nI find it difficult to talk about specific deals as it feels like picking your favorite children, but I still mention a handful of transactions to give you a sense. We bought 700 units, 3 large communities in Washington State with COGIR to expand our partnership with Matthew and Dave. Dave Eskenazy is one of the best in the business, and I'm glad that he's now back full time at COGIR US as a CEO.\nWe're also expanding our partnership with purchase of another property in Brentwood located in the East Bay of Northern California. All properties were bought at significant discount replacement cost. For example, the Brentwood asset contains large units, and it was bought for $320,000 per unit. We believe the replacement cost in each way today is easily significantly north of $500,000 units.\nAdditionally, we are significantly deepening our relationship with Dan and his team at StoryPoint with the acquisition of 33 communities in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee in their backyard. With a median vintage of 2016, we're extremely pleased with the average price of $197,000 per unit which is meaningful discount replacement cost with 63% of current average occupancy this sizable deal will be dilutive to our 2022 FFO per share, but properties are anticipated to generate significant occupancy, margin and cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond under StoryPoint's enhanced operating platform.\nThis is another example of us choosing the right long-term investment decision and cash flow growth of our GAAP earnings separation, another thing you hear from us consistently.\nIn another transaction, we announced we're expanding our partnership with Courtney and her team at Oakmont with 7 new assets in extraordinary locations in California. Courtney and her team are at the absolute top of operating echelons, and we cannot be happier to grow this partnership together.\nSeparately, within the medical office space, we bought 4 building property portfolio on the campus of one of the strongest hospitals in Birmingham, Alabama for a 5.5% cap rate in an absolute net lease structure at a great basis. Given the absolute net structure, we expect unlevered IRR to be high single-digit range. We're also under contract to buy 2 large beautiful MOBs, 1 in San Francisco Bay Area, another in Sacramento MSA for a high 5% going-in cap rate at a great basis. Again, we expect to generate high single digits in IRR in both cases.\nIn terms of the financing market, in the last 30 days or so, we have seen a massive shift with property level leverage down 15 points, cost doubling and interest only disappearing from the market, both in seniors as well as in MOBs. This is starting to have a tectonic impact on asset pricing. To put bluntly, I have not been this excited about our acquisition prospects since Q4 of 2020.\nAbout 6 weeks ago, an investor, whom I respect very much asked me if I'm optimistic about the next $7 billion of acquisitions, as I was about the last $7 billion of acquisition that we did since pivoting to offense in 4Q of '20. I instinctively answered what I truly believe that we're driven by value, not by volume, which this investor took it as a no.\nToday, that answer will be unequivocal yes. Yes, we are excited about the figuratively net $7 billion as we are when we acted on the last $7 billion. To that effect, our pipeline today is roughly $1.5 billion of deals in process across 20 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. Several of these are potentially operating unit transactions, which we expect to be very popular with the sellers.\nPlease recall that we define our pipeline as transactions that are already under contract. In addition to this, we're negotiating another couple of billion dollars of acquisitions across several other transactions. While we may not eventually succeed in convincing sellers to agree to our price, please note that we don't need any given transaction. Price is the price.\nWe see cracks in the market and are focused on where the puck is going and not where the puck might have been. The value of a party that never retreats and doesn't requires debt has really been higher. In most class systems in nature, such as coastline, cloud, turbulence no matter how much you scale up or scale down, you notice a remarkable self-similarity property. You notice that same occurrence everywhere in nature.\nFor example, a floret of a cauliflower is same as the cauliflower. This phenomenon is called fractal geometry. This is the same idea that our drive time polygons and isochrones are based on if you have seen our data science presentation. Interestingly, organization history is full of companies who grow successfully through small bolt-on acquisitions in their advantageous niche only to convince themselves of strategic acquisitions that get them in trouble.\nDavid Packer, the founder of HP brilliantly said, more businesses die of indigestion than starvation to discuss this phenomena. At Welltower, we don't have strategic acquisitions. In fact, self-similarity of mother nature is highly visible in our investment philosophy. No matter how small or big a specific investment is we are after the same, driven by the same factors.\nIn all cases, were buying, #1, a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs. And #2, where we can add value by driving operational improvement. We are not spread investing deal junkies. We are true total retail investors and are optimistic that 2022 will be one of the best years in the company's history from an acquisition point.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to my partner, John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer. John?\n\nJohn F. Burkart\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business in the quarter and provide some elements of our vision for senior housing. Starting with our medical office portfolio.\nIn the first quarter, our outpatient medical business delivered 2.7% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, while occupancy declined modestly to 94.5%. We continue to see strong retention rates in the first quarter of 92%, likely driven by rising construction costs, construction delays and the related increases in new lease rents.\nGoing forward, we expect occupancy to decline modestly as we continue to increase renewal rates in line with market increases. Now turning to our senior housing portfolio. The coiled spring, as Shankh has called it, is starting its expansion. Revenue in our same-store portfolio grew at 11.2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter.\nThat's over 2x the growth rate experienced last quarter and the highest year-over-year increase since at least 2017. Our first quarter performance was led by our U.S. portfolio, which reported year-over-year top line growth of 13.5%. Additionally, as we've described in recent calls, pricing power continues to strengthen as reflected by strong renewal rate increases and improving market rate.\nIn fact, RevPAR growth in the first quarter increased by the highest level in years at 4.6% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. While expenses grew at a rate of 9.5%, the more insightful expense metric is expense POR or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3%, in the first quarter year-over-year on a year-over-year basis, the lowest since at least 2017.\nThe combination of higher rental rates, increasing occupancy and improving margins led to an outstanding NOI growth rate of 18.4%. Our operators continue to report very strong demand with traffic above 2019 levels, which bodes well for the peak sales season ahead.\nAnd if things play out as we expect continued top line strength and further improvement on the expense side should result in a meaningful acceleration in NOI growth in the back half of the year. Understandably, since taking over as COO at Welltower, I've received questions about my vision and areas of focus, both of which I want to provide some insight to on this call.\nI will outline the opportunity I see and highlight some key elements of my plan, which I believe Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute. As I evaluate the senior housing business, my perspective is a little different than the conventional wisdom that is developed as the health care REIT industry has evolved.\nThe healthcare REIT industry, including Welltower, started with triple-net leases for senior housing, giving the owners little to no say in operations and asset management. As the industry evolved with RIDEA, the historic reliance on the operators to run the business continued. The senior housing industry was founded by strong visionary leaders who saw that there was a much better way for society to provide quality lifestyles for its aging members, and they acted accordingly, like so many industries, which are started by small businesses, they are specialists in their core focus, in this case, providing quality living experience for our aging population and generalists and the many other important elements related to running a modern operating business.\nBut as you know, I come to this business with a different perspective and have broken down the business into a few components. It's essentially the multifamily business that provides care with some hospitality. As Shankh alluded to in his opening remarks. Although REITs are limited in providing care services, we can perform multifamily type functions like revenue management, capital management, procurement, provide IT expertise as well as leverage our data science expertise.\nBy doing so, we have the opportunity to fundamentally change the potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to the senior housing business. Overall, I have come to believe that Welltower has a substantial opportunity to improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading the digital transformation of the business.\nMore to come on timing, but I will say that we are actively working on the initiative, partnering with best-in-class operators, and we will deliver various components as they are ready. The addition of the world-class operating platform will continue to dramatically increase the size and depth of the Welltower moat, and it will greatly simplify the business for our top operators, enabling them to focus on their core strengths, increasing their effectiveness and efficiency, and driving increased total returns.\nWe expect that all our stakeholders, including our operating partners and investors will emerge as winners in this next phase of the senior housing business. I'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy G. McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, John. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter. Our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the second quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.14 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.82 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our $0.79 to $0.84 per share guidance.\nDespite our results only including approximately $600,000 of HHS funds versus the $6 million expectation we had previously forecasted as part of our guidance. This quarter represented our first with year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic. And when excluding provider relief funds received in the respective periods, our $0.82 per share represents 15% year-over-year growth versus the first quarter of 2021.\nWe are also pleased to report that total portfolio same-store NOI growth turned positive in the quarter. With 8.9% year-over-year growth, which compares favorably to guidance of 7%. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported at quarter in years. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2021.\nIn our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 6.9% year-over-year and exceeded our expectations, driven by improvements in rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI.\nTrailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.82x and with a sequential improvement, mainly driven by the conversion of Legend Senior Living to day in the quarter. As indicated last quarter, we expect coverages to continue to move higher through the rest of the year as the positive inflection point we started experiencing in our SHO portfolio in the first quarter will be reflected in our triple-net coverages on a 1-quarter lag.\nNext, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.3x. We completed $67 million of long-term post-acute sales in the quarter bringing our total sales in the last 12 months to $525 million and a blending cap rate of 7.5%, with an additional $202 million under contract for sale at quarter end.\nAs a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 4.8% of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020, a 530 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship.\nAnd lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System, had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.02x.\nAs a reminder, this lease is backed by the full corporate guarantee from ProMedica Health System. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transactions.\nSince the start of the year, we have sold 21 million shares via forward sale agreement, at initial weighted average price of approximately $89.90 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.9 billion. We currently have approximately 19.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1.8 billion.\nAdditionally, we are seeing significant interest from potential sellers to accept OP units as consideration, providing further investment capacity. Taken together, our unsettled ATM proceeds, potential OP unit issuances and $352 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds provide ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline.\nDuring the quarter, we issued our second green bond comprised of $550 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032, with a coupon of 3.85%. Following a similar discipline in our equity funding strategy, this is our fourth unsecured issuance since March of 2021, bringing total debt issuance over the span of $2.3 billion with an average duration of 9.5 years and average coupon of 3%.\nAt quarter end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previously mentioned $2.1 billion of unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position.\nLastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.20 to $0.25 per share, normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.82 to $0.87 per share or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million of HHS funds expected to be received in the second quarter.\nGuidance represents a $0.025 increase at the midpoint from our $0.82 per share number in 1Q. This $0.025 increase is composed of a $0.04 sequential increase in our Senior Housing Operating portfolio NOI, $0.01 incremental increase in HHS funds and is offset by $0.025 of increased interest expense, lower foreign exchange rates, particularly the British pound, and dilution from development deliveries.\nUnderlying this FFO guidance is estimated in second quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 8% to 10%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%; long-term post-acute 2% to 3%; Health System, positive 2.75% and senior housing triple-net 7% to 8%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by revenue growth of 11% and underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 500 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and continued robust rate increases.\nWe continue to be pleased by the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth. setting the stage for a multiyear recovery to average occupancy in the portfolio at 76.4% at quarter end, nearly 1,100 basis points below pre-COVID levels and nearly 1,500 basis points below peak occupancy levels.\nWe've described as recovery in the past as a coiled spring with both secular and cyclical tailwinds behind it. While we started to see the spring release in the core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distressed, underoperated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects.\nWhile this capital allocation has the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, we will sustainably amplify it in the years to come. In short, we're working hard to keep that spring coil even as we start to realize the power of the earnings growth it can drive.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nI want to sum it up -- sum up the call by saying I cannot be more pleased with the internal and external growth prospects of the company. We have taken a lot of shots, suffered a lot of pain through the course of many years to finally get to the point where we believe we're primed for long-term compounding.\nThe only way we know how to create significant shareholder wealth over a long period of time.\nA great investment has 3 characteristics, outsized returns, low risk and long duration. While we are very successful in finding outsized returns in off-market opportunities that we continue to execute on we're equally focused on lower risk and longevity. This is why we're obsessed with acquiring assets at a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs in order to reduce risk.\nAnd in terms of longevity, Page 20 of our business update will describe to you 30 or so win-win contractual partnerships that we have signed through a seamless way of trust where we hope to deploy 30-plus billion dollars of capital over the next decade and beyond. We see enormous opportunity for growth within our circle of confidence, which we define as the area where we can allocate capital with house odds instead of gamblers odds our predictive analytics platform.\nThis confluence of outsized internal and external growth has created a rare condition, which is called Leaping Emergent Effect or as Munger describes it, Lollapalooza effect. You as our owners can rest assured that we will not make any poor capital allocation decisions that will jeopardize these rare leaping emergent conditions that we have achieved through many years of hard work, luck, courage and a culture where everybody is all in.\nWith that, operator, please open the call up for questions. Thank you."

Welcome to the Q4 2021 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew Grant McQueen\n\nExecutive VP, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the quarter reflect back on 2021 on this year-end call, walk you through high-level business trends and our capital allocation priorities.\nJohn will provide an update on the operational environment for show and MOB portfolios, and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and first quarter guidance. 2021 was a year marked by high conviction capital deployment, partner and talent acquisition and a powerful inflection in our senior housing business.\nOur belief in the long-term demand thesis for the senior housing proved out as we witnessed significant occupancy growth starting in the spring of last year, which continued through the historically seasonally weak winter season. Just as importantly, in the second half of 2021, we began to see a significant shift in the pricing power. Interestingly, we found these pricing power during a period of relatively low occupancy levels.\nAfter all, what industry or asset class do you know of that is able to achieve pricing power with occupancy levels in the low 70% range. Low behold that pricing power continued to strengthen in Q4, and in the first quarter of this year despite the impact of Delta and Omicron.\nSame-store RevPAR grew 3.4% in Q4, falling year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 4.8%, one of the strongest quarter in the company's history. And even more encouraging is the revenue growth in U.S., exceeded 6% with the momentum accelerating through fourth quarter. John will walk you through the details in a moment. Though I am not happy with our (inaudible) bottom line results due to increased expenses mainly from the Omicron induced labor crisis, I continue to believe we will see significant improvement throughout the year given the continued net hiring trends we're seeing from our operating partners. This assumes we don't experience a highly infectious variant. We can offset the higher cost of full-time employees just as we have done during the years prior to COVID, it is a significant presence of contract labor at search pricing level that is a source of the issue.\nFrom a demand standpoint, we saw record interest in our product in Q4 that continued through January with inquiries up significantly from December. However, a meaningful number of tours got canceled or postponed as either the prospective resident or their family got COVID or a community that did not have enough employees to conduct the tour as there was a COVID crisis in the communities.\nHowever, the tours have picked up meaningfully in recent weeks, and we are starting to see strong sales activity, which should translate into higher net move-ins in next 3 to 4 weeks. If we are right about this, you may see occupancy growth exceed seasonal trends while occurring in an environment of strong rate growth. We project this will put us into the double-digit NOI growth range in Q1, only to accelerate further throughout the year. As disappointed as I am about the diminished bottom line flow-through in Q4 due to $30 million of agency costs compared to only $5 million in Q1 of last year I continue to believe that our 2022 exit run rate and 2023 earnings power of this platform is unchanged.\nMoving to capital allocation. In 2021, we deployed $5.7 billion across great real estate with fantastic operator and at even a better price. The most incredible aspect of this story was the granular nature of execution with a median transaction size of $26 million. We're not believers in elephant hunting as larger transactions usually result in value accruing to the seller. As you know, we manage this company for our long-term shareholders to increase our share value. Q4 was no exception to this consistent trend. We have deployed $1.4 billion of capital in Q4 across 20 separate transactions with a median size of $24 million. I won't bore you with the details of every transaction, but I would be remiss not to mention a couple of them, which I'm particularly proud of, including a handful of trophy buildings in Boston and Florida at a very attractive basis. But perhaps the most exciting investment of the quarter was the formation of our partnership with Andy and Plan at Quality Senior Living or QSL.\nIt is hard to overstate how strong of a team Andy and Glenn have built from conceptualization of the product to development execution and ultimately, their operational excellence. For example, despite all the labor challenges that I've highlighted, have used virtually no agency labor and their buildings are well occupied. Andy, who is one of the biggest users of our data analytics platform is embarking on a multiyear effort to expand the Blake brand with the full support of our platform behind him.\nI hope you are seeing a pattern here with how our data and predictive analytics platform attracts some of the best people in the business as we offer so much more than capital. This network effect of platform execution across multiyear partnership that were formed over the last few years will fuel our growth for years to come. As Delta and Omicron induce challenges, we had that ugly head in Q4, capital deployment opportunity set only expanded, and that continued in Q1, which is seasonally the weakest quarter from a deal activity. With -- after a strong close of 2021, we have already closed an approximately $600 million of the investment over the last 6 weeks.\nAnd I'm pleased to report that our pipeline remains robust, highly visible and actionable. While the capital market backdrops remain volatile of late, driven primarily by the Fed headlines. We're well positioned to fund our pipeline with well over $1 billion of equity and availability of liquidity in excess of $4 billion.\nWe're proud of our capital allocation track record both deployment and sourcing. But if capital markets volatility continues, we will access different tools from our toolbox as we have done before. Lastly, I'm very proud to announce our new partnership with Rubin Brothers, which is buying every healthcare, one of our largest operating partner. Rubin Brothers, founded by David and Simon Rubin is one of the largest family offices in the world, and is the owner of prime real estate and infrastructure, both in U.K. and globally. There are also a pioneer of investing in alternative real estate and infrastructure as an early investor and owner of Global Switch. Rubin Brothers share our optimism for the exceptional growth trajectory for health care and wellness infrastructure as society ages. We're particularly excited about the prospect of expanding the platform together as Rubin Brothers owns some of the most prime land and real estate in the U.K. Tim and I have said on this call many times that temporary degradation of cash flow doesn't necessarily mean the extraction of value, every which constitutes 16% of our same-store triple net NOI will be significantly delevered through this equity infusion from Rubin Brothers. Partnering with highly sophisticated global investors like Rubin Brothers, validates our view of the long-term value of this business despite Wall Street's obsession with point-to-time coverage.\nIn conclusion, I'm very proud to of our execution in 2021 across operations, capital allocation and partnership that stay set for multiyear earnings growth as we find ourselves at the bottom of both secular and cyclical cycles with unparalleled platform built with advanced data analytics or so growth vehicles with different partners and talent to execute on it.\nThe pandemic has been devastating for our entire ecosystem, but we have doubled down during this massive disruption given our high conviction investment thesis, you as our shareholders can rest assured that we'll not be resting on our laurels and that will continue to dig deeper and wider moat.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to John. John?\n\nJohn F. Burkart\n\nExecutive VP & COO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on the performance of our management operating segments in the quarter. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.4% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter despite a 20 basis point decline in occupancy.\nWe continue to see strong retention rates at 86% in the fourth quarter and with increasing construction costs and rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates in exchange and accept the reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we maximize the value of the portfolio.\nNow turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The strong demand-based recovery in the senior housing business continues to strengthen. The show portfolio same-store revenue increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing the first full period of year-over-year same-store revenue growth since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy grew 90 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Again, the first year-over-year increase in occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic and the largest year-over-year gain for any quarter since 2016. Sequentially, the show portfolio spot occupancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the fourth quarter to 77.7%. Compounding these strong occupancy trends is a notable shift in pricing power.\nOver the second half of the year, operators have successfully raised and are again able to charge community raised rates and are, again, able to charge community fees, both of which were reflected in a 3.4% year-over-year increase in RevPAR during the quarter.\nAnd following an outsized increases on January and February renewals with little to no pushback, we expect further acceleration in RevPAR growth over the course of the year. Geographically, each of our markets Canada, the U.K. and the U.S. are showing improvement in same-store top line metrics through the quarter. Our Canadian portfolio, which has lagged the recovery posted a year-over-year revenue decline of 3% in Q4 2021.\nHowever, the revenue decline improved intra-quarter moving from a decline of 4.2% in October 2021 to a decline of 1.4% in December '21 compared to the prior year's respective months. Sequentially, the Canadian same-store portfolio grew at a revenue rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. In the U.K., our same-store revenue increased 7.8% during the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, accelerating from 7.1% growth in October of 2021 to 9% in December of 2021 compared to the prior year's respective months.\nFinally, in the U.S., where the majority of our portfolio is located, year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6.3%. The acceleration in revenue growth was particularly pronounced in the U.S., accelerating from 3.8% in October 21 versus the prior year's month to 9.1% in December. Despite these encouraging top line trends, expenses increased 8.8% year-over-year, driven largely by excessive agency cost. The combination of holiday time off and Omicron disruption led to an increase in agency costs in the quarter, almost 4.5x agency expense versus the prior year's quarter.\nExcluding agency costs, expenses increased 5.3%. Stress and Systems highlights opportunities and issues and the extreme stress in the health care system brought on by COVID has identified some opportunities to improve the value proposition for our hard-working health care workers. The agencies have been a temporary crush, which will provide a short-term option for both operators and the health care workers. That said, the excessive use of agencies is truly short term in nature and the exceptional premiums that they charge as much as 6x the base rate during the recent holiday period do not pass through to the agency employees who typically do not receive benefits either. The quality of life and their work experience is substantially less desirable than that of a permanent employee. Agency employees lack the connection to their coworkers and customers that they desire as they travel from site to site, city to city and state to state on a daily basis often away from their families.\nAdditionally, agency employees are less efficient as they do not know the systems nor the processes of the operator or the site nor the specific customer requirement. Our operators have many workflows underway at this time to improve the value proposition for permanent employees, which were bearing fruit prior to the Omicron. Nonetheless, the results of these outsized expenses was a decline in same-store NOI of 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, but still marked an improvement from Q3 2021, with over 50% of operators delivering positive NOI growth for the period.\nThe recovery continues to strengthen despite recent Omicron disruption, and we remain confident in our ability to drive significant NOI growth in 2022. Through January, agency labor expense has declined as staff cases have fallen. Labor expense is expected to moderate further through the first half of 2022 and declined substantially in the second half of 2022. The other disruption caused by Omicron was a record cancellation of tourists, which Sean described. However, at this point, weekly staff cases are down 81% from their peak, including an 89% drop in the U.S., and we are seeing operations normalize.\nThe disruption of tours and sales caused occupancy to fall about 20 basis points in January. However, with the high level of traffic, we expect that the continued occupancy gains will return and that we will regain lost occupancy by the end of the quarter. Here are some quotes from our operators about the strength of traffic and deposits. digital inquiries were up 36% over 2019 in the fourth quarter and continued strong in January. Our 4-week averages for inquiries, tours and deposits are the highest they've been since August of 2021, we are seeing week-over-week growth in deposits of 10% the last 4 weeks running. We are experiencing the strongest January for inquiries in several years. And finally our inquiries from the last week alone have been the highest numbers we've ever experienced. In closing, I have shifted from full immersion in the business to planning in action. I'm even more excited about the future opportunities across the Welltower platform. We are leveraging our proprietary data analytics platform and operationalizing the data to drive results. This process is occurring right now as we have several workflows underway, which we expect to bear fruit in the immediate future as well as many more workflows that we expect to drive our outperformance in the quarters and years to come.\nI continue to be appreciative of the warm welcome and excitement expressed by our operators as we leverage our combined real estate operating company and care experience to improve the customer and employee experience and drive financial results. Each operator has a unique expertise and opportunities. We have been working very well together and offering support where needed from implementing best practices to applying data analytics to improve their business. In one case, we identified a software tool over 25 years old. As they say, the '90s called and they want their deeper back. I'm confident there is a substantial opportunity to implement operational excellence across the board and bringing the basic back office and sales operations up to match the high quality of care the operators are delivering which will drive significant margin growth in the years to come.\nI'll now turn the call over to Tim.\n\nTimothy G. McHugh\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Welltower Inc.\n\nThank you, John. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2021 results. Performance of our triple net investment segment in the quarter are capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally, our outlook for the first quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of a $0.13 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per diluted share relative to the guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. Our results included approximately $18 million or $0.04 per diluted share of HHS funds and other out-of-period government grants that were not previously budgeted.\nTurning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months at 9/30/2021. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections on leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI.\nWe expect the impact of both these trends to accelerate in 2022. As rent collections improve, given that 20% of our leases are subject to API-based escalators. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.8x. Looking forward, we expect coverages to inflect positively in the first half of 2022 as year-over-year improvement in fundamentals followed the positive trends expected in our senior housing operating portfolio. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 0.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth. However, similar to our senior housing triple net portfolio, we expect NOI growth to improve in 2022 through greater rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition as well as CPI-based rent escalators.\nTrailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.29x. Over the course of 2021, we completed $458 million of long-term post-acute dispositions at a blended cap rate of 8.7%. With an additional $108 million under contract for sale at year-end. As a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 5.2% of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020. A 490 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System, had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.39x. The sequential improvement in coverage was driven by the previously announced agreement to sell 25 assets that have been contributing negative EBITDA.\nAs of year-end, we completed the sale of '21 of those assets with the remaining 4 held for sale. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions.\nSince the beginning of the fourth quarter, we've sold 11.3 million shares via forward sale agreements at an initial weighted average price, $85.06 per share for expected gross proceeds of $961 million. We currently have approximately 11.1 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $949 million. This is in addition to $220 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds.\nDuring the quarter, we also issued $500 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032 with a coupon of 2.75%. Following similar discipline in their equity funding strategy, this is our third unsecured issuance in 2021, bringing full year issuance to $1.75 billion, with an average ratio of 9.5 years and a coupon of 2.6%. At year-end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. When combined with the previously mentioned $1.2 billion of combined unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we are in a very strong liquidity position heading into 2022. We ended the fourth quarter with 6.95x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, down slightly from last quarter. Leverage is impacted by the timing of $1.5 billion of net investment activity completed later in the quarter. If we run rate the impact of net investment activity completed in the quarter, pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA decreased to 6.75x. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio. with portfolio spot occupancy ending the quarter at 77.7%, 70 basis points higher than the end of the prior quarter, but still 950 basis points below pre-COVID levels. The portfolio also sits 1,300 basis points below peak occupancy levels. Setting the stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base.\nLastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.17 to $0.22 per share, and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.79 to $0.84 or $0.815 at the midpoint.\nThis guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million or $0.015 per share of HHS funds expected to be received in the first quarter. Excluding the HHS funds, the $0.80 per share midpoint of our first quarter guidance, represents a $0.01 sequential increase from an as adjusted $0.785 per share number for 4Q, which excludes $18 million of previously recognized HHS and out-of-period U.K. and Canadian subsidies recognized in the quarter.\nThis $0.015 increase is composed of $0.025 from a sequential increase in senior housing operating portfolio NOI and fourth quarter investment activity and an offset of $0.01 increase of sequential G&A and income taxes. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated first quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 7%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1% to 2% growth; long-term post-acute, 1% to 2%; health systems, 2.75%; Senior housing triple net, 5% to 6%; and finally, senior housing offering growth of approximately 15%, driven by revenue growth of 10%.\nUnderlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 420 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh.\n\nShankh S. Mitra\n\nCEO, CIO & Director, Welltower Inc.\n\nThanks, Tim. I wanted to conclude this call by addressing something that we usually don't talk about, and that is our comprehensive team. We have completed a completely overhauled and upgraded our team, and this was a multiyear effort building out new areas such as breaktime analytics to create a truly scalable platform. with extremely low volunteer turnover, we continue to hire the best and the brightest to fight that deepen our capital allocation expertise. Historically, the majority of the alpha we created have been through astute raising or deployment of capital. Over the last 15 months, though, we have also built out an industry-leading and frankly, a very significant development team under the leadership of Mike Fey and (inaudible) The last piece of this puzzle is building out our operational excellence and asset management capabilities. This started with the hiring of John in 2021. John is building out a world-class team that will accelerate value creation for our shareholders for years to come. We have added a net 51 people last year and we're likely to add another 80 new colleagues in 2022. Many of you who follow our company closely understand that our asset platform is like a coil spring today. We spent heavily during the pandemic, but most of these assets are sitting with low occupancy and thus, cash flow which is about to be released and search forward to realize its full value. Similarly, the people side of our business platform is also a call spring today. You are only seeing them in G&A line, but their full contribution to the revenue line will be seen in 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, operator, please open up the call for questions."

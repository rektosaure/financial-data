Welcome to Q3 2025 BXP Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Helen Han, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the BXP Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night and furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, BXP has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investors section of our website at investors.bxp.com. A webcast of this call will be available for 12 months.\nAt this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although BXP believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable exceptions, it can give no assurance that expectations will be attained.\nFactors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in BXP's filings with the SEC. BXP does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nI'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.\n[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning to all of you. Our financial results for the third quarter demonstrate a continuation of BXP's positive momentum. FFO per share was $0.04 above our forecast and $0.02 above market consensus, and we raised the midpoint of our earnings guidance for the full year 2025 by $0.03. This past quarter, BXP also completed a very well attended and successful Investor Day, during which we provided a detailed execution plan on how we intend to increase FFO per share fund development costs and deleverage over the next 2.5 years.\nThis morning, I will provide a reminder of the action steps in our plan as well as an early update on our progress. Our first goal is to lease space and grow occupancy given the modest rollover exposure BXP faces over the next 9 quarters. In the third quarter, we completed over 1.5 million square feet of leasing, 39% greater than the third quarter of 2024, and 130% of our last 5-year average leasing for the third quarter. Year-to-date, we've leased 3.8 million square feet, which is 14% greater than the first 3 quarters of 2024.\nAs we have explained on prior calls, leasing activity is tied to both our clients' growth and the use of their space. As a proxy for BXP's client base, over 87% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings this quarter as of last Friday are beating estimates. S&P 500 earnings have been growing for 9 straight quarters and for 2025 are projected to grow around 11% to 12%, up from single-digit estimates last quarter.\nReturn to office mandates continue to grow and take effect, though the West Coast lags the East Coast on this measure. Placer AI just released their office utilization data showing a material uptick in office utilization from a year ago. In September 2024, office utilization was 34.8% below 2019 levels, and last month's utilization was 26.3% lower indicating a 13% increase in office utilization over the last year. This data captures a large set of office assets across the U.S. and though premier workplace utilization in gateway cities is higher, the overall trend is relevant.\nOur second goal is to raise capital and optimize our portfolio through asset sales. During our Investor Day, we communicated an objective to sell 27 land, residential and nonstrategic office assets for approximately $1.9 billion in net aggregate sale proceeds by year-end 2027. We are off to a strong start. So far, we've closed the sale of 4 land assets for total net proceeds of $57 million, have under contract 9 assets for total net proceeds of approximately $400 million and are in the market with 10 additional properties for estimated total net proceeds of $750 million to $800 million.\nIn total, we have 23 transactions closed or underway with estimated net proceeds of roughly $1.25 billion. Dispositions completed for 2025 could aggregate approximately $500 million to $700 million in net proceeds. Office transaction volume in the private market continues to improve as more equity investors get constructive on the sector, and financing becomes more available at scale, particularly in the CMBS market with tightening credit spreads. In the third quarter, significant office sales were $12.9 billion, up 6% from the second quarter of '25 and up 55% from the third quarter last year.\nRelevant transaction activity that took place in the third quarter is as follows: In New York City, Park Avenue Tower, a nearly fully leased 620,000 foot office building located at 55th Street, is under agreement to sell for $730 million or approximately a 6% cap rate and nearly $1,200 a square foot. Another 5% interest in One Vanderbilt located adjacent to Grand Central Station in New York City sold for over $2,800 a square foot and presumably a very low cap rate. In Boston, 399 Burlton Street, a 245,000 square foot office asset that is 90% leased with relatively short weighted average lease term is under agreement to sell for $124 million or just over $500 a foot and an 8.3% cap rate; in Beverly Hills, Maple Plaza, a 290,000 square-foot office asset that is 75% leased sold for $205 million or $713 a foot and a 6.5% cap rate; and lastly, in Redmond, Washington, [indiscernible], a 250,000 square foot office building fully leased to Microsoft on a long-term basis sold for $225 million or a 6.5% cap rate and over $900 a square foot.\nOur third goal is to increase our portfolio concentration of premier workplace assets in CBD locations in our core gateway markets. As a backdrop, the premier workplace segment, defined as roughly the top 14% of space and 7% of buildings in the 5 CBD markets where BXP competes continues to materially outperform the broader office market. Direct vacancy for Premier workplaces in these 5 markets is 11.7%, 5.7 percentage points or 22% lower than the broader market and asking rents for Premier workplaces climbed to a 55% premium over the broader market.\nOver the last 3 years, net absorption for Premier workplaces has been a positive 10.3 million square feet versus a negative 9.2 million square feet for the balance of the market, nearly a 20 million square foot difference. For BXP, we continue to reallocate capital to Premier Workplace assets in CBD locations. We recently launched new developments at 343 Madison Avenue in New York City and 725 12th Street in Washington, D.C., and most of the office and land assets we are selling are in suburban locations. There are an increasing number of higher quality office assets in our core markets available for acquisition, some on an off-market basis. We evaluate everything, pursue deals selectively, but are being disciplined about quality, pricing and the resultant leverage and earnings dilution impact.\nThe fourth goal is to grow FFO through new development more selectively with office given market conditions and more actively for multifamily, which we'll do with a financial partner. For office, we are allocating capital more to developments and acquisitions because we are finding very high-quality development opportunities with pre-leasing that we believe will generate over 8% cash yield upon delivery, which are roughly 150 to 200 basis points higher than cap rates for debatably equivalent quality asset acquisitions.\nAn additional advantage as new buildings generally have longer weighted average lease term and limited near- and medium-term CapEx requirements. The trade-off is timing as developments obviously take several years to deliver. For multifamily, we are selling 4 properties totaling over 1,300 units, have 3 projects with over 1,400 units under construction and our various stages of entitlement and/or design for 11 projects totaling over 5,000 units, 2 of which could commence in 2026. We expect to capitalize new development starts with financial partners owning the majority of the equity.\nWe continue to advance our development pipeline. This quarter, we delivered 3 office projects: 1050 Winter Street, Reston Town Office Phase 2. The office component of both these assets are fully leased and 360 Park Avenue South, currently 38% leased and experiencing accelerating leasing activity. We have 8 office life science, residential and retail projects underway, comprising 3.5 million square feet and $3.7 billion of BXP investment. We expect these projects will deliver strong external growth, both in the near term with the delivery of 290 Binney Street midway through next year and over the longer term. Our Washington, D.C. team is also working on another Premier Workplace build-to-suit opportunity.\nA final goal is to introduce a financial partner into our 343 Madison development project, which is under construction. As we have described, 343 Madison is a leading premier workplace new development project in New York City given its location with direct access to Grand Central Terminal and state-of-the-art amenities and design. We are finalizing a lease commitment with a financial services client for 30% of the space in the middle bank of the building. We are also in discussions with several other large users for the balance of the space in the project.\nOur financial goal is to introduce an equity partner for a 30% to 50% interest in the property. While we are in very preliminary discussions with a small number of investors who have expressed interest, we believe the value of the asset will appreciate given our leasing progress and the accelerating market rent growth in the Midtown office market and do not expect to finalize an investment until sometime in 2026.\nIn conclusion, our clients, in general, are growing, healthy and more intensive [indiscernible] space, creating increasingly positive leasing market conditions concentrated in the premier workplace segment of the market. New construction for office has virtually halted leading to higher occupancy and rent growth in many submarkets where BXP operates. Debt and equity investors are becoming constructive on the office sector, resulting in more availability of capital at better pricing.\nBXP is very much on track executing our business plan as outlined last month, which we believe will deliver both FFO growth and deleveraging in the years ahead. Let me turn it over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So it's been 6.5 weeks since we made our presentation at our Investor Day, and I'm going to begin my comments this morning by affirming our expectations relative to our same-store leasing, occupancy growth and bottom line contribution to future earnings. As you probably noticed, our beat this quarter came directly from better operating portfolio performance.\nWe have entered a 30-month period of very light lease expirations 60% of historical annual average over the last 10 years, and we've now reduced our '26 and '27 expirations by another 8% from [ 630 25. ] So the total expiring square footage on our 49 million square foot portfolio is 3.8 million square feet.\nDuring 29 of the last 39 quarters, -- we executed leases in excess of 1 million square feet with this quarter's 1.5 million square foot performance added. We will surpass our goal of 4 million square feet for 2025. [indiscernible] says to say confidently. As I described in my remarks in September, leasing vacant space improves occupancy and delivers the highest contribution to revenue growth.\nDuring the first half of '25, we leased 810,000 square feet of vacant space. And this quarter, we leased an additional 490,000 square feet of vacancies, making this the seventh consecutive quarter of between 400,000 and 500,000 square feet of vacancy leasing. Post [ 10 25, ] so at the beginning of the fourth quarter, we had 1.8 million square feet of leases in negotiation, which is where we began the beginning of the second quarter. So we have continued to replenish the pipeline.\nThe space under lease negotiations includes 650,000 square feet of currently vacant space, 71,000 square feet of known 25 explorations and 450,000 square feet of [ 26 27 ] expirations. In addition, we have active dialogue on other space that's not yet in lease negotiation totaling about 1.1 million square feet, and that includes more than 125,000 square feet on buildings that we delivered into the portfolio this quarter, aka 360 Park Avenue South.\nLast quarter, on our call, we called out the delivery of the 3 development properties in our portfolio that would occur this quarter and result in an estimated 70 basis point reduction in our occupancy from the portfolio additions. I'm happy to report that the in-service occupancy as of [ 9 30 25 ] decreased by only 40 basis points to 86%. BXP's totaled sequential same-store portfolio occupancy, excluding the portfolio additions. So looking back to where we were at the end of the second quarter, actually increased by 20 basis points in end of the year [indiscernible] the quarter at 86.6%.\nThe largest lease starts and expirations this quarter all came in the urban edge portfolio of Boston. We had 160,000 square feet exploration at 1000 Winter Street, which, by the way, is a building that we are considering for a potential conversion to residential. We executed and delivered 104,000 square feet at 153 Second Avenue in the full building lease at [ 1050 ] Winter Street for 162,000 square feet commenced this quarter.\nWe placed 350 Park Avenue South Reston Town Phase 2 into service and we added 130,000 square feet of occupied space and 405,000 square feet of vacant space, of which 120,000 is leased but not yet occupied. BXP's total portfolio percentage leased for the quarter was 88.8%, a decline of 30 basis points. Excluding the impact of placing the 3 development properties in service. So again, going back to 630, the lease percentage increased by 10 basis points to 89.2%. The difference between the leased and occupied square footage has grown again this quarter and now sits at 1.4 million square feet. 300,000 square feet is expected to become occupied in '25, about 1 million square feet that's going to commence in the back half of '26 and another 100,000 square feet in '27.\nOwen described the magnitude of the operating assets being actively marketed for sale. As we dispose of assets, we will disclose the incremental impact of occupancy from the changes in the portfolio. Looking forward, we project that the current in-service portfolio, which includes the recent development deliveries to end '25 at approximately 86.2% occupied and '26 at 88.3% occupied, a 210 basis point increase with most of the improvement in the second half of '26.\nWe are reaffirming our guidance from the Investor Day, adjusted for the 70 basis points of impact from the Q3 new deliveries, which we also disclosed at that time. The overall mark-to-market on leases signed this quarter on a cash basis was up almost 7% with a 12% increase in Boston a 7% increase in New York, flat results in D.C. and a 4% decrease on the West Coast. This quarter, we executed a number of larger leases, including 5 that were each over 75,000 square feet. 60% of the square footage involved renewables or extensions and 40% was either new clients or expansions from existing clients.\nExisting client expansions encompass 84,000 square feet of the activity. The second-generation rents in the leasing statistics this quarter represent about 523,000 square feet and are down on a gross basis about 4%. The LA statistic had a whopping 1,300 square foot lease and San Francisco included 117,000 square feet with 74,000 square feet to about 2/3 coming from our Mountain View properties.\nI want to pivot my remarks now to the market conditions and the activity we're capturing. Our leasing this quarter came from 79 transactions, 398,000 square feet in Boston; 795,000 square feet in New York; 191,000 square feet on the West Coast; and 140,000 square feet in D.C. In the BXP portfolio, Midtown New York City, the Back Bay of Boston and Reston Virginia continue to have the tightest supply and, therefore, the most landlord favorable conditions. What this means is that net effective rents are increasing due to either higher rental rates or flat or decrease in concessions or both.\nThe bigger [indiscernible] in Boston this quarter took place in our Urban Edge portfolio, where we completed over 200,000 square feet of leasing to life science clients. This included 104,000 square foot lease with a drug development and medical device research services company and 5 -- counted 5 additional pure office leases with life science organizations. Our remaining first-generation life science availability in the Urban Edge is now limited to 70,000 square feet at 180 CityPoint and 112,000 square feet at 103 CityPoint. So that's a total of 180,000 square feet. That's our life science first-generation exposure.\nDemand for wet lab space continues to be tepid. There are a [indiscernible] lab users actively touring but the requirements from very early stage clients continues to be limited. In the Boston CBD, we continue to complete renewals in the Back Bay portfolio. This quarter, we completed about 140,000 square feet. And as you can see from our property occupancy tables, availability is very limited, net effective rents are improving.\nIn New York, our executed leasing activity was focused on the Midtown East portfolio. The underpinning of this demand is the growth of clients in a variety of asset management strategies. I described a series of client-initiated early extensions under negotiation last quarter, while 500,000 square feet were executed this quarter, with the largest being at 399 Park Avenue. There have been many unconfirmed press reports about our lead 10 for 343 Madison. If that client were to come from one of our Midtown assets, there would be strong demand for the space at either 601 Lexington Avenue, 599 Lexington or 399 Park Avenue. The average in-place fully escalated rent is under $110 a square foot, which is significantly below market.\nThis quarter, while our executed leases were primarily in Midtown, the new client inquiry story was focused on 360 Park Avenue South, where we have our largest availability in Manhattan. Activity at the building has grown substantially, and we executed 2 leases during the quarter. There are a few AI companies in the mix, but much of the activity is being driven by financial service and asset management organizations, the heart of New York City.\nWe have 56,000 square feet of leases in negotiation and letters of intent discussions on more than 125,000 square feet. All of these leases would commence in '26. With the tightening of availability in the Park Avenue and now the 6th Avenue submarket, we're also seeing stronger activity at Times Square Tower where we are in lease negotiations with over 100,000 square feet of new client demand. And down in Princeton, we completed over 160,000 square feet of leasing with 8 clients totaling -- including [ 834,000 ] square feet renewal with a life science client, again with no lab infrastructure.\nIn San Francisco, the demand from organizations that describe themselves as AI business continues to accelerate. The bulk of this demand is concentrated south of Mission Street. The majority of these requirements are looking for inexpensive, fully built and furnished space with short-term commitments. To date, these criteria have been available in either sublease situations or with landlords that have direct space that was vacated by tech companies over the past 3 years. These opportunities in medium-sized [ block ], 25,000 to 100,000 square feet are quickly shrinking. The result has been a dramatic pickup of activity at our 680 Folsom, 50 Hawthorne assets, which are south of mission between Foundry Square and Mission Bay.\nWe have had multiple tours every week and are exchanging proposals with tenants ranging from a single floor to over 200,000 square feet. During the first 6 months of the year, we had 11 unique tours at the property. In the month of July, we had 7, in August 9, in September 10 and so far in October 14. That AI demand has not translated into a commensurate pickup in ancillary professional services growth in the high-rise assets in San Francisco.\nWhile San Francisco is unequivocally the financial capital of the West. The organizations that are growing assets under management in San Francisco are not expanding at the same levels we are experiencing in our New York and Boston portfolios. There's clearly been a pickup in activity, and the premier buildings are gaining market share, but it's just nothing like the client growth from the AI companies south of Mission where CBR reports that there are 36 AI active tenants with aggregate growth of 1.5 million square feet in the market right now.\nIn our towers, we completed about 100,000 square feet of transactions this quarter. The rest of the West Coast activity came from Mountain View, where we signed 30,000 square feet in Seattle where we completed the 54,000 square feet of vacant space leasing. Activity in D.C. continues to be concentrated in Reston Town Center. This quarter, we executed a 51,000 square foot lease on space that was vacated by Meta in June of this year as well as a handful of smaller office and retail leases. The government shutdown has had minimal impact on government contract or leasing activities. The private sector clients that have space needs are all still active in the market.\nBefore I conclude my remarks, I want to update our construction activities, particularly because we are in the process of establishing our GMP for 343 Madison. Subcontractors are actively bidding the job after taking into consideration the tariffs associated with nondomestic suppliers and the most recent country agreements. We expect to purchase our steel from U.S. manufacturers, and we are within our expected budgets with all include anticipated savings relative to our last GC estimate. Given the overall slowdown in construction activity in our markets, there is enough subcontractor interest to provide savings in spite of all the tariff increases. Remember, construction is a composition of labor cost, material cost and profit.\nAnd let me hand the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Today, I'm going to cover some of our activity in the capital markets as well as our third quarter earnings results, an update to our full year guidance and some updates on our expectations for 2026 since our Investor Day in early September.\nThe debt markets have been steadily improving throughout 2025, and this quarter, we opportunistically and successfully accessed both the secured and unsecured markets. In late September, we closed on $1 billion of 5-year unsecured exchangeable notes at a 2% coupon. If you include closing costs, the interest costs we will record for GAAP is 2.5%. This will refinance a $1 billion bond issue that expires in February of next year and carries a GAAP yield of 3.77%. The notes include a conversion premium at a stock price of $92.44 per share. So if our stock trades above the conversion premium during the term, our diluted share count will increase. We also acquired a capped call to increase the conversion premium to 40% or $105.64 per share, to reduce the dilution from the increase in our share price. The [indiscernible] has no impact on our P&L or our diluted share count during the term. It settled at maturity.\nThe market demand for our deal was exceptionally strong, and we were 5x oversubscribed. That allowed us to price the security in the low end of our expected pricing range and upsized the deal from the $600 million initially offered to $1 billion. We also closed a $465 million mortgage refinancing on our Hub on Causeway office and retail complex that we own in a joint venture where our share is 50%. This loan was executed as a single asset securitization in the CMBS market, and it priced at a 5.73% fixed rate for a 5.5-year term. This is approximately 50 basis points lower than the floating rate on the prior loan.\nThe pricing equated to about a 200 basis point credit spread for a premier quality secured mortgage with a 55% loan-to-value ratio. There have been about a dozen single asset securitizations completed on office buildings in the past 6 months, and that demonstrates the CMBS market is supportive of financing high-quality, large office assets on competitive terms and credit spreads have been consistently improving. We expect this will help lead to a healthier sales market, as Owen described.\nOverall, we continue to have very strong access to all the capital markets to finance our business. This includes the debt markets as well as the asset sales environment where we expect to be increasingly active.\nNow I would like to turn to our earnings for the quarter. Last night, we reported funds from operations for the third quarter of $1.74 per share, which is $0.04 per share above the midpoint of the FFO guidance range we provided in July. All of the outperformance came from better-than-projected same-property portfolio NOI due to a combination of the straight-line rent impact of completing early renewals at higher rents and lower net operating expenses in the portfolio.\nOur occupancy came right in line with our expectations. As Doug described, occupancy in the same property pool increased by 20 basis points from last quarter. We grew occupancy sequentially in Boston, New York City, Reston and Princeton. The improvement showed up in our top line lease revenues that increased $4 million this quarter. In our leasing activity this quarter, we executed 4 early renewals totaling 500,000 square feet at 399 Park and 200 Clarendon Street with future starting rents nearly 15% higher than our in-place rents. We are locking in future rental rate increases and a portion is straight line into the current period and improving 2025 revenues.\nOur portfolio revenues exceeded our guidance for the quarter by approximately $0.02 per share. On the expense side, we experienced lower-than-anticipated repair and maintenance expenses this quarter, and that contributed $0.02 per share to our outperformance. I anticipate that we will give some of this performance back in the fourth quarter as our teams complete R&M projects that were budgeted for Q3, but not completed in the quarter.\nWe also recorded $212 million of impairments this quarter related to assets that are part of our strategic sales program we announced on our Investor Day. The accounting guidance requires that we recognize impairments to fair value when we shorten our whole period and prior to an asset sale actually closing. On the flip side, gains on sale are not recorded until the sale closes. So if you look at our sales program as a whole, we anticipate that the aggregate gains less impairments will total nearly $300 million. We expect gains will be recorded in future quarters as we execute our sales strategy.\nLooking at the rest of 2025, we've increased our guidance range by $0.03 per share at the midpoint, and we expect full year 2025 FFO of $6.89 to $6.92 per share. Our increased guidance includes a $0.07 increase in the low end of our range, reflecting outperformance from the third quarter, some of which was incorporated into our guidance range we provided last quarter.\nSequentially, we expect Q4 funds from operations to be higher than our Q3 actual FFO from higher portfolio NOI and lower net interest expense. With respect to changes in our guidance, the outperformance in our same-property portfolio is expected to add an incremental $4 million to our full year NOI assumption. That equates to about $0.02 per share of improvement. We've reduced our net interest expense projections for the full year 2025 by approximately $6 million or $0.03 per share. The improvement is from our new $1 billion exchangeable notes offering, where we're recording interest expense at 2.5% and we're actually earning over 4% on the proceeds until we repay our expiring bonds on February 1 next year.\nAnd we also improved the interest rate with our Hub on Causeway refinancing and we're projecting several asset sales to occur in the fourth quarter that will reduce our debt. These increases to our FFO are anticipated to be partially offset from the reduction of about $0.02 per share of NOI from asset sales that we expect will close in the fourth quarter. If you include the associated changes in interest expense, our fourth quarter asset sales are projected to be dilutive by $0.01 per share.\nSo to summarize, we've increased our guidance range for 2025 FFO by $0.03 per share at the midpoint, $0.02 of higher same-property NOI, $0.03 of lower net interest expense offset by $0.02 of lower NOI from asset sales. At our investor conference last month, we provided some insights into our expectations for FFO growth in 2026. Doug described our active leasing pipeline that we expect will lead to higher occupancy primarily in the back half of next year.\nWe are off to a strong start on our refinancing plan with our exchangeable notes deal pricing with a GAAP yield that is 75 basis points better than we anticipated. The impact is about $0.04 per share of lower interest expense in 2026 than we described at our Investor Day. We still have $1 billion bond issue expiring October 1 next year that has a 3.5% yield. We currently project that we will refinance it with a 10-year unsecured bond where we could issue today at approximately 5.5%.\nThe other factor that is fluid and will have an impact on our 2026 results is the timing of our asset sales. As we stated at our Investor Day, we expect the program to be slightly dilutive in 2026. We are seeing good response to date, which could accelerate some of our sales. We will continue to update you every quarter on the success of the program as it evolves. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the lines for questions?"

During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. We ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, to please limit yourself to one and only one question. If you have an additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning to all of you. Our results in the second quarter demonstrate BXP's continued strong execution, and provide further evidence of the property and capital market recovery underway in our sector.\nOur FFO per share was $0.05 above our forecast and $0.04 above market consensus for the second quarter primarily driven by improved operations. As a result, we're also raising the midpoint of our earnings guidance for the full year 2025 by $0.02. We completed over 1.1 million square feet of leasing in the quarter, bringing our total leasing in 2025 to 2.2 million square feet. Over the last 4 quarters, our leasing volume of 5.7 million square feet was 18% higher than the prior 4 quarters. We continue to increase the pre-leasing of our development pipeline with 200,000 square feet of development leasing this quarter.\nNow regarding the operating environment, BXP's leasing activity remains vibrant across many, though not all, submarkets. As discussed before, the primary drivers of BXP leasing activity, our corporate confidence and the in-person work behavior of our clients. Corporations generally see a favorable environment for their businesses unfolding this year with a pro-growth tax bill recently passed in Congress, less regulation, geopolitical risk relief in certain regions, resolution of U.S. tariff agreements with many important nations and the possibility of lower short-term interest rates. As a proxy for corporate health, 2025 S&P 500 earnings growth projections though revised lower since the beginning of the year remain healthy at 7% to 9%. Investors are confirming this view with U.S. equity market indices achieving new eyes, and credit spreads on U.S. investment-grade bonds trading at or near 10-year lows.\nFurther, in-person work behaviors continue to improve. JLL recently completed a study of Fortune 100 firm's office attendance policies. Over the last 2 years, ended the second quarter of 2025, Fortune 100 companies that are fully in the office climbed tenfold from 5% to 54%. Hybrid mandates dropped by nearly half from 78% to 41% and fully remote policies dropped from 6% to only 1%. These are material shifts that avidly augmented leasing activity return to office behavior is more advanced in our East Coast markets, particularly New York City and well behind on the West Coast.\nMoving on to office market conditions. I'll continue to emphasize that the premier workplace segment defined as roughly the top 10% of buildings in a market and where BXP primarily competes continues to materially outperform the broader office market. And our 5 core CBD markets, direct vacancy for Premier Workplaces is 7.5 percentage points or 38% less than the broader -- less than the broader market. And asking rents for premier workplaces continue to be more than 50% greater than the broader market.\nRegarding the real estate private equity capital markets office sales volume increased materially in the second quarter to $14.2 billion, up 80% from the prior quarter and 125% from the second quarter of last year. Financing at scale is increasingly available at tightening spreads for higher quality office assets with Walt, particularly in the CMBS market. Equity investors are also starting to reenter the office sector, given improving operating performance in certain markets and attractive asset pricing versus other sectors. There were several notable office transactions completed or committed in the quarter.\nIn Midtown New York City, 590 Madisons under contract for sale for $1.1 billion or $1,060 a square foot and a 5.2% cap rate. This building was constructed in 1981 is 85% leased and sold by a pension fund to a local real estate operator with a financial partner. Also in Midtown, a half interest in 1345 Avenue of the Americas was sold at a gross valuation of $1.4 billion or around $740 a square foot. The cap rate, not particularly meaningful against stabilization is several years away, and the transaction was facilitated by $850 million EMBS financing. The building was originally built in 1969, is 92% leased and transacted between investment management firms with the building manager staying in and owning the other half of the asset.\nAnd lastly, in Culver City, California and [indiscernible] was sold for gross -- gross price of $212 million or $675 a square foot and a 7.4% cap rate. This building was recently constructed recently in 2021 is 75% leased and transacted between investment management firms, again, with the building manager staying in and owning a small stake in the property.\nNow let's transition to BXP's capital allocation activities. As discussed on many prior calls, BXP controls what we think is the best positioned currently actionable office developments in New York City located at 343 Madison Avenue. The building will be a highly amenitized, sustainably designed 46-story, 930,000 square foot premier workplace with direct escalator access into the Madison concourse of Grand Central Terminal from the buildings lobby. Today, we are making several important announcements regarding this project. First, we're proceeding with the project for the terms of our ground lease with the MTA and plan to immediately commence full vertical construction of the building, which will allow delivery in late 2029, site preparation, foundation work, and development of the Grand Central escalator access is well underway had commenced in October 2024.\nSecond, we have executed a letter of intent with an anchor client for approximately 30% of the building with economics consistent with our investment underwriting. The client is a prestigious investment-grade financial institution that will be leasing the lower middle section of the building, we have experienced strong client demand for the project and have active anchor tenant proposals out to 6 clients representing in total approximately 1.3 million square feet. Negotiations continue with anchor clients for the base of the building, and we intend to be patient leasing the upper floors of the project, which we expect will be attractive to smaller users that make leasing commitments closer to the date when they can occupy their new space.\nThird, BXP is opting to buy out our 45% equity joint venture partner, which we will do no later than the end of this quarter for approximately $44 million at their cost basis. While our partner has been funding its share of predevelopment expenses since 2017, they have decided to prioritize investment in existing as opposed to development assets as opposed to development assets which better align with their current risk-adjusted return objectives. Given the trophy status of the asset and very promising pre-leasing activity, we believe introducing a new capital partner for an interest in 343 Madison if we elect to do so, is readily achievable. As a reminder, 343 Madison has a total development cost of just under $2 billion, including approximately $400 million of imputed capital cost carry and a projected stabilized cash yield on cost of approximately 7.5% to 8%, depending on how we ultimately elect to capitalize the project.\nThe leasing market in Midtown remained very strong with trophy buildings having a vacancy rate of 6.3% and no large blocks of space available in the Plaza District of Park Avenue. As a result, office rents are growing at rates well above inflation and the very few high-quality building traits that have been completed reduct cap rates well below our projected development returns. Culminating 13 years of effort by our New York region in securing and entitling the site, we believe 343 Madison will be a core long-term holding for BXP and represents a very strong and significant value creation opportunity for BXP shareholders.\nTurning to asset sales. We're in various stages of execution for the sale of 10 non-income producing assets, both land sites and largely empty buildings that we believe will generate if successful, net proceeds of nearly $300 million over the next 2 years. We're also exploring the sale of a handful of income-producing properties that could generate another $300 million in net proceeds more likely in '26 than '25. There is strong demand for housing in the communities where many of our sites and out of surface buildings are located, allowing us to create value through reentitlement. The process can in select cases take up to 2 years to complete. Other sites are being sold for industrial or other non-office uses. In the aggregate, we do not expect these sales will be dilutive to BXP's FFO because of the significant portion of nonincome-producing assets. A great example of our creativity in monetizing a nonproducing asset is 17 Hartwell Avenue in Lexington, Massachusetts, which is a 30,000 square foot commercial building built in 1966 and vacated in 2024 and recently demolished. We successfully rezoned the property in the town of Lexington to build a 312-unit multifamily building on the 5-acre site and secured an institutional partner to provide both construction financing and 80% of the equity required to build the project. The stick frame construction development will cost $180 million and is projected to deliver a 7.1% yield on cost, including land at current market value and capital cost carry upon stabilization in 2028.\nIn terms of economics to BXP, we received $22 million at closing for our land contribution. We own 20% of the project, which will require $10 million of funding from BXP over time, and we'll earn a development fee of more than $4 million. The inferred land value is $70,000 per residential unit or $22 million which is $733 a square foot for the existing empty commercial building significantly more than its as-is value. So in conclusion, Premier Workplace leasing and capital markets continue to recover from their lows in 2024. Our clients are generally optimistic about their business prospects and are demanding more in-person work from their professionals, both creating leasing demand.\nFurther, new construction for office has virtually halted and users are gravitating to higher-quality assets with strong sponsorship, the combination creating occupancy and rent growth for many of our assets as we gain market share. Private equity investors are increasingly taking note of these trends and starting to invest in the office sector. With our current leasing momentum and limited rollover in 2026 and 2027, we expect to gain occupancy, revenue and FFO in the years ahead, and development deliveries and potentially acquisitions will provide additional growth.\nLet me turn over our report to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Hope everyone is staying cool in this rather warm and humid air on the East Coast. As we think about the demand for premier office space across our markets, the pattern and the sources of demand that we've been describing for the last few quarters have really basically continued to sort of go on, as we've already talked about. Specifically, on the East Coast, submarkets with a concentration of financial and professional services businesses, which is the New York and the Boston CBD. We've had real demand growth there.\nDefense services and cybersecurity businesses located in Northern Virginia, have continued to weather the potential federal spending cuts, and there's been growth there. biotech demand growth with extensive lab uses continues to be light, while demand from life science clients with needs for high-quality office space continue in the Urban Edge of Boston. On the West Coast, there's been an improvement in overall demand in San Francisco led by organizations focused on AI, albeit with a large established tech companies still largely absent from growth. Venture funding from a deal count continues to be dominated by California, where there are 2.3x the next state, which is, by the way, New York, and to reinforce the dominance of AI-related venture investing California companies have raised more than $100 billion in the first half of '25, which is 10x of what was raised by New York City start-ups, the next largest ecosystem. Financial service and professional service clients are active though not showing the same growth that's present on the East Coast. Owen mentioned our 2.2 million square feet of leasing in the first half.\nDuring the first half of '25, we leased 810,000 square feet of vacant space and 750,000 square feet of space associated with 2025 expirations for a total of 1.56 million square feet. Our 2025 plan, call it for 4 million square feet of total leasing with about 3 million square feet of activity on vacant space and known 25 expirations. Leasing vacant space and near-term expirations will drive improvements to our occupancy over the next 12 to 18 months, When we experienced very modest expiration. We are on track. Post 7/1/25, the end of the second quarter, we have 1.8 million square feet of leases in negotiation compared to 1.1 million square feet at the beginning of the second quarter. If you include our letter of intent at 343 Madison, the number jumps to almost 2.1 million square feet. Our pipeline covers 575,000 square feet of currently vacant space, 65,000 square feet of known '25 expirations and 600,000 square feet of '26 and '27 expirations. Additionally, we are engaged in more than 550,000 square feet of client-initiated early lease renewals on leases that expire between '28 and '31. We have active dialogue on space that is not yet in lease negotiations, totaling about 1 million square feet. BXP's total portfolio occupancy for the second quarter ended at 86.4%, a decline of 50 basis points or 240,000 square feet.\nAs previously communicated during our first quarter earnings call as well as our remarks in January, Biogen's 355,000 square foot lease in the urban edge portfolio of Boston expired in May 2025 this quarter. We have re-let 45,000 square feet and have 310,000 square feet of space available. There were 2 other notable declines in our in-service property lessing -- listing this quarter. At South of Market in Reston, Meta terminated 51,000 square feet in May. We have already executed a lease for the entire space done this month, but the space was neither occupied nor leased at 6/30. And at 599 Lexington Avenue, we early terminated 100,000 square feet of late '25 expiring space in conjunction with executed leases for the entire square footage. We demolished these floors, so they were taken out of occupancy and are shown as leased at 6/30/25, but not occupied. Improvements at our other properties offset much of these declines.\nBXP's total portfolio percentage leased for the second quarter was 89.1%, a decline of only 30 basis points. As we highlighted last quarter and at our NAREIT meetings in June, the difference between leased and occupied square footage has grown again this quarter and now sits at 270 basis points versus 190 basis points on 12/31/24. 500,000 square feet of this approximately 1.3 million square feet of space is expected to become occupied in '25, with the bulk of the remaining 800,000 square feet commencing in the back half of 2026.\nLooking forward, we project the current in-service portfolio to end the year at around 87% occupied an improvement from where we are today. However, there will be 3 developments that are being added to the in-service portfolio in the third quarter. 360 Park Avenue South, which is 450,000 square feet, 23% occupied and 28% leased, 150 Winter Street, which is 152,000 square feet and will be 100% occupied and leased when it's added and Reston Next Block B, which is 90,000 square feet, 4% occupied and 95% leased when it is added. If we were add to add these properties this quarter, occupancy would drop by about 70 basis points. When we quarter statistics next quarter, you will need to adjust for these additions to gauge the progress of the in-service portfolio. We will be sure to highlight the impact on our occupancy in the third quarter earnings press release.\nOur development portfolio lease percentage this quarter increased by another 500 basis points to 67%. Office market conditions are pretty consistent with my earlier comments on demand. Those markets with the strongest demand growth also have the most landlord favorable conditions, Midtown New York City, the Back Bay of Boston and Reston, Virginia. What this means is that availability is sparse, rents are increasing and concessions are either improving or remaining constant. We completed 91 individual transactions this quarter 236,000 in Boston, 344 in New York, 185 on the West Coast and 356 in D.C. We had 20 clients expanding the portfolio by a total of 190,000 square feet and only 2 contractions for just over 3,000 square feet. 482,000 square feet of the leasing this quarter represented new clients in the portfolio, and the rest were either renewals and/or expected.\nThe overall mark-to-market of leases signed this quarter on a cash basis was flat with modest increases in Boston and New York and slight decreases on the West Coast in D.C. We only executed 3 leases in the in-service portfolio that were greater than 50,000 square feet this quarter. The second-generation rent change in the leasing statistics this quarter represents only about 400,000 square feet. And if you're curious, the LA numbers are skewed by a subsidized rent at the Santa Monic Business Park for a secondary school that was destroyed by Palisades fire where we did a lease. Our activity in Boston this quarter was very granular and spread around the portfolio. We completed 5 renewals and expansions in the CBD both in the Back Bay and the Financial District.\nLast quarter, I described life science client activity without the need for lab infrastructure. The first of these transactions was executed in the first quarter at 180 City Point and we are in lease negotiations with 2 additional clients for another 76,000 square feet also at 180 City Point. In addition, we have discussions going on with another group of companies that fit the same profile at our other urban edge assets. The economics of doing an office transaction on rock space, even though the building has been purposeful for lab and has the infrastructure are far superior lab transaction today given the elevated tenant improvements necessary to compete in the lab market.\nWe are in negotiations, however, with 1 true lab user for a second-generation lab building again in the Urban Edge portfolio. In New York, our leasing activity was focused on the Midtown East portfolio this quarter. The highlight was leasing 6 floors at 510 Madison Avenue, where we have opened an enhanced amenity offering, including a new outdoor space. We also completed a renewal of 399 Park Avenue and 2 law firm expansions, one at the General Motors Building and another at 200 Fifth Avenue. The 550,000 square feet of client-initiated extensions mentioned earlier, are concentrated in our Midtown portfolio.\nAt 360 Park Avenue South, we are currently in negotiations with 2 floors for approximately 47,000 square feet, one of those floors actually got executed last night, late breaking. So we're now at 33% leased there. In Princeton, we completed over 164,000 square feet of leasing with 13 clients, including 76,000 square feet of new clients and expansions. Interestingly, all the growth in Princeton is from office requirements for life science users. In San Francisco, at Embarcadero Center, we completed about 100,000 square feet of law firm transactions, including 165,000 square foot renewal with no reduction in space square footage, many of the traditional office users have continued to rationalize their space, which has led to little if any growth in the San Francisco CBD traditional demand. So incremental leasing is going to be all about tenant relocations.\nOur largest lack of available space in San Francisco is at 680 Folsom, where we are finishing up in the [indiscernible] improvement, including a new outdoor route space there as well. During the first 6 months of the year, we have 11 tours at the property. In the month of July, we had 7 additional. Virtually every potential client is a technology company working in the AI space. The granular absorption of space is very much underway, and the South of Mission buildings are great options for these clients. Our listing agent at 680 Folsom provided us a list of 37 AI-related tenants in the market with aggregate demand growth of almost 1.2 million square feet active in the market today.\nBefore I conclude my remarks, I do want to discuss tariffs as they relate to construction activities, particularly because we are in the process of establishing our GMP contract for 343 Madison Avenue. Subcontractors are actively bidding the job after taking into consideration the sectorial tariffs associated with nondomestic suppliers and the recent preliminary country agreements. To date, we've either awarded or are negotiating bids for 3 separate components of the job. And in each case, we are obtaining meaningful savings relative to our last general contractors estimate. Given the overall slowdown in construction activity in Manhattan, there is enough subcontractor interest to provide savings in spite of the tariffs. Remember, the construction is a composition of labor, materials and profits.\nAnd let me hand over the call to Mike to talk about our earnings peak.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. So today, I'm going to talk about our second quarter earnings results as well as the update to full year 2021 earnings guidance. And as Owen and Doug both described, we delivered a really strong second quarter.\nEarnings surpassed expectations and we're raising our full year guidance. For the second quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.71 per share, that is $0.05 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance range and $0.04 of consensus estimates for the quarter. Our portfolio generated approximately $0.04 of the outperformance, $0.01 came from earlier-than-anticipated revenue recognition on leases, which was very granular and spread across the portfolio, we generated an additional $0.01 per share from higher-than-anticipated service income for our clients primarily in Boston and New York, which tracks the higher space utilization on the East Coast. And then the last $0.02 of outperformance in the portfolio came from lower-than-projected operating expenses. Lower expenses partially came from lower real estate taxes resulting from successfully negotiating reductions in our assessed values. We do anticipate about $0.01 per share of the expense reduction that related to repair and maintenance costs will be deferred into the third quarter and will not benefit our full year results. Our G&A expenses also came in lower than we expected, resulting in a $0.01 per share better earnings performance. The savings came from lower compensation expense due to capitalized wages and savings in professional fees versus our budget.\nNow turning to the increase in our full year 2025 guidance. We're increasing the projected contribution from our same-property portfolio from the second quarter strong performance, combined with our ongoing leasing activity that Doug described, which continues to be aligned with our expectations. We now expect that the NOI from our same-property portfolio will increase in 2025 by about 0.25% at the midpoint from 2024. And on a cash basis, we expect the same-property portfolio NOI to grow 1.25% at the midpoint year-over-year. This represents an improvement of approximately 25 basis points from our guidance last quarter. or about $0.03 per share at the midpoint of our range. We continue to expect our in-service occupancy to start to improve in the second half of the year, excluding changes to the portfolio. As Doug detailed, we will be adding several development properties into service in the third quarter that will reduce our headline occupancy rate temporarily.\nWe are increasing our assumption for interest expense on our floating rate debt this quarter due to the expectation for fewer interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Our prior guidance included the potential for 3 rate cuts starting in the third quarter, and we've now reduced this to a maximum of 2 cuts, both in the fourth quarter. The result is approximately $3 million of projected incremental interest expense for the year or $0.02 per share of higher expense. In our G&A, we recognized $0.01 of lower expense in the second quarter, and we anticipate that savings flowing through to the full year in our FFO guidance.\nSo in summary, we have increased our guidance range to $6.84 to $6.92 per share. This represents an increase of $0.04 per share at the low end and $0.02 per share at the midpoint of our range. The increase at the midpoint is from $0.03 of better same-property NOI, $0.01 of lower G&A expense, partially offset by $0.02 of higher interest expense. Overall, we had a great quarter highlighted by strong leasing activity at 343 Madison catalyzing its development start, more than 1.1 million square feet of leases executed in the quarter and an FFO beat and guidance raise driven by stronger core portfolio operations.\nThe last thing I would like to remind everyone of is our upcoming Investor Day. It will be held in New York City on September 8 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at 599 Lexington Avenue with a cocktail event at 6:00 p.m. at our Coco's dining club on the 37th floor of the GM building. And for those of you who are really ambitious, you can join Owen and James for the 6:00 a.m. fun run through Central Park before the conference. We already have over 100 RSVPs and it will be a highly informative event with leadership from across our regions attending. So if you haven't responded and you would like to attend, please RSVP to the invite or you can send Helen a note. That completes our formal remarks.\nOperator, can you open the line for questions?"

Welcome to BXP's Q4 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Helen Han, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to DXP's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night and furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, BXP has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investors section of our website at investors.bxp.com. A webcast of this call will be available for 12 months.\nAt this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call which are not historical may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although BXP believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in DXP's filings with the SEC. BXP does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nI'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.\nWe ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit yourself to one and only one question. If you have an additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Helen. Good morning and Happy Lunar New Year to all of you. Our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated strong performance given our execution and the property and capital market recovery that is underway.\nOur FFO per share was in line with our forecast and market consensus for the fourth quarter. We completed over 2.3 million square feet of leasing in the quarter, which was the most quarterly leasing we have experienced since the second quarter of 2019. It was 130% of our long-term average leasing for the fourth quarter and our fifth largest quarter of leasing ever.\nOver the last few months, we have made several significant leasing announcements with important clients such as Bain Capital, Ropes & Gray, McDermott Will & Emery and KnitWell. We leased over 5.6 million square feet for all of 2024, which was 35% greater than 2023, and the average term for over 291 leases completed in 2024 was just under 10 years. Though the fourth quarter is usually our most productive leasing quarter due to year-end seasonality effects, momentum is clearly building in the market and our leasing results.\nAs I discussed at some length last quarter, the most important market forces impacting BXP, corporate earnings growth, return to office behavior and outperformance of premier workplaces continues to work in our favor, serving as a tailwind for BXP's performance. The one critical factor with a more uncertain trajectory is interest rates. Inflation measured as CPI has risen the last 3 months to 2.9%, stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target, and the December employment release indicated new job creation was well in excess of market expectations. As a result, the Fed has become more cautious, lowering its forecast of Fed fund rate cuts in 2025. And in the fixed income markets, long-term interest rates were up nearly 100 basis points since the Fed's first rate cut in September last year. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, short-term interest rates should remain lower in 2025 than 2024, which would be a positive for our and our clients' cost of capital.\nOne question we frequently receive is to project the impact of the new federal administration's policies on BXP's activities. Though we are in the early stages of the new administration executing its plan, we do believe many of the articulated policies are business friendly, particularly lower taxes and less regulation, which will be positive for our clients, building their confidence and as a result, stimulating leasing activities.\nRegarding efficiency initiatives, even if the federal workforce is rationalized and the GSA reduces space requirements, having federal workers returning to their offices should be a significant positive for BXP's business in the Washington, D.C. region. BXP has limited exposure to GSA leases and is therefore not directly impacted by a reduction in GSA space requirements. More street life would be a positive for the urban environment and local retailers in Washington, D.C. and many of our users are government contractors who would be more likely to return to their offices in line with our government clients.\nAn area of concern with the new administration's policies is the potential impact to interest rates, given that new tariffs, if implemented, could be inflationary and larger fiscal deficits resulting from tax cuts could lead to higher long-term treasury yields in the debt markets.\nWe are shocked by the devastation of the recent fires in L.A. and empathetic to all those impacted. It is too early to fully understand the future impact of this tragedy on the L.A. office market, but we are aware of a significant office sale process that is progressing with no apparent pricing impact post the fire incident.\nAs discussed repeatedly in the past, BXP competes primarily in the premier workplace segment of the office sector, which continues to materially outperform the broader office market. Premier workplaces are defined in CBRE's research as the highest quality 7% of buildings, representing 13% of total space in our 5 CBD markets. Direct vacancy for Premier workplaces is currently 13.2% versus 18.8% for the broader market. Likewise, net absorption for premier workplaces has been a positive 8.8 million square feet over the last 3 years versus a negative 15.6 million square feet for the broader market, Asking rents for premier workplaces are more than 50% higher than the broader market, up from approximately a 40% premium 3 years ago.\nRegarding the real estate private equity, capital markets office sales volume in the fourth quarter demonstrated a continued acceleration of deal activity. Specifically, significant U.S. office sales volume was $15.3 billion, 80% greater than the third quarter of '24 and 59% above the fourth quarter a year ago. Lower short-term interest rates, increased leasing activity for certain assets and locations and better access to debt financing continue to be the drivers.\nThough there were limited premier workplace sale transactions this past quarter in our core markets, notable deals include [ Norges ] purchased the 50% interest that did not already own in a portfolio of 8 assets located in Boston, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco from Nuveen. Pricing was on average approximately $500 a square foot for a portfolio that is 88.5% leased. A non-U.S. investor purchased an 11% minority interest in One Vanderbilt next to Grand Central in New York City for $2,700 a square foot and a 4.3% reported cap rate.\nMoving to BXP's capital allocation activities and new investments, we commenced an exciting new office development in Washington, D.C. Specifically, we acquired 725 12th Street, a vacant office building from its lender for $34 million or $112 a square foot. The site is very well located, immediately adjacent to Metro Center, Washington, D.C.'s busiest transit stop where 4 train lines converge.\nConcurrent with the acquisition, we secured a long-term prelease commitment from McDermott Will & Emery for 152,000 square feet to anchor a new premier workplace development on the site. Further, we have a letter of intent with another anchor client to lease substantially all of the remaining space. Our development plan is to demolish the existing building, reuse the below-grade parking structure and rebuild a new 320,000 square foot premier workplace with market-leading amenities and unique entry meeting and outdoor spaces for our 2 anchor clients.\nWe expect the full development budget, including land acquisition and capital costs, will be approximately $350 million, and our projected initial cash development yield for the project is over 8%. The development has commenced with our acquisition in December, and we expect to deliver the building in late 2028.\nThe 725 12th Street is a great example of how BXP is uniquely able to create an accretive investment opportunity in the current market environment. The existing building was empty and its loan in default creating a discounted acquisition opportunity. Industry-leading clients want and will pay for new premier workplace space fulfillments, notwithstanding high levels of vacancy in existing buildings. And BXP has the unique ability to execute, given our relationships with lenders and owners, trusted reputation and experience with industry-leading clients, both in Washington, D.C. and around the U.S., access to the capital markets needed to fund the development and a market-leading execution team to design and construct the new building. Well done, team BXP D.C.\nContinuing with new developments. I described last quarter our 940,000 square foot 343 Madison project in Midtown with direct lobby escalator access to Grand Central Madison Concourse and located 2 blocks south of JPMorgan's new headquarters building. We are in active conversations with several potential anchor clients ranging from 150,000 to 400,000 square feet. 343 Madison is the only immediately actionable office development site in close proximity to Grand Central Terminal, widely viewed as the most in-demand office submarket in the U.S. We expect to launch this $2 billion project in 2025, where, as a reminder, BXP owns a 55% interest.\nWe also expect to launch 2 new residential developments in 2025 where BXP will serve as a developer and a minority owner of the project. One of these projects is in suburban Boston at 17 Hartwell Avenue in Lexington on a site we already own that is being re-entitled and the other project is in the New York region. More details will be forthcoming when we launch these projects later this year.\nBXP, along with 3 partners, was also awarded by the State of New York, a project known as Site K, located at 11th Avenue between 35th and 36th Street, directly across from the Javits Convention Center and adjacent to our 3 Hudson Boulevard commercial site in New York City. The plan is to build approximately 1,350 residential units with an affordable component and a 450-room hotel in 2 separate towers over a 5-story podium. We are very pleased and honored to have been selected by New York State in this highly competitive RFP process. The project is several years away from construction commencement given the entitlement, predevelopment and design work that needs to be completed.\nBXP also delivered into service 2 projects this past quarter ahead of schedule. In October, we completed 300 Binney Street, a 240,000 square foot office to lab conversion project, fully leased to the Broad Institute on a long-term basis where we were able to achieve a first year cash development yield on incremental capital of 14.5%.\nWe also fully delivered into service Skymark, a 508-unit luxury residential high-rise development located in Reston Town Center. The lease-up of this project is well ahead of schedule, having leased over 50% of the units at above pro forma rents only 6 months after opening.\nWe are in active negotiations for the disposition of 3 land sites and are preparing to put into the market and operating property. In the aggregate, these sales, if successful, will generate approximately $200 million of net proceeds, although it is possible one of the land sale closings gets pushed to 2026. We remain active evaluating our nonproducing assets, both sites and buildings taken out of service to generate more monetization activity.\nNotwithstanding the development deliveries we completed in the second half of 2024, BXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 7 office lab retail and residential projects underway as of the end of the fourth quarter, the largest of which is 290 Binney in Cambridge fully leased to AstraZeneca and expected to deliver in the second quarter of 2026. These projects aggregate approximately 2.3 million square feet and $2.1 billion of BXP investment with $1.2 billion remaining to be funded.\nSo in conclusion, BXP is clearly gaining momentum in both leasing and new investment activity due to more favorable market conditions and our strategy of commitment to both our clients and the premier workplace segment of the office industry, our access to public and private debt and equity capital markets and a leading market presence in our core cities. We will build on this momentum in the constructive environment for our business to lay the foundation for additional growth in the years ahead.\nLet me turn over our report to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So as Owen said, BXP's regional leasing teams had an outstanding fourth quarter and we greatly exceeded our 2024 baseline leasing expectation of 3.5 million square feet. We did a significant amount of future year exploration leasing during the fourth quarter, which followed a pattern that we set over the last 12 months. This has had the effect of dramatically reducing our 2026 and 2027 expirations.\nDuring the last 15 months, our 2026 expirations were cut by more than 1.5 million square feet. So as of 12/31/24, 2026 expirations sit at 1.86 million square feet, 3.8% portfolio and 2027 sits at 2.2 million square feet, 4.4% of the portfolio. And the largest expiration we have in 2026 is 134,000 square feet, and the largest expiration we have in 2027 is 143,000 square feet.\nWe are today in renewal or replacement client discussions on more than 500,000 square feet of the 2026 expiration. '26 and '27 will be exceptionally low rollover years for BXP. Why am I emphasizing this? Because if we continue to lease 2 million to 3 million square feet of vacancy and expiring space in '26 and '27, there will be a material improvement in our occupancy. 490,000 square feet is 100 basis points. Mike thought I should just stop right there today, but I'm going to keep going.\nOur in-service properties finished the year at 87.5% occupancy, a 50 basis point increase from last quarter and slightly ahead of the estimate we provided on our last call. Remember, our occupancy reflects the square footage of space where we are recognizing GAAP revenue. Our leased square footage includes the addition of any spaces that have been leased but have yet to commence GAAP revenue. At the end of the fourth quarter, we were 89.4% leased.\nOur focus is on lease square footage since it captures all of our future revenue and eliminates the variability of the timing of completion of tenant improvements, which governs GAAP revenue recognition and occupancy. We start '25 with our lease square footage, as I said, at 89.4%. We've just completed our bottom-up leasing projections, which emanate from the regions, little help from me as well. And the goal for our in-service and 2025 development deliveries is just over 4 million square feet. So that's our goal for '24 -- excuse me, '25.\nIn '24, we completed leasing on about 1.5 million square feet of vacant space. Our '25 estimate includes the execution of about 2 million square feet of currently vacant space and 1.3 million square feet of leasing on known '25 move-outs and 2025 expirations, where we believe we will be successfully renewing our clients. The remainder of the leasing will be on future year expirations, the 500,000 square feet I talked about earlier.\nOur current pool of leases in negotiation is about 1 million square feet. It covers 280,000 square feet of currently vacant space, [ 325,000 ] square feet of '25 expirations, 75,000 square feet of '25 renewals, with the remaining transactions involving spaces with expirations after '25 and as Owen said, our second lease at 725 12th Street. There's another 1.6 million square feet of active pipeline transactions, which include 550,000 square feet of vacant space. These are deals that are not in LOI stage but where we have good clarity.\nWe're off to a good start in '25. So we have [ 3.1 million ] square feet of contractual expirations in '25. If we achieve our budget of 2.3 million square feet of leasing of vacant and '25 expiring space square footage, our net lease pickup would be about 40 basis points. The one adjustment to this number will be the impacts from changes to the portfolio, which will cause some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations but will even out by the end of 2025. Right now, we expect to take about 825,000 square feet of space out of service, which is currently 62% leased and we're adding our 3 developments, 651 Gateway, [ Reston Block B ] and 360 Park Avenue South, which will all be in the in-service portfolio by the end of the year, and they are currently 23% leased. I guarantee it will be a lot higher before we get to the end of the year, though.\nIn 25, we're taking a few suburban office assets out of service. This follows the path we took in '24. We are taking action where we have higher and better use for our assets. There's pent-up demand for residential development in acknowledgment by local governments that affordable housing is a critical component to a successful economy and development economics that can actually work for [indiscernible] frame construction today. This is leading to a change in attitude towards the permitting of additional housing in some of our communities. We have been working in many of our markets for more than 25 years and have established constructive relationships in these towns and counties. We are working with the local communities to rezone commercial office to for rent and/or for-sale housing.\n17 Hartwell Avenue, as Owen said, is the first example of this. This is a building in Lexington that we took out of service in '24 and where we have received the entitlements for a 312-unit projects in late December. We expect to be under development in early '25. We have also entitled a site in Shady Grove, Maryland for townhouses and have executed an agreement to sell the first space to a townhome developer. We've done the same thing in Herndon, Virginia, where we have rezoned land holding 2 existing office buildings for a 359-unit rental projects and a townhouse development. And we have already executed an agreement to sell the townhouse development sites. This is what we expect to accomplish with the buildings that we are taking out of service in '25.\nOur office markets have either stabilized or are improving. Sublet additions have tailed off, leasing activity has picked up in every market and the negative absorption spigot appears to have stocked in Boston, San Francisco, Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia following what we have already seen in Midtown Manhattan over the last year. Our 2 largest property concentrations, the Back Bay of Boston and Midtown Manhattan continued to be the strongest markets in our portfolio. Availability is sparse, rents are increasing and concessions remain constant.\nWhile there's no meaningful job growth in office-using jobs across the U.S. economy, the pace of job reductions has slowed. There are still technology companies that are reducing headcount, but there are others that are short of space and increasing their footprints. We are witnessing space utilization growth in pockets of industries, though they vary by market.\nTake the legal industry as a case in point. There are law firms in New York and Boston that are expanding, while at the same time, law firms in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco continue to reduce but upgrade their footprints. The improvement in business sentiment, the anticipation of deal activity and a more robust capital raising environment are improving the confidence of our existing and potential customers. When our clients are confident, they are more constructive on making long-term real estate commitments.\nWhile we don't think that '25 is going to be characterized by a dramatic pickup in market leasing absorption, we are certainly on the right track. And our data on premier space illustrates the activity continues to migrate to the best assets.\nAs Owen said, there's no better example of this than the transaction that he described at 725 12th. When we began our pursuit of this opportunity, we identified 8 buildings defined as Class A premier by the brokerage community in D.C., including one new development under construction that could accommodate a 150,000 square foot client. Were they trophy? Do they have ability at the top of the building or are they amenity-rich? Well, none of these buildings were deemed to be acceptable by our clients. And in order to bridge the delivery of the new development, the client also executed a short-term extension to the 500 North Capitol, a JV asset owned by BXP, rather than relocate when their existing lease expired to the existing inventory in the market. The bifurcation is real.\nBXP's activity for the fourth quarter was not dominated by any region. We completed 680,000 square feet in Boston, 577 in New York, 571 on the West Coast and 494,000 square feet in D.C. 320,000 square feet was on currently vacant space, 626,000 involved '24 and '25 expirations, and 1.2 million involved lease extensions for the space that we were scheduled to expire post 2026. 152,000 square feet was for the new development at 725 12th. The activity includes about 312,000 square feet of leasing on existing vacant space.\nAcross the portfolio, the deals were executed this quarter had a mark down -- excuse me, of about 5%, with a 3% increase in Boston, a 5% decrease in New York, a 10% decrease in D.C. and a 14% decrease on the West Coast, pretty consistent with what you saw in our supplemental for the leases that hit revenue this quarter.\nThe bifurcation of client demand between the East Coast and the West Coast continues to exist, and there are actions of the clients in these respective markets that are also different. There was little large block availability in the Back Bay of Boston or in the Park Avenue submarket in New York. The lease extensions we completed with Ropes & Gray at the Prudential Center this quarter begins in 2031. You may recall that we did an early extension with Bain Capital earlier this year and another was [ MFS ] at 111 Huntington Avenue in '23. At the moment, the rents necessary to justify new construction in Boston are considerably higher than the rents embedded in extensions. Our large clients recognize that they want to remain in the Back Bay long term, there are a few alternatives to remaining in place.\nThis quarter, we did 2 other larger renewals in Boston, one in 200 Clarendon and the other at Atlantic Wharf. These clients had the options to go to a vacant space in the greater CBD market, but that would have meant significant changes in quality and location. Our Boston CBD portfolio availability is as tight as it has ever been. We do have some work to do, however, in our Urban Edge portfolio, which is where we have our largest concentration of vacant space, large known expirations and life science availability. These markets are focused on traditional technology and life science clients, life science tenant clients, and that demand growth continues to be weak.\nTraditional life science demand is weaker than office demand. We are in discussions with a few life science companies that are looking exclusively for office space as they focus their capital on acquiring derisked products that are in trials rather than pure drug discovery and therefore, don't need lab infrastructure. There is considerable lab sublease space available and the economics of these offerings make it very difficult for new developments with [ Shell Lab ] to compete even if we provide a significant tenant improvement allowance.\nOur availability in Midtown Manhattan is almost none, but we have a concentration in Midtown South. We have 350,000 square feet of availability at 200 Fifth Avenue where we are in lease negotiations with a nontechnology client for 244,000 square feet. At 360 Park Avenue South, demand is picking up, and there has been some improvement in small tech tenant inquiry. But overall tech demand in '25 is still less than 40% of what it was pre-COVID. We are in lease with another single-floor tenant at 360 Park Avenue South.\nDuring the quarter, we leased about 200,000 square feet to financial firms in the Park Avenue submarket at the General Motors Building, 599 Lexington and at 510 Madison Avenue. Each of these clients experienced growth in their footprint. There's no question that the activity we have seen at 599 Lexington is a direct result of the lack of availability on Park Avenue.\nOur largest Midtown opportunity in '25 is at 510 Madison. We are finishing it up an amenity upgrade and have about 100,000 square feet of availability on 500,000 square foot floors. The big news is that the small floor leasing market this quarter was made by CBRE who took multiple small floors at [ Lever House ] earlier this month at rents that position our offering at 510 Madison as a great value in the market. There is a sparse selection of large block space availability in the Park Avenue area, which portends well for our ability to [indiscernible] to get a commitment at 343 Madison where the rents necessary to support new construction are only a slight premium to current market rents and we're leasing at rents that will be starting in 2029 and 2030.\nThe leasing excitement on the West Coast in '24 continues to be growth from AI organizations in the city of San Francisco. At this point, we're not sure what defines an AI company since it seems that even established technology companies are describing their proprietary large language model, computing power and storage of data and there are a number of organizations that are working on industry-specific solutions that rely on new training models. The critical point is that the technology ecosystem in the city of San Francisco and the Peninsula is where the bulk of these businesses are operating and growing.\nIn addition, the cost of office real estate is significantly cheaper. The cost of housing is cheaper and there is more available talent than there has been in the last decade in the Bay Area. Our largest availability in our CBD portfolio wide is in San Francisco. Many of our traditional office users have continued to rationalize their space in the city, which has led to a little, if any, growth in the traditional San Francisco CBD market.\n[indiscernible] is just weeks into his new job, and one of his priorities is bringing workers and shoppers and visitors back to the CBD, [ view ] spaces in short supply but spaces the lower sections of buildings is widely available and very competitive. We completed a new amenity center at Embarcadero Center in December and are now focused on increasing occupancy there and at 680 Folsom Street where we also have a large block and are finishing up a new amenity offering as well.\nBefore I hand the call over to Mike to discuss '25 earnings guidance, I want to reiterate my comments at the top of my remarks. We accomplished a lot of leasing and a lot of early new [ rules ] in '24. We expect '25 will be a year of modest lease square footage increases as we focus on leasing vacant space and known expirations. When we get to '26 and '27, there is going to be very little exploration headwinds. If we lease at a pace anything like '24 and what we hope to accomplish in '25, we will see our lease percentage accelerate.\nMike, it's time to talk about the quarter and guidance for '25.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nExcellent. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So this morning, I plan to cover the details of our fourth quarter and full year '24 performance. And I'm going to spend most of my time describing our '25 initial earnings guidance that was included in our press release with additional details in our supplemental financial package.\nFor 2024, we reported total consolidated revenues of $3.4 billion and full year FFO of $1.25 billion or $7.10 per share. We continue to grow our portfolio and saw revenue increase by 4% in 2024, primarily from bringing new developments into service.\nOur fourth quarter FFO of $1.79 per share was in line with the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter and our portfolio performed consistent with our expectations.\nAs Doug mentioned, our occupancy climbed this quarter by 50 basis points to 87.5%. Our premier workplace CBD buildings that contribute nearly 90% of the company's revenues continued to outperform and are 90.9% occupied and 92.8% leased. Our CBD occupancy improved by 80 basis points in the fourth quarter with positive absorption in Boston, New York City and Seattle.\nWe also reported 2024 full year AFFO, which we refer to as FAD in our supplemental, of $894 million which exceeds our dividend payout by over $200 million.\nWhile not impacting our FFO, we recorded noncash impairment charges totaling $341 million this quarter related to 3 of our unconsolidated joint ventures. The charges all relate to assets located on the West Coast and include our interest in Colorado Center, Gateway Commons and Safeco Plaza.\nWith that, I will turn to our 2025 guidance. On a high level, our 2025 guidance can be summarized as follows: growth from a full year contribution of development deliveries, higher fee income, and relatively flat 2025 same-property portfolio NOI compared to 2024. These items will be offset by lower termination income, lower interest income from utilizing our cash balances to pay off debt and fund our developments and a loss of NOI from taking buildings out of service for future development.\nI'll start with the growth from our development activities. In 2024, we delivered 2 fully leased properties, 300 Binney Street in Cambridge and DICK's House of Sport at the Prudential Center in Boston.\nWe also delivered Skymark, our multifamily project in Reston that is currently in lease-up and 54% leased today. As Owen mentioned, it's exceeding our expectations on both absorption pace and rental rates.\nOur life science deliveries at 651 Gateway in South San Francisco and 103 and 180 CityPoint in Waltham continue to be in lease-up with minimal projected contribution to our earnings in 2025. 651 Gateway will be delivered into service and we will cease interest capitalization in the first quarter of 2025.\nAnd lastly, our 360 Park Avenue South development in Midtown South opened in late 2024. We have 4 floors occupied and are seeing a meaningful pickup in leasing activity. We will complete incremental leasing in 2025, but the revenue commencement will likely be either late in the year or in 2026. We expect the NOI for 360 Park will have significant growth in 2026 as we gain occupancy from new leasing. 360 Park will be delivered into service and we will cease interest capitalization in the third quarter of 2025. Overall, the incremental contribution to our NOI from our developments in 2025 is expected to be $19 million to $22 million.\nOur same-property portfolio is the largest contributor to our earnings, and generated approximately $1.9 billion of NOI in 2024, including our share of joint ventures. Doug described in detail our lease expirations over the next 12 months and the expectation that we will grow our leased percentage as we execute our leasing plan for 2025.\nAs you know, there is a lag between signing a lease, achieving occupancy and generating GAAP revenue. In the first half of 2025, we have several larger expirations that will impact our occupancy. These include 350,000 square feet at 200 Fifth where, as Doug described, we're negotiating a replacement lease for occupancy in 2026.\nWe also have 480,000 square feet in 2 uncovered expirations in suburban Boston. This totals 1.6% of the portfolio and is expected to result in our occupancy declining slightly in the first 6 months of 2025. We do have signed leases totaling 860,000 square feet that will take occupancy spread relatively evenly across 2025.\nOur leasing plan results in our occupancy remaining relatively stable and averaging 86.5% to 88% during the year. Our same-property NOI is also anticipated to be stable, and we project '25 same-property NOI growth of negative 1% to positive 0.5% from 2024. Our 2025 same-property NOI on a cash basis will actually increase by up to 1.5% from 2024 as we have free rent burning up that will increase our cash flow from the portfolio.\nTurning to our fee income, which we expect to be higher in 2025 from earning leasing commissions on our joint venture properties. This is primarily a 200 Fifth and 360 Park Avenue South in New York City, and will also generate incremental construction management fees as we construct the tenant improvements for AstraZeneca and 290 Binney Street in Cambridge.\nOur projection for fee income in 2025 is $32 million to $38 million, an increase of $7 million at the midpoint from 2024. Our termination income was higher than typical in 2024 and totaled $16 million or $0.09 per share. In 2025, we're projecting a more normalized $4 million to $8 million of termination income. So this results in a $10 million projected revenue decline in 2025 at the midpoint of our guidance.\nAs we described on our call last quarter, we project our net interest expense will be higher in 2025 as we will be carrying lower cash balances, resulting in lower interest income. At year-end, we reported cash balances of $1.3 billion. At the beginning of January, we utilized $850 million of available cash to pay off an expiring senior unsecured note. We are also forecasting approximately $700 million of development spend in 2025. Overall, we project our average cash balance will be $800 million lower on average in 2025, reducing our interest income by approximately $35 million year-over-year.\nOur consolidated interest expense is expected to be relatively flat in 2025 versus '24 assuming no Fed rate cuts. And with 12% of our debt portfolio floating, we will benefit as the Fed cuts rates this year and that is reflected in the low end of our interest expense guidance. Overall, we project net interest expense of $610 million to $625 million in 2025, an increase of $33 million from 2024 at the midpoint.\nLastly and as I described last quarter, we have taken Reston Corporate Center -- the buildings at Reston Corporate Center out of service upon the expiration of the full building lease on 12/31/24. This is the location for the next phase of our highly successful Reston Town Center development that we anticipate will encompass 2.3 million square feet of new mixed-use development including both multifamily and commercial space. The ability to increase the density by nearly 10x on this site will create significant future value and earnings over time. The buildings generated $11 million or $0.06 per share of NOI in 2024 that we will lose in 2025.\nSo to sum all this up, our initial guidance range for 2025 FFO is $6.77 to $6.95 per share, representing a decline of 2% at the high end from 2024. At the midpoint, the decline is comprised of higher net interest expense of $0.20, lower same-property NOI of $0.03, lower termination income of $0.06, higher G&A of $0.04 and the loss of $0.06 from pulling Reston Corporate Center out of service. These are projected to be partially offset by higher NOI from our developments of $0.11 and higher fee income of $0.04.\nAgain, the modest decline in 2025 FFO is primarily due to lower interest income from lower cash balances as we fund our development pipeline that will generate future growth, pulling buildings out of service for future development as well as a decline in noncore termination income. We have not included any incremental acquisition activity in our guidance, though we are actively looking for opportunities.\nLooking forward to 2026, we see an opportunity to demonstrate meaningful growth in our portfolio. We have very limited lease expirations and project positive absorption in the in-service portfolio and we have embedded growth opportunity in the development pipeline through the delivery of a fully leased 290 Binney Street in mid-2026 and the lease-up of the available space in our 2024 and 2025 development deliveries. You can hear about all of this and more at our [ triannual ] Investor Conference we will hold this fall on September 9 in New York City. The conference will be a deep dive into our portfolio and our future outlook and will include presentations from our regional teams, offering an opportunity for investors to see the depth of our company. We will send out save the date soon, and we look forward to hosting all of you.\nThat completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the lines for questions?"

Welcome to BXP's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference call over to your first speaker, Helen Han, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BXP's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

BXP's performance in the second quarter once again demonstrated the relative market strength of the premier workplace segment of the commercial office industry as well as BXP's strength and execution.\nOur FFO per share was $0.06 above our forecast and $0.05 above market consensus for the second quarter. Further, we raised the midpoint of our FFO per share guidance for 2024 by $0.08. We completed over 1.3 million square feet of leasing which is 41% greater than the second quarter of 2023 and close to our 10-year average leasing volume for the second quarter. As our leasing volume continues to escalate exceeding current lease expirations, we expect our occupancy will increase over time. Weighted average lease term on leases signed this past quarter remained long at 9 years.\nOn sustainability this past quarter, we released our 2023 Sustainability & Impact Report, hosted our third annual Sustainability & Impact Investor Update and were recognized by Time Magazine as one of the world's most sustainable companies, ranking #1 in the U.S. among property owners. Delivering sustainable real estate solutions is increasingly important to our clients as well as the communities where we operate, and decreases our cost of capital given the growing number of ESG investors interested in our debt and equity securities.\nMoving to macro market conditions. We continue to experience market tailwinds for the 2 most important external forces impacting BXP's performance, interest rates and corporate earnings growth. The U.S. inflation report released on July 11 reflected a 3% inflation rate for June, lower than expectations, sparking new forecasts of accelerated interest rate cuts by the Fed as well as lower market yields for the 10-year U.S. Treasury. Lower interest rates are obviously favorable for real estate and BXP's valuation and for broader corporate earnings growth, the second important external factor driving BXP's performance.\nAfter remaining flat for all of 2023, S&P 500 earnings growth was 6.6% in the first quarter of this year and is expected to be around 9% for the second quarter.\nAs mentioned repeatedly, companies with earnings growth are much more likely to invest, to hire and to lease additional space as demonstrated in our growing leasing volumes this year. Premier workplaces, defined as the highest quality 6.5% of buildings, representing 13.1% of total space in our 5 CBD markets continue to materially outperform the broader market. Direct vacancy for premier workplaces is 13% versus 18.5% for the broader market. Likewise, net absorption for premier workplaces has been a positive 6.9 million square feet over the last 3 years versus a negative 22.8 million square feet for the broader market.\nAsking rents for premier workplaces are 51% higher than the broader market, a consistent gap from prior quarters. This outperformance is evident in BXP's portfolio. [ Where ] just under 90% of our NOI comes from assets located in CBDs that are predominantly premier workplaces. These CBD assets are 90.4% occupied and 92.2% leased as of the end of the second quarter. We are also experiencing moderate but steady increases in workers returning to the office based on the turnstile data we capture for roughly half of our 54 million square foot portfolio. Corporations continue to push for increased office attendance, including Salesforce, who recently announced their new policy shift from primarily flexible work to mandatory office attendance for most employees of 3 to 5 days per week depending on job function.\nRegarding the real estate private equity capital markets, office sales volume in the second quarter continued to be muted at $6.9 billion and has ranged from $6.2 billion to $9.1 billion for the last 6 quarters, well below volumes achieved before the Fed started raising interest rates in 2022. Completed transaction activity for premier workplaces has been very limited, though increasingly, owners are testing the market to understand pricing.\nMoving to BXP's capital allocation activities. We remain active in pursuing acquisitions from owners and lenders but as mentioned, have seen limited opportunities in the premier workplace segment. We are in active negotiations for the disposition of 4 land positions, which, if successful, would generate approximately $150 million of proceeds, half of which could be realized this year.\nFor our development pipeline, we delivered into service the 118,000 square foot Dick's House of Sport on Boylston Street at the Prudential Center in Boston, fully leased at a strong yield. On July 12, we opened Skymark, our 508-unit luxury residential tower development at Reston Town Center. We've already leased 21% of the units ahead of schedule and rents are also modestly above projections. We continue to push forward with several residential projects primarily on land we control that are being entitled and designed for which we intend to raise JV equity capital.\nDXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 10 office lab retail and residential projects underway as of the end of the second quarter. These projects aggregate approximately 3.1 million square feet and $2.3 billion of BXP investment with $1.2 billion remaining to be funded and will contribute to BXP's external FFO per share growth over time.\nThe market segment for the broad office asset class remains challenging. BXP continues to leverage its key strengths, which are: our commitment to premier workplaces and our clients as many competitors disinvest in the office sector; a strong balance sheet with ready access to capital [ and ] the secured and unsecured debt in private equity markets; and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional development acquisitions and dispositions.\nSo in conclusion, BXP continues to display resilience with a growing leasing pipeline as well as stability in FFO per share and dividend level, and is well positioned to continue to gain market share in both assets and clients during this time of market dislocation for the office sector. Expectations for lower interest rates and stronger corporate earnings growth will also provide tailwinds for our renewed growth over time.\nSo now, Doug, I'd like to wish you a happy birthday. And I'll turn the call over, and you can talk about our strong leasing activity.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen, I really enjoy celebrating my birthday with all of you on the call every 2 years, one of the highlights. So as we described during our NAREIT June meetings and the webcast that we did, the trend line of BXP's leasing activity in the second quarter of '24 picked up materially relative to what we executed in the first quarter and what we discussed on our last call, all really good stuff.\nAs of June 30, we've completed 2.2 million square feet of leasing for '24. When we spoke to you during our May call, we stated our pipeline of leases under negotiation at that time, May 1, was 875,000 square feet. And as Owen highlighted, we signed leases for 1.32 million square feet between April 1 and June 30, a lot more. And our active pipeline of leases under documentation today has grown to 1.39 million square feet. So if we complete this pool of transactions, we will have leased 3.59 million square feet of space, exclusive of our leases and documentation. We have an additional set of transactions under discussion totaling about 850,000 square feet. So if we execute 50% of those transactions, we will more than achieve our leasing guidance of 4 million square feet for the year.\nThis quarter, we completed 73 transactions, 37 lease renewals for 830,000 square feet, 36 new leases encompassing 500,000 square feet. 12 clients expanded into 228,000 square feet of additional square footage, while we had 4 contractions totaling 63,000 square feet. 45% of our absorption was growth from our existing client pool. As a point of comparison, last quarter, we completed 61 transactions with 29 renewals, encompassing about 400,000 square feet and 32 leases for 494,000 square feet, and we had only 3 expansions for 18,000 square feet, and we had 4 contractions totaling 44,000 square feet. So again, really big improvements.\nQ2 activity was concentrated in our East Coast markets with 445,000 square feet in New York, 343,000 square feet in Boston and 351,000 square feet in Northern Virginia. These 3 markets made up 1.14 million square feet or 86% of the activity. Our West Coast activity was almost exclusively in San Francisco with 146,000 square feet. The majority of our client expansion came from Manhattan this quarter. The only significant contraction in the portfolio came from a tech company downsizing in Reston.\nWe had 3 transactions over 100,000 square feet, one each in Boston, New York and Reston. Expansions or new clients made up 42% of the activity in New York, 40% in Boston, 37% on the West Coast and 16% in D.C. As reported in our supplemental, the mark-to-market of leases that commenced this quarter, which is about a 375,000 square foot base, was up 6% and transaction costs averaged $11 per square foot per year. The overall mark-to-market of the [ restarting ] cash rent on leases executed this quarter, which was a 1.15 million square feet pool relative to the previous in-place cash rent was about flat. The starting rents on leases we signed during the second quarter were up about 8% in Boston, really flat in New York, down 6% in D.C. and down 7% on the West Coast.\nNow I want to spend a minute on our occupancy change during the quarter, which seemed to have been a focus of many of the analyst reports that we saw this morning and last night. As we stated in February and May, we have 2 large known expirations, one in April, 200,000 square feet at [ 680 ] Folsom, which is in the second quarter figures and one in July, 200,000 square feet at Times Square Tower. That's a JV asset, so our percentage share is 110, but we report the 200.\nThis quarter, we also vacated 148,000 square feet of occupied but non-revenue-producing spaces. What do I mean? Well, we had some tenants in default where we had stopped recognizing revenue yet they were still in possession and we were in legal proceedings to vacate the space. In addition, we took back 60,000 square feet from WeWork at Dock 72, but there, the absolute rent that we were receiving remains the same. It's just on a lower square footage.\nFinally, we terminated a 33,000 square foot lease in Waltham that was simultaneously released but won't be delivered into next quarter. Those movements account for 92% of the reduction in our occupancy in the second quarter from the first quarter.\nAs of June 30, we have approximately one million square feet of signed leases that have not commenced. Hence, the 200 basis points difference between occupied space and leased space. In the first quarter, our leasing included 383,000 square feet of vacant space leasing. This quarter, that same vacant space leasing was 362,000 square feet. These leases are all part of our leased square footage percentage. Our pipeline of leases in negotiation includes an additional 635,000 square feet of currently vacant space, which if signed will contribute another 130 basis points to our leased square footage.\nIn addition to the known 200,000 square feet expiration at Times Square Tower in Q3, our 2 Waltham life science developments will be added into our in-service portfolio in the third and fourth quarters, 180 CityPoint and 103 Fourth Avenue, respectively. [ There are ] combined 32% occupied, which will reduce our in-service occupancy. These additions will result in about a 50 basis point reduction at the year-end.\nFor those of you that are focused on the [ next quarter ], we expect us to be lower by about 40 basis points with a recovery in the fourth quarter where most of the leases that have been signed start to commence where we project occupied space to be between 87% and 87.5%, inclusive of the addition to the in-service portfolio. In previous quarters, we have not been including the additions to in-service portfolio, but we're doing that now because it's a quarter away.\nOur leased space will continue to be above 89%. BXP continues to lease space. In Manhattan, almost all of our demand continues to originate from financial institutions, alternative asset managers, professional service organizations and law firms. In many circumstances, these clients are expanding. Concessions are flat and taking market rents have risen double digits in 2024. The sub 8% availability in the Park Avenue submarket is a direct reflection of these users growing and competing for limited blocks of space. In one of our assets, we have 3 tenants that would like more space, and we have no immediate availability.\nWe had more than 130,000 square feet of expansions at the General Motors Building and at 601 Lexington Avenue this quarter. Our strongest tour activity in New York City continues to be in the submarket. At the same time, technology demand across the city continues to be light. We completed a single floor lease at 360 Park Avenue South with a digital media firm this quarter, but Midtown South is a [tech-branded ] submarket in the city, where transactions over 20,000 square feet have been very limited in 2024.\nIn Princeton, we completed 10 transactions totaling 150,000 square feet during the quarter, including an extension and expansion with a foreign pharma company. In the Back Bay and the Financial District of Boston, we completed 195,000 square feet of leasing this quarter. The majority of this activity was in our Back Bay portfolio and the clients were alternative asset managers and professional services firms. The Back Bay continues to outperform the financial district, which continues to have to digest the new construction pipeline.\nOur remaining activity was in our Waltham urban edge portfolio, where we completed just over 110,000 square feet and 90% of those transactions were on either existing or near-term vacancy, not renewals. Here, the demand came from a consumer products company, a homebuilder and a few pharma life science companies with office requirements. [ We've ] execute one 25,000 square foot life science lab lease. The life science lab demand in Greater Boston continues to be lackluster, with tenants displaying a little urgency around any potential new requirements or relocations.\nTo date, this year, there have been 8 nonrenewal lab deals in Waltham, Lexington, Watertown and West Cambridge that didn't involve a sublet. Only one was greater than 25,000 square feet.\nOur Reston portfolio was responsible, as I said, for virtually all of our executed leases this quarter in the D.C. region. Leasing activity and tenant demand growth is coming primarily from 2 industries, cybersecurity and defense contracting. We had just over 30,000 square feet of expansion from existing tenants but we also experienced, as I said, a 50,000 square foot contraction from a traditional tech company. The vibrant residential and retail environment continues to be a natural location for small businesses in the financial services and legal industry as well, and we did do 6 leases at 5,000 square feet or less in the Town Center as well as a handful of retail deals.\nThe District of Columbia office market is becoming more and more bifurcated. The private sector tenant demand is dominated by the legal industry in D.C., but in almost every case law firm renewal or relocations are resulting in smaller requirements which is leading to negative absorption as we have all read and seen. It doesn't look like the government leasing or usage is going to help with this problem. However, with the either existing or near-term high vacancy, there are many buildings with overleveraged capital structures unwilling to provide capital for new transactions, and therefore, they have very little client interest.\nWhen clients do want space, they prefer to be on the top of refurbished, amenity-rich, [ well-capitalized ] buildings. There appears to be limited opportunities in the market that meet these clients' demand so our availability at 2200 Penn and 901 New York Avenue should fare well over the next few quarters. On a comparative basis, the West Coast markets, particularly San Francisco, are seeing more demand in '24 than '23. However, additional sublet availability and technology company lease downsizing upon lease expirations continue to mute the positive demand emanating from the AI organizations that continue to look for space.\nTech growth away from AI has yet to emerge. The San Francisco CBD also continues to act as a financial center of the West Coast with its own set of asset managers, including private equity firms and venture firms, some hedge funds a few specialized fund managers and obviously, their financial and legal advisers. This is the source of the bulk of the transactional activity in the market. And while the brokers correctly report a pickup and tenants in the market. If you look more closely, very little of that demand represents net growth from those tenants.\nOur San Francisco activity continues to center on traditional nontech demands at Embarcadero Center. This quarter, we completed an 80,000 square foot law firm renewal with no change in square footage and 5 smaller deals, all 12,000 square feet or less with new tenants on currently vacant space. We continue to see many of the professional services in law firm continuing to downsize, which is in stark contrast to the activities of those same tenants in New York and Boston. We are seeing a steady flow of potential tenants 12,000 square feet or less, which is about a full floor at our 535 Mission property. But this is in contrast to 680 Folsom whose location is less desirable for non-tech demand and where the potential tech clients continue to have inexpensive furnished sublet options.\nTenant activity is improving in our Mountain View research R&D buildings, where we have about 215,000 square feet of availability and uniquely attractive products. These buildings are designed for companies that are making some sort of device, be it a car sensor, a photovoltaic panel or a medical device. They don't compete with the large multistory office product that has flooded the market. We saw activity come to a halt when the [ SVB ] imploded last year. The entrepreneurial device maker companies still exist, and they are now slowly making capital commitments once again and looking at leasing space.\nThe lab market story in South San Francisco is not dissimilar to Greater Boston. There were only a handful of new leases completed during the first 6 months of the year that didn't involve a renewal or sublease though there have been about 100,000 square feet of new deals completed in the last 30 days.\nOverall, we are experiencing an improving operating environment. Leasing available space is primarily driven by gaining market share from competitive landlords and/or lower quality building, but not net new market demand growth. While the markets need consistent incremental absorption to show a macro recovery, we have started to see pockets of strength where low availability is driving constructive client behavior, the Back Bay of Boston and the Park Avenue submarket of New York are the obvious examples.\nAs clients choose premier properties and sound financial condition operated by [indiscernible] property management team, we will continue to be successful in capturing demand, leasing space and increasing our occupancy.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. Happy birthday.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nSo this morning, I'm going to cover the details of our second quarter performance and the increase to our 2024 full year guidance. So for the second quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.77 per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance from last quarter by $0.06 per share. Our portfolio NOI came in $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance. The majority of this resulted from lower operating expenses in the quarter.\nOur rental revenue was closely aligned with our expectations. And as Doug described, our occupancy decline was anticipated in our guidance as we've covered with you in the last 2 earnings calls. $0.05 of our earnings beat came from a reduction in noncash interest expense that we don't expect to recur and that you should not incorporate in our run rate going forward. The change is due to our reassessing of future earnout payment related to our Skyline multifamily project in Oakland. The reassessment results in the reversal of $9 million of previously accrued noncash interest expense. Our structuring of this deal with the protection of an earnout in lieu of an upfront land purchase is saving us nearly $40 million of projected land payments.\nSo moving to the full year. We're increasing our FFO guidance for 2024 to $7.09 to $7.15 per share. At the midpoint, this equates to $7.12 per share and is an increase of $0.08 per share over the prior guidance midpoint. In addition to the second quarter outperformance, we anticipate $0.02 per share of better projected portfolio NOI in the back half of the year from our in-service portfolio. We've negotiated 3 lease terminations, all in Boston, with payments that will add incremental income in the second half of 2024. Net of lost rental income [ or NOI ] is projected to be higher by approximately $4 million or $0.02 a share.\nThe geography of the expected improvement shows up as an increase in termination income and a modest reduction of same-property NOI. We don't include termination income in our same property guidance, and we guide to it separately. So you will see in our detailed guidance table in our supplemental that our full year '24 termination income guidance is now $14 million to $16 million, up $8 million. Correspondingly, we've reduced our 2024 same-property NOI growth by 25 basis points at the midpoint to a range of negative 1.5% to negative 3% from 2023. If not for the terminations, our same-property performance expectations would have been in line with our prior guidance.\nTo provide a little more detail, most of our termination income comes from terminations we have negotiated to allow us to sign new long-term leases with both expanding and new clients. These transactions are reducing our occupancy by 100,000 square feet temporarily but the impact will be short term as we have new leases coming in after 6 to 12 months of downtime that will cover virtually all of the space. These deals reduce our 2024 occupancy by about 20 basis points and are reflected in our updated occupancy guidance.\nWe've also modified our guidance for net interest expense to incorporate the $0.05 per share of lower interest expense recorded in the second quarter. This results in lower interest expense for the full year and a new guidance range for net interest expense of $578 million to $588 million.\nThe remaining components of our prior guidance have not changed meaningfully, and overall, our earnings performance for 2024 is exceeding our prior expectations.\nI would like to spend a minute on interest rates as there's been no consistency quarter-to-quarter on Fed rate cut projections. Back in January, the Street was projecting 4 to 5 rate cuts starting in the second quarter, then the first quarter data came out and the Street changed that to 0 to 1 cut. And now with more progress on inflation, the Street has reverted back to 3 cuts this year. We have not changed our base model that assumes one 25 basis point cut in December. Should the Fed cut by 25 basis points 3x starting in September, our interest expense will be about $2 million or $0.01 per share lower, which is within our guidance range.\nAnother item that could impact interest expense is the refinancing of our $850 million, 3.35% bond expiring in January 2025. We have access to multiple debt markets, and in general, the bond markets have been improving with tighter spreads and lower treasury rates. We are evaluating the timing of replacement financing, and it is possible we could hit the market this year. We would expect to invest any financing proceeds temporarily in bank deposits that currently earn approximately 5% and then redeem the bond at its expiration. We haven't included the impact of a potential debt transaction in our current guidance.\nSo in conclusion, we're increasing our guidance for FFO to $7.09 to $7.15 per share. This is an $0.08 share increase from the midpoint from our prior guidance. The primary reason is the improvement of $0.05 per share of lower noncash interest expense, $0.05 of higher termination income offset by $0.02 of lower same-property NOI from the lost rental income related to lease terminations.\nThat completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the line for questions?"

Welcome to BXP First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Helen Han, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BXP's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night and furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, BXP has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G.\nIf you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investors section of our website at investors.bxp.com. A webcast of this call will be available for 12 months.\nAt this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although DXP believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be a change.\nFactors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in BXP's filings with the SEC. BXP does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nI'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. We ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. BXP's performance in the first quarter continued to defy the negative market sentiment for the commercial office sector. Our FFO per share was in line with our forecast and market consensus for the first quarter.\nWe completed just under 900,000 square feet of leasing, which is 35% greater than the first quarter of '23 when we leased 660,000 square feet. And this is a more relevant comparison than to the fourth quarter of '23, given elevated leasing activity associated with the quarter at year-end.\nOur weighted average lease term on leases signed this past quarter was also notable at 11.6 years in comparison the leases we signed in 2023 at a weighted average lease term of 8.2 years. Our occupancy remains stable. We closed the previously announced joint venture with Norges at 290 Binney Street, our lab development in Cambridge that is fully leased to AstraZeneca.\nThis transaction mitigates $534 million of development funding for BXP by raising property level equity for the company on attractive terms.\nNow moving to macro market conditions. The 2 most important external factors impacting BXP's performance or long-term interest rates and corporate earnings growth. Lower interest rates would improve our cost of capital, spark more transaction activity and investment opportunities in our sector, reduce the cost of new development and be a tailwind for our clients' earnings growth.\nMuch has been written and forecasted about the trajectory of interest rates, which we believe will come down over time, but we can only speculate on the exact timing. Companies generally do not hire new employees and increase their office space requirements unless their earnings are growing. Over time, the S&P 500 earnings grow around 10% per year. But in 2023, that growth rate was 0%. And in 2022, it was 5%.\nThough the U.S. economy is growing and unemployment remains low, only about 7% of the jobs created are in office-using categories versus a long-term average of over 25%. S&P 500 earnings are projected to grow 11% to 13% per annum over the next 2 years, which should be constructive to BXP's leasing activity.\nMany technology clients, a critically important sector driving space demand post the global financial crisis overcommitted to space during the pandemic and are currently in a digestion process, which has curtailed demand. There are exceptions such as net demand for space from the AI sector in San Francisco.\nOver the long term, we expect many tech companies will experience strong earnings growth and return to requiring more office space. Premier Workplace is defined as the best 6% of buildings representing 13% of total space in our 5 CBD markets continue to materially outperform the broader market. Direct vacancy for Premier Workplaces is 11.2% versus 17.9% for the broader market.\nLikewise, net absorption for premier workplaces has been a positive 7 million square feet over the last 13 quarters versus a negative 30 million square feet for the broader market. Asking rents for premier workplaces are 50% higher than the broader market, a widening gap from prior quarters.\nThis outperformance is evident in BXP's portfolio, where 89% of our NOI comes from assets located in CBDs that are predominantly premier workplaces. These CBD assets are 91% occupied and 93% leased as of the end of the first quarter.\nRegarding the real estate private equity capital markets, office sales volume in the first quarter was down was $8.7 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter and up 32% from a low base 1 year ago. Office sales as a percentage of total commercial real estate transaction volume are continue to rise to over 20%. Transaction activity for premier workplaces was very limited.\nBXP's overriding goal is to leverage our competitive advantages to preserve and build FFO per share over time. The key advantages for BXP are our commitment to the office asset class and our clients as many competitors disinvest in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital in the secured and unsecured debt and private equity markets, and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional development acquisitions and dispositions.\nToday, clients and their advisers are more focused than ever on building quality as well as the financial stability and long-term commitment of their building owners, all strong competitive advantages for BXP.\nLast quarter, I spoke about 3 priorities for BXP in 2024, leasing space, new investments and development. Now Doug will provide more details on leasing. We're off to a good start in the first quarter and see a growing pipeline of opportunities for later this year in 2025.\nOn new investment activity, as you know, we pivoted to offense late last year and early this year through buying joint venture interest in 3 significant in-service assets at attractive prices. We remain in active pursuit of opportunities in our core markets and asset types with primarily 2 types of counterparties. Lenders to highly leveraged assets that require recapitalization and institutional owners seeking to diversify from the office asset plan.\nTo date, there has been limited market transaction activity for high-quality office assets. With lenders, there are fewer premier workplaces that are struggling with leverage. And in the few cases involving premier workplaces, lenders are generally electing borrowers who agreed to invest modestly in their assets.\nInstitutional owners are less interested in selling their highest quality assets, and there remains a material bid-ask spread given assets have, in most cases, not been marked down to market clearing levels. Notwithstanding these current challenges, our expectations are the transactions and our investment activity will increase in coming quarters given the volume of maturing financings, continued markdowns in institutional portfolios and higher for longer interest rates.\nWe also have interest from institutional investors in contesting with us for select opportunities. On development, we commenced our 121 Broadway residential tower in Kendall Center as part of the 1 million square feet of commercial entitlements we received from the city of Cambridge to build 290 Binney Street and a future to-be-determined commercial building.\nComprising 37 stories and 439 units, 121 Broadway will be the tallest building in Cambridge with a state-of-the-art design and amenity setting a new quality standard for residential offerings in the Kendall Square neighborhood.\nEarlier this month, on Boston Marathon weekend, we celebrated the grand opening for and delivered into service the 118,000 square foot [indiscernible] House of Sports store on Boylston Street at Prudential Center. We continue to push forward with several residential projects under control that are being entitled and designed for which we intend to raise joint venture equity capital in the second half of the year.\nFor office development, we have been approached by multiple clients in all our core markets who are interested in occupying new space and anchoring development projects. Given escalated material labor and capital costs, anchor clients must pay a premium to market rent today to justify the launch of a new development project, which is a challenging dynamic exacerbated by the earnings growth issue previously described.\nThough BXP's new office development activity has slowed, there will also be a very limited new office that will also be very limited new office development for the foreseeable future in our core markets, which is favorable for our existing portfolio. As vacancies continue to decline for premier workplaces, rents should rise, which will ultimately bridge the economic gap to justify new development.\nThough we believe buying is a better opportunity than selling in the current market environment, we are interested in raising capital through asset sales if attractive opportunities present themselves. We have a handful of small dispositions defined as under $30 million we are currently exploring.\nBXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 11 office lab retail and residential projects underway as of the end of the first quarter. These projects aggregate approximately 3.2 million square feet and $2.4 billion of BXP investment with $1.3 billion remaining to be funded and are projected to generate attractive yields in the aggregate upon delivery.\nSo to summarize, in the face of strong negative market sentiment, BXP continues to display resilience and stability and occupancy FFO and dividend level. BXP is well positioned to continue to gain market share in both assets and clients during this time of market dislocation. The prospect of lower interest rates and stronger corporate earnings also provides a backdrop for renewed growth.\nLet me turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. I hope what you're going to hear today from me is you're going to be with a pretty constructive perspective on what's going on in our markets and what's going on with our revenue picture and our leasing picture.\nAs we sit here at the end of the first quarter, in spite of the absence of a broad pickup in office-using jobs, BXP continues to lease space. We are leasing space. There's momentum in the economy despite persistent high interest rates.\nOverall earnings growth for our clients and potential clients appears to be improving, and we're pretty optimistic it's going to lead to employment and space additions. And while we are not going to see broad reports of shrinking availability across any market, until there is a pickup in white collar job formation, there are pockets of supply constrained in select submarkets where we are seeing competition for space and improving economics.\nAs reported in our supplemental, the mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter was up 7% and the transaction costs averaged $8.60 per year, which is lower than it's been in the last few quarters. The overall mark-to-market of the starting cash rents on leases executed this quarter relative to the previous in-place cash rent was up about 2%.\nThe starting cash rents on leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space, we're up about 22% in Boston, down 6.5% in Manhattan, down 3% in D.C. and up 8% on the West Coast with San Francisco CBD up 12%. Boston's increased is in large part due to a replacement of a tenant that was in default and had stopped paying.\nAdjusting for the transaction, the Boston numbers would have been up about 6%. As Owen stated, the seasonal trend line of BXP's leasing activity in the first quarter of '24 picked up relative to what we experienced in the first quarter of '23. This quarter, we completed 61 transactions, 32 new leases for 494,000 square feet and 29 renewals encompassing 399,000 square feet. We had 3 expansions totaling 18,000 square feet and 4 contractions totaling 44,000 square feet.\nAs a point of comparison, in the first quarter of '23, there were 57 leases, 29 leases were with new clients for 410,000 and 28 renewals for 250,000. There were 10 expansions and 3 contractions. Last quarter, Fourth quarter of '23, we signed 37 lease renewals and 37 leases with new clients, and there were 8 contractions and 9 expansions among our existing clients.\nThis quarter, new leases encompass 55% of the volume. Activity was across the entire portfolio with 178,000 square feet in Boston, 225,000 square feet in the New York region, 154,000 square feet from the West Coast and D.C. lead attack with 336,000 square feet. And to give you some additional color on this activity, there was only 1 transaction greater than 60,000 square feet due to the 215,000 square feet long-term law firm extension that included a 25,000 square foot contraction in D.C. although that same law firm took an additional 7,600 square feet in our Reston portfolio.\nPrinceton made up 38% of the New York activity this quarter, almost all new clients. New clients made up 90% of the leasing volume in Boston and in New York, while renewals captured 73% of the West Coast and D.C. market.\nEqually important is our pipeline. Post March 31, we have over 875,000 square feet of active leases under negotiation, which we define as a transaction that is being documented by our legal teams and some of these transactions have been completed. This is consistent with the level of in-process leases we've made for the last few quarters.\nThese transactions include a multifloor expansion of an asset manager in our Midtown portfolio in New York, a full floor expansion by a law firm in Midtown, an asset manager taking a full floor 360 Park Avenue South, consumer brand company relocating to a building in Waltham, a multi-floor renewal of a law firm in San Francisco with no change in the premises and a downsizing along with an extension of a technology company in Reston, Virginia and a similar transaction in Waltham.\nWe have seen an uptick in the number of active deals. At the end of the quarter, we had signed leases that had yet to commence on the in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 817,000 square feet, which includes 624,000 square feet that is anticipated to commence in 2024. We also have signed leases with new clients for another 534,000 square feet of currently occupied states. These leases have yet to commence but they are reflected in the reduction of our rollover exposure shown in our supplemental.\nThe strongest user demand continues to come from the asset managers, including private equity venture hedge funds, specialized fund managers and their financial and legal advisers. These organizations are the heart and soul of our New York and our Back Bay activity and are an important driver of our San Francisco CBD demand. In some instances, these clients are growing their teams and capital under management. But in all cases, they want to occupy premier workplaces.\nWe continue to see significantly more client demand in our East Coast portfolio versus the West Coast due to the disproportionate concentration of technology and media content related demand on the West Coast. However, there have been some subtle and encouraging trends across much of the portfolio. Our Back Bay Boston and Park Avenue Centric New York City portfolio continue to have outsized demand relative to our availability.\nWhile concessions are still at elevated levels, we've been able to increase our taking rents and we actually have clients that we cannot accommodate due to a lack of available space in certain buildings.\nIn the last 90 days, there is the strong pickup of client activity in our Urban Edge Waltham portfolio. We have an 80,000 square foot tech client expiring in 2024 with a planted downsize to 16,000 square feet. This quarter, we completed a lease for 45,000 square feet and are in negotiations with 2 other clients, new ones for another 37,000 square feet of that expiration, and the existing client will stay with us but relocate within the building.\nAdditionally, in a different Urban Edge building, we're negotiating a 45,000 square foot lease with an existing subtenant to extend when their prime lease expires in '25. We're negotiating a 25,000 square foot lease with a lab user proportion of our availability on Second Avenue and we're negotiating a 55,000 square foot lease with a nontech company in a different building. None of these transactions more than 220,000 square feet were in our pipeline on 12/31/2023. All of this occurred in the last 90 to 120 days.\nIn the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia, we continue to see more buildings with over leveraged capital structures unwilling to provide capital for new transactions, and therefore, they have very little client interest.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, when the market got wind of our lease extension at 901 New York Avenue and the anticipated enhancements that we are planning, the interest in the available space at New York -- 901 New York accelerated dramatically. Reston continues to house the largest concentration of our Washington regional portfolio. It's the headquarters for VW, [ Batel ], Leidos, SAIC, Peraton, [ Kaki ], Metron, Comscore, Mandiant and the College Board and it's also the home to a number of large technology companies like Microsoft.\nBecause of the environment of the Town Center with 7 days a week food, beverage and shopping and is also a natural location for small businesses in the financial services and legal industries. This quarter, we completed a 58,000 square foot lease with a new technology client at Reston Next that's moving from a toll road building, an expansion for law firm, and we are seeing a pickup in small tenant activity relate to [ '23 ] and as well as large users looking to upgrade their premises.\nThe AI organizations in the city of San Francisco continue to look for additional space, which will continue the positive absorption story. They continue to focus, however, on build and expensive space. And while there is an abundance of available space in the city, there continues to be outsized demand for [ view-spaced ] north of market relative to the available supply.\nWe completed a 35,000 square foot lease with a boutique financial adviser at Embarcadero Center this quarter that was only interested in [ use-spaced ] north of market. We're negotiating 6 transactions with new clients totaling 40,000 square feet as well as an 80,000 square foot renewal with a law firm that's retaining their existing point.\nToday, the Seattle CBD is almost exclusively a lease expiration-driven market, and there has been a material pickup in the level of activity. The number of tenant tours that we have conducted has picked up in the last 2 quarters. We completed a lease with a new client on a 10,000 square-foot prebuilt [ suite ] and are in negotiations with a law firm for a parcel floor and discussions with a technology company for a full floor.\nWest L.A, however, continues to be the market where activity remains light. While Century City is seeing great demand and strong rents as financial and professional services firms head west from the downtown market, those clients are not yet prepared to take space in low-rise buildings in Santa Monica.\nThere continues to be pressure from streaming profitability, industry consolidation and job reduction in the gaming and media space that is impacting overall demand growth in the West L.A. area.\nAs we forecast during our last call, our occupancies declined also slightly from 88.4% to 88.2% during the quarter, with a known expiration of 230,000 square feet in Princeton, where, as I mentioned, we have signed 80,000 square feet of new client deals this quarter that will commence this year.\nWe have 2 additional large lease expirations across the portfolio in '24 that will occur during the second quarter, 200,000 square feet at 680 Folsom in San Francisco and 230,000 square feet at 7 Times Square, where we own 55%. Occupancy will drop in the second quarter and recover as we move into the fourth quarter.\nMike is going to spend some time discussing changes to our interest expense outlook in his remarks. The issue of the day is the level of inflation, and I thought I'd make a few brief comments on how inflation is impacting our business. We are not seeing any deflation in our base building costs as we build -- as we bid potential stick-frame residential the projects Owen was describing earlier, but escalation assumptions are now normalized. No more 8% to 9%.\nThe changes to the building in energy codes, along with the elevated level of interest expense associated with any construction financing, continue to pressure project costs and make new starts very challenging. However, we are seeing costs come down on tenant improvement jobs, which is a reflection of reduced demand on the group of contractors and subcontractors that focus on interiors work who are looking to maintain a consistent book of business.\nNew high-rise tower construction costs are unlikely to deflate in the longer-term interest rate environment and the long-term interest rates remain at the elevated levels, the longer it's going to be before we see market rents approach the levels necessary to rationalize new office building, leasing economics and corresponding new development.\nWe are experiencing an operating environment where leasing available space is primarily driven by gaining market share. That's with the world that we are living in, and we're winning. As clients choose premier properties in sound financial condition, operated by the best property management teams, BXP will continue to be successful in doing just that.\nI'll stop there and turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Doug. I appreciate it. Good morning, everybody. This morning, I plan to cover the details of our first quarter performance and also the updates to our 2024 full year guidance. We've also been active in the debt markets this quarter. So I'm going to start with a summary of some of the changes in our debt structure.\nIn early February, we paid off $700 million of unsecured notes with available cash, that was in line with our plan. We also entered into a $500 million unsecured commercial paper program. This program offers an additional market for us to tap beyond the bank market mortgage and unsecured bond markets that we currently actively utilize.\nWe started issuing under the program last week, and we've raised the full $500 million for terms ranging from overnight to 1 month at a weighted average rate of SOFR plus 25 basis points. The all-in rate, including fees is approximately [ 5.75% ].\nWe've used the proceeds to pay down our term loan from $1.2 billion to $700 million, which will reduce our borrowing cost on $500 million by 75 basis points or about $0.01 per share in 2024. In addition, we increased our corporate line of credit by $185 million to $2 billion. Our banks continue to be strong supporters of BXP even as they evaluate their global commercial real estate exposure and exit certain relationships.\nNow I'd like to turn to our first quarter earnings results. Despite the difficult real estate operating conditions and the stagnant office using job growth statistics, our portfolio is demonstrating strength and stability. As Owen and Doug described, portfolio occupancy has been relatively steady for the past 6 quarters.\nOur revenues continue to grow with top line total revenue up again this quarter by $10 million or 1.3%, and our share of portfolio NOI is also higher, up $6 million or 1.2% from last quarter. High interest rates are our biggest earnings challenge. This quarter, our interest expense increased $7 million. It's important to point out that more than half of this increase was due to higher noncash fair value interest expense, related to below-market debt on our recent acquisitions.\nWe reported funds from operation of $1.73 per share for the quarter that was in line with our guidance for the first quarter and it was equal to our first quarter FFO from 1 year ago, again, demonstrating the stability of our income statement. Portfolio NOI exceeded our expectations by about $0.02 per share. The majority of this is from lower-than-anticipated net operating expenses that we expect will be deferred to later in 2024.\nThis was offset by higher-than-projected net interest expense of $0.02 per share primarily from higher noncash fair value interest expense related to the acquisitions, and we also booked lower-than-projected interest income due to changes in the timing of closing our 290 Binney Street joint venture.\nSo moving to the full year. Since providing our initial 2024 guidance, we finalized the assumptions utilized in valuing the in-place debt and interest rate swaps for our 901 New York Avenue and Santa Monica Business Park acquisitions. For 901 New York Avenue, we increased our assumption for the interest rate on the debt by 70 basis points to 7.7%. And for the interest rate hedge at Santa Monica Business Park, we determined that the change in market value will be amortized through our interest expense for the remaining term of the loan that expires in 2025.\nThese adjustments result in an additional $0.05 per share of noncash fair value interest expense in 2024 relative to the estimate we used when we provided our guidance last quarter. This noncash adjustment impacts our full year guidance and is the primary reason we have reduced our FFO guidance for 2024.\nOther interest expense assumptions have also been impacted by the changing expectations for rate cuts in 2024. Last quarter, we forecasted 4 rate cuts commencing in the second quarter which was actually conservative to market expectations at the time. We've now pushed out any rate cuts to late in 2024. The impact on our floating rate debt is partially offset by the lower cost of our commercial paper program, but overall, we expect $0.02 of dilution from higher short-term interest rates compared to our prior guidance.\nThe operating assumptions for the portfolio occupancy and same-store NOI remain relatively unchanged from our prior forecast. As Doug described, we do expect occupancy to decline slightly this quarter, we did expect occupancy to decline slightly this quarter and in the second quarter before improving in the back half of the year.\nOur assumption for same-property NOI growth of negative 1% to 3% is unchanged. Other modifications to our guidance include reducing our assumption for 2024 G&A expense by $0.01 per share and a modest reduction in our fee income projection. So in summary, we are reducing and narrowing our 2024 full year guidance for FFO to $6.98 to $7.10 per share. This represents a reduction of $0.06 per share at the midpoint from our prior guidance.\nThe primary reason for the reductions are $0.05 of higher noncash fair value interest expense and $0.02 of higher interest expense from higher short-term interest rates, offset by $0.01 of lower G&A expense. The last item I would like to mention is that we published our 2023 sustainability and impact report, and it can be found on our website. The report contains a wealth of information on our sustainability efforts and the progress towards achieving our critical goals of reducing our energy use intensity, carbon emissions and achieving net 0 carbon operations for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.\nWe invite you to join us for our sustainability and impact webcast on May 15. If you have not received an invitation, please reach out to Helen and our Investor Relations team. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the line for questions?"

Welcome to BXP Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, to Helen Han, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BXP's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

We ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit yourself to only one question. If you have an additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. After a brief review of our quarterly and annual performance, I intend to focus my remarks this morning on BXP's significant capital allocation activity over the last quarter, related real estate capital market conditions and key areas of focus for us in 2024.\nThe operating trends I've described in prior quarters, specifically the steady return of workers to their offices, the importance of corporate earnings growth to leasing activity and the outperformance of Premier Workplaces, all remain important and substantially unchanged.\nBXP continued to perform in the fourth quarter as we did throughout 2023, despite withering negative market sentiment for the commercial real estate sector. Our FFO per share was $0.01 above market consensus for the fourth quarter and for all of 2023, was $0.15 above the midpoint of the guidance range we provided 1 year ago.\nWe completed over 1.5 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and 4.2 million square feet of leasing for all of 2023, well above our prior forecast.\nOver the last year, signed leases remain long term over 8 years weighted average and portfolio occupancy remained stable, despite a challenging leasing environment.\nIn 2023, BXP raised over $4 billion in new capital in the public unsecured debt, private secured mortgage and private equity markets. In the fourth quarter alone, we completed a new $600 million mortgage financing, a $750 million asset-specific equity capital raise, both among the largest comparable transactions completed in our sector last year as well as 3 new and highly accretive equity investments, one of which closed in January.\nSo on capital allocation activities and starting with capital raising, last November, BXP announced the sale to Norges Bank Investment Management of a 45% interest in 290 and 300 Binney Street, both life science developments located in the Kendall Square District of Cambridge, leased on a long-term basis to creditworthy clients. 300 Binney is a 236,000 square foot existing office building that is being converted to lab use and scheduled for delivery at the end of this year, and 290 Binney is a 566,000 square foot ground-up development that we expect to deliver in 2026.\nOur partner purchased the assets at a gross valuation of $1.66 billion or $2,050 per square foot and an expected initial cash yield on cost at delivery for both assets of 5.9%.\nBXP will retain a 55% interest in each joint venture and provide development, property management and leasing services.\nNorges has closed its investment in 300 Binney and funded $213 million, and we expect the 290 Binney joint venture will close in the first quarter of this year, which will reduce approximately $534 million of BXP's development funding requirement over time.\nWe are pleased and honored to grow our important relationship with Norges, BXP's largest joint venture partner and one of our largest shareholders.\nUpon completion of this transaction, BXP will have raised just under $750 million of equity capital on attractive terms and reduced our forecast leverage.\nNext, BXP purchased interest in 3 currently owned assets from 2 different joint venture partners, 1 of which closed in early January. These transactions were sparked by anchor client renewals BXP achieved at 2 of the assets, requiring capital for tenant improvements, leasing commissions and building upgrades.\nIn the current environment, these 2 joint venture partners decided they wanted to reduce their exposure to office. We agreed to purchase their interest at attractive and accretive returns and complete the long-term lease extension.\nRegarding the specific deals, 901 New York Avenue is a 548,000 square foot, 83% leased office building located in Washington, D.C. The building is encumbered by a $207 million mortgage, with attractive terms due in 2025.\nIn January, we completed the renewal of the 214,000 square foot anchor client in the building, Finnegan Henderson for 18 years, purchased the 50% interest in the property we didn't own for $10 million and modified the loan to allow for an extension of the maturity date for up to 5 years.\nPricing for the acquisition was $414 per square foot and a 6.4% initial cap rate on an as-is basis, and $516 a square foot with an expected 8.4% cash yield on cost at stabilization in 2027.\nSanta Monica Business Park is a 21 building 1.2 million square foot and 88% leased office complex located adjacent to the Santa Monica Airport. The property is encumbered by a $300 million mortgage due in 2025, and 70% of the park is encumbered by a ground lease, with above-market ground rent and a fee purchase option in 2028.\nWe completed a 467,000 square foot lease renewal for Snap, the anchor client in the park for 10 years, and purchased the 45% interest in the asset we didn't own for $38 million, which represents pricing of $395 per square foot and a 9% initial cap rate on a fee simple basis based on market assumptions for land value.\nLastly, in conjunction with the Santa Monica Business Park buyout, BXP purchased a 29% interest in 360 Park Avenue South for $1, bringing our ownership interest in the asset to 71%. 360 Park Avenue South is a 450,000 square foot office building that BXP is fully redeveloping in Midtown South and is encumbered by a $220 million mortgage.\nPurchased 360 Park Avenue South using OP units priced at $111 per share in 2021 and subsequently introduced 2 financial joint venture partners, who secured their interest by funding the required redevelopment capital expenditures over time.\nAt the time of closing, the selling joint venture partner had funded $71 million, and BXP assumed their remaining $46 million projected funding obligation. This investment represents pricing projected at building stabilization in 2026 of $754 per square foot and a 7.2% initial yield on cost.\nSo in summary, for these 3 acquisitions, BXP invested only $48 million upfront and materially increased its ownership position in 3 high-quality assets we understand well. We expect to receive projected total returns that will be well in excess of the cost of the equity capital we've raised from the Binney Street joint ventures, and project FFO per share accretion from the investments of approximately $0.14 in 2024.\nRegarding the broader private equity capital markets, office sales volume picked up in the fourth quarter to $14.4 billion, up 126% from the prior quarter and up 14% from a year ago.\nInterestingly, office sales went from 12% of total real estate transaction volume in the third quarter, to over 27% last quarter. Though U.S. lenders continue to reduce exposure to office real estate, making secured financing extremely difficult to arrange, there is more distressed asset restructuring activity, more capitulation on pricing by owners and more confidence by buyers in their forecast cost of capital.\nThe Fed's announced late last year that interest rate hikes are likely over and cuts could start to occur in 2024, is very favorable for real estate capital market conditions.\nThere were a few comparable premier workplace transactions completed last quarter other than our Binney Street joint ventures. [ 1 Westside ] and West Side 2 in West L.A. sold for $700 million or over $1,000 a square foot, and a 6% cap rate to a user, but the economics are influenced by a lease buyout from the existing anchor tenant.\nNow turning to BXP's priorities for 2024. Our overriding goal is to leverage our competitive advantages to preserve and build FFO per share over time.\nToday, the key advantages for BXP are our commitment to the office asset class and our clients, as many competitors disinvest in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital and the unsecured debt and private equity markets and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional acquisitions and development.\nOur primary focus for 2024 will be leasing, preserving and building over time our occupancy in addressing near and, in some cases, medium-term lease expirations, with our portfolio 88% occupied, leasing vacant space is our lead capital-intensive way to build back FFO. Doug will focus his comments on leasing markets and our expectations for leasing this year.\nA second focus for 2024 is new investment activity. Many office owners are facing existential risks, given slow leasing and limited secured financing, and many institutional owners want to diversify away from the office asset class.\nWe said last quarter we intended to shift to offense on capital deployment, and this has started, given the 3 new investments I described. There are and will be significant additional investment opportunities available from both lenders and owners of property. Our focus will remain in our core markets on premier workplaces, life science assets and residential development.\nDuring the last market downturn caused by the global financial crisis, BXP was able to acquire premier workplaces such as the GM building, 200 Clarendon Street, 100 Federal Street and 510 Madison, all at attractive prices at the time.\nA third area of focus for us this year will be new development. We have 2 possibly 3 residential development opportunities under control that are being entitled and designed and we intend to raise joint venture equity capital for these projects in the second half of the year. We also continue to have dialogue with anchor clients for sites under control in Manhattan, though the discussions are in early phases and the outcomes are much less certain.\nSignificant pre-leasing, higher expected development yields and joint venture equity would be required to launch any new premier workplace developments. We also have several specific sites and buildings that we are trying to reentitle in advance for near-term viable use based on market conditions.\nBXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 10 office, lab, retail and residential projects underway. These projects aggregate approximately 2.7 million square feet and $2.4 billion of BXP investment, with $750 million remaining to be funded after closing the 290 Binney Street joint venture, and are projected to generate attractive yields in the aggregate upon delivery.\nWe will be opportunistic with dispositions in 2024. Market conditions are generally unfavorable for selling assets at attractive prices, but we are interested in raising capital through asset sales if favorable opportunities present themselves.\nTo summarize, in the face of strong negative market sentiment, BXP executed well in 2023, leasing over 4 million square feet of space, raising over $4 billion of capital and launching 2 large-scale fully pre-leased life science developments. We displayed resilience with stable occupancy and a stable dividend, and our FFO per share is higher today than it was before the pandemic started in 2020.\nSo we start the year with continued challenges in the leasing market, BXP is well positioned to gain market share in both assets and clients during this time of market dislocation.\nAs a last closing remark, today represents a BXP milestone. This will be Bob Pester's last earnings call as he is retiring from BXP next month, after more than 25 years of service. Our San Francisco region grew significantly under Bob's capable leadership. Thank you very much, Bob. You will be missed by all of us at BXP.\nOver to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. After a moment of silence to Bob, I'm going to start.\nIn early 2023, we established our baseline leasing expectations for our portfolio of about 3 million square feet in flat occupancy. As Owen commented, we ended the year with 4.2 million square feet, and the fourth quarter included our 467,000 square foot early renewal with Snap at Santa Monica Business Park.\nWe executed about 500,000 square feet more than we expected in 2023, and it was primarily pulling forward some 2024 transactions. The Snap lease was part of our baseline expectations. And interestingly, it was only 1 of 2 leases in excess of 130,000 square feet that we executed in the portfolio during the year.\nOn 12/31/22, so over -- just over a year ago, our in-service occupancy was 88.6%, and we finished the year, 12/31/23, at 88.4%, essentially flat. Our in-service portfolio is 49 million square feet, so 20 basis points amounts to 98,000 square feet, sort of a rounding era.\nMaintaining portfolio occupancy in the current environment is an accomplishment in its own right. Our large lease expirations in 2024 are 200,000 square feet at 680 Folsom, 230,000 square feet at 7 Times Square, where we own 55% and 230,000 square feet at Carnegie Center, and they all occur in the first half of the year.\nA few comments on WeWork. We are actively engaged in lease modification discussions at our 4 units, Dock 72 in Brooklyn and our 3 sites in San Francisco. Our occupancy expectations assume we reach agreements that result in a smaller overall footprint and a reduction to the $33 million of rent they are currently paying. State the obvious that we work emerges from bankruptcy as an operating business that is positioned for success. Mike will discuss the impacts in his same-store property performance for 2024.\nIn '23, the U.S. [indiscernible] markets experienced negative leasing absorption. This included the BXP coastal cities as well as the major Sunbelt and Midwest markets, basically everywhere.\nHow are we thinking about the broad market for '24? If you look at the most recent labor statistics, while the U.S. added 216,000 jobs in December, only 5% were categorized as professional and business services, a.k.a. true office using jobs. The pace of job reductions related to the slowdown in the business economy has slowed, but we continue to see employee layoff announcements across a wide variety of industries, particularly technology.\nThe U.S. economy may not enter a technical recession, but no one should assume that the soft landing is going to stimulate a pickup in office-using employment. Operating in this macro environment, it's hard to envision any dramatic pickup in market leasing absorption in '24.\nWe think overall earnings growth for our clients and potential clients will improve and are optimistic it will lead to employment and space additions just not right away. However, we're not counting on a market recovery can maintain BXP's occupancy. Our leasing, construction and property management teams will lean in on our operating prowess to gain new clients and market share, as clients choose premier properties that are in sound financial conditions for their workplaces. This is how we release known explorations and cover vacant space.\nThe bifurcation of client demand between the East Coast and the West Coast continues to be very wide. San Francisco, West L.A. and Seattle are dependent on technology employers. Traditional technology demand growth continues to be weak and more times than not, renewing technology clients are reducing their lease premises.\nSnap is a case in point. We were successful in executing a forward-starting 10-year lease extension commencing in '26 for 467,000 square feet. However, the transaction does include an early termination of 140,000 square feet at 12/31 24. We can't require clients to lease more space, but we can meet their workplace needs.\nThe leasing excitement on the West Coast in '23 was all about growth from AI organizations in the city of San Francisco, where we saw over 1 million square feet of positive absorption from the industry in the San Francisco CBD in '23. There have been billions of dollars of recent investment in this growing ecosystem, and there are additional clients in the market, but let's acknowledge that these other AI organizations are predominantly seed or early round funded entities, and not at the same scale as an open AI or an anthropic. Their leasing is focused on small footprint built opportunities that are available at significantly discounted terms relative to rents being achieved in Premier. However, all demand is good demand in San Francisco if it translates into absorption.\nThe Seattle CBD continues to have very little active demand other than lease exploration-driven exploration. Our vacancy in Seattle increased by about 100,000 square feet in the second half of '23, due to WeWorks termination, as well as the give back of a floor from a technology company as part of a 5-floor lease extension at Madison Center. Again, technology company, staying with us in our portfolio, but reducing some space.\nThe entertainment industry, union contract settlements are clearly a positive for West L.A., but there continues to be pressure from streaming profitability, industry consolidation and job reduction in the gaming and media space that is impacting overall demand growth.\nThe concentration of the strongest user demand, which will be the source of occupancy pickup, is still broadly speaking, asset managers, including private equity, venture hedge funds and specialized fund managers and their financial and legal advisers. These organizations are the heart and soul of our New York City activity and are an important sector of the Boston and San Francisco CBD demand as well.\nIn some instances, these clients are growing their teams and capital under management, but in many cases, or in all cases, they want to occupy premier workplaces.\nTo illustrate the point, during the quarter, we completed a 25,000 square expansion for an investment bank in Manhattan, a 17,000 square foot lease with a foreign bank that's relocating to one of our other properties in Manhattan, a 10,000 square foot lease with a venture capital firm that's relocating to Embarcadero Center, a 30,000 square foot renewal with a private equity firm at Embarcadero Center, a 74,000 square foot renewal with a law firm in Embarcadero Center and a 15,000 square foot renewal with a long-only manager in Boston. This is where the demand is going to come from.\nOur strongest activity remains in our Midtown Manhattan portfolio, the Back Bay of Boston, the urban cores of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco.\nThis quarter, we executed leases of about 74 transactions. We signed 37 lease renewals, 37 leases with new tenants. There were 8 contractions and 9 expansions among our existing clients, with a net reduction of about 100,000 square feet across those 17 transactions. If you exclude Snap, the number is actually a positive 40,000 square feet. The bulk of the transactions were on the West Coast and the majority of the expansions were in New York City.\nTotal leasing volume this quarter was led by New York at 567,000 square feet, then 468,000 in L.A., 198,000 in San Francisco, 153,000 in Boston and 140,000 square feet in the greater Washington, DC area.\nI would highlight 2 leases that were executed this quarter. First, the Pratt Institute entered into a long-term lease for 63,000 square feet at Dock 72, a real accomplishment for the New York team and DoorDash executed 115,000 square foot lease, including 57,000 square feet of expansion at 200 Fifth Avenue, again, in Manhattan.\nThe mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter, meaning they hit our revenue, was flat as reported in our supplemental. The overall mark-to-market of the starting cash rents on leases executed this quarter, relative to the previous in-place cash rents was down 1.8%. The starting cash rents on leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space were up 7.5% in Boston, flat in New York, down 15% in D.C. and overall on the West Coast down 3%, but the San Francisco CBD was still up 9%.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had signed leases that had yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 750,000 square feet, with 625,000 square feet anticipated to commence in '24.\nOur pipeline of active leases under negotiation sits at just under 1 million square feet today. We have only one transaction currently in negotiation over 70,000 square feet. Comparing this to last quarter, we were at 1.2 million square feet of active discussions at the same time and included the 467,000 square foot Snap deal. We've seen an uptick in the number of active deals, but the size is smaller.\nFor modeling purposes, our 2024 leasing activity is anticipated to be about 3.5 million square feet. As of January 1, 2022, so going back 2 years, our total expirations for '24 totaled 3.5 million square feet.\nOn January 1, 2024, we have 2.7 million square feet of current expected expirations. If we renew 25% of the remaining 2024 expirations or 675,000 square feet, it means we will have renewed about 43% of our expiring square footage, which is sort of in line with our historical averages.\nWe have executed leases on 625,000 square feet of vacant space commencing in '24. So effectively, we need about 1.4 million square feet of leases that we have yet to execute on 2024 vacant space to have a rent commencement during the year to maintain a flat occupancy. That's what is built into the model and into Mike's same-store.\nAs we look forward into the year 2024, we expect to have sticky occupancy defined as 20 basis points [ plus ] to minus 120 basis points negative at the year, and that also factors in some tenant defaults in addition to contractual expirations.\nDuring the year, we will have property additions and subtractions to the portfolio. These are not included in the current portfolio occupancy guidance. As an example, in the fourth quarter of '24, the 2 Waltham Life Science developments will join the in-service portfolio. Their 32% leased and include 300,000 square feet of vacant space that will hit the reported vacancy, that's not part of our projections. We're just looking at our intra-service portfolio as of today.\nAnd as long as we're on the topic of life science leasing, new life science activity across our 2 markets as well as our entire portfolio, continues to be light. During the quarter, we actually had 137,000 square foot known exploration of a life science lease in our Waltham portfolio, which impacted our sequential occupancy and there were no new leases signed in South San Francisco at 651 Gateway.\nIn Waltham, we are seeing some tour activity and have made some proposals, but potential clients don't feel a sense of urgency to make a quick decision.\nBefore Mike discusses our 2024 guidance, I want to make one additional comment around the cost of potential new developments that Owen described. We are seeing more competitive pricing in tenant improvement projects. We've not experienced deflation in material prices or labor, but it's true that there is less work, and we believe that this has resulted in lower pricing from the various subcontractors, who want to maintain a certain size of business.\nAs we think about new base building construction costs, we're hopeful that escalation is no longer part of the conversation and that the same pressures will result in bids that allow us to consider moving forward.\nHowever, there are lots of infrastructure projects as well as institutional construction that is filling a portion of the void from lower commercial construction in our markets.\nCapital costs still haven't received. Construction financing requires a significant capital charge for lenders and obviously results in a higher margin on top of the underlying SOFR. Everyone has a view on the timing and depth of Fed Red rate cuts, but if [ Silver ] goes to 4%, construction financing, if you can arrange it, it's still going to be very expensive and a significant drag on new construction starts.\nCurrent market rents and concessions associated with available existing space don't support office -- new office development. To a potential client that requests a proposal for new construction understands it will involve appropriate lease economics to justify the new capital requirements.\nSo Mike, it's time to talk about the quarter and guidance for '24.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So this morning, I plan to cover the details of the fourth quarter and our full year 2023 performance, but I'm going to spend most of our time describing our 2024 initial earnings guidance that was included in our press release, with additional details in our supplemental financial package.\nSo for 2023, we reported full year FFO of $7.28 per share and that was $0.02 per share of the midpoint of our guidance range provided last quarter and $0.01 above Street consensus.\nOwen described the strong 1.5 million square feet of leasing activity in the quarter, and included in this is 270,000 square feet within our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio, where we generate leasing commissions that exceeded our budget by $0.02 per share.\nWe also outperformed our guidance for the quarter with $0.02 per share of lower net interest expense. There were 2 real reasons for that. Last quarter, we announced the closing of our $600 million 5-year floating rate mortgage on 3 of our Cambridge buildings. When interest rates rallied in December, we opportunistically hedged this financing to fix the rate at 6% for the term. This reduced our interest rate by 160 basis points, contributing to lower interest expense in the quarter.\nAdditionally, the closing of the sale of a 45% interest in 300 Binney Street raised $213 million of equity. That transaction closed earlier than we expected, so the interest earned on the cash represents an increase to our net interest guidance.\nThese 2 items were offset by about $0.02 per share of onetime unbudgeted transaction expenses related to the forming of the joint venture for 290 and 300 Binney Street as well as slightly higher G&A costs in the quarter.\nOur portfolio NOI performed in line with our expectations, though we did experience a shift from the same property income bucket to termination income. We booked $10 million of termination income in the quarter, which was $7 million higher than our assumption, primarily from WeWork terminating its lease for 2 floors in Madison Center in Seattle.\nOur practice is to exclude termination income from our same property results. So the impact caused our same-property growth to be slightly negative for the quarter. If you exclude the impact of the termination income, our same-property performance actually would have been roughly flat.\nSo with that, I'm going to turn to our 2024 guidance. On a high level, our 2024 guidance can be summarized as follows. We project growth from the delivery of development and the acquisitions of our partners share in Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue, a slight decrease in our same-property portfolio NOI compared to 2023, higher net interest expense due to the persistency of the current high interest rate environment and lower development and management services fee income.\nI'm going to start with the impact of the acquisitions of our partner's interest in Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue that Owen described. 360 Park is still in development, so that transaction has limited impact on 2024 FFO. There are a lot of moving pieces with these transactions from an income and balance sheet perspective, so bear with me for a moment.\nIncluding the impact of the incremental debt acquired as well as the loss of fee income earned from our former partners, we project these acquisitions are highly accretive, adding approximately $25 million or $0.14 per share to our 2024 FFO.\nNoncash components represent about 50% of the incremental FFO pickup and are derived from straight lining the leases and fair valuing the debt and the ground lease at Santa Monica Business Park.\nIf we break that down into the categories for our guidance assumptions, the incremental property NOI is approximately $0.22 per share, and that's offset by the additional interest expense of $0.05 per share and the loss of fee income of $0.03 per share.\nWe will now be consolidating the results from these properties. So starting in 2024, you will see the increase in our consolidated NOI and interest expense and a decrease in FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures and fee income.\nAlso impacting 2024 is the disposition of Metropolitan Square in Washington, D.C. that we transacted last year. Inclusive of interest expense, the transaction is neutral to our 2024 FFO. But we do expect a reduction in property NOI of $0.03 per share, that's offset by a comparable $0.03 per share reduction in interest expense.\nTurning to development activity. Our development activity includes $550 million of investments that delivered in 2023 and will contribute incremental growth for a full year in 2024. These include 2100 Penn, 140 Kendrick Street and 751 Gateway that are in aggregate 97% leased.\nWe have an additional $665 million in developments that are projected to deliver in the near term that we expect will commence revenue in 2024, but be much more meaningful to our growth in 2025 as they complete their lease-up.\nIn aggregate, we expect our developments to contribute an incremental $35 million to $42 million in 2024 or $0.20 to $0.24 per share.\nTurning to the same property portfolio. Doug spent time describing our occupancy outlook and the impact of the uncertain economic environment that our clients are dealing with. Most continue to be very cautious around new investments, including space, and our leasing projections reflect this conservatism. We still expect to have a productive leasing year. And as Doug described, we have a large backlog of signed leases and leases and negotiation that will go into occupancy in 2024. We expect an occupancy range for our in-service portfolio of 87.2% to 88.6%.\nOverall, our assumption for 2024 same-property NOI growth from 2023 is negative 1% to negative 3%. As Doug mentioned, we're in discussions with WeWork on modifications for the remaining 4 leases. Our guidance assumes -- our guidance includes assumptions for these modifications that comprise 45 basis points of the decrease in our projected same-property NOI performance.\nAs you all should expect, our interest expense will be higher in 2024 with the continued high interest rate environment. We expect floating rates will start to drop in the back half of the year and are modeling 75 basis points of Fed cuts, which is more conservative than the current forward SOFR curve.\nCurrently, floating rate debt is only 5% of our total debt, is comprised of $730 million of mortgages, and we have a $1.2 billion term loan that's currently fixed and the interest rate swap expires in May of 2024.\nOur liquidity is very strong. We have current cash balances of $1.5 billion and our entire $1.8 billion line of credit is available. We will be using approximately $700 million of cash to redeem our maturing 3.8% $700 million unsecured bond that expires tomorrow. Other than that, we have no meaningful 2024 debt maturities without extension provisions, so we're not projecting significant changes in our debt profile.\nOur only external funding need is approximately $600 million of development spend in 2024 that will be funded with available cash.\nThe majority of the increase in interest expense is coming from our 2023 refinancing activity, resulting in a roll up to market interest rates and the consolidation of the mortgage threat for Santa Monica Business Park and 901 New York Avenue.\nAnd lastly, as I mentioned last quarter, our average cash balance will be less in 2024 than it was in 2023, and we expect approximately $30 million of lower interest income. So overall, we're projecting net interest expense of $570 million to $590 million in 2024. We expect consolidated net interest expense to be higher by $72 million at the midpoint, inclusive of the drop in interest income I mentioned. With the consolidation of SMBP and 901 New York Avenue, the interest expense and our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio is expected to be $18 million lower. So this results in a projected increase from year-to-year in total interest expense, including our joint ventures of $54 million or $0.31 per share at the midpoint of our guidance range over 2023.\nAdditionally, the consolidation of Santa Monica Business Park requires us to fair value the above-market ground lease, we project a $10 million positive noncash impact to FFO from this in 2024.\nThe last item I would like to cover is our fee income projection. We have or will be delivering several joint venture development projects, including our Gateway joint ventures, 360 [ Park ] and the Skymark Residential Development. With the delivery of these projects, our development fees are expected to be lower by about $5 million in 2024.\nAlso, we're no longer receiving fees of about $5 million from Santa Monica and 901 New York Avenue, now that they are wholly owned. So our guidance for fee income is lower and is now $25 million to $28 million in 2024.\nSo if you aggregate all of these assumptions, we're providing an initial 2024 FFO guidance range of $7 to $7.20 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, that's $0.18 per share lower than our 2023 reported FFO. The difference is comprised of increases of $0.19 of incremental NOI from acquisitions and dispositions, $0.22 from our developments, $0.02 of lower G&A expense, offset by $0.26 of higher interest and fair value ground lease amortization, $0.21 of lower contribution from same-property NOI, $0.08 of lower fee income and $0.06 of lower termination income.\nAt the midpoint, our 2024 FFO results in a modest 2.5% decline from 2023. So despite the economic headwinds, we continue to gain market share with our leasing and operating prowess and premier workplace portfolio, demonstrating relative stability in times of negative absorption.\nWe're optimistic that the interest rate environment will settle at a lower level, providing more confidence in the economy. We're also successfully executing on accretive new investments and continue to focus on additional opportunities to grow our earnings and create shareholder value.\nThat completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line for questions?"

[Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover BXP's operating outperformance in the third quarter, key economic and market trends impacting our company, and BXP's capital allocation activities for the quarter.\nBXP continued to perform in the third quarter despite escalating negative market sentiment for the commercial real estate sector. Our FFO per share was once again above both market consensus and the midpoint of our own forecast. We completed over 1 million square feet of leasing in the third quarter with a weighted average lease term of over 8 years, and increased portfolio occupancy despite a weaker operating environment for most of our clients. We completed multiple company and asset-specific financings, both elevating our liquidity position and demonstrating BXP's sustained access to the capital markets.\nMoving to the economy. Notwithstanding the Federal Reserve having increased the discount rate, 5.25 percentage points and the 10-year U.S. treasury having risen nearly 3%, all since March of 2022, the U.S. economy's headline statistics remain remarkably strong, with GDP growth at 4.9% in the third quarter, 336,000 jobs created in September and the unemployment rate steady at 3.8%. This rosy economic picture is misleading, as it does not accurately reflect the market tone and operating environment for many of our clients.\nAssuming forecasts for negative earnings growth in the third quarter are accurate, S&P 500 annual earnings growth has been negative for the last 4 quarters. Much of the recent strength in GDP has been consumption related, and job creation has been in the leisure and hospitality, health care, education and government sectors, not in the office leasing sector such as information and financial services.\nOur clients are corporations that actively manage their head count and operating expenses in times of weak or negative earnings growth. And as a result, they are more cautious in making new space commitments. The remote work is obviously not helping space demand. We believe economic conditions are the primary driver of our slower leasing activity in 2023, and leasing will rebound when earnings growth returns.\nWe continue to be encouraged with the return to office trajectory we are experiencing in our buildings, as well as the rhetoric and actions of many of our clients with respect to their in-person work policy. We believe the broadly reported turnstile data from Kastle Systems, indicating buildings are generally 50% occupied versus pre-pandemic levels over the course of a whole week, is a measure of aggregate human activity important to cities, but is not an accurate measure of premier workplace space utilization. We collect turnstyle data for approximately half of our 54 million square foot portfolio.\nAnd as of mid-October, for Tuesday through Thursday, our New York City buildings experienced 95% of the turnstile activity achieved before the pandemic. Those figures for Boston and San Francisco were 74% and 45%, respectively, and the space utilization data in all our markets continues to improve. Workers in premier workplaces are returning to their offices in greater numbers, and it is difficult for users to reduce space if all employees are expected in the office on specific days of the week.\nLastly and importantly, all office buildings are not the same. We share in our IR materials every quarter, CBRE's report on the performance of the premier workplace segment of the overall office market. In the 5 CBDs where BXP operates, premier workplaces represent approximately 18% of the total space and 10% of total buildings.\nAt the end of the third quarter, direct vacancy for premier workplaces was 12.4% versus 17% for the balance of the market. Also for the third quarter, net absorption for the premier segment was a positive 0.5 million square feet, versus a negative 600,000 square feet for the balance of the market.\nFor the last 11 quarters, net absorption for the premier segment was a positive 8.1 million square feet versus a negative 30.8 million square feet for the balance of the market, and asking rents are 44% higher for the premier workplace segment. Including 2 buildings undergoing renovation, 94% of BXP's CBD space is in buildings rated by CBRE as premier workplaces, which has been important in driving the increasing office attendance statistics in our buildings, and is a critical differentiator for BXP in the leasing marketplace.\nNow moving to private real estate capital markets, U.S. transaction volume for office assets in the third quarter was muted, dropping 48% from the second quarter to $4.4 billion, the lowest quarterly level of office transaction activity since the first quarter of 2010.\nInvestors in the sector face material uncertainties in both office demand due to factors previously mentioned, as well as the cost and availability of debt financing. The 10-year U.S. treasury has been and is rising and approaching 5%, and consensus market sentiment currently believes rates will be higher for longer given pernicious inflation.\nMost U.S. lenders are trying to reduce their exposure to commercial real estate loans and have limited available lending capacity for repayments. No sales in BXP's core markets were completed in the third quarter of significant assets that would be considered premier workplace.\nIn Boston, there were 3 completed office transactions, all under $100 million of reasonably well-leased assets that sold for $290 to $690 a square foot and 6.7% to 7.5% cap rates.\nIn Santa Monica, the Pen Factory, a fully leased 220,000 square foot redeveloped creative office complex, sold for $178 million, representing pricing of over $800 a foot and an 8.4% cap rate. The existing leases in the asset have turned but are significantly above market and seller financing was provided.\nIn New York City, a user is under agreement to purchase the 400,000 square foot vacant Neiman Marcus store at 20 Hudson Yards, for $550 million or $1,375 a square foot.\nIn the financial district of San Francisco, there are 4 sales, either completed or pending for buildings that are or nearly vacant. Each sale is for under $65 million and pricing ranges from $120 to $320 a square foot. These deals reflect many of the characteristics prevalent in today's nonpremier office sales market. Entrepreneurial, in many cases, family office buyers attracted by the low per square foot values relative to historical levels, small transaction sizes requiring less capital and likely not involving debt financing, and renovation plans designed to take advantage of future leasing market recovery.\nMoving to BXP's capital market activity for the third quarter, we completed a restructuring of our investment in Metropolitan Square, a recently renovated 657,000 square foot office building located in Washington, D.C. BXP owned a 20% interest in and provided leasing and management services for the asset, which was encumbered by a senior loan of $305 million and a mezzanine loan of $115 million. The existing mezzanine lender now owns 100% interest in the property, with BXP continuing to provide management and leasing services.\nFurther, a new undrawn $100 million mezzanine loan has been structured to fund future leasing, operating and other expenses of the property on an as-needed basis. BXP has a 20% interest in the new mezzanine loan, which is subordinate only to the $305 million senior loan and will receive interest at a 12% annual return. BXP will continue to earn leasing and property management fees as well as an attractive return with potential incentive fees for providing additional capital to stabilize the asset. We also experienced a $36 million gain as a result of the transaction.\nIn the coming quarters, given the negative sentiment toward the office industry, which spills over into the much better performing premier workplace segment, we believe BXP will be presented with unique opportunities to expand its portfolio on an attractive basis. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have maintained access to capital primarily through the unsecured debt markets available to a few public and private competitors. Our portfolio is outperforming peers due to its attractiveness in the market when competing for clients, the hallmark of a premier workplace portfolio.\nIn anticipation of the current market distress in our sector, we have been positioning BXP to play offense for the past year by raising $4.1 billion in gross funding and currently holding $2.7 billion in liquidity. In search of opportunities, we're maintaining continuous dialogue with lenders that are foreclosing on or restructuring assets, as well as owners seeking to reduce their office exposure. Our focus will remain in our core markets on premier workplace assets, life science and residential development.\nDuring the last major downturn caused by the global financial crisis, BXP was able to acquire the General Motors Building, 200 Clarendon Street, 100 Federal Street and 510 Madison, all at attractive prices at the time. On this conditions, we continue to pursue additional capital raising through joint ventures with select pre-leased developments and to consider incremental asset sales. Our development portfolio continues to create FFO growth for BXP.\nThis quarter, we placed fully into service 104,000 square foot renovated and fully leased building at 140 Kendrick Street in Needham, MA. This redevelopment completed for a client with stringent sustainability objectives was delivered with net zero carbon performance and generating an 18% first year yield on incremental capital invested.\nWe also delivered into service 751 Gateway as part of our Gateway Life Science Park, which is a 231,000 square foot lab building that is fully leased. BXP owns a 49% interest in the asset, which was delivered at a 6.7% first year return on cost.\nBXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 11 office lab, retail and residential projects underway. These projects aggregate approximately 2.8 million square feet and $2.4 billion of BXP investment, with $1.4 billion remaining to be funded, and are projected to generate attractive yields in the aggregate upon delivery.\nSo in summary, despite strong negative market sentiment, BXP had another productive quarter with financial performance and leasing above expectations and a stable dividend. BXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our leadership position in the premier workplace market segment, our strong and liquid balance sheet with access to multiple capital sources, our significant development pipeline providing growth, and our potential to gain market share in both assets and clients due to the current market dislocation. Over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody.\nClient demand across our portfolio has remained pretty stable over the last quarter. But final leasing decisions are taking longer, not -- pretty consistent with Owen's talking about -- relative to challenges with regards to the profitability of corporations. Our buildings continue to see the most activity from financial services, professional services, law firms, administrative services and asset management.\nTraditional technology demand continues to be absent from our markets and more times than not, renewing technology clients are reducing their lease premises. This is most prevalent in our West Coast properties, Pretty much the same picture that I pointed -- painted last quarter.\nGrowth from the AI organizations in the city of San Francisco is real. More than 700,000 square feet of leasing has occurred in the past few weeks, and there have been billions of dollars of recent investment into this growing ecosystem.\nFor now, that leasing is focused on large, well-built opportunities that are available at significant discounted terms relative to the rents being achieved in premier buildings. Reducing availability is a positive for the broader San Francisco market, but it's not going to impact leasing at Embarcadero Center in 2024.\nThe concentration of strongest user demand, often with growth for our assets, is still broadly speaking, alternative asset managers, private equity, venture hedge funds, specialized fund managers. These companies are growing their teams and capital under management. This pool of clients typically wants to occupy premier workplaces.\nTo illustrate the point, during the third quarter, we completed a 15,000 square foot expansion for a hedge fund in Manhattan. A 52,000 square foot multi-floor lease with a private equity firm growing in our portfolio in Manhattan, a 70,000 square foot asset manager growing in our portfolio in Manhattan, and an expansion for a 21,000 square foot private equity firm in D.C.\nOur strongest activity remains in our Midtown Manhattan portfolio, 200 Clarendon and the Prudential Center in Boston, the urban core of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia, and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco. We don't have direct availability at Salesforce Tower, but we hear through the market that Salesforce has interest in their 150,000 square foot sublet opportunity.\nLaw firms are also an active portion of our portfolio and important clients for BXP. We are in active lease negotiations or LOI discussions with 7 distinct law firms in Manhattan, D.C. and San Francisco.\nOwen highlighted that just over 1 million square foot of signed leases during the third quarter. Last October, we provided the leasing expectations embedded in our '23 guidance, between 500 million to 1 million square feet per quarter, aka, 750,000 square feet on average or 3 million for 2023.\nThrough the first half of the year, we were at 1.56 million. So to date, we're at 2.7 million square feet. We currently have an additional 1.2 million square feet of transactions in active lease documentation. I would say we have a high confidence that we will be beating our leasing target embedded in our 2023 guidance of 3 million square feet.\nThis quarter, the executed leases included 52 transactions, 32 renewals, 20 new tenants. There were 5 contractions and 5 expansions among our existing clients, with a net reduction in that pool of about 33,000 square feet. There were no particular patterns relative to industry or size, given who was expanding and contracting.\nBreaking the volume down by market, we did about 439,000 in Boston. 240,000 square feet in New York, 100,000 square feet in D.C. and 278,000 square feet in the West Coast market. The mark-to-market of the leases that commenced this quarter was down 3% as reported in our supplemental. The mark-to-market of the leases executed this quarter was positive 4%. The starting cash rents on leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space, were up 16% in Boston, about 1% in New York and then down 13% in D.C., 9% in San Francisco, 14% in L.A. and 6% in Seattle.\nWe ended the third quarter with an in-service occupancy of 88.8%, compared to 88.3% last quarter. As Owen said, during the third quarter, 140 Kendrick Street and 751 Gateway were added to the portfolio, and Net Square was taken out. If you remove Net Square from the second quarter, the comparative period occupancy went from 88.7% to 88.8%. So again, modest relevant increase.\nI would also note that we terminated WeWork, on 44,000 square feet in the third quarter. We expect to have additional portfolio vacancy stemming from WeWork defaults as we move through the fourth quarter and into 2024. Just to remind everyone, WeWork leases 493,000 square feet as of 10/1/23.\nThe BXP share of 2023 annualized revenue is $33 million. We don't expect we work to exit all the assets, nor do we expect them to remain in place in their current footprint. This will be a drag on '24 occupancy and same-store contribution.\nThe development portfolio now sits at 2.8 million square feet and it's 52% leased. We've recently signed a 70,000 square foot office lease with an asset manager at 360 Park Avenue South, bringing -- its 18% leased and another floor at 651 Gateway that is now 21% leased. Two 100% leased assets totaling 335,000 square feet were removed and put into service, which accounts for the change in our total leased in the supplemental.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had signed leases that have yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 750,000 square feet, with about 425,000 square feet anticipated to commence in the fourth quarter of '23.\nFor the remainder of 23, we have about 925,000 square feet of expirations. Much of this is uncovered, so we expect a drop of a few basis points of occupancy at year-end.\nIn '24, we have a very manageable 5.7% of our total portfolio expiration or 2.7 million square feet. We believe our occupancy will be stable in '24, defined as up or down 1% quarter-to-quarter where we end -- relative to where we're going to end the year in 2023. We will provide a leasing volume outlook for '24 along with guidance next quarter.\nFrom a broad market perspective, the office supply picture didn't really improve much in the third quarter with almost every market continuing to experience net negative absorption, manhattan being the one place where there was some positive. The city-specific office brokerage reports are starting to characterize their markets in ways that acknowledge the bifurcation between the have and the have-nots, and the distinctive trends for premier assets, though they are not publishing their data broadly.\nThe availability in the premier buildings that Owen described is depicting a more constructive picture and BXP relevant view of office supply. What's clear is that new speculative construction, which presumably would be Premier is nonexistent in the marketplace today. Any new construction starts are going to require economic rents, rent and concessions that are vastly different from the current transactions. The major inputs to a new building are construction hard costs, capital costs and leasing velocity.\nConstruction costs saw dramatic increases over the past 5 years with annual increases in the high single digits. We've seen the rate of increases slowing down, but we have not seen any reduction of costs. Construction financing could be found at SOFR +200, when SOFR was 25 to 50 basis points.\nToday, construction financing for office space is simply not available from traditional lenders. SOFR is at 5.25%, and nontraditional lenders might, and I use the word might, lend at double-digit current interest rates with additional points upfront and lower loan-to-cost caps. Speculative leasing assumptions also assume longer lease up. You put all this into a development pro forma and you need rents that are materially higher than what is supported by current market rents in every one of our cities.\nThis quarter, we completed a 313,000 square foot 10-year renewal in the Back Bay of Boston, 4 years prior to expiration at a rent level that both parties found attractive. Our client is using all their space, believes it's a critical component of their overall business strategy, and when they look down to the market did not believe that any new construction was likely to be built on a speculative basis.\nThis meant they would need to pay replacement cost rents and sign a lease now using all the inputs I just outlined, to be in new construction in the Back Bay in 4 years, and there are no 300,000 square foot block of high-rise space available in premier buildings in the Back Bay today.\nNew life science activity in the portfolio continues to be light. During the quarter, we completed our third lease at 651 Gateway for another floor. The property will open in '24, and to date, each lease requires our partnership to complete turnkey spaces.\nIn Waltham, where we have our other life science new development availability, we are seeing some tour activity, but there is no urgency for these requirements. There are a few large requirements to the touring, but as I have discussed previously, the bulk of the immediate demand is from small private companies that are looking for fully built space.\nBXP's [indiscernible] teams continue to lease space and outperformed the market because our portfolio is fundamentally comprised of premier workplaces, the majority of the demand, new and existing clients in the market want to be in these types of properties, and we're investing capital in our building infrastructures, amenities and client spaces, which allow our teams to meet client needs.\nWe are all seeing the stress that many buildings are feeling due to their current capital structure, and the reality of the supply and demand fundamentals reflected in the leasing market activity. The transition or recapitalization or reequitization of these buildings is going to take an extended period of time. Many of these assets are not in a position to commit capital to existing or new tenants, which greatly impacts the leasing brokers interest in considering them for their clients and offers us for the opportunity to further increase our market share.\nI'll stop here and turn things over to Mike.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start my comments with some discussion on the debt markets and our activity. Then I will go over the third quarter performance and the changes to our 2023 earnings guidance.\nWe had another busy financing quarter this quarter. We extended or refinanced mortgage facilities totaling $570 million. The 2 largest of these related to our Hub on Causeway premier workplace and retail mixed-use project that's in Boston.\nFirst, we exercised the first of 2, 1-year extension options we have on the $337 million mortgage loan on the office tower. And second, we completed a 3-year refinancing of the $155 million mortgage loan secured by the low-rise, creative office and retail component. We also expanded our corporate line of credit by $315 million to $1.8 billion. We honestly were surprised by the market's reaction when we issued a press release on this earlier this quarter, as it increases our liquidity at a pretty modest cost. We had 3 new banks approach us, seeking to expand their relationship with us and up-tier the quality of their own client base. With so much uncertainty and illiquidity in the bank markets, our view is expanding our roster of banking relationships as a smart move.\nLast week, we closed on a new 5-year, $600 million mortgage loans from a syndicate of banks on a portfolio of 3 premier workplaces in Cambridge. The credit spread at SOFR + 225 basis points, is attractive in today's market, and we expect to use the proceeds to repay our upcoming $700 million bond maturity in February next year.\nGiven the significant recent move in interest rates, we are happy with the timing of our last couple of bond deals, both of which have been below market coupons today. We have no more financing needs in 2023, and we've taken care of a large piece of our 2024 maturities, which is the $700 million bond I just mentioned.\nOur other 2024 maturities include our $1.2 billion term loan and $400 million at our share of floating rate mortgages. The term loan is also floating rate, though we have swapped SOFR to be fixed at 4.64% through May of 2024. We expect to exercise 1-year extension options that are available on both the term loan and the majority of the maturing mortgages.\nAs you think about our interest expense, moving into 2024, you need to account for higher borrowing costs. We are refinancing $1.2 billion of bonds that expired in August of 2023 and February of 2024, that had a weighted average interest rate of 3.5%, with new financing at an average rate of 7%.\nAdditionally, we've been running with an average cash balance of approximately $1 billion in 2023. In 2024, we expect to fund our development pipeline with available cash, and run with an average balance closer to $400 million. At our current earnings rate, this projects to a decrease of approximately $30 million of interest income in 2024.\nNow I want to turn to our third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.86 per share, that was $0.02 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. The outperformance all came from better-than-projected portfolio net operating income. Revenues were higher than our assumptions from a mix of better rental revenues, client service income, parking and hotel performance. Our operating expenses were in line with our assumptions.\nWhile not impacting our FFO, we did record noncash impairment charges totaling $273 million this quarter, related to 4 of our unconsolidated joint ventures. The GAAP rules for unconsolidated joint ventures dictate that if we believe a loss in asset value below our basis is not temporary, the asset is market to fair value. The definition of temporary is somewhat subjective, but as the length of the current market dislocation extends, it's harder to justify a temporary loss in value. The charges relate to Platform 16, which we discussed last quarter, as well as 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue and Safeco Plaza.\nGiven the cyclical nature of the real estate business, the value of assets like these will recover in the future when interest rates normalize and corporate economic conditions improve, and we expect to hold these assets through their recovery. Our past experience reflects this recovery. After the GFC, we took a similar impairment charge and ultimately, we sold the asset a few years later at a significant gain, not only to the impaired value but to the original book values of the buildings as well.\nNow I want to turn to our guidance for the rest of 2023. We have narrowed our 2023 guidance range to $7.25 to $7.27 per share, with the midpoint relatively unchanged from last quarter at $7.26 per share.\nThere are 2 key changes to our guidance from last quarter. First, we're projecting $0.03 per share of higher termination income in the fourth quarter from lease terminations with WeWork at Madison Center, and Dock 72, as they have stopped paying rent in both locations. We have security deposits to cover a portion of the lost rent, which we will recognize as termination income. The revenue loss is approximately $6.5 million per year until those spaces are re-leased to other clients. They comprise approximately 200,000 square feet that equates to about 40 basis points of our occupancy.\nSecond, we anticipate our net interest expense will be higher by approximately $0.03 per share due to lower projected capitalized interest and closing the new $600 million mortgage financing earlier than we had previously expected. We expect to invest the funds and cash equivalents until we repay our bond expiration at the beginning of February, and the negative arbitrage on the funds is about $3 million in 2023.\nThe remainder of our assumptions for the portfolio performance has not changed. As Doug described, we continue to execute leases in line with our expectations, and net of the lease terminations, our outlook for occupancy remains stable.\nAs we look ahead into 2024, we have several developments that delivered during 2023 or will deliver in 2024, that will add incremental FFO next year. These include 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, 651 and 751 Gateway, 140 Kendrick Street, 180 CityPoint and View Boston.\nHowever, as I described earlier, we expect our overall earnings trajectory will be negatively impacted by the persistent high interest rate environment that will result in higher net interest expense in 2024. We will provide detailed earnings guidance for 2024 on next quarter's call in January. That completes our formal remarks.\nOperator, can you please open the lines up for questions?"

Welcome to Q2 2023 BXP Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to Helen Han, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BXP Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night and furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, BXP has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investors section of our website at investors.bxp.com. A webcast of this call will be available for 12 months.\nAt this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although BXP believes that expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in BXP's filings with the SEC. BXP does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements. I'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike Lavelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President; and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover BXP's above-expected operating performance in the second quarter, key economic and market trends impacting BXP, BXP's capital allocation activities and a personnel and organizational announcement.\nBXP continued to perform in the second quarter, once again demonstrating sentiment in the office industry is worse than what we are experiencing. Our FFO per share was above both market consensus in the midpoint of our own forecast. And once again, this quarter, we increased our FFO per share guidance for all of 2023. We completed 938,000 square feet of leasing in the second quarter with a weighted average lease term of 8 years despite continued challenging leasing market conditions.\nWe completed multiple company and asset-specific financings, both elevating our liquidity position and demonstrating BXP's sustained access to the capital markets. U.S. economic growth is challenging to forecast as there are currently 2 competing and viable theories predicting very different trajectories. The first theory is that inflation is increasingly under control due to pandemic economic anomalies wearing off and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. And the economy has and will remain healthy with a strong labor market and continued GDP growth driven by consumption.\nThe second theory is that inflation is already well under control, and the Federal Reserve has been overly aggressive in the magnitude and timing of its interest rate increases, which will create dislocation in sectors of the economy as has already started to occur with regional banks and commercial real estate and will result in a recession possibly as soon as later this year.\nWe are obviously hoping for the first outcome but have prepared BXP for the second by increasing liquidity currently at $3.1 billion, pursuing additional capital raising opportunities and being measured in discretionary capital expenditures and new investment activity. Whether or not we have an economic recession, U.S. companies are experiencing a recession in earnings, which for the S&P 500 are predicted to drop over 6% year-over-year in the second quarter. With lower earnings, companies look to cut costs, including expenditures for space, which is the primary driver of our slower leasing in the first half of 2023 versus last year.\nLarge tech companies, the most significant source of new employment and net absorption of space last cycle, are largely absent from the current leasing market. In analyzing the market demand for office space, it is important to understand the behavior of underlying users, which, in the broadest sense, are bifurcated into 2 groups. First, their knowledge workers who are client and/or product facing and execute the core functions of a business where creativity and collaboration are critical to success. And second, support workers who provide services to the core functions of a business in areas such as IT and accounting, where tasks are more repetitive and collaboration less of an imperative.\nKnowledge workers generally have dedicated workstations and are increasingly in the office as business leaders understand the importance of in-person work for this group and are enforcing firmer in-person work policies. In many cases, companies working remotely are announcing return to office plans. Companies working on a hybrid basis are increasing the number of days expected in the office. Companies are tying year-end evaluations and bonus levels to office attendance.\nOn the other hand, support workers often work in shared workstations with more workers and seats, which -- with much less prescriptive office attendance policies. This workforce bifurcation is creating the ever-increasing performance gap between Premier workplaces and the balance of the office market. A primary tool companies utilize to increase knowledge worker attendance is to provide modern workspace rich with amenities in an easily commutable location, the definition of a premier workplace.\nConversely, support functions are not as commonly located in premier workplace assets. Therefore, remote work and shared workstation puts more pressure on the market for lower-quality buildings in secondary locations. The divergent impact of AI on knowledge and support jobs could also continue to widen the building quality performance gap as AI drives knowledge job growth and automate support processes.\nWe share in our IR materials every quarter, CBRE's report on the performance of the Premier Workplace segment. In the 5 CBDs where BXP operates, premier Workplaces represent approximately 18% of the total space and 10% of the total buildings. At the end of the second quarter, direct vacancy for Premier Workplaces was 11.6% versus 16.5% for the balance of the market.\nAlso for the second quarter, net absorption for the Premier segment was around 800,000 square feet positive versus a negative 2.1 million square feet for the balance of the market. For the last 10 quarters, net absorption for the premier segment was a positive 6.7 million square feet versus a negative 31.9 million square feet for the balance of the market.\nRents and rent growth are higher for premier workplaces, and we believe the segment captures most of all gross leasing activity. Including 2 buildings undergoing renovation, 94% of BXP CBD space is in buildings rated by CBRE as premier workplaces, which has been important in driving the increasing office attendance statistics in our buildings and is a critical differentiator for BXP in the marketplace.\nMoving to private real estate capital markets, U.S. transaction volume in the second quarter rose 43% from the first quarter to $9.6 billion, though volume is down 50% versus the second quarter last year. Interestingly, sales volumes for other asset classes is weaker, up less than office and consecutive quarters and down more versus last year.\nReal estate values have reset down due to higher capital costs and demand challenges in specific sectors, and most sellers continue to be unwilling to accept lower prices, creating a slowdown in transaction activity, common and declining market.\nNew mortgage financing for office is not available from domestic lenders. Non-U.S. banks will consider financing only for the highest quality leased assets and sponsors and at modest loan to values. Completed office sales and recapitalizations invariably involved buildings with long weighted average lease terms and/or seller financing.\nGiven the dearth of transaction activity, office asset pricing is difficult to determine, but there were a small number of relevant data points this past quarter. A fund manager backed by a private equity firm purchased 2 lab portfolios in the Boston area from a public REIT. Three buildings on Second Avenue and Waltham comprising 329,000 square feet, which are 100% leased for over 6 years, sold for $266 million, representing pricing of $809 a foot and a 5.8% initial cap rate.\nAlso in the deal, 2 buildings on Memorial Drive in Cambridge Port comprising 99,000 square feet and vacated for redevelopment sold for $99 million, which was a price of just under $1,000 a square foot. Also located in Santa Clara next to BXP's Peterson Way development site campus at 333 sold for $183 million, representing pricing of $742 a square foot and a 6.1% initial cap rate. The building comprises 246,000 square feet. It's fully leased on a long-term basis and was sold by a domestic pension fund to a domestic fund manager.\nNow moving to BXP's capital market activity for the second quarter. We are being patient with new investment activity as we believe acquisition opportunities will grow in number and become more attractive in this environment. We will remain opportunistic and solely focused on premier workplaces, life science and residential development in our 6 target markets.\nWe are considering additional capital raising through dispositions and joint ventures with our in-service residential assets and select pre-leased developments. This quarter, we placed fully into service 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, a 476,000 square-foot market-leading premier workplace in Washington, D.C. that is 91% leased.\nIn late June, we opened and placed into service View Boston, a 3-story observation Pavilion, a top Prudential tower in the Back Bay of Boston that offers panoramic views of the city as well as an immersive experience, showcasing Boston's many neighborhoods and cultural landmarks. BXP has been constructing the first phase of the Platform 16 premier workplace development adjacent to Google's Downtown West project in San Jose.\nBXP owns a 55% interest in the project in the first phase includes a 390,000 square foot building as well as a garage and foundation for all 3 phases, which in total will comprise 1.1 million square feet. Unfortunately, market conditions in the Silicon Valley, including San Jose, have deteriorated meaningfully with rising direct vacancy, few large space requirements and technology companies, including Google, putting significant space in the sublease market.\nAs a result, we have decided to pause construction of the project at Gray with completion of the Garage and Foundation scheduled for year-end 2023. Though disappointing, as market conditions recover, we will have a project that can be delivered to users in under 2 years, which is 12 to 14 months more quickly than a ground-up development.\nFurther, this decision reduces our near-term development spend by approximately $200 million, thereby enhancing our liquidity. BXP recently accomplished 2 important milestones in the predevelopment of the 900,000 square foot 343 Madison premier workplace in Midtown Manhattan. We completed a joint venture with a leading global real estate investor who will own a 45% interest in the project.\nFurther, the joint venture completed a 99-year ground lease with the Metropolitan Transit Authority for the 343 Madison Avenue site. Under the terms of the lease, the joint venture is required to construct a direct entrance into the Long Island Railroad East Side Access project known as Grand Central Madison.\nThe joint venture can terminate the ground lease and be reimbursed for its costs in constructing the access to Grand Central Madison. With direct access to transit in the relatively tight Grand Central submarket, 343 Madison is a unique offering and preliminary discussions with potential anchor clients have been constructive.\nBXP continues to execute a significant development pipeline with 13 office lab retail and residential projects underway. These projects aggregate approximately 3.1 million square feet and $2.6 billion of BXP investment with $1.6 billion remaining to be funded and are projected to generate attractive yields upon delivery.\nOn a personnel matter, after a 25-year distinguished career running BXP, San Francisco region, Bob Pester has elected to retire early next year. We have asked Rod Deal, who currently runs leasing in BXP San Francisco region to succeed Bob. Rod, an 18-year BXP veteran is an accomplished leader with a strong track record of commercial success with BXP's clients. With this change, we are also adjusting our organizational structure.\nBXP has and will continue to execute its business in 3 regions on the West Coast. However, given that L.A. and Seattle are relatively new regions for BXP and currently underscaled, we will manage these 3 regions with a unified organizational structure under Rod sharing resources across the regions to the benefit of BXP's clients and shareholders. Alex Cameron and Melissa Cohen will continue to be our senior representatives in the L.A. region and Kelly Levchin, our senior representative in the Seattle region.\nSo in summary, despite strong negative market sentiment, BXP had another productive quarter with financial performance and leasing above expectations and a stable dividend. BXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our leadership position in the premier workplace market segment, our strong and liquid balance sheet with access to multiple capital sources, our significant development pipeline providing growth and our potential to gain market share in both assets and clients due to the current market dislocation. Let me turn it over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. So during our June NAREIT meetings, the most frequent topic of conversation was our leasing activity since it obviously drives occupancy, top line revenue on our net operating income. So I'm going to focus my remarks here this morning. Owen highlighted the volume of signed leases during the second quarter.\nJust to remind everybody, during the last 9 months, we've been providing the leasing expectations embedded into our 2023 earnings guidance between 0.5 million and 1 million square feet per quarter which translates to 750,000 square feet on average or 3 million square feet for year 2023.\nSo during the first quarter, we signed 6 60. As of the end of the first half of '23, we've completed 1.56 million square feet, pretty much on target. This quarter, the 930,000 square feet of time leases included 63 transactions, 37 renewals, 26 new tenants. There were 7 contractions and 5 expansions. Three of the expansions were law firms, although we also had 2 law firm contractions along with the nonprofit and a government agency.\nBreaking the volume down by market, 320,000 square feet in Boston, 280,000 square feet in New York, 235,000 square feet in D.C. and 100,000 square feet in San Francisco. We ended the second quarter with an in-service occupancy of 88.3% compared to 88.6% last quarter. But as Owen said, we added 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue to the in-service portfolio.\nThe building is 91% leased but only 61% occupied for purposes of revenue recognition, which is how we calculate our occupancy statistics. So if you exclude the additional property, our occupancy actually remains flat for that quarter. As we sit here today, we have signed leases that have yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 1 million square feet with 800,000 square feet anticipated to commence in 2023. That does not include the development portfolio, which is 3.1 million square feet and 54% leased.\nWe currently have 44 leases in negotiation totaling 1.17 million square feet as compared to about 900,000 square feet as we entered the second quarter, so a slight acceleration. The one difference in this pool of transactions is that there is 1 large renewal, over 300,000 square feet versus the largest active negotiation last quarter also renewal was just over 100,000 square feet.\nWe also have a current pipeline of additional active proposals totaling over 1.7 million square feet. So if we complete 95% of the leases in negotiation and 1/3 of the 1.7 million square feet of proposals. We currently would have about 1.7 million square feet of additional leases we hope to execute during the second half of '23, which will bring our total leasing for 2023 to just over 3 million square feet, again, going back to our original embedded expectations right on ticket.\nOur remaining 2023 expiration are 1.3 million square feet. We have 800,000 square feet of signed leases with an anticipated 2023 commencement. We'll be delivering 140 Kendrick Street, 104,000 square feet into the in-service portfolio in the third quarter and 751 Gateway, 100% leased 231,000 square feet in the fourth quarter. We will have additional 2023 activity across the portfolio, which will get our occupancy up slightly by year-end.\nBut as we get further into calendar year 2023, additional lease executions will impact occupancy after 2023. The New York regions, second-generation leasing statistics jump out this quarter and need a little bit of explanation. The deals commencing included a floor that was previously leased to an existing tenant at a below-market rent as they were rebuilding their space elsewhere in the building.\nWe subsequently relet the space under a long-term lease to a new tenant and the impact is hitting this quarter. If you strip out that transaction, New York would be down 9.2% on a gross basis and 15% on a net basis. As I said before, in general, we continue to have roll-ups in Boston and San Francisco, roll downs in D.C. and Northern Virginia, while New York is very building and lease-specific.\nThe leases we signed in this quarter on second-generation space were up 8% in Boston, 10% in San Francisco, down 11% in New York and down 13.5% in D.C. The New York leases signed this quarter included a 120,000 square foot renewal in Princeton that was down 28% on a cash basis. The sentiment of our own office is worse than the reality, as Owen said. To illustrate the point in our portfolio, we continue to see an incremental pickup in daily activity as we look at the month-to-month trend lines.\nWe measure the unique client employees coming into our building every day against a number of workstation/office desks in our CBD buildings today. Using this methodology, we are seeing weekly usage of 80% in New York City, 75% in Boston and 70% in San Francisco, and this excludes Salesforce.com and WeWork because they don't use our access card system.\nWhen we look at individual firms, there is a wide discrepancy in utilization. We have clients that are close to 90% of their daily high that they had pre-pandemic. While we have a few insurance companies back office that are as low as 35% sort of making Owen's point on the type of work that's being done. The frequency at work in the office is about 3 days per week across our markets where we track the data, and this includes San Francisco. So that people are coming back to work, 3-plus days a week.\nFridays continues to be a real outlier for our clients. Contrary to popular sentiment our clients are using their space. From a broad perspective, the office supply picture didn't improve in the second quarter. The third-party industry reports all noted negative modest absorption across all of the major markets in the United States, all of them. And you'll clearly read about high headline availability very inflating in every market for -- in the U.S. for some time.\nHowever, continuing the theme that the sentiment is worse in the reality, the New York City brokers reports also indicate that the Class A inventory in the Park Avenue submarket has an availability rate of 11% and that net effective rents are rising with higher face rates and flat or lower concessions. And while it's not reported, the availability in the premier buildings is even tighter.\nAway from the Midtown market in the BXP portfolio, we are now in negotiations with our first multi-floor client at 360 Park Avenue South. Tenant demand in the San Francisco CBD has increased more than 50% since the fourth quarter of 2022, with new technology demand responsible for much of the increase. There are a significant number of AI companies actively considering space and the requirements will all create net absorption.\nGiven their potential growth at these organizations, we would expect this demand to center on the well-built tech sublet space that is readily available in the market, not direct vacancy. Global investment in the AI field is rapidly increasing and it's going to result in job growth.\nSan Francisco is the leading labor market for AI jobs, followed by Seattle and New York and new venture capital investment in AI is concentrated in San Francisco CBD, New York and Boston, with CBRE research reporting at San Francisco is receiving more than 50% of of the total invested money during the third quarter. These are encouraging facts that can only be constructive in the eventual recovery of the San Francisco CBD office market.\nThe concentration of user demand strength with growth still is broadly speaking, alternative asset managers, private equity, venture hedge funds, specialized fund managers. These companies are growing their teams and capital under management. This pool of clients typically wants to occupy premier workplaces. To illustrate this point, during the quarter, we did a multi-floor 10-year renewal with our private equity firm in Boston and a 15-year renewal for a full floor with an investment manager in New York City.\nIn general, our strongest activity as at the General Motors Building in Manhattan, Carine Prudential Center properties in Boston, 2,200 and 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C., the urban core of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco. We don't have availability of Salesforce Tower ourselves directly.\nThe loss firms are also active in our portfolio and important clients for BXP. This quarter, we completed 3 law firm leases in New York, 1 in Boston and 3 in our D.C. portfolio. We also have a number of active loss from transactions in the proposal stage at Embarcadero Center. In general, however, outside of Manhattan, the law firms are reducing their footprint.\nDuring the quarter, we completed 3 life science leases, a 55,000 square foot extension in Lexington, Massachusetts. We relet the 12,000 square foot suite at 880 Winter Street where we had a pharma biotech company shut down its operations in March. We did it on an as-is basis and a rent that was 9% higher than the prior rent. And we completed our second full floor lease at 651 Gateway in South San Francisco.\nWe are also negotiating a third full for lease at 651 Gateway, and we intend to complete a speculative turnkey installation on an additional floor. The property will open in '24 and to date, each lease at 651 Gateway requires our partnership to complete turnkey build-outs.\nActivity in the life science market continues to be moderate across both Boston and South San Francisco, and there is new unleased supply being added to the market. There are a few large requirements that are touring. But as I have previously said, the bulk of the demand is from small private companies that are looking for fully built space. Our new client at 80 Winter fits this profile.\nI also want to note that we are seeing costs decreasing this inflation on our tenant improvement work relative to jobs completed in 2022, largely due to the falloff in transactions in our markets. The numbers are slightly different by market by market, but we are seeing a reduction in TIs that we are budgeting.\nBXP's portfolio is going to gain occupancy. We will continue to lease available space because our portfolio is fundamentally comprised of premier workplaces. The majority of the demand new and existing clients in the market wants to be in these types of properties and we are investing capital in our building infrastructure, amenities and tenant spaces.\nWe are all seeing the stress that many buildings are feeling due to their current capital structure. The transition or recapitalization of these buildings is going to take an extended time. While this is happening, many of these assets are not in a position to commit capital to existing or new tenants, which greatly impacts the leasing brokers interest in considering them for their clients.\nAnd so returning to the theme of the sentiment is worse than the reality for BXP, much of the available space in our markets is not competitive with our assets and some buildings are not in a position to compete due to their owners unwillingness to invest capital while their capitalization is in the restructure mode.\nOur clients are using our space. Medium and small financial and professional service clients will make up the bulk of the leasing we completed in 2023. We completed 57 leases during the first quarter, 63% during the second. We have had only 2 leases above 100,000 square feet this year and each was a renewal. Occupancy gains will be captured slowly through lots of small- and medium-sized new leases and renewals. I'll stop here and turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to start with a few comments on our balance sheet and then I plan to cover the details of our second quarter performance and the changes to our 2023 earnings guidance. We had a busy quarter in the debt markets, and we continue to bolster our liquidity and opportunistically manage our interest rate risk.\nIn the bond market, we issued $750 million of 6.5% 10-year unsecured green bonds. We had strong support from our fixed income investors and our deal was well oversubscribed, allowing us to upsize the transaction and reduce the pricing from initial guidance. When we issued the notes in May, the underlying treasury was 3.34% and our credit spread was 320 basis points.\nOur credit spreads have rallied significantly to under 250 basis points today, while the 10-year has increased to over 4%. So despite all the volatility, if we issued another 10-year today, it would be at a similar coupon.\nIn the mortgage market, we refinanced our $105 million expiring mortgage on 500 North Capitol Street in Washington, D.C. We also exercised 1-year extensions for our mortgage loans on the Marriott headquarters in Bethesda and the Hub on Cosby office tower in Boston. Our remaining 2023 loan maturities are limited to a $500 million bond maturity that we expect to repay with cash as well as a mortgage loan on our mixed-use Hub on Causeway podium building.\nThe Hub on Causeway is held in a joint venture and our share of the loan is only $87 million. We're finalizing terms and expect to refinance the loan in the third quarter for 2 additional years plus a 1-year extension option. This quarter, we also entered into interest rate swaps to fix the rate on our $1.2 billion unsecured term loan through May of 2024. We fixed the term SOFR rate at 4.64%. That's approximately 70 basis points lower than where term silver sits today.\nOur liquidity is strong at $3.1 billion. It consists of $1.6 billion in cash and the full availability under our $1.5 billion line credit. Our liquidity needs through the end of 2024 include $1.1 billion of projected spend on our development pipeline, $1.2 billion of bond maturities and $190 million of mortgages with final maturities by 2024.\nWe do have another $390 million of mortgages and our $1.2 billion term loan that mature in 2024 and have extension rights into 2025 or 2026. So our financing plan is to pay off the $500 million bond expiring in September with cash. refinance our $700 million bond prior to its maturity in February 2024, either through the secured or the unsecured market, refinance our mortgage maturities and continue to maintain ample liquidity.\nNow turning to our earnings results. For the second quarter, we reported funds from operations of $1.86 per share. Our results exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.06 per share. The outperformance was due to $0.02 of better-than-expected revenues in the portfolio, combined with $0.04 of lower-than-expected operating expenses.\nThe stronger revenues were spread across the portfolio. It included earlier than projected lease commencements, higher service and parking revenues and outperformance at our hotel. On the operating expense side of the ledger, the savings were split between lower energy costs from both lower consumption and rates and the deferral of repair and maintenance expenses.\nWe project that most of the benefit from lower maintenance expenses will be lost as the projects get deferred until later in the year. So for the full year 2023, we're raising our FFO guidance to $7.24 to $7.29 per share. In our same-property portfolio, we expect most of the second quarter performance to flow through to the full year.\nWe're raising our assumptions for our same-property NOI growth by increasing the bottom end of our range by 50 basis points. So we're now assuming same-property NOI growth from 2022 of 0% to 0.5%. We're also increasing our assumption for same-property cash NOI growth to 1.5% to 2.5%.\nThe other area we are seeing improvement is in net interest expense. By swapping the floating rate on our $1.2 billion term loan to a fixed rate we've locked in interest savings. And while we issued new bonds to refinance our September maturity earlier than we had projected, the interest rate was lower than our assumption from last quarter. Plus, we're seeing better deposit rates and are carrying higher cash balances, so we are earning more on our liquidity.\nIn conclusion, we're increasing our 2023 FFO guidance range by $0.10 per share at the midpoint. The changes are primarily from $0.05 per share of better same-property portfolio NOI and and $0.05 per share of lower net interest expense. Overall, we had a strong quarter with top line revenue growth, earnings outperformance, improved leasing volumes positive mark-to-market on our commenced leases and timely capital raising activity. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape, and we are well positioned in an uncertain environment for any economic outcome.\nLooking further forward, we do expect the high interest rate environment to continue to be a headwind as we refinance low-cost expiring debt at anticipated higher rates. For example, we have a $700 million of 3.8% fixed rate unsecured notes that expire in early 2024, and we expect a refinancing rate of approximately 6.5%. In addition, we have $1.9 billion of floating rate debt that is impacted by changes in SOFA rates.\nOur floating rate debt does include our $1.2 billion term loan that has been swapped to a fixed rate through May of 2024. We expect that our same property portfolio stable, with occupancy improving over time, and we will continue to add to our income through placing developments into service over the next few years. That completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the lines for questions?"

Welcome to Q1 2023 BXP Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Helen Han, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVP of IR, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BXP's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. [Operator Instructions] If you have an additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen Thomas\n\nCEO, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover BXP's continued steady operating performance as demonstrated in our first quarter results. The key economic and market trends impacting our company and BXP's capital allocation activities and funding. Despite significant economic headwinds, BXP continued to perform in the first quarter.\nOur FFO per share was above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance, and we increased our FFO per share guidance for all of 2023. We completed 660,000 square feet of leasing in the first quarter with a weighted average lease term of 7.7 years and kept occupancy flat despite more challenging leasing market conditions.\nFinally, BXP just published its 2022 ESG report and announced our second annual ESG investor webcast for May 31. Though the office sector is clearly facing challenges in the current economic environment, there are 2 underappreciated trends, which we believe will have a significant impact on BXP's longer-term performance.\nFirst, the deceleration in leasing, which we forecasted last year and are now experiencing driven primarily by the economic slowdown, a cyclical trend rather than remote work a secular trend. In other words, we believe the current leasing slowdown is cyclical and will recover along with economic conditions.\nOur clear evidence for this observation is our own leasing experience. In 2022, when the economy was much stronger and significantly fewer workers were using our offices, we leased 5.8 million square feet, essentially a normal year just below our 10-year average level of leasing. This year, the economy is clearly weaker, but many more workers are back in the office and our leasing has slowed.\nThough we are not in a recession defined as negative GDP growth, approximately 75% of S&P 500 companies are forecasting lower earnings this quarter and aggregate earnings are expected to drop over 6%. There are seemingly daily announcements of corporate layoffs. With slowing growth, companies are more focused on cost control, reducing headcount and taking less or reducing their space. In addition, capital market volatility on the heels of recent bank failures drives companies to be more cautious in capital outlays, including capital required for leasing new space.\nWith more challenging economic conditions, the return to office trend continues to improve. Major tech companies have announced return to work expectations and specific policies and many companies in a variety of industries continue to tighten their requirements, increasing the days expected in the office.\nPresident Biden has mandated a substantial increase for in-person work at federal offices. U.S. West Coast cities, though improving, remain behind the rest of the U.S. and other global business centers in their return to office work. The second underappreciated trend is office users are much more discriminating about building quality than the current market sentiment regarding the overall office asset class.\nThe Premier Workplace segment continues to materially outperform the broader office market. Users are compelled to upgrade their buildings and workspaces to attract their workforce back to the office. Clients increasingly prefer assets with the highest quality managers and consistent and stable ownership, buildings facing debt default do not have the tenant improvement and leasing commission capital available to complete leases and are therefore uncompetitive.\nLastly, full or significant remote work is more frequently allowed and practiced for support workers across industries in areas such as accounting, IT and HR. This segment of the workforce does not as commonly occupy premier workplace assets, putting more pressure on the market for lower quality buildings.\nAs described previously, CBRE is tracking the performance of Premier workplaces in the U.S. and for the 5 CBDs, where BXP operates, premier workplaces represent an approximately 17% and of the 733 million square feet of space and less than 10% of the total buildings.\nIn the first quarter of this year, direct vacancy for Premier Workplaces increased only 20 basis points to 10.7% while direct vacancy for the balance of the market increased 80 basis points to 15.5%. Also for the first quarter, net absorption for the premier segment was a negative 200,000 square feet versus a negative 3.3 million square feet for the balance of the market.\nFor the last 9 quarters, net absorption for the Premier segment was a positive 6.9 million square feet versus a negative 28.6 million square feet for the balance of the market. Rents and rent growth are higher for Premier workplaces, and we believe the segment captures the majority of all gross leasing activity, including 2 buildings undergoing renovation, 94% of BXP CBD space is in buildings rated by CBRE as Premier workplaces, which has been and will be critical for our long-term success.\nMoving to private real estate capital markets, U.S. transaction volume for office assets slowed materially to $6.6 billion in the first quarter, down 47% from the fourth quarter of last year. The reduction was by no means an office-specific trend as transaction volume across all assets -- all real estate asset classes was also 43% lower over the same period.\nReal estate values have reset down due to higher capital costs, and sellers have so far been unwilling to accept lower prices, creating a bid/ask gap common in declining markets. Mortgage financing for office is challenging to arrange and available for only the highest quality leased assets and sponsors.\nGiven the dearth of transaction activity, office asset pricing is difficult to determine. But there were several data points of note in the quarter. In the Seaport of Boston, ARE announced the sale of a 37% interest in a lab development at 15 Necco Street to an offshore property company for a valuation of over $1,600 a square foot and approximately a 5.4% cap rate.\nThe building, which is being delivered into service later this year comprises just under 350,000 feet and is fully leased to a strong credit life science user for 15 years. In Downtown New York City, a global property company purchased the 49% interest to did not own in One Liberty Plaza for $426 a square foot at a 6 cap rate -- 6% cap rate from a global fund manager, of the 2.3 million square foot building is 80% leased.\nThere are several smaller non-premier workplaces currently in the market, testing pricing at cap rates of 7% or greater. Regarding BXP's capital market activity in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of a 50% interest in Worldgate, a residential conversion opportunity located on Worldgate Drive in Herndon, Virginia near Reston Town Center for $17 million.\nThe property currently consists of 2 vacant office buildings comprising 350,000 square feet and a 1,200 stall parking garage all situated on a 10-acre site. The plan, which is subject to receiving entitlements is to demolish the 2 office buildings and reuse a portion of the existing garage to support a 349 unit rental and for-sale residential development -- BXP will serve as managing member and developer in partnership with Artemis Real Estate Partners, the current owner of the project. Development is not expected to commence until 2024. Additional new acquisition opportunities will undoubtedly grow in this environment, and we will remain highly opportunistic and solely focused on premier workplaces, life science and residential development.\nWe added the previously described 290 and 300 Binney Street developments to our active construction pipeline this quarter and now have underway 16 office lab retail and residential projects as well as View Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center. These projects aggregate approximately 4 million square feet and $3.3 billion of BXP investment with $1.9 billion remaining to be funded and are projected to generate attractive yields upon delivery.\nWe have received recent inquiries about our funding sources and needs, which is understandable in the current market environment. We currently hold elevated levels of liquidity and have access to both the unsecured debt market and private secured mortgage market for select assets, albeit at higher rates and spreads than a year ago.\nWe could also monetize select residential assets and attract JV partners into our lease development pipeline. Our internal discussions on funding strategy are not about whether we are able to access capital, but rather how to best select and sequence our capital raising options to minimize costs and maximize flexibility. Mike will provide more details in his remarks.\nIn summary, despite unconstructive market conditions, BXP had another productive quarter with financial performance above and leasing in line with expectations. BXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our position in the premier workplace segment, our strong and liquid balance sheet with access to multiple capital sources, our significant development portfolio and progress and our potential to gain market share in both assets and clients due to the current market dislocation.\nLastly, on an organizational matter, John Lange, our Senior Vice President, who oversees the L.A. region has elected to pursue professional interests outside of BXP. John joined us 7 years ago and has been an important contributor to BXP's growth in the L.A. region. Melissa Cohen, a LA native and former project manager in BXP's New York office, will rejoin BXP as Head of Development for L.A. Alex Cameron, our current Head of Leasing in L.A. and Melissa will be BXP's senior leaders for our L.A. region. These changes will be effective at the end of June. Let me turn it over to Doug.\n\nDouglas Linde\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So I think it's fair to say that we are operating in a challenging real estate supply and demand environment. And as Owen stated, businesses continue to make pronouncements about the importance of in-person work, but office job reductions related to the economy have impacted both supply and demand. In our portfolio, we continue to see incremental pickup in daily activity as we look at the month-to-month trend lines, and we see weekly patterns emerging based upon industry.\nThe legal professions got a different perspective than asset management, which is different than private equity. People using their spaces at different times. The frequency of work, however, in the office is really about 3 days per week across our markets, where we track the data, and this includes San Francisco, obviously, our portfolio being primarily professional services and financial services. No city is back to the levels of urban work activity that existed in 2019.\nWe are aware of isolated instances, where an organization has required all their employees to work in their existing office most of the week and they don't have enough space, but that's just not the norm. The pendulum could swing back to where organizations find themselves short on space for their existing and future workforce, but it's not the way they're planning today. The most dynamic and expanding reservoirs of demand over the last decade, technology and life science users are focused on profitability, cost reduction and capital preservation.\nThis doesn't lead to near-term positive absorption. There's a lot of variability with the financial services and professional services firms space needs. Those that are reducing headcount through layoffs are replanning their facilities with less space. It's evident that some law firms in the market are signing leases with smaller footprints as they move to a more uniform office module, while a few are actually taking additional space.\nThe concentration of user demand strength in 2023 is broadly speaking, alternative asset managers, private equity, venture, hedge funds, specialized fund managers. These companies are growing their teams and their capital under management. This pool of clients typically wants to occupy premier workplaces and it's not surprising that BXP's strongest activity is at the General Motors Building in Manhattan, 200 Clarendon and the Prudential Center in Boston, 2,200 and 2,100 Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C., the urban core of Reston Town Center in Northern Virginia and our Embarcadero Center assets in San Francisco. By the way, we just don't have any space available at Salesforce Tower, which is why it's not on the list.\nThe challenging office supply picture is not a New York or a San Francisco story. There is high headline availability in virtually every market across the U.S. Availability rates are at or above 20% in coastal and Sunbelt markets. These availability rates published by the brokerage firms and reported as headlines track all of the space in every pocket of each market.\nWe spent the last 2 years redefining our business as being developers and operators of premier workplaces and explaining why these headline numbers hold much less relevant. Owen gave the most recent data, which demonstrates the dramatic bifurcation between premier workplaces and general office space.\nAvailability and premier assets matters and the location and the specific attributes of those buildings matter. The client looking at 399 Park Avenue is not considered sharing space on [ Third Avenue ] Midtown South or downtown. If a 20,000 square foot client wants to be in a premier building in the Back Bay of Boston on a single floor with primarily exterior office configurations, there are limited availabilities.\nIf a 40,000 square foot tenant -- client wants to be in view space north of 42nd Street and South of 59th Street between Fifth Avenue and Lexington, there are limited availabilities. This is why we could recapture a 30,000 square foot floor at 200 Clarendon this quarter and we leased the space as is with immediate occupancy to a new client. This is why we can lease the floor with a mid-2024 expiration at 399 Park Avenue this quarter with no downtime to a growing client at the building. Last quarter, I described the 50,000 square foot client in San Francisco, the lease space at Embarcadero Center, and had 2 alternatives outside of a renewal.\nThe headline information that was reported by the brokerage committee, it's true, it's factual but it's just not nearly as relevant as people think in our business. BXP's regional teams are leasing space. We completed 660,000 square feet of transactions during the first quarter. On our last call, we gave an expectation of 3 million square feet for the year, which translates to about 750,000 square feet per quarter on average.\nWe have reaffirmed this at the Citi conference in March in our public webcast. There were 57 leases across our markets. 29 leases were with new or growing tenants, 410,000 square feet and 28 renewals totaling 250,000 square feet. We had 10 expansions and 3 contraction. As we sit here today, we have signed leases that have yet to commence on our in-service vacancy, totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet and 1.2 million square feet of that space is anticipated to commence in 2023.\nThis quarter, we added a secondary occupancy statistic that shows the effect of these signed leases on our quarterly occupancy. Our headline in-service occupancy stands at 88.6% and with leases signed, but not commenced, it rises to 91%. This portfolio includes our in-service properties and it does not include the development portfolio, which is up to 4 million square feet and is 52% leased.\nWe currently have leases in negotiation totaling 900,000 square feet, and we have a current pipeline of additional active proposals totaling over 1.5 million square feet. I would expect us to sign 95% of the leases in negotiation and more than 50% of the 1.5 million square feet of proposals.\nSo to summarize, we have active dialogue on 1.65 million square feet of space as we end the first quarter of '23. If 40% of these leases are in vacant space or 223 expirations. It should add about 660,000 square feet of space to our occupancy. We have 1.2 million square feet of signed leases with an anticipated 2023 commencement.\nTogether with the leasing pipeline, this adds 1.86 million square feet to our occupancy. Our remaining 2023 expirations are 2.2 million square feet. We have additional activity across the portfolio and still expect to lease 3 million square feet this calendar year. The mark-to-market on the leases in the supplemental, show we were down about 3% overall and D.C. was down 47%, which was a little bit shocking. This is due to our restructuring of a 70,000 square foot Regal cinema lease in Springfield, Virginia.\nIf you exclude the Regal cinema lease, the portfolio was up 2.5% and D.C. was down 10%. We were up 21% in Boston, down 9% in New York City and up 6% in San Francisco. The leases we signed this quarter on second-generation space were essentially flat across the company, with Boston up and the other markets slightly down.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced 1 life science default on 12,000 square feet at 880 Winter Street where a forum biotech company shut down its U.S. operations. This was one of the spaces we built on a speculative basis in 2022. We are negotiating a new lease on the space as is with a rent that's 9% higher than the prior rent. To provide some perspective on our life science credit exposure, our total annual revenue from in-service life science clients is about $226 million or 8% of our total revenue. 70% comes from public companies with equity market values over $1 billion. The others 30%, $68 million is made up of 66 clients, 20 public and 46 privately funded.\nWe've also signed leases that have yet to commence with total annual revenue of $128 million, 90% is with Roche Genentech, AstraZeneca and the Broad Institute. Activity in the life science market continues to be slow across both Greater Boston and South San Francisco, and there is new unleased space being added to the market. There are a huge -- large requirements for the touring, but as I have previously discussed, the bulk of the demand is from small private companies that are looking for fully built space.\nOur new client at 880 Winter Street fits this profile. We are also negotiating 3 additional leases at the development project at 651 Gateway in South San Francisco totaling 57,000 square feet. The property will open in 2024, and each lease requires our partnership to complete turnkey spaces. BXP will outperform the market, and we will continue to lease the available space because our portfolio was fundamentally comprised of premier workplaces and the majority of the demand new and existing clients in the market want to be in these types of properties.\nMedium and small financial and professional service clients will make up the bulk of the leasing we completed in '23. We completed 57 leases during the first quarter. We had 4 leases over 30,000 square feet and only 1 above 50,000 square feet. Occupancy cans will be captured through lots of small- and medium-sized leases and renewals. We will have some contractions and we will also have some expansions.\nTour activity continues to be strongest in the Boston CBD, New York City Plaza District and San Francisco, where the concentration of small professional firm and financial firms are concentrated. I'll stop here and turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael LaBelle\n\nThanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So I am going to cover the details of our first quarter performance and also the changes to our guidance for the year. But before I do, I would like to address a couple of questions we've received from shareholders, and we'll start with a discussion of our liquidity, our near-term capital needs and the state of the debt markets from our perspective.\nThere's been a lot of talk in the media about the lack of financing available for commercial real estate. And while we agree that underwriting criteria is tighter and financing costs, both in terms of credit spreads and reference rates are higher there is financing available for high-quality, well-leased premier workplace assets and portfolios.\nIn fact, in the past 6 months, we issued $750 million of unsecured green bonds in the investment-grade bond market and extended and increased our term loan with a syndicate of banks to $1.2 billion, providing $470 million of incremental proceeds. We are currently in a strong position with $2.4 billion of liquidity comprised of $900 million of cash and full availability under our $1.5 billion line of credit.\nWe do have 2023 capital needs, including funding our development pipeline and refinancing expiring debt facilities. For the remainder of 2023, we project to spend approximately $750 million to fund our developments. Our consolidated 2023 debt maturities are limited to a $500 million bond issuance expiring in the third quarter of 2023.\nIf you extend the window into 2024, we have another $700 million coming due in the first quarter of 2024. The bond market experienced volatility and higher credit spreads in March, coming out of the bank failures over fears of a broader crisis. In April, the market has settled down, and our credit spreads have come in meaningfully.\nWe believe we could issue a new 10-year bond today at between 6.4% and 6.7%, which is inside the pricing we issued on a 5-year deal last November. Credit spreads are still wider than historical levels, but the market is open, and we expect to continue to monitor it as an option for our refinancing needs. In our joint venture portfolio, we just exercised a 1-year extension on our mortgage loan for the Marriott headquarters located in Bethesda, and we have an additional option to extend it to 2025.\nOur remaining 2023 mortgage expirations totaled just $287 million at our share, and we have an extension option available on $168 million of this. The expiring mortgages are for the Verizon anchor Hub on Causeway new development in Boston that is 94% leased and 500 North Capital in Washington, D.C. that is 100% leased. We expect to refinance or extend these loans in the mortgage market and are actively working on term sheets.\nAs Owen mentioned, we have a broad array of capital sources that we consistently evaluate that are available to us in varying amounts in cost to fund our capital requirements. The unsecured bond market has been a reliable debt capital source for us for over 20 years. We have a very liquid outstanding bond complex and a supportive core of fixed income investors who have partnered with us for years.\nAs I just mentioned, the market is opened, but at a cost higher than our historical levels. The mortgage market is also available to us. We have a large portfolio with over 90% of our assets unencumbered. This allows us to selectively secure assets if we want to raise capital and appropriately leveraged and well-leased premier workplace can be financed in today's mortgage market at pricing inside our bond pricing.\nWe're also active in utilizing institutional private equity to help fund our acquisitions and development activities. And although investors are highly selective, they continue to evaluate investment opportunities with us. We have an attractive pipeline of well-leased developments and existing properties that represent unique offerings to these investors.\nAsset sales are another source of capital. And in the past 4 years, we've sold over $2 billion of properties and have efficiently recycled the capital into newer investments. The asset sales market has definitely slowed dramatically with the increase in interest rates. So it is a lower probability for us in 2023. However, we have properties that we could sell, including assets in our multifamily portfolio that are more liquid in today's market.\nSo while the public discussion continues to be broadly pessimistic on real estate and the availability of capital, we continue to have plenty of flexibility with strong liquidity and multiple sources of debt and equity capital that we can turn to. Another question we've received from investors is about our dividend policy, given we are trading at a historically high 8% dividend yield.\nWe have maintained a consistent dividend since the beginning of 2020. Our FAD provides reliable coverage of our dividend, such that we're able to reinvest excess cash flow into the growth of our business. We've been successful in selling assets annually and fitting the gains on sale within our regular dividend policy without the need for special dividends.\nLong term, our goal is to maintain a steady dividend and increase it over time as our developments add to our income. In the near term, a slowdown in expected sales activity would create room in our dividend relative to the REIT distribution requirements. If our outlook for the economy and the capital markets becomes more negative and asset sales slow, we do have flexibility to modify our policy.\nNow I'd like to turn to our earnings results. We reported first quarter FFO of $1.73 per share. Our results exceeded the midpoint of our FFO guidance by $0.06 per share. Nearly all of the variance to our guidance is from higher-than-projected NOI from our portfolio with $0.05 coming from lower operating expenses and $0.01 coming from higher rental revenues and fee income.\nThe expense savings are the result of lower energy costs due to both lower commodity prices and reduced utilization related to the mild winter in the Northeast. We also incurred lower repair and maintenance expenses than expected. As a result, we're increasing our funds from operations guidance for 2023 by $0.04 per share at the midpoint. Our new range is $7.14 to $7.20 per share.\nOur full year guidance increase is less than the Q1 FFO beat as we expect the $0.03 of our Q1 operating expense savings will be moved into the rest of the year in the form of lower expense recoveries and the deferral of repair and maintenance expense. So the $0.04 increase in our full year guidance includes $0.03 of improvement in our portfolio NOI that is comprised of $0.02 of lower expenses and $0.01 of better-than-projected revenues.\nWhile we're increasing our portfolio NOI guidance overall, we remain comfortable with the same property guidance range that we offered last quarter. This includes our assumption that same-property NOI growth from 2022 will be flat at the midpoint of our range. While on a cash basis, we expect same-property NOI growth of 1% to 2.5%.\nWe have increased our guidance for fee income for the full year by $0.01 per share. The increase is a combination of higher construction management and development fees. We've made no changes to our interest expense assumptions. Currently, we are assuming an additional 25 basis point increase in short-term rates and then rates remaining flat for the rest of 2023.\nSo to summarize, we've increased our guidance range for funds from operation to $7.14 to $7.20 per share. The increase is $0.04 per share at the midpoint and it comes from $0.03 of better projected contribution from our portfolio and $0.01 of higher fee income.\nThe last item I would like to cover is a reminder of the diversification and credit quality of the leases in our portfolio. Doug provided some of the details on the 8% of our portfolio leased to life science clients. And if you take a deep dive on our technology clients, the results are very similar.\nTech clients comprise about 17% of our revenues and over 80% is from large publicly traded companies. We have 85 leases with smaller public and private technology companies with an average annual rent of about $1 million each. Our tech and life science clients comprise 25% of our revenue base. The rest of our portfolio consists of a diverse mix of financial services companies, law firms, other professional service firms, media, real estate, retail and manufacturing companies.\nOverall, our portfolio is incredibly diversified by client, by industry sector and by geography. And our weighted average lease term is approximately 8 years, which leads to manageable annual lease expiration exposure. This portfolio construction is by design, given our focus on premier workplaces that attract a high-quality client base that desires longer-term leases and are focused on attracting and retaining a talented workforce.\nOperator, that completes our formal remarks. If you could open up the line for questions, that would be great."

Welcome to the BXP's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Helen Han, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVP of IR, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BXP's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

We ask that those of you participating in the Q&A portion of the call to please limit yourself to one question. If you have any additional query or follow-up, please feel free to rejoin the que.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover BXP's continued strong operating performance as demonstrated in our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. I'll discuss key economic and market trends impacting BXP and finish with BXP's capital allocation decisions and activities.\nDespite increasing economic headwinds, BXP continued to perform in the fourth quarter and had strong overall operating results throughout 2022. Our FFO per share this quarter was above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance. Our FFO per share grew 15% in 2022 due to development deliveries and strong leasing activity. We completed 1.1 million square feet of leasing in the fourth quarter and 5.7 million square feet of leasing for all of 2022, which is 95% of our average annual leasing over the last 10 years. The weighted average term for leases signed in 2022 was 9.2 years.\nThis success can again be attributed to not only BXP's strong client relationships, and our team's execution, but also the increased share of tenant demand captured by premier workplaces, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio.\nBXP raised $1.2 billion in additional liquidity through a $750 million unsecured green bond offering and the extension and upsizing of a bank term loan ensuring funding for our sizable and substantially leased development pipeline in a challenging capital markets environment.\nAnd lastly, on 2022, BXP continues to be a decorated industry leader in sustainability, having most recently won NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award, named the highest ranking real estate company and 29th overall on Newsweek's List of Most Responsible Companies, and 1 of only 8 property companies named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\nNotwithstanding the running debate on whether the U.S. economy will experience a hard or soft landing, commercial real estate markets are currently in a recession. Many of our clients are experiencing a slowdown in growth or reductions in top line revenue, and as a result, are focused on cost control, including moderating headcount and space use. We all read the daily headlines of layoffs, which have been most significant in the technology industry, but are migrating into other sectors. Many companies, particularly in the technology sector are halting new requirements and/or giving back space to the market. The key culprit for the current economic slowdown is inflation, which sparked unprecedented Federal Reserve tightening measures last year including rapidly increasing interest rates, quantitative tightening measures and more regulatory scrutiny of banks. The better news is, inflation is starting to come down. The Federal Reserve is expected to moderate further interest rate increases with the Fed funds rate possibly peaking around 5%, and the capital markets with a 10-year U.S. treasury at 3.5% and rallying equity markets are much less hawkish on inflation than the Federal Reserve. We are not able to predict the depth or length of the current economic slowdown, but its trajectory is coming into clearer focus. Our goal is to position BXP for success regardless of the economy's trajectory, by carefully managing leverage and liquidity.\nThough leasing activity is declining due to corporate earnings pressure, the premier workplace segment of the office market continues to materially outperform. Users are increasingly interested in upgrading their buildings and workspaces to attract their workforce back to the office, resulting in an accelerating flight to quality in the office industry. As described previously, CBRE is tracking the performance of premier workplaces in the U.S. And for the 5 CBDs where BXP operates, Premier Workplaces represent approximately 17% of the 700 million square feet of space and less than 13% of the total buildings.\nAs of year-end 2022, direct vacancy for Premier workplaces was 9.6% versus 14.7% for the rest of the market.\nAlso for all of 2021 and 2022, net absorption for Premier workplaces was a positive 7.1 million square feet versus a negative 25.4 million square feet for the balance of the market. Rents and rent growth are higher for Premier workplaces, and we believe the segment captures well over half of all leasing activity.\nIncluding 2 buildings undergoing renovation, 94% of BXP CBD space is in buildings rated as premier workplaces, which has been and will be critical for our leasing success.\nMoving to real estate capital markets for office assets, U.S. transaction volume slowed materially to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, down 40% from the third quarter.\nTransaction volume across all real estate classes was down 36% over the same period. Mortgage financing is very challenging to arrange and available for only the highest quality leased assets and sponsors.\nFirst mortgage financing costs have risen materially over the past year based on both higher rates and credit spreads.\nGiven the dearth of transaction activity, office asset pricing is difficult to determine, but it is clear cap rates have risen. There were a handful of BXP comparable transactions of note in the quarter.\nIn the Route 128 quarter of Boston, 2 separate lab sales were completed for a total of $375 million; 1 sold to a REIT and another to an institutional investor.\nSo one of the transactions is a redevelopment, pricing parameters indicate a stabilized yield of at least 6% and pricing per square foot in the mid 900s.\nIn Sunnyvale, California, 2 separate and fully leased office complexes sold for $415 million, one to a private real estate company and the other to an international fund. Initial cap rates ranged from 4.8% to 6.2% and prices per square foot from $11.40 to $12.30.\nRegarding BXP's capital market activity in the fourth quarter, we closed both the previously described acquisition of a 20% -- 27% interest in 200 Fifth Avenue in New York City and the sale of the Avant, a luxury residential building in Reston.\nFor all of 2022, we acquired $1.6 billion of lab and office assets and completed over $860 million of dispositions of office and residential assets. So we have additional asset sales in our targeted pipeline. Completion of the dispositions will require more liquid capital market conditions.\nNew acquisitions will be opportunistic and solely focused on premier workplaces, life science and residential development. BXP's volumes for acquisitions and dispositions are very difficult to predict for 2023 given current market conditions.\nOur development pipeline continues to be active, delivering growth to our current and future financial results. This past quarter, we fully placed into service the 1.1 million square foot Reston Next premier workplace which is 90% leased on a long-term basis to Fannie Mae and VW of America. This project was delivered below budget on costs and is projected to yield 7.7% upon stabilization.\nWe also placed into service 880 Winter Street, a 244,000 square foot very successful office to lab conversion project located in Waltham that is 97% leased. We purchased the office building in 2019 for $270 a square foot, spent approximately $500 a square foot on the conversion and delivered the project at an initial cash yield of 10%.\nWe also commenced the conversion of 105 Carnegie Center, a 70,000 square-foot suburban office building in our Carnegie Center asset in Princeton to lab use. This is our first attempt at Life Science at Carnegie Center, and we have life science clients reviewing the opportunity.\nThere are 2 projects, 290 and 300 Binney Street in Cambridge that did not appear on our fourth quarter construction and progress schedule that we are commencing in the first quarter and have an impact on our current 2023 financial projections, which Mike will discuss in greater detail.\nAs described on our last call, Biogen is in the process of vacating the 300 Binney Street office building, and we will commence the conversion of the asset to lab use for the Broad Institute which has agreed to lease the building for 15 years. We have also completed the necessary predevelopment hurdles to commence the development of 290 Binney Street a 570,000 square foot, 16-story lab building leased to AstraZeneca for 15 years. We estimate that the project will cost approximately $1.2 billion and expected to be delivered in 2026 at an initial cash yield in the mid-6% range.\nGiven the annual escalations in the AstraZeneca lease, the initial FFO yield is materially higher.\n290 Binney Street is a complicated development and tailing the demolition of 1,136 stall parking garage, the temporary relocation of parking capacity from this garage, the construction of a subterranean Vault, which will house an electrical substation currently being permitted by Eversource and other facilitating agreements.\nCommencing 290 Binney Street also creates an obligation for BXP to build 121 Broadway, which is a 37-story, 440 unit residential tower, which will likely commence in 2024.\nIn addition to these 2 buildings, BXP also has remaining rights for an additional 580,000 square foot life science building in our Kendall Center development, which due to upfront infrastructure costs carried by the first 2 projects has the potential to be developed at significantly higher yields than 290 Binney Street.\nThese projects demonstrate the skill of BXP's development team in identifying an opportunity to creatively solve the community problem of locating a new electrical substation and having the expertise to bring the project to reality by solving problems for multiple interested stakeholders, thus creating a highly accretive development opportunity for BXP.\nAfter all of these movements and including the 290 and 300 Binney Street projects, our current development pipeline of 13 office lab and residential projects, as well as View Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center, aggregates approximately 4 million square feet and $3.3 billion of BXP investment that we project based on delivery date and lease-up assumptions to add more than $240 million to our NOI over the next 5 years at a 7.3% average cash yield on cost when stabilized. The commercial component of our development pipeline is 51% pre-leased.\nSo in summary, despite adverse market conditions, BXP had another very successful quarter and year with financial performance above expectations, strong FFO growth, significant leasing success and robust investments in capital reallocation activity.\nBXP is well positioned to weather the current economic slowdown given our premier workplace market position, our strong and increasingly liquid balance sheet, our significant and well-leased development portfolio in progress and our potential to identify additional investment opportunities in the current market dislocation.\nLet me turn the discussion over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So Owen really spent some time describing the totality of what's going on at BXP, and I'm going to be a little bit more concentrated today and talk about demand.\nEvery day seems to bring another announcement of a staff reduction from some large or medium-sized employer. And while these announcements have been concentrated in the technology industries, as Owen described, primarily big tech, we're also seeing them in the finance industry, the legal industry and broader corporate America.\nNow I can point to examples of companies in our portfolio that are growing. But we are the first to acknowledge that the pool of clients overall demand that we serve is unlikely to be growing their overall footprint in 2023, a.k.a., hard to see much in the way of positive absorption. If there's a silver lining in the job reductions that are being announced, it's an improvement in the labor availability and it's manifesting itself in encouraging ways. Fewer job listings being offered for remote work. Forms of hybrid work seem to be sticky, but the power dynamic between employers and employees is shifting. Companies are stepping up the days that workers are asked, required, cajoled to come into the office. In our portfolio, we're seeing a steady increase in the number of unique occupants that are in the office each week.\nWe measure the unique number of card swipes on a daily basis where we have turnstiles. These numbers vary day to day. And if I compare the best day in March of 2022, which is after the last sort of COVID Omicron surge, versus the best day in January, so a week ago, across the BXP portfolio, volume is up almost 40%.\nI don't know how others measure their usage. BXP measures against the number of seats we have in our spaces.\nOn a daily basis, utilization ranges from between 34% in San Francisco, 48% in Boston and 58% in New York City. And if we look at the number of unique users coming into our buildings on a weekly basis relative to the number of seats, we're currently seeing as much as 82% in New York City, 76% in Boston and 70% in San Francisco. Our clients are using their space. They're just not coming to the office every day.\nAs Owen said, we spent a better part of 18 months of redefining our business with you as being developers and operators of premier workplaces. As Owen described in his comments, the bifurcation between premier product and general office space continues to widen. The availability rates published by the brokerage firms and reported as headlines in business publications and newspapers track all of the space.\nA meaningful amount of the existing office inventory may have a higher and a better use as an alternative product, and it's not relevant to users searching for space today. Conversions will happen, and we are studying non-BXP buildings in our markets, but this process is going to take years. So the published statistics are going to be sticky even though much of the availability is not attractive to users at any price. In fact, it's hard to see a potential client looking at BXP offering that would consider many of the buildings captured in the broad market surveys.\nAgain, we have to acknowledge that there continues to be addition to new sublet or soon to be direct opportunities in premier space from technology companies, 181 Fremont Street in San Francisco being the latest example. Availability in premier space matters, but other issues matter even more. The floor plate size matters, the build-out configuration matters, amenities matter. In markets like Boston and San Francisco, parking availability matters, and the specific location matters.\nAs we explained in our press release last night, while our reported in-service occupancy declined in the quarter, as we said it would on our last call and at our NAREIT meetings in November, it is simply due to the addition of new in-service buildings that have leases that have not commenced and are reported as vacant. This includes Reston Next that is 69% occupied and 90% leased; and 880 Winter Street that's 85% occupied and 97% leased.\nExcluding those assets, our occupancy was actually up this quarter from 88.9% to 89.1% and if you do the math a little bit differently, and we include those buildings at their lease percentages, the portfolio would still be at 89.1%. So our in-service portfolio is picking up occupancy.\nAs we sit here today, we have signed leases on our in-service vacancy, totaling 1.5 million square feet. In the fourth quarter, we completed 145,000 square feet of leasing in our development portfolio, which is now up to 1.6 million square feet leased when we include 300 Binney and 290 Binney, which as Owen said, are not yet on our development pipeline. We completed 2 transactions totaling 90,000 square feet at 2100 Penn in the CBD of DC, which now stands at 81.3% leased.\nWe executed 1.1 million square feet of leases in the fourth quarter with New York, Boston and the D.C. regions, leading the way with about 300,000 square feet each in San Francisco of 200,000 square feet. 48% of the square footage came from new clients, 39% were renewals and 11% were expansions. Some of the renewing clients did reduce their footprint as part of the extension.\nEven in the midst of a slowdown in business activity and job reductions, there are still businesses that are expanding their footprints.\nThe mark-to-market on the leases we signed this quarter were up, 7% in Boston; 9% in San Francisco; flat in New York City; and down 11% in D.C.\nIt should come as no surprise that we think BXP's premier workspace portfolio is highly differentiated, but on top of that, our operating teams are the best in the business. I want to describe 3 transactions we accomplished in the fourth quarter that illustrate our team's creativity.\nIn Boston, we were getting 100,000 square feet block of space back in one of our assets. The team identified a client that typically does not do direct deals with landlords but generally looked at sublet space. We engaged the principles in a tour of the space. The space was in great condition, and we were able to secure a lease that met the tenant's desire to have an attractive annual rent as possible in a premier building with limited capital outlay and make a long-term commitment. The lease was executed in late December.\nIn San Francisco, a client with a fast-approaching termination option in its existing non-BXP building wanted to move to view space. They toured the market in early December and identified 2 spaces in the 34% available market that met their needs. On December 26, we signed a binding letter of intent. The client understood they were not taking any counter party risk with BXP, and we signed the lease for 50,000 square feet or 2.5 floors that were vacant on January 16.\nIn October, our New York team identified a client that had a lease expiration and no ability to renew in place in mid-2023, which is a very tight timeline. We sent an unsolicited proposal for 2 vacant floors in our 53rd Street campus.\nWith some persistence we were able to arrange a tour, we mobilized our construction department to deliver the space per their needs. And in December, we signed a lease for 2 vacant floors and an option for a third.\nOwen mentioned that we delivered our life science project at 880 Winter Street this quarter. We also completed our first lease at 651 Gateway. We have available space as well at our 2 developments in Waltham. The life science market is also experiencing a slowdown in demand.\nAt the present time, we've not made any commitments to build additional projects other than 290 Binney Street, which is 100% leased to AZ and the 70,000 square foot project that Owen described at Carnegie Center. It's a challenging market. There is not going to be positive market absorption in the near term. We believe that BXP will outperform the market, and we will lease our available space because our portfolio is fundamentally comprised of premier workspaces and the demand that is in the market wants to be in these types of properties. Medium and small financial and professional service clients will make up the bulk of the leasing we complete in 2023. We completed 72 leases during the fourth quarter. Only 1 lease was above 100,000 square feet.\nTour activity continues to be strongest in the Boston CBD and New York City markets where the concentration of technology users is less pronounced and the weighting of market occupancy means more heavily towards traditional financial and professional services firms, not surprisingly, the most active buildings in our portfolio are the GM Building and 200 Clarendon.\nWith that, I'll stop and turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive VP, Treasurer & CFO, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I plan to cover the details of our fourth quarter performance and the changes to our 2023 earnings guidance. However, I would like to start with a summary of our recent capital raising activities. We've been very busy in the capital markets and have substantially bolstered our liquidity heading into 2023.\nIn the last 120 days, we've executed on 3 transactions in 3 different markets. We sold one of our residential buildings in Reston Town Center for $141 million and a 4.3% cap rate. We issued $750 million of 5-year unsecured green bonds. And in January, we extended and upsized our corporate unsecured term loan to $1.2 billion, an increase of $470 million.\nIn aggregate, the net proceeds raised from these deals is $1.35 billion, and we now have liquidity of $2.6 billion, which puts us in an extremely strong position to complete our development pipeline, including our recently commenced 570,000 square foot fully pre-leased 290 Binney Street Life Science project, as well as provide additional capital for other opportunities that may arise.\nWe've also reduced our 2023 loan maturity exposure to $930 million which is comprised of $500 million of senior unsecured notes that expire in September and 5 expiring mortgages totaling $430 million at our share, the majority of these mortgages have embedded extension options, and we anticipate renewing or refinancing all of these facilities.\nGiven the challenging state of the current debt markets, particularly with respect to the mortgage markets, we are very well positioned.\nNow I'd like to turn to our fourth quarter earnings results. We reported fourth quarter FFO of $1.86 per diluted share and full year 2022 FFO of $7.53 per diluted share. This is $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of our guidance and $0.02 ahead of Street consensus. The improvement was primarily from better performance in our portfolio with our NOI of about $4 million or $0.02 per share ahead of our forecast.\nThe outperformance was a mix of higher lease revenue, stronger results from our hotel in Cambridge and higher building service income, especially in New York City, where we see the highest space utilization. The portfolio outperformance was partially offset by $0.01 of higher net interest expense related to our $750 million green bond offering that was not part of our original guidance.\nAlthough not part of FFO, I do want to describe that we took a $51 million or $0.29 per share noncash impairment charge in the quarter, reducing the book value of our equity interest in our Dock 72 property located in Brooklyn, New York. This building is owned in a joint venture where we hold 50%. The building has suffered from weak leasing conditions in Brooklyn and last quarter, the primary client contracted by 2 floors. It's currently just 25% occupied, although it is 42% leased, including leases that have not yet commenced.\nOverall, we had a strong year in 2022. We increased revenue by 8% and our FFO by 15% over 2021. Our growth came from our same property portfolio as well as our developments and our acquisitions. Our same-property NOI increased 4% over 2021, which was the high end of our range. And on a cash basis, it was even stronger with cash NOI growth in our same-property portfolio of 6.5% over 2021.\nOur development deliveries added $0.24 per share to our 2022 earnings and our acquisitions net of our dispositions added $0.10 per share.\nNow I'd like to turn to an update to our 2023 guidance. As we detailed in our press release, the 2 most significant changes to our 2023 FFO guidance are the impact of commencing our 290 Binney Street development and the interest expense associated with our new financings. We did not incorporate 290 Binney in our guidance last quarter due to several significant contingencies we needed to clear prior to starting the project that were outside of our control. Our team successfully closed out these items late in the fourth quarter, and we're able to start the project in January. The development plan includes closing and demolishing the existing Binney Street garage. That garage produced $8.6 million of NOI in 2022, and we will lose this income in 2023 and going forward until the completion of the development, which will include a new underground parking facility.\nAs Owen described, the project is projected to be highly accretive to our future FFO. And by the way, all of the loss garage income is incorporated into those development returns.\nWe're also required by GAAP to expense the garage demolition costs of approximately $3.2 million. We expect to incur the demolition expense in the first and second quarters of 2023 with no impact thereafter as the demolition will be complete.\nThese 2 items related to 290 Binney Street will result in $11.8 million of lower FFO in 2023 or $0.07 per share.\nWith respect to our financing activity, we disclosed in our press release in November that our $750 million green bond offering would add $0.08 per share to our 2023 net interest expense and reduce our FFO guidance.\nAs a result, we expect the aggregate impact of starting 290 Binney and issuing incremental debt capital will reduce our 2023 FFO by $0.15 per share.\nDespite this, our new guidance range for diluted FFO of $7.08 to $7.18 per share is a reduction of only $0.09 per share at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter. That means we've increased the projected contribution to FFO from other areas.\nAlso, we previously communicated the impact of our bond offering, so the reduction is really only $0.01 per share from our November adjusted guidance.\nThe projected increases come from 3 places: First, excluding 290 Binney Street, our assumption for incremental contribution to NOI from acquisitions and developments is up $0.02 per share. The increase is from higher contribution from our 205th Avenue acquisition and better than projected leasing in our development pipeline. Doug described the increased leasing this quarter in the pipeline, and some of that will generate revenues in 2023.\nSecond, our revised assumption for net interest expense is lower by $0.03 per share, net of the impact of the bond offering. And this improvement is primarily from higher earnings on our cash balances and higher capitalized interest from changes in our development spend and higher interest capitalization rate.\nAnd last, we've increased our guidance for development and management services income by $2 million or $0.01 per share, reflecting higher projected construction management fees.\nSo to summarize, we've modified our 2023 guidance range for diluted FFO to $7.08 to $7.18 per share a decline of $0.09 per share at the midpoint. The changes are the result of costs from starting 290 Binney Street of $0.07 and higher interest expense from our bond offering of $0.08, and these reductions are partially offset by higher contributions to NOI from acquisitions and developments of $0.02, higher interest income and capitalized interest of $0.03 and higher fee income of $0.01. Our 2023 forecast results in a projected reduction in FFO of 5% from last year after growing 15% in 2022. The reduction is wholly due to the significant increase in interest rates as our portfolio NOI continues to grow, and we have a significant pipeline of accretive developments that are delivering over the next few years.\nAs Owen described, it appears that we are close to the end of the Fed's tightening cycle so interest rate should not be the same headwind going forward. The last thing I would like to mention is that we intend to change the timing of our initial issuance of annual guidance starting next year. We plan to provide guidance for 2024 with our fourth quarter earnings release, similar to the other companies in our sector.\nThat completes all of our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the lines for questions?"

Welcome to BXP's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\n(Operator Instructions)\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Helen Han, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVP of IR, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BXP's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President; and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. (Operator Instructions).\nI would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover BXP's continued strong execution, as demonstrated in our third quarter results. I'll provide a brief update to my remarks at our recent investor conference on the economy, return to office dynamics in the premier workplace market. I'll discuss private equity capital market conditions for office real estate, BXP's capital allocation activities, and I will provide a reminder from the investor conference of BXP's strategic shifts given current market conditions.\nOur FFO per share this quarter was well above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance, and we once again increased our forecast for full year 2022. We completed 1.4 million square feet of leasing just below our long-term average leasing activity for the third quarter. And year-to-date, we've leased 4.6 million square feet, which is meaningfully above our long-term leasing activity for the first 3 quarters of the year.\nThis success is due to our team's strong execution, increasing return to the office behavior by workers and the strong preference of our clients for premier workplaces, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio. Also in the quarter, BXP reinforced its ESG credentials by earning the highest 5-star rating in the 2022 GRES assessment as well as its 11th consecutive Green Star recognition. We also commenced a partnership with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority as part of the Empire building challenge, a public-private effort to support low-carbon retrofits and high-rise buildings in New York City to reduce emissions and combat climate change. As a company, we remain focused on climate action and are on track to achieve carbon-neutral operations in 2025.\nNow I covered in detail at BXP's investor conference in September, our views of economic conditions, client preferences and in-person work behavior and market statistics for premier workplaces. So in terms of what's new, inflation unfortunately remains resilient. The Fed remains committed to taming it through higher interest rates, and as a result, markets remain volatile. Workers continue to return to the office as our bad swipes grow each week, led by nontechnology industry clients.\nPremier workplaces, as defined by CBRE, represent only 17% of the office inventory in the 5 CBDs where we operate, and this segment continues to outperform the broader office market. At the end of the third quarter, vacancy in these 5 CBDs was 9.1% for Premier workplaces and 14.8% for the rest of the market. Net absorption in the third quarter was negative 200,000 square feet for Premier workplaces and negative 1.7 million square feet for the rest of the market. Net absorption for the last 7 quarters was negative 900,000 square feet for Premier workplaces and negative 17.3 million square feet for the balance of the market, obviously, a very significant difference.\nGiven that 94% of BXP CBD space competes in the premier workplace market, we believe it's increasingly necessary to understand operating trends for the premier workplace segment of the market to assess and forecast our leasing performance. In terms of real estate capital markets, transaction volume for office assets slowed to $18 billion in the third quarter, down 11% from the second quarter and down 41% from the third quarter last year. We expect transaction volumes to decline further, particularly in the next few quarters. Debt financing is increasingly expensive and difficult to arrange and many institutional buyers that withdrawn from the market due to real estate over allocations caused by the denominator effect and/or a view that more attractive entry points for new investments will be forthcoming in future quarters. There are, however, were several transactions of note in the third quarter.\nIn the office sector, the most significant transaction was our sale of 601 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C. for $531 million to a non-U.S. property company. The 480,000 square foot building is 98% leased and sold for a 5.1% initial cap rate and $1,110 a square foot. In New York City, 1330 Avenue of the Americas sold for $320 million to a private investment firm. The 536,000 square foot building is 85% leased and sold for just under $600 a square foot and a 5.7% cap rate. In the lab sector, there were 4 significant transactions completed in Cambridge, the Seaport District of Boston and South San Francisco for a total of over $1.6 billion. Pricing ranged from a 4.2% to a 5.5% cap rate and approximately $1,200 to $2,200 per square foot.\nBXP was active this quarter with capital allocation. We completed a significant transaction with Biogen involving 2 adjacent buildings in our Kendall Center project. We acquired 125 Broadway, a 271,000 square foot lab building that Biogen has agreed to lease back for 6 years for $592 million, which is $2,185 a square foot. Immediately adjacent is 300 Binney Street, 195,000 square foot office building owned by BXP and leased to Biogen for 6 remaining years. We terminated Biogen's lease will convert the building to lab use upsized to 240,000 square feet and entered into a new lease with the Broad Institute for 15 years at significantly higher rents. The total cost to redevelop 300 Benning Street is $210 million, and the building will be delivered in the fourth quarter of '24. For both investments, the projected blended initial cash return is over 7%, including the acquisition cost of 125 Broadway and the redevelopment cost forgone Biogen rent and initial cost basis for 300 Binney Street. The projected blended GAAP yields are materially higher given the 3% annual rent escalations in both the Biogen and Broad Institute leases.\nWe also continue to advance predevelopment work for 290 Binney Street, a 570,000 square foot lab development that is 100% pre-leased to AstraZeneca and our 121 Broadway residential tower, also both located in Kendall Center. Assuming all predevelopment hurdles are achieved, we expect these projects will commence in early 2023. Strategically, we are making major steps forward in our life science ambitions by acquiring, developing and redeveloping at attractive yields, significant lab space at Kendall Center, one of the leading preferred locations for life science clients in the world. We also just announced an agreement to acquire a 27% interest in 200 Fifth Avenue, 1 of the top 5 premier workplaces in the Midtown South submarket of New York City located directly on Madison Square Park. The building comprises 870,000 square feet and is 93% leased to leading clients such as Tiffany, Gray Advertising and (inaudible). The acquisition price for our interest implies a building valuation of $1.05 billion, which equates to just over $1,200 a square foot and a 5.3% initial cap rate.\nThe building has a $600 million first mortgage that matures in 2028 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.34%, which is well below current market rates. BXP will assume management and leasing from the current developer who is monetizing their interest in the asset. We are entering into the existing partnership, and as a result, we'll grow our relationship with JPMorgan Global Alternatives, a leading real estate investment adviser. This investment was sourced off market. Strategically, we are excited to grow our presence in Midtown South and had such a leading premier workplace to the BXP portfolio. We remain active with dispositions as well given the recent announcement of our contract to sell the Avant, a 15-story 359-unit luxury multifamily building in Reston, which we built in 2013. The sale price is $141 million or $393,000 per unit, which represents a 4.3% cap rate on current NOI. We also sold a 10-acre land parcel in Loudon County Virginia for $27 million to a data center developer. Both sales, along with 601 Mass Ads will be like-kind exchange with the Madison Center acquisition.\nOur previously described strategy to reallocate capital from the Washington, D.C. region to Seattle is now complete, having sold assets totaling approximately $700 million to fund the $730 million acquisition. We do not anticipate any further sales this year, and our total dispositions in 2022 is projected to be $864 million. Our development pipeline remains robust as we added this quarter a 104,000 square foot building at 140 Kendrick Street and Needham math that we are redeveloping to net zero carbon performance for Wellington Management. And the 118,000 square foot 760 Boylston Street retail building at the Prudential Center in Boston that is also fully leased.\nOur current development pipeline of 13 office lab residential and retail projects as well as view Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center, aggregates 4.4 million square feet and $2.7 billion of investment that we project based on delivery date and lease-up assumptions to add nearly $200 million to our NOI over the next 5 years at a 7.4% weighted average cash yield on cost when stabilized.\nThe commercial component of our development pipeline is 52% pre-leased. These figures exclude the positive contribution of 300 Binney Street, which will be added to the development pipeline in the first quarter of next year. In closing, I'd like to reiterate the strategic shift BXP is executing as a result of the pandemic and current economic slowdown. We will continue to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace industry and leverage our strengths in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share. We will pursue attractive asset class adjacencies where BXP has a track record of success, which today are life sciences, as evidenced most recently by the transaction with Biogen and multifamily development.\nWe will continue to raise the quality bar for our portfolio and actively recycle capital by selling assets as we did in 2022, subject to market conditions. And lastly, given rising interest rates and financial market turbulence, we will prioritize risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels and being highly selective in new investment commitments. The near-term challenges in the capital markets confront BXP in our industry, we are confident our platform, strategy and team will build market share and continue to create value over the long term.\nLet me turn the discussion over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, and good morning, everybody. So I'm going to pivot the discussion this morning to our 2023 earnings guidance. We expected and saw a number of notes last night. So obviously, this is of critical importance to everybody. And I think we outlined a bunch of the critical variables in the press release, and Mike is going to provide some commentary on the most significant components in his remarks. I am going to focus my remarks on our in-service operating portfolio, which is really driving our same property expectations. But I'm going to start with what happened in the third quarter because I think the trends that I'm describing are going to be relatively relevant to our forward assumptions as we think about 2023.\nSo the third quarter was another really good leasing quarter for BXP. It's now the sixth straight quarter of strong overall leasing activity in the portfolio. Just to remind everybody, beginning in the second quarter of '21, we signed 1.2 million, 1.4 million, 1.8 million, 1.2 million, 1.9 million and this quarter, 1.4 million square feet of leases. So that's about 6.3 million over the last 12 months. Obviously, it's a deceleration between the second -- the third quarter from the second quarter.\nWe have successfully executed leases with clients in the midst of the delta variant, the Omicron variant, remote work fits and starts, significant labor market headwinds and now what is surely a pullback in business activity. The Boston CBD led our activity this quarter with about 260,000 square feet of leases, including some renewals expansions and the addition of new clients into the portfolio. The mark-to-market on the previously leased space and again, giving you data on the leases that were signed this quarter, not leases that are in our supplemental, which may have happened 2 or 3 or 4 years ago, but the mark-to-market on the spaces this quarter was 15% positive. The lease of 300 Binny Street dominated our Cambridge activity this quarter, and because we are moving from a 2011 office lease to a 2024 Lab lease, the markup is over 250%. So it's a very, very significant increase. The suburban 128 workspace market remains slow with all of our leasing under 10,000 square feet other than a 55,000 square foot renewal that we did, there, the markup was about 3%. This was also an unusually busy quarter for our retail space, including the 118,000 square feet at 750 Boylston, we completed 181,000 square feet of retail leasing in the Boston region this quarter. We didn't complete any new life science leasing in the Waltham, Lexington portfolio, where we have our buildings under construction.\nThe life science market has seen a significant slowdown. We have available space of both of these developments that we are aggressively marketing. As we discussed at our Investor Day, there are a number of other suburban buildings that we have been vacating in order to be in a position to redevelop them as lab buildings. These buildings are not yet under development, so they reduced the portfolio occupancy that we're showing. At the present time, we have not made any commitments to begin any additional developments that these assets, but we are vacating these buildings intentionally.\nIn New York City, we completed 250,000 square feet of leasing, much like Boston, in Manhattan, we saw a number of renewals, expansions and new clients join the portfolio. the mark-to-market on the second-generation space that was recently occupied was down about 4%. New activity in New York City was off in September, but we have seen a meaningful pickup during the month of October. As a case in point, on September 30, we had no active discussions on our 120,000 square foot block of space at 599 Lexington Avenue. Today, we have 3 active proposals covering over 70,000 square feet of that space. We completed another lease at Dock 72 this quarter, but WeWork relinquished space on October 1 that will mute the contribution to occupancy as you look at it next quarter.\nIn Princeton, we completed 6 transactions with professional and financial firms totaling 40,000 square feet with an increase of rent of 3.5%. In D.C., we completed 4 leases for about 100,000 square feet. This is in CBD including 1 lease renewal with a markdown of about 12%. Now remember in D.C., the lease structure has 2% to 3% annual increases for leases that are generally 10 to 15 years. So in virtually every renewal, the last year of a 10- to 15-year-old lease with a 2.5% to 3% increase is less than the starting rent of the new lease. So that's typically what we see all the time there.\nSmall financial and professional service firms made up the activity in Northern Virginia, where we saw about 50,000 square feet of activity and the largest lease was only 15,000 square feet. The markdown was about 3.5% on that portfolio. We continue to make progress at 2100 Penn, where we have 90,000 square feet of leases under negotiation that will bring that asset to 80% leased.\nFinally, in San Francisco, the story is the same as the other markets though the lack of technology demand is more impactful on overall market segments. We completed 8 CBD leases all under 11,000 square feet with professional services and financial clients. The markup was flat with an average starting rent of about $100 a square foot. Down in the Valley, we did 92,000 square feet with 3 renewals and added 1 client. The 60 basis points of occupancy loss this quarter was in line with our comments and expectations from last quarter. These 3 assets were removed from the portfolio. 601 Massachusetts Avenue, obviously, which was sold and 100% leased, 140 Kendrick Street Building A, which is 100% leased is in redevelopment and our large box at the Prudential Center, 760 Boylston, which is 100% leased and in redevelopment. Shearson, 350,000 square foot 20-year lease renewal at 599 lex commenced this quarter, and they relinquished 120,000 square feet, the block I was describing.\nBiogen moved out of the first portion of 300 Binny Street, which will eventually grow by 40,000 square feet when it's converted to lab and is fully preleased. The partial termination is reflected in our statistics not the new lease. Biogen will vacate the rest of this 195,000 square foot building in the first quarter of 2023. So we're going to lose occupancy on that as we redevelop it for the long-term addition of a liability. At Santa Monica Business Park, we had a post-movie operation that completed their use of space this quarter and they moved out. Our second-generation release synthesis for the quarter, if you look at our FAD in particular, include the Shearman transaction at 599 Lex. They converted a bunch of their free rent to TI and the entire cost for that 20-year 350,000square foot is in the Fed this quarter, which is why the Fed looks unusual.\nThe global central bank tightening has resulted in softened demand in all the markets, while tours continue and leases under construction move forward under negotiation move forward, there is less urgency from clients to make new commitments. We have conversations with potential clients during space tours who acknowledge that economic uncertainty is impacting space decisions as we consider our expectations for leasing completions in '23, and we're factoring the impact of a materially slower economy, softer business performance and reduced demand for space. We expect the bulk of our leasing will continue to come from small- and medium-sized professional and financial services firms.\nSo as we think about '23, let's start with what we know. We have signed leases on more than 886,000 square feet of in-service on vacant space that are not in our occupancy figures. Approximately 700,000 will commence in 2023, the remainder in '24. At the end of the third quarter, we had active leases under negotiation in the in-service portfolio of about 800,000 square feet, 270,000 of that would currently cover currently vacant space that will go into service in 2023. The rest is on our near-term expirations.\nIn sum, we have visibility on about 1 million squares feet of currently vacant space and about 500,000 square feet of expiring leases. The remainder of '22 and '23 totals about 3 million square feet of expirations. This would mean we need to lease about 1.8 million square with 2023 commencements to remain flat. We typically leased more than 1 million square feet on a quarterly basis. Obviously, I described what happened over the last 6 quarters where the lowest was about 1.2 million. The issue is the timing of these commitments on vacant space, that's the big wildcard. We just don't know if we sign a lease, whether the space is going to be in a shell condition or an as-is condition and whether that lease is going to commence in 2023 or 2024. What we said last quarter remains true. We will see a slight decline over the next few quarters as we wait for all signed leases to commence but in spite of our less robust leasing expectations, we still anticipate an improvement as we move into 2024.\nTour activity continues to be strongest in the Boston CBD and New York City markets where the concentration of technology users is the least pronounced and the weighting of market occupancy leads more heavily towards financial and professional services firms. Consistent with my earlier remarks on the third quarter, small and medium-sized financial and professional services firms continue to be the active portion of our portfolio as those tenants clients look for premier workspaces. These users are also active, though to a lesser extent, in D.C., San Francisco and Reston.\nWe have all seen the announcements regarding higher increases, job reductions through attrition and explicit job cuts that are occurring on a consistent basis from many of the large technology employers. In some cases, these announcements coincide with decisions to put space on sublet market. It's hard to envision much technology-related demand growth in 2023. Owen described the stark divergence between premier workplaces and everything else. When clients do make space decisions, we expect them to gravitate to premier workplaces that we have at BXP. I want to make a few more points about the same property portfolio before I hand the speaker over to Mike.\nThe elimination of income from 300 Binney Street as we redeveloped this fully leased building into a lab building is about $10 million in 2023 relative to '22. The reduction in income from the Boston suburban assets as well as building a Carnegie Center and Shady Grove properties in Maryland that we are now enabling for life science constitutes a reduction of about $10 million in 2023 from 2022. This positions us to add life science portfolio properties over time.\nWe expect our parking income to be about 90% of the 2019 level and up about 6% from '22 estimates. Our retail portfolio has come back in Boston, New York City and D.C. where we have a significant number of new spaces under construction with 23 openings. The West Coast continues to be a laggard. We expect little change in contribution from retail in San Francisco in '23. The daily traffic in our West Coast portfolio continues to be dramatically lower than the East Coast. We continue to provide extensive subsidies to many of our retail tenants in San Francisco. In spite of the challenges with the new lease at 760 Boylston, we expect the overall contribution from retail to return to 2019 levels by the middle of '24 when the lease of 760 commences.\nIn summary, we have reduced our total leasing expectations in '23 due to the issues stemming from the aggressive battle against inflation and the ensuing slowdown in the economy. We still expect occupancy improvement in '23, though at a reduced rate. Our flat same-store guidance is based on these variables. Mike, take it away.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive VP, Treasurer & CFO, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Doug. Good morning. So today, I plan to cover the details of our third quarter performance and also the increase to our 2022 full year guidance. And I will spend most of my time describing the details of our 2023 initial earnings guidance. The third quarter results were strong. We reported third quarter funds from operation of $1.91 per share that was $0.04 per share higher than the midpoint of our guidance. The improvement came from better-than-anticipated portfolio performance. Higher revenues contributed $0.03 per share to our results from earlier than projected revenue commencement on space that we delivered to clients ahead of schedule. And we also exceeded our budget for parking revenues, particularly in Boston, where return to office continues to grow. Lower operating expenses also contributed $0.03 per share, this was primarily from lower-than-projected repair and maintenance costs, most of which will be deferred into the fourth quarter. These positives were partially offset by the termination of our lease with Biogen at 300 Binney Street in Cambridge. The lost revenue resulted in a $0.02 per share reduction in revenue versus our budget that assumed full rent and occupancy for the quarter.\nWhile not part of FFO, our net income included gains on asset sales of $262 million or $1.50 per share, primarily from the sale of 601 Mass Avenue in Washington, D.C. Our asset sales this quarter raised $540 million in net cash proceeds. On the new investment side, our acquisition of 125 Broadway, a fully leased lab facility in Cambridge utilized $592 million of cash.\nFor the rest of 2022, we have increased our guidance for full year funds from operations to $7.51 to $7.53 per share. That's an increase of $0.02 per share at the midpoint from our prior guidance. The increase is projected to come from higher revenue from the portfolio and our 125 Broadway acquisition, partially offset by the deferral of third quarter operating expenses into the fourth quarter and higher interest expense from both higher floating interest rates and incremental debt from funding our new investments.\nThe new [bid] midpoint of our 2022 guidance represents strong growth in FFO and of $0.96 per share or 15% over 2021. At the midpoint of our guidance, our growth is comprised of 3.75% year-over-year improvement in our same-property NOI and that adds $0.35 per share, $0.63 per share of external NOI growth from acquisitions and developments coming online, and $0.16 per share of lower interest expense from locking in low rates in our financing activities last year. These positives are partially offset by the loss of $0.15 per share from asset sales and $0.03 per share of other items, primarily higher G&A expense. Overall, we expect 2022 to be one of the strongest years for earnings growth in the company's history.\nNow I'd like to turn to our initial guidance for 2023. The most significant impact by far to next year's guidance is the dramatic increase in interest rates in 2022, which is expected to continue into 2023. Stubborn inflation is leading to even more aggressive actions by the Fed that are having a meaningful impact on borrowing costs. Our assumptions include the Fed increasing short-term rates to 4.75% which drives an increase in the borrowing cost under our line of credit and term loan facilities into the high 5% range. We currently have $1.9 billion of floating rate debt that comprises just 14% of our share of total debt. So we still have the vast majority of our debt being fixed.\nOur floating rate debt includes outstanding amounts under our line of credit, our $730 million term loan and $800 million, representing our share of floating rate debt in our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio. In addition, we anticipate that our floating rate debt will likely increase in 2023 as we use our line of credit to fund a portion of our development spend. A change in our assumption for short-term rates of 50 basis points either way, impacts our projected earnings by $0.06 per share.\nOwen described the new acquisitions and developments that we announced during the quarter. This use of capital results in a projected $50 million of incremental interest expense. So overall, our assumptions for interest expense in 2023 are an increase of approximately $122 million at the midpoint of our range. This amount includes our consolidated interest expense and our share of unconsolidated joint venture interest expense. At the midpoint, this is an increase of $0.69 per share of interest expense from 2022.\nDoug provided a substantial amount of detail on the changes in our same-property portfolio. Our leasing assumptions reflect the uncertainty in the broader economic environment that has resulted in elongating the lease-up of some of our vacant and expiring space. In addition, as Doug said, we have several projects that we have targeted for future life science conversions where we are intentionally creating vacancy. We still expect to have a productive leasing year and we have a large backlog of signed leases and leases and negotiation that will go into occupancy over the next 12 months.\nOverall, we expect our occupancy to be relatively stable year-over-year. We project our 2023 same-property NOI growth to be flat from 2022, and we expect that we will have positive same-property cash NOI growth our guidance assumes growth of 1% to 2.5%. We anticipate that we will see strong external growth in 2022 from the delivery of development and the impact from a full year of our 2022 acquisition program. Next year, we will fully deliver our 880 Winter Street life science facility that is 97% leased. Our carbon net zero redevelopment of our building at 140 Kendrick Street that is 100% leased and View Boxton, our immersive observation experience at the Prudential Center. We will also see a full year from our 2022 deliveries, including our Google building in Cambridge, 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue and Reston Next.\nIn aggregate, we project our developments will add between $55 million and $65 million in incremental NOI in 2023. This year, we acquired Madison Center in Seattle and 125 Broadway in Cambridge and we just announced the acquisition of an interest in 200 Fifth Avenue in New York City that Owen described. In 2023, we project these acquisitions to provide an incremental $45 million to $50 million to our NOI. We were also an active seller in 2022. And as Owen described, we currently have the Avant residential building under contract. In total, we project sales for the year of $864 million, which we expect will reduce our portfolio NOI by $28 million to $30 million in 2023.\nThe other changes that impact our 2023 guidance are a modest expected decline in fee income due to a $7 million assignment fee we generated in 2022 that we do not expect to recur. And we project that our G&A will increase by approximately 5% next year. So to summarize, we expect our 2023 FFO to be lower than 2022 by approximately 4% or $0.30 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect growth from our acquisitions and development of $0.62 per share, offset by higher interest expense of $0.69, a reduction in NOI from asset sales of $0.16 and lower fee income of $0.03 and higher G&A expense of $0.04. While we are never happy forecasting a reduction in FFO, 4% is relatively modest and entirely due to a steep increase in interest rates. Our portfolio NOI continues to grow, and we have a significant pipeline of accretive developments delivering over the next few years.\nThat completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the lines for questions?"

Welcome to BXP's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Helen Han.\n\nHelen Han\n\nVP of IR, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to BXP's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The press release and supplemental package were distributed last night and furnished on Form 8-K. In the supplemental package, BXP has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in accordance with Reg G. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investors section of our website at investors.bxp.com. A webcast of this call will be available for 12 months.\nAt this time, we would like to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although BXP believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be attained.\nFactors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements were detailed in yesterday's press release and from time to time in BXP's filings with the SEC. BXP does not undertake a duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nI'd like to welcome Owen Thomas, Chief Executive Officer; Doug Linde, President; and Mike LaBelle, Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchey, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will cover BXP's continued strong performance, as demonstrated in our second quarter results, high-level trends in the economy and in-person work affecting BXP, current private equity capital market conditions for office real estate and BXP's capital allocation activities.\nBXP's financial results for the second quarter reflect the continued positive impact of the post-pandemic reopening of the major cities where we operate and the increasing needs for our clients for securing high-quality office space. Our FFO per share this quarter was well above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance, and we increased our forecast for full year 2022. We completed 1.9 million square feet of leasing, more than 160% of our leasing volumes in the first quarter and 140% of longer-term average leasing activity for the second quarter. This success can again be attributed to not only our execution, but also the enhanced velocity achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality workspaces, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio.\nIt's clear over the last quarter that economic conditions in the U.S. and globally have deteriorated. The key culprit is inflation, which as it continues to reach new highs, set off a chain reaction of events, starting with: the Federal Reserve taking and signaling severe tightening measures; interest rates rising across the yield curve; volatility and losses in the public equity and debt markets; and now increasing concerns that the U.S. economy may experience a recession. This evolving operating environment is having several impacts to BXP's operating activities.\nThough our leasing activity has been very strong for the last few quarters, we anticipate headwinds at least in the short term. Business leaders are generally more reticent to make large capital allocation decisions, such as a lease, in an uncertain economic environment. Before the summer season, office usage by our clients continued to gradually increase. There is increasing evidence that many businesses have or will tighten up in-person work policies as economic conditions worsen.\nMany of these companies also significantly increased their workforce during the pandemic without increasing their available space. These factors should help offset, at least partially, the recessionary headwinds to space demand. Our capital costs have increased, which Mike will cover in greater detail, due to higher interest rates and credit spreads. And private market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets is significantly more challenging to arrange.\nAs discussed in prior quarters, inflation has increased construction costs for new development. Though the cost for our launch development pipeline are essentially already locked in, the cost of potential future developments continues to increase. We are not able to predict the depth or length of the current economic slowdown. As a result, we are positioning BXP for relative success regardless of the economy trajectory by carefully managing leverage while continuing to selectively invest in opportunities with the highest return versus risk characteristics.\nIn terms of real estate capital markets, transaction volume for office assets slowed to $18 billion in the second quarter, down 40% from the first quarter and flat to the second quarter last year. Though volumes are down, liquidity remains for the higher-quality assets that often trade to institutional buyers not requiring leverage. Cap rates have increased at least 10 basis points for the highest-quality assets with limited leasing exposure and more for assets of lower quality and/or with riskier income streams.\nAvailability of financing is a key market driver. There were several transactions of note in the second quarter. In the Seaport District of Boston, a developer recapitalized 451 D Street with a fund manager for $708 million. This 480,000-square-foot building was fully leased and pricing was just under $1,500 a square foot and a 4% cap rate. In El Segundo, 555 South Aviation Boulevard sold for $206 million to a fund manager. This 260,000-square-foot building is fully leased and was extensively renovated in 2018. Pricing was $790 a square foot and a 5.3% cap rate. And lastly, in Sunnyvale, Moffett Green was sold to a pension fund adviser for $875 million. The 4-building 720,000-square-foot complex is fully leased to Meta and sold for just over $1,200 a square foot and a 4.5% cap rate.\nRegarding BXP's capital market activity, we closed on our previously described Madison Center acquisition in Seattle for $730 million and continue to selectively pursue acquisitions in our core markets with financial partners. On dispositions, we completed the sale of VA 95, an older 11-building 733,000-square-foot suburban flex office park located in Springfield, Virginia, for $127 million, which represents pricing of $173 a square foot and a 6.2% cap rate. Bought in 1981 and developed by BXP over time, VA 95 was an early and successful investment by BXP that no longer fits well with our corporate strategy. We are making good progress in the sale of several additional assets in the Washington, D.C. market, which we intend to use to fund the Madison Center acquisition through reverse lifetime exchanges.\nIf these transactions are successful and including 2 sales already completed this year, total dispositions for 2022 could exceed $850 million, allowing BXP to both raise incremental liquidity and reallocate capital on a tax-efficient basis from the Washington, D.C. to the Seattle markets.\nOur development pipeline continues to deliver accretive projects to our in-service portfolio and is consistently recharged with new starts. This quarter, we delivered 325 Main Street in Cambridge, a 414,000-square-foot building in which the office component is 100% leased to Google. Our $418 million investment in the project is estimated to have a first year cash yield on cost of 8.7%. In Reston, Virginia, we commenced the development of a mixed-use project in Reston Next, comprising a 4-story 90,000-square-foot jewel box office building and a 508-unit highly amenitized residential complex.\nMost of the residential units will be located in a notable 39-story tower, which will be the tallest building in Reston. BXP will own 100% of the office component and a 20% interest in the residential in partnership with an institutional investor. This project is the next step in the full build-out of our very successful Reston Next development within Reston Town Center.\nAll of these movements with -- after all of these movements, our current development pipeline of 11 office, lab and residential projects, as well as View Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center aggregates 4.2 million square feet and $2.6 billion of investment that we project, based on delivery date and lease-up assumptions, to add more than $190 million to our NOI over the next 5 years at a 7.5% average cash yield on cost when stabilized. The commercial component of our development pipeline is 49% preleased.\nSo in summary, we had another very successful quarter with above-expectation financial performance, strong leasing success and significant investment and capital reallocation activity. Let me turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. So our last conference call was on May 3. And over the last 86 days, the conversations on the demand side of our business have really shifted from, as Owen described, return to work and space utilization to the pace of job growth and job reductions, as the impacts of the Fed's actions moved their way through the economy. While leasing activity has slowed some across every market, new lease transactions that have been in documentation during the first half of the year across all of our markets and not just with our tenants continue to move towards completion. In our portfolio, none of our active lease negotiations have been scrapped. And I think that's important relative to how we have seen other \"dramatic slowdowns\" occur, where people and companies have become much more cautious about what they're doing.\nThere is, however, less urgency with clients to make new commitments. As we consider our expectations for leasing completions in the back half of '22 and '23, we are obviously factoring in the impact of the slowdown in the macroeconomic activity, business performance and reduced overall demand for space. The availability rate defined by third-party brokers that look at the entirety of the markets continues to appear to be very elevated across virtually every office market in the country, and our markets are no exception.\nLast quarter, we described the work that CBRE Econometrics did on the availability in the premier assets in the urban markets. Availability of space is at lower levels among premier buildings. These assets continue to get more than their proportionate share of market demand. And there are still premier building micro markets like the Back Bay in Boston or View Space in Class A buildings in San Francisco that are still performing really well, meaning rents and concessions are equal to, if not better than, pre pandemic.\nWe have moved away from looking at the percentage of card access swipes relative to February of 2020. It seems to be talked about in the Wall Street Journal every day, and are now measuring the daily and weekly utilization of seats. We've got pretty good data on daily utilization in our Boston Back Bay and New York City assets where the customer makeup is dominated by traditional financial services and professional services firms, i.e., very few technology companies. Here, we're seeing about 70% of the desks being used on a weekly basis with about 50% of the employees using the space 3, 4 or 5 days a week.\nNow when we compare utilization from 2020 pre pandemic, the striking difference is the daily difference, where we saw 80% of the employees coming in 3 or more days a week in early 2020, 2019. There was a ramp-up, as Owen said, between March and June, but it really has plateaued as we began the summer. Some business leaders, including a few renowned technology CEOs, are becoming sterner in their message to employees regarding the importance of in-person daily activities in traditional office space. This may lead to greater daily utilization as we end the summer holiday season. We'll be able to tell you about that as we look at our September data when we talk to you in October.\nIn the last week, we've seen announcements from some of the tech titans, Amazon, Meta, that acknowledge that they're trying to figure out how they're going to match their human capital with the utilization of physical space. Changes in the labor market supply are also going to impact these decisions. And as I said last quarter, I think this is going to be a journey when any industry expert could tell you they know how business is going to use their space or what they even think remote or hybrid work actually means in 2024 is grossly overestimating their expertise.\nGetting to our performance. The second quarter was a great leasing quarter for BXP. This is now the fourth straight quarter of strong overall leasing activity in our portfolio. To remind everybody, beginning with the third quarter of '21, we signed 1.4 million, 1.8 million, 1.2 million and this quarter, 1.9 million square feet of leases. So that's 6.3 million square feet of signed leases in the last 12 months. This activity has occurred in the midst of the Delta variant, the Omicron variant, remote work fits and starts and most importantly, significant labor market headwinds.\nAs we speak to you this morning, we have signed leases on more than 975,000 square feet of in-service vacant space that are not yet in our occupancy figures. About 50% is going to commence in '22 and the remainder in '23. At the end of the second quarter, after completing the 1.9 million square feet of active leasing, we have an additional active lease portfolio in negotiation in the in-service portfolio of 1.3 million square feet. 640,000 square feet would cover currently vacant space. The most will go into service in '23 and the other 660,000 involves currently leased space, so aka renewals or replacement tenants.\nKnown expirations for the remainder of '22 total under 1.7 million square feet. Over the last 4 quarters, our occupancy has improved by 90 basis points and stands at 89.5% as of June 30. We expect to see a slight decline over the next few quarters, as we wait for all of these signed leases to commence, but in spite of even our less robust leasing expectations, we should see occupancy pick up slightly in 2023 from today's level.\nThe development portfolio includes 1.1 million square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence, and that excludes the lease of 290 Binney Street. And these buildings are not included in our occupancy figures this quarter. Reston Next will be included in the in-service portfolio of '22 without the 200,000 square feet signed Volkswagen lease that won't commence until '23. We are going to see an increase in contribution from these assets even though they will show a reduction in our reported in-service occupancy. A good portion of the vacancy in our Boston suburban portfolio is now comprised of space in buildings we have actually vacated, as we plan our next group of future Life Science conversions. When we commence redevelopment, these assets will be taken out of service.\nSo let's talk about sort of my ranking of the markets. It goes into sort of 3 tranches. The Boston CBD stands out as the most active of our portfolio, and it is by itself in the trough tranche. And by CBD, I'm really referring to the Back Bay because that's where we have the majority of our portfolio. The New York City, Reston, Virginia really leases under 25,000 square feet; San Francisco, again, smaller tenants, leases under 25,000 square feet; and Washington, D.C. CBD make up sort of the second tranche. And then suburban Boston, South San Francisco, Mountain View, Princeton and West L.A. make up the third.\nActivity on the East Coast is stronger than activity on our West Coast portfolio. I think this is a function of the composition of customer demand, which has a much heavier weighting of market occupancy from traditional financial services and professional services firms on the East Coast versus technology and media companies on the West Coast. I think the big changes from the last quarter in our portfolio are the increased level of leases we're actually working on in our D.C. CBD portfolio and then the slowdown we have seen in the Boston suburbs.\nNow to be fair, we completed over 220,000 square feet of suburban office leasing in the suburban Boston in-service portfolio during the second quarter, where the average market rent on second-generation space was up 34%. In addition, all of the Life Science leases we were negotiating at 880 Winter Street were executed this quarter. We signed 3 separate leases totaling 72,000 square feet in that building, and it's now 97% leased with expected occupancy in September for the first tenant. We also signed 2 leases at 180 CityPoint, our next Life Science delivery totaling 140,000 square feet. So if you include the 570,000 square feet on Binney Street, we actually executed over 775,000 square feet of Life Science leases during the quarter in our Boston portfolio.\n2021 was an extraordinary leasing year for Life Science, and the slowdown we are now seeing in the office leasing activity is also being felt in the Life Science market in our suburban Boston, suburban San Francisco and suburban Montgomery County portfolio. The biotech index, IBX, is down significantly from a year ago, and fewer private companies are getting funded, which translates into a drop in active requirements relative to last year. I would note that the big pharma companies continue to have an appetite for new space in our markets.\nEarly-stage Life Science tenants and their investors with an eye to slowing down their capital outflows are also pushing more of the capital spend needed to fit out space to the landlord in the form of higher TI demand.\nIn the Boston CBD, we completed 253,000 square feet of leases. The markup on that portfolio was 18%. More than 450,000 square feet of our leases in negotiation are in the Boston CBD portfolio and that includes 200,000 square feet of retail space that has been vacant. In the San Francisco CBD, there have been a few more large tech tenants that have completed leases in sublease space, but the bulk of the activity on a direct basis has been north of market and it continues to be concentrated in the premier buildings with professional services and financial services firms.\nThis quarter, we did 9 leases totaling 96,000 square feet in the CBD portfolio, and the leases had a second-generation increase of 37%. We also completed 2 transactions in Mountain View with an uptick of only 3%. In other positive news on the West Coast, we completed a 60,000-square-foot lease for the top 3 floors that are vacant at Safeco Plaza in Seattle. When we purchased the asset in '21, our plan included a major repositioning of the public and amenity spaces at the Fourth Avenue and Third Avenue Street plans. We have begun to introduce our repositioning plans for the building. And this, combined with our proven track record in creating great places and spaces, allowed us to win over a current BXP West Coast client to Safeco Plaza.\nActivity in the D.C. region was pretty light during the second quarter with the 8 office transactions totaling only 43,000 square feet and 8 retail transactions totaling 39,000. But as we look forward, we're negotiating over 270,000 square feet of leases for the in-service portfolio and 95,000 square feet of leases at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, our newest development in D.C. In the New York region during the quarter, the most significant transaction was a 125,000-square-foot extension at General Motors building that got signed in early April, and I described last quarter. In addition, we completed another 168,000 square foot of leases across the portfolio.\nThere were some ups and downs in the lease-to-lease rent comparison, but together, the portfolio had a slightly positive under 1% mark-to-market on the leases executed during the second quarter. We have multi-floor lease negotiations underway at 399 Park Avenue, 601 Lex, and last week, we signed a 71,000-square-foot 2-floor lease at Dock 72. Total active leases in the New York City portfolio as of July 1 was in excess of 260,000 square feet.\nWe have had 4 consecutive strong quarters of office leasing. We have incremental development deliveries hitting in '22 that will be at their run rate in '23. We still expect occupancy improvement in '23, though at a reduced rate based on the slowdown in the economy. We continue, as Owen said, to feel really good about our portfolio position in each market. And our lack of meaningful lease expirations in '23, just over 2 million square feet, puts us in a great position entering the year.\nWe have a strong balance sheet with low floating rate exposure and near-term maturities, so debt financing costs are going to be higher in '23. In addition to his commentary on the second quarter performance, Mike will discuss our internal interest rate expectations and our financing plans. Mike?\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive VP, Treasurer & CFO, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Doug. Good morning. So as Doug said, this morning, I plan to cover the details of our second quarter performance and our full year earnings guidance. And while I don't plan to provide specific guidance for 2023 until next quarter, I do want to discuss the potential impact of rising interest rates, as well as the leasing commentary that Doug described and our development deliveries.\nOverall, we had another strong quarter. Our share of revenues and FFO this quarter are up over 10% and 13%, respectively, over the second quarter of 2021. And we reported second quarter funds from operation of $1.94 per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.09 per share. The improvement mostly came from a combination of higher rental revenues, stronger performance at our hotel and lower operating expenses. Lower expenses drove $0.05 per share of the outperformance and is primarily from the repair and maintenance category. We anticipate that many of these jobs will be completed in the back half of 2022, so the majority of this expense is only a deferral and will be incurred later this year.\nOur one hotel, which is located in Kendall Square in Cambridge, experienced stronger occupancy and RevPAR growth that exceeded our expectations by $0.02 per share. The return of business and educational activity to Kendall Square, along with the college graduation season, drove the improvement in hotel NOI back to the level that we saw in the second quarter of 2019.\nIn the rest of the portfolio, we experienced better-than-projected rental revenues of $0.03 per share from timing of our leasing leading to improved occupancy and higher parking revenue. Our share of parking revenue continues to grow as activity levels increase in our cities and buildings. This quarter, our share of parking revenue grew by $5 million and is now operating at over 90% of its pre-COVID run rate.\nThe outperformance in these 3 areas was partially offset by $0.01 of higher-than-anticipated interest expense coming from both lower capitalized interest from changes in the timing of our development spend and higher short-term rates impacting the interest expense on our floating rate debt, which includes our new $730 million term loan that we used as a bridge to acquire Madison Center. As Owen covered, we're progressing well with our asset sales and anticipate paying down debt with the proceeds from sales later this year.\nThere are a couple of other items of note in the quarter. First, we closed a 10-year $185 million financing at a fixed rate of 4.43% on our Hub 50House residential joint venture in Boston. This new mortgage refinanced floating rate construction financing. And second, we recorded $6.6 million or $0.04 per share of other income for assigning our rights to a purchase contract on a building in Reston. This income was included in our guidance, but we don't expect it to recur, so you should not expect it in our run rate going forward.\nNow I'd like to cover the changes to our guidance for the full year 2022. We've increased our guidance range for 2022 FFO to $7.48 to $7.53 per share. That's an increase of $0.06 per share at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter. Our portfolio exceeded our projection in the second quarter. And as Doug described, we had a strong quarter of leasing activity, some of which will result in earlier than projected rental revenues in 2022. The result is an increase in our assumption for our 2022 same-property NOI growth by 75 basis points to now 3.5% to 4.5% over 2021.\nWe also increased our assumption for 2022 cash same-property NOI growth by 50 basis points to 5.5% to 6.5% over 2021. At the midpoint, the increase in our same-property NOI assumption adds $0.07 per share to our full year guidance. We've also increased our NOI assumptions for the incremental impact from properties in our non-same portfolio by about $0.03 per share. The increase is primarily from delivering our 400,000-square-foot build-to-suit for Google in Cambridge. The building and tenant improvements were completed over a month ahead of schedule, so revenue recognition commenced earlier than we anticipated. In addition, we've refined the timing of our asset sales activity, adding incremental income to our model.\nDoug touched on the impact of rising interest rates. Since we last provided guidance, the Fed has become much more aggressive in its rates policy and short-term rates have risen dramatically. 30-day LIBOR and 1-month term SOFR have risen from approximately 60 basis points in April to just over 2.25% today, and our projections assume they increase to 4% over the next few quarters. We currently have approximately $1.7 billion of floating rate debt, representing a relatively modest 12% of our total debt. This includes $800 million in our share of floating rate debt in our joint venture portfolio, our line of credit with current borrowings of $165 million and our $730 million term loan.\nThe increase in our interest rate assumptions result in higher interest expense in 2022 of approximately $0.05 per share at the midpoint of our range. So in summary, we're increasing our guidance for 2022 FFO by $0.06 per share at the midpoint. The increase is from higher same-property NOI of $0.07, higher non same-property NOI of $0.03, higher fee income of $0.01 offset by higher interest expense of $0.05.\nAs we look out into 2023, there's a few things you should consider when modeling our projected earnings. First, we anticipate that our interest expense will be meaningfully higher in 2023. While the pace of interest rate increases may moderate, we expect the average interest rate on our debt portfolio will be higher in 2023 than it is this year. We expect the size of our floating-rate debt to remain relatively stable, with repayments from asset sales later this year offset by funding our development spend with our line of credit in 2022 and 2023.\nWe also expect to refinance $800 million of debt that expires in the second half of 2023 in the long-term fixed rate market. The current average rate on the expiring debt is 3.4%. Today, our borrowing costs for 10-year unsecured bonds is between 5.25% and 5.5%. The market has varying views for interest rates in 2023, so it's anyone's guess where they end up. If you assume that short-term rates continue to rise and our long-term borrowing cost remains relatively stable, this results in an average 200 basis point increase in borrowing cost on approximately $1.7 billion of floating rate debt and $800 million of refinancing or about $40 million of potential incremental interest expense in 2023.\nIn addition, we also expect our capitalized interest to be slightly lower in 2023 due to delivering several large developments. Second, we expect our same-property portfolio to continue to grow, but likely at a slower pace than the 4% midpoint growth rate we assume for 2022. This year, we're benefiting from the recovery of income from our retail, parking and hotel. With the continued improvement in parking and the strong performance of our hotel this quarter, we've now recovered over 90% of our ancillary income. Our annual growth in these income streams going forward should be more normalized.\nIn the office portfolio, Doug described our healthy backlog of signed leases and leases under negotiation that total over 2 million square feet that we expect will go into occupancy this year and next. Based on the timing of this activity and our lease rollover, we expect our occupancy will decline modestly in the second half of 2022 and then start to increase in 2023.\nAnd third, we expect that our development pipeline will add to our earnings in 2023. We anticipate a full year of income from our Google development in Cambridge, and we expect to deliver 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. and 880 Winter Street in suburban Boston later this year. We also plan to open View Boston, our 60,000-square-foot experiential observation deck at the Prudential Center in the second quarter of 2023. These developments represent more than $1 billion of investment at an expected stabilized unleveraged return in excess of 8%.\nIn conclusion, we've had a strong second quarter performance, and we've increased our full year '22 FFO guidance. We're projecting over 14% FFO growth in 2022. And despite headwinds from higher interest rates and economic uncertainty, our portfolio is well-positioned with modest rollover exposure and growth from our pipeline of developments.\nLastly, we're looking forward to hosting you at our Investor Conference to be held in Boston on September 19 and 20. The conference will be a fantastic opportunity to hear from the broader BXP team, learn more about our current and future strategic initiatives and tour some of our Boston Area properties. If you've not received an invitation, please reach out to our investor relations team. That completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open the line up for questions?"

Our FFO per share this quarter was well above both market consensus and the midpoint of our guidance and we increased our forecast for full year 2022.\nWe completed 1.2 million square feet of leasing more than double the space we leased in the first quarter of 2021 and in line with our pre-pandemic leasing activity for the first quarter, and our leasing momentum continues in the second quarter as Doug will cover. This success can be attributed to not only our execution but also the enhanced velocity achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality workspaces, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio.\nFinally, we just released our 2021 ESG report outlining the actions BXP has and will take to ensure continued leadership in this critical area. Highlights include remaining on track to achieve carbon-neutral operations by 2025, enhanced disclosures regarding Scope 3 emissions and diversity, achieving multiple financings tied to sustainability performance, inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and recognition for our work from many sources. The report is available on our website, and I encourage your review.\nAs the effects of the pandemic are increasingly behind us, there continues to be much speculation about the future of work and its impacts on the use of office space. While many questions remain unanswered, there are a number of trends which are increasingly coming into focus. First, building census figures, roughly 40% to 80% on the peak day of the week in BXP's portfolio depending upon the city are improving weekly and are at post-pandemic highs, with many large employers, such as Google and Apple just now implementing return-to-work plans.\nSecond, City leaders are responding to the slow return to office as they understand the vibrant business district is critical to their city's economic health and recovery. The mayors of New York and San Francisco have partnered with their respective City's largest employers and encouraging return to work policies to help reinvigorate their business districts and local businesses that have experienced hardship from the delay in return to office.\nThird, most business leaders see the challenges of an inconsistent return to the office by their employees given the widening gaps their businesses are experiencing in maintaining corporate culture, onboarding and trading employees -- and training employees and talent retention. Employee unwillingness to return to the office today on a consistent basis is primarily due to very tight labor market conditions and employee desire for flexibility. As business conditions become more competitive due to rising interest rates, slowing economic growth and changes in the labor market, business leaders will likely feel increased urgency in bringing their employees together on a much more consistent basis and modify their return to office policies accordingly.\nFourth, return to office does not mean 5 days a week for most employers. Companies are increasingly providing a flexibility benefit allowing employees to work remotely 1 to 2 days or in some cases, more per week. These employees invariably are electing to come in more frequently Tuesday through Thursday and want more physical separation, their own dedicated workspaces and in-office amenities, all of which make it challenging for employers to reduce space, notwithstanding reduced occupancy for part of the week. Many of our clients have also materially grown their headcount due to buoyant economic growth and market conditions during the pandemic increasing their need for seats.\nAnd lastly, building and workspace quality has never been more important in the office business. To help entice workers back to their workplaces, employers are increasingly attracted to buildings that are new or recently renovated, well-amenitized inside and out and proximate to transportation. Aggregate office market statistics that currently show elevated levels of vacancy and weak net absorption do not properly reflect the market dynamics of the premium end of the market where most of our portfolio competes. We recently completed a disaggregated office market study with CBRE Econometric Advisors, analyzing the relative performance of prime office assets as selected by CBRE representing about 17% of total space versus the rest of the market in 5 of our targeted CBDs. The West LA analysis is forthcoming.\nCBRE found the vacancy rate is more than 5 percentage points lower for prime office assets versus nonprime assets and 10 percentage points lower in San Francisco. In 2021, for those 5 CBDs, net absorption for prime assets was a positive 1.2 million square feet versus a negative 6.6 million square feet for non-prime assets. This dynamic explains BXP's recent success in achieving pre-pandemic levels of leasing despite elevated total market vacancy statistics.\nMoving to real estate capital markets. Transaction volume for office assets remains vibrant as $25 billion of significant office assets were sold in the first quarter. Though volume was down 40% from the near record fourth quarter 2021, it was up 57% from the first quarter a year ago and above first quarter levels in both 2020 and 2019. Pricing has remained stable for high-quality office buildings and anything life science related though rising interest rates have impacted leverage buyers, which could pressure volumes and cap rates. In Cambridge, a majority interest in the 100% leased lab building 100 Binney Street sold at an aggregate valuation of over $1 billion. Pricing was $2,350 a square foot and a 3.5% cap rate. The seller was a REIT and the buyer was a JV of institutional real estate investors.\nIn the Culver City submarket of L.A., one Culver was recapitalized at a gross valuation of $510 million. This building is 90% leased and pricing was $1,350 a square foot and a 4.5% cap rate. A regional operator sponsored the recap with a global institutional fund manager. In New York City, 450 Park Avenue was sold for $445 million by an institutional operator to a REIT. The building faces near-term lease expirations with pricing at $1,320 a square foot and a sub 4% initial cap rate.\nIn South San Francisco, the 144,000 square foot, 5,000 shoreline court building was sold for $1,140 a foot and will be vacated for lab conversion. The asset, which will require capital to redevelop was purchased by an institutional fund manager from a corporation at a basis that is equivalent to our completed life science developments and higher than our redevelopments in the same market.\nNow regarding BXP's capital market activity, we recently committed to purchase Madison Center, one of the highest quality office buildings in the Seattle CBD for $730 million. Recently built in 2017, Madison Center comprises 760,000 square feet in 37 stories, is 93% leased to leading tenants and is lead platinum certified. The building has one of the most generous amenity offerings in the Seattle market with 30,000 square feet of fitness, conference, library living room, boardroom, fast casual food, bike storage and roof deck space. Madison Center is well located 2 blocks from light rail and bus transportation and direct vehicular access to the I-5 North and South ramps. Pricing for the investment is $965 a square foot and a 4.3% initial cap rate, stabilizing above 5% with additional leasing. The acquisition is expected to close on May 17 and will initially be funded with a $730 million bridge loan.\nOur funding plan over the next year is to either enter into a like-kind exchange with other assets we sell or bring in capital partners as we have done with other acquisitions. The acquisition of Madison Center accomplishes several key strategic goals for BXP. It expands our presence in Seattle, targeting a growing technology market, adds one of the newest and most competitive buildings in the Seattle market to our portfolio, consistent with our quality strategy in all the markets where we operate. And it provides the opportunity to reallocate capital on a tax-efficient basis between markets and specific buildings.\nOn dispositions, in the first quarter, we completed the sale of 195 West Street, which is a 64,000 square foot, 100% leased building in Waltham for $38 million which represents pricing of just under $600 a foot and a 4.7% cap rate. We are either in the market or planning additional sales in our Boston and Washington, D.C. markets several of which could be used in a like-kind and a like exchange for Madison Center -- for the Madison Center acquisition. If completed, these transactions will efficiently reallocate capital with limited loss in FFO from East Coast properties into a market-leading Seattle asset.\nWe also completed another active quarter recharging our development pipeline. As previously described, we commenced the 390,000 square foot first phase of Platform 16 in San Jose to be delivered in 2025 and the 327,000 square foot conversion of 651 Gateway in South San Francisco from office to lab to be delivered in late 2023. Our share of investment in these 2 projects aggregates $378 million and projected initial cash yields upon stabilization are in excess of 6%.\nAstraZeneca announced last week, they have signed a lease for 570,000 square feet to consolidate into a major research facility at BXP's 290 Binney Street development in Cambridge. This development could commence in early 2023, but is contingent on several enabling milestones to be completed this year, at which time we will provide more details, including economics on both it and the adjacent 250 Binney Street Lab and 135 Broadway residential projects.\nAfter all these movements, our current development pipeline aggregates 4.1 million square feet and $2.9 billion of investment, is 54% pre-leased, is 27% life science related and projected based on lease-up assumptions to add approximately $200 million to our NOI over the next 5 years at a 7% average cash yield on cost when stabilized.\nSo in summary, we had another active and successful quarter with strong leasing and financial returns and continue to forecast significant growth in our FFO per share this year, driven by strong leasing activity, continued recovery of variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion of new acquisitions, both last year and this year, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science market and well-timed refinancing activity in 2021 and lower capital costs.\nLet me turn the call over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody.\nSo we're sitting here on May 3, pretty late for us to have a call, but obviously, we had a lot of news to report, and we wanted to make sure our own schedules worked out there.\nMost employers have begun their journey to discover how they're going to match their human capital with their utilization of physical space. It's clear that the census on public transportation and in our office buildings continues to be below levels in 2019. There are going to be organizations that make few, if any, changes to their space configuration, location or allocation of space per employee. Those clients will be and are in the market making long-term leasing commitments based on their growth and as Owen said, a lot of companies grew in their lease expiration schedules. There will be businesses that experiment with different models. These companies could sublet space, they could commit to more or less short-term space or they could simply watch how their business responds to their new in-office cadence and do nothing until their lease gets closer to its natural expiration.\nIt's also true that the availability rate of space defined by third-party brokers that look at the entirety of the market, and as Owen described, there are lots of ways to cut it, but in general, it's -- it still continues to be elevated in our urban markets. But as Owen pointed out, if you start to analyze the activity, the best buildings are getting more than their proportionate share of market demand. Despite these headwinds, on demand and supply the BXP portfolio had its third consecutive sequential strong leasing quarter. Our total activity was again spread amongst Boston, New York, San Francisco and the Metropolitan Washington region.\nLast quarter, we showed an occupancy gain of 40 basis points, and this quarter, we picked up another 30 basis points. As we sit here today, we have signed leases for our in-service portfolio on vacant space that has yet to commence, so it's not in our occupancy figures of more than 975,000 square feet, which is up from 925,000 square feet last quarter. This will represent an additional 220 basis points of occupancy.\nWe began 2022 with over 1.4 million square feet of leases in negotiation on space in the in-service portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, after completing the 1.2 million square feet I mentioned, we have active lease negotiations underway in the in-service portfolio and about 1.3 million square feet, and we had over 750,000 square feet in our development pipeline.\nDuring the month of April, so the last 30 days, we've signed in excess of 1.1 million square feet of space. We are moving quickly and confidently to lease up our portfolio. While our portfolio is comprised of the highest quality buildings in their submarkets, we have another advantage, which is our operational platform. We are in constant contact with our clients as we look for ways to create opportunities in the portfolio for our customers where a leasing transaction may not be readily apparent.\nLet me illustrate as I begin my regional comments in Boston. Life science is the clear driver of new demand in the suburban Boston market, but our traditional Route 128 office leasing is also extremely busy. This quarter, we agreed to recapture and release 73,000 square feet at 77 CityPoint. We were aware of a large tech company that was seeking to establish a presence inside of 128. When we were finalizing the recapture and release of 1265 Main Street late last year, this tenant expressed interest, but we were too far along with our transaction to accommodate them. Our tenant at 77 CityPoint had a lease that expires December 31, '24 and had listed its space on the sublet market beginning in 2019, pre-pandemic related. Instead of simply waiting for the lease to expire we negotiated an early termination recapture and signed a new 7.5-year lease, which also resulted in a 15% net increase in the rent.\nLet me give you another example. We have a relationship with Wellington, the prime tenant at Atlantic Wharf. Our team was aware of Wellington's strong desire to improve their carbon footprint in any new real estate commitments. Working in partnership with Wellington as well as the local energy provider Eversource and a solar developer, we were able to find a way to reposition the mechanical systems at our 140 Kendrick Street project and make a net zero commitment. This resulted in a 105,000 square foot lease for space scheduled to expire in November 22. In addition, we signed leases with 2 other tenants for the remaining 80,000 square feet in this project, and leases for that space were also scheduled to expire in November 22, all with rent roll-ups of about 40%.\nBy just looking at the performance of the XBI on your stock screen, it's pretty clear that the equity markets have not been kind to public biotech companies. However, there continues to be significant demand for life science tenants in the Boston market. many of which continue to be funded with private capital and have strong science working in their favor. Over the last 2 weeks, we've signed another 45,000 square feet of leases at 880 Winter Street and are in final lease negotiations on the remaining space. And we signed a 140,000 square foot lease at 180 CityPoint, the new 329,000 square foot building under construction. Steel erection is underway, and we're hoping to deliver that space in the fourth quarter of '23. And obviously, we are excited to have AstraZeneca as a new client in Kendall Center and look forward to getting that building under construction in early '23.\nOur CBD Boston activity this quarter was primarily small transactions. We completed 7 deals for 47,000 square feet. Average markup was 17% on a cash basis. At the moment, we are in lease negotiations on more than 300,000 square feet of leases in the CBD of Boston with 4 transactions over 40,000 square feet.\nThe New York regional second-generation statistics this quarter merits some explanation. In early 2020, Perella Weinberg made the decision to relocate out of the GM Building. COVID hit, they paused their plans to move and they asked for a short-term renewal. We accommodated that request at an as-is market rent that was below their expiring rent with the hope that we could use this time to convince them to reconsider their decision and entertain a long-term renewal at the GM. What you see in our statistics this quarter is the impact of that short-term deal. Fast forward to April 1, 2022, our operating team was able to work with PWP to provide a long-term solution and they have signed 125,000 square foot lease renewal at GM that will keep them as our client until 2040. The mark-to-market on this new lease involved the relocation to lower contiguous floors. On the floors there that are the remaining part of the premises, the rents are down about 7%.\nIn New York City during the quarter, the most significant leasing transaction was a 330,000 square foot extension and expansion at 601 Lexington Avenue. This lease involved the client expanding into a direct vacant floor as well as floors that are expiring in the second half of '22 totaling 180,000 square feet. The rent on this block is down about 7.5%.\nWe also completed a 70,000 square foot renewal at 510 Madison, where the cash rent is down about 10% and 5 small transactions totaling 24,000 square feet. Our current activity in New York continues to be strong. We have multi-floor lease negotiations underway at 399 Park Avenue at Dock 72 and another full floor lease at the General Motors Building as well as a number of smaller leases at 250 West 55th, Times Square Tower and 510 Madison. Total activity is in excess of 400,000 square feet. Construction is underway at 360 Park Avenue South, and we are actively touring the building every week and trading proposals for 2023 lease commencements.\nOur Boston CBD, Cambridge and Waltham markets as well as Midtown New York are significantly busier than San Francisco, Northern Virginia, D.C. and L.A. In the San Francisco CBD, there have been a handful of large tech tenants in the market, and those deals have gravitated towards the well-built sublease space at assets like 350 Mission and 680 Folsom, our property with a Macy's sublet. The bulk of the activity on a direct basis has been in the financial district, and it continues to be concentrated at the better buildings with professional service firms and financial firms. We completed 10 leases totaling 104,000 square feet in the CBD this quarter, our cash rents increased by 25%. As we sit here this morning, we're working on another 110,000 square feet, including 3 full floors in Embarcadero Center, and we completed over 50,000 square feet in our Mountain View portfolio on currently vacant space.\nOur venture with ARE, as Owen said, has commenced construction at 651 Gateway, and we are making full floor and multi-floor proposals with anticipated occupancy in late '23, early '24. The venture did about 45,000 square feet of non-lab leasing at 601 and 611 Gateway this quarter.\nI'll finish my remarks with -- around Northern Virginia and D.C. During the first quarter, activity in Reston was concentrated on partial floor deals, i.e., small deals. We completed 6 totaling 20,000 square feet and are actively negotiating another 5 in the in-service portfolio. We have 1 full floor lease negotiation at their next phase of the Reston Town Center project, but large tenant activity in the Reston submarket has been slow as we started 2022. Rents have held up. They're in the low 50s with a 2.5% annual bump to the low 60s with similar bumps for RTC Next. In the district, we signed our second non-anchored deal at 2100 Penn and are in lease discussions now with a multi-floor office tenant and a retail tenant that would bring the leasing at 2100 Penn to over 80%.\nActivity at -- the Street plane, retail, in Boston and in Reston in New York City has picked up significantly. Parking revenue in Boston and San Francisco continued to improve, while activity in parking in D.C., L.A. and Seattle is still restrained. The first quarter parking revenue, excluding Seattle, was 77% of what it was in 2019 and we expect a meaningful bump in the second quarter as we moved away from Omicron. We have had 3 consecutive strong quarters of office leasing and a great April 2022. Employers continue to search for new employees Businesses are leasing space, and we are capturing incremental portfolio occupancy.\nTo circle back to Owen's comments about quality, employers want to use their physical space to encourage their teams to be together. The availability rate in the best buildings is lower, and there is significant relative rental rate outperformance. We create great places and spaces, so our customers can use space as a tool to attract and retain their talent. While not at 2019 levels, employees are spending more and more time in the office and it's even more critical to have the right place and space.\nMike?\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive VP, Treasurer & CFO, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. .\nThis morning, I plan to cover the details of our first quarter performance, the impact of our current and projected capital markets activity and the changes to our 2022 earnings guidance.\nOverall, as Owen and Doug described, we had a strong quarter. We increased our occupancy, and we continue to grow our revenues. Our share of revenues this quarter is up 4% sequentially from the fourth quarter, and up 8% over the first quarter of 2021.\nWe reported funds from operation of $1.82 per share that exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.09 per share. The most -- the improvement mostly came from a combination of higher rental revenues and some lower operating expenses that aggregated to $0.08 per share. $0.03 per share of the revenue outperformance came primarily from recognizing revenue earlier than anticipated due to our clients completing build-outs and occupying their space faster than we expected. For example, at our Reston Next development, we delivered a tranche of 11 floors to Fannie Mae almost a month earlier than we projected, resulting in higher-than-expected revenue in the quarter. We also recognized $0.01 of revenue from restoring the accrued rent balances from clients that struggled during the pandemic, but have now recovered. We had previously reclassified these clients, which are primarily retailers and restaurants to cash basis accounting, and now their sales performance demonstrates the ability to pay their rent over the full term.\nOn the operating expense side, lower-than-anticipated expenses contributed $0.04 per share to exceeding our FFO guidance. A portion of this was from lower-than-anticipated physical occupancy in January and February during the height of the Omicron variant. This resulted in lower cleaning and utilities expense during the quarter. We have seen our physical occupancy rebound and surpass prior post-pandemic highs, so we expect our expenses to normalize back to our budget for the rest of the year. We also incurred lower-than-anticipated repair and maintenance expenses this quarter, some of which will be deferred to later in the year. The remaining $0.01 of increase in our FFO was due to lower-than-expected G&A expense in the quarter.\nNow I would like to turn to our 2022 earnings guidance, including the financial impact of our projected capital markets activities that Owen described. We've increased our guidance range for 2022 FFO to $7.40 to $7.50 per share. This equates to an increase of about $0.07 per share at the midpoint from our guidance last quarter. Our portfolio is exceeding prior expectations, and it is projected to contribute $0.11 per share to that increase in our guidance at the midpoint. The portfolio's stronger growth is partially offset by the loss of FFO from our assumptions for asset sales, net of acquisitions and the impact of our anticipated financing activities.\nAs Owen described, we've entered into an agreement to buy Madison Center in Seattle for $730 million. We expect to close before the end of the month. Our objective is to fund the acquisition through the proceeds from asset sales and our assumptions include asset sales of between $700 million and $900 million for the year. Including the impact of this elevated asset sales program, we expect the transaction to be neutral to $0.02 per share dilutive to our 2022 FFO. The range is really reliant on the ultimate size and timing of our sales activity.\nLooking forward, we expect Madison Center to demonstrate consistent cash flow growth as we lease up the currently vacant space and roll below-market rents to market as leases expire. The positive mark-to-market on current leases is between 10% and 15%. So the initial GAAP return, which fair values the rents is about 50 basis points higher than the cash return that Owen quoted. In addition, the property is new and a very high quality and will require minimal capital improvements.\nIn the interim and in advance of completing our asset sales strategy, we expect to close on a short-term $730 million bridge loan to fund the acquisition. We are also planning to secure long-term fixed rate financing on our recently completed Hub on Causeway mixed-use development in Boston. We're in the market and close to finalizing terms for the residential component and expect to pursue financing for the office and retail component later this year. The impact of these financings is included in our guidance and is expected to increase our interest expense for 2022 by $6 million to $9 million, a portion of which will run through our income from joint venture line.\nWe are seeing improvement in NOI in both our same property portfolio and our development portfolio. In the same-property portfolio, we achieved faster lease-up from delivering spaces to clients earlier than expected. You saw this in our higher occupancy we reported in the quarter. And as a result, we have increased our assumption for same-property NOI growth by 75 basis points to 2.75% to 3.75% over 2021.\nOn a cash basis, we continue to anticipate strong same-property NOI -- same-property cash NOI growth of 5% to 6% over 2021. Our non-same properties, which is primarily our recently delivered and active developments, are also exceeding our prior projections in achieving faster absorption. Our share of NOI from the non-same properties, and that excludes the Madison Center acquisition, is expected to be $75 million to $85 million, an increase of $5 million at the midpoint from our assumption last quarter. The only other meaningful change to our guidance is an increase in our assumption of development and management fee revenue to $26 million to $33 million, which is an increase of $2 million. The improvement primarily relates to higher construction management fees related to tenant build-out activity.\nSo in summary, we have increased our guidance range for 2022 FFO by approximately $0.07 per share at the midpoint. The drivers of the increase are $0.08 of improvement in the same property NOI performance, $0.03 from our developments and $0.01 of higher fee income, offset by dilution of $0.04 of higher interest expense and $0.01 from our net acquisition and disposition activity. Overall, we anticipate strong growth with 14% projected 2022 FFO growth over 2021 at the midpoint.\nWe've improved our occupancy for 2 consecutive quarters, and Doug described both the meaningful backlog of nearly 1 million square feet of signed leases that will come into the portfolio in the next year and our current activity. We have additional future growth from the delivery of our $2.9 billion active development pipeline. It's currently 54% pre-leased and it will deliver over the next few years, plus we're making progress towards adding to the pipeline in the future.\nOperator, that completes our formal remarks. You can open the line for questions, please."

During our Q&A portion of our call, Ray Ritchie, Senior Executive Vice President, and our regional management teams will be available to address any questions.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Owen Thomas for his formal remarks.\n\nOwen David Thomas\n\nCEO & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by introducing Helen Han, who's our new Head of Investor Relations. Helen was formerly Head of Marketing for our Western region, has been with BXP for over 15 years, and has a deep wealth of knowledge about our company and people. Welcome, Helen. Great to have you here. .\nSo today, I'm going to cover BXP's operating momentum, the economic conditions that serve as a backdrop for BXP's operations as we enter 2022. The current private equity capital market conditions for office real estate as well as BXP's capital allocation activities and growth potential. BXP's financial results for the fourth quarter reflect the impact of the recovering U.S. economy and increasing needs for our clients for securing high-quality office space. Our FFO per share this quarter was above market consensus, and the midpoint of our guidance. We completed 1.8 million square feet of leasing, our third consecutive quarter of significantly higher leasing activity. It was 55% above the fourth quarter of 2020 and in line with our pre-pandemic leasing levels.\nWith an average term of 8.6 years on the leases signed this past quarter, lease commitments by our clients continue to be long term in nature. This success can be attributed to not only our execution but also the enhanced velocity and economics achieved in the current marketplace for premium quality assets with great amenities and transit access, which are the hallmark of BXP's strategy and portfolio.\nNow turning to 2022. We believe the market and economic factors, which impact BXP, are on balance, very favorable. Though the Omicron variant has been a setback and the course of the pandemic has proven hard to forecast. Most experts believe conditions will improve in 2022, resulting in more workers returning to the office and further improved space demand. The economic recovery in the U.S. continues with consensus GDP growth predicted to be 4% in 2022. And innovations in technology and life science remain promising and well funded, a key driver for office and lab space demand.\nCapital flows into the real estate sector will also likely grow further as investors: one, rebalance their portfolios away from equities due to strong performance from the lows of the pandemic; and two, have a reluctance to allocate these funds to fixed income due to rising interest rates. New office supply has also slowed down given the demand uncertainties created by the pandemic, another long-term positive for the office business.\nMoving to the challenges. Interest rates are rising, which will likely continue due to the Fed's current focus on inflation, and signaling it will raise the Fed funds rate multiple times in 2022. BXP had significant and well-timed refinancing activity in 2021 and therefore, faces limited debt financing needs in the coming year. Inflation is a greater challenge, and has several dimensions. Rising construction costs will require higher rental rates to make development feasible. However, over time, higher replacement costs should increase the value of our existing portfolio of buildings. The labor market is also very tight, which contributes to our clients' hesitancy in bringing their employees back to an in-person work environment.\nAs we have stated repeatedly, we believe this phenomenon will change over time, given widespread corporate dissatisfaction with the decaying of efficiency, retention and culture associated with remote work. Though challenges persist, we see 2022 market conditions as a favorable backdrop for BXP to continue to perform.\nSo moving to the real estate capital markets, an all-time record of commercial real estate sales volume was achieved in the fourth quarter, and private capital market activity for office assets was similarly robust. $39 billion of significant office assets were sold in the fourth quarter, up 35% from the previous quarter and up 90% from the fourth quarter a year ago. Cap rates are stable or declining for assets with limited lease rollover and anything life science-related, and activity is increasing for assets facing near-term lease expirations.\nThe Boston market was particularly active with 2 major life science recapitalization deals in Cambridge, selling for around $2,200 a square foot and sub-4% cap rates. Three significant deals in the Seaport District selling for approximately $1,500 a foot on a fee simple basis, with cap rates at or below 4%. And 2 CBD sales at $700 to $950 a square foot, with cap rates in the low 4% range. Notably, in New York City, 2 major assets in the Hudson Yards area sold in full or part for an average of approximately $1,400 a square foot, and cap rates of 4.5% to 5% on a stabilized basis.\nIn the District of Columbia, 4 transactions completed, aggregating $750 million with pricing averaging approximately $550 to $600 a square foot on a fee simple basis and cap rates in the low 5% range. And pricing in Seattle continues to escalate with deals closed or announced in South Lake Union priced above $1,200 a square foot, a new local record, and a sub-4% cap rate. In Fremont at over $1,000 a foot, and a low 4% cap rate. And in the CBD at around $750 a square foot, and a mid-4% cap rate.\nRegarding BXP's capital market activity and starting with acquisitions, we closed on the previously described 360 Park Avenue South acquisition in New York City in December, and placed the project into our active development pipeline. Two of our strategic capital program partners will co-invest in the deal as capital is drawn for redevelopment, bringing our interest to 42% on a stabilized basis. We continue to have elevating dialogues with potential private equity partners, are pursuing an active pipeline of both on and off-market deals in many of our markets, and anticipate additional acquisition activity of value-add assets with capital partners in 2022.\nIn 2021, we also completed noncore asset sales of $225 million, and anticipate higher disposition volumes in 2022. We completed a very active quarter with our development pipeline. We delivered fully into service 100 Causeway Street in Boston, the Marriott headquarters at [7750] Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda and the lab conversion project at 200 West Street in Waltham. In the aggregate, BXP's share of these projects represents 1.5 million square feet of development and $460 million of investment. The 3 assets are 98% leased, being delivered below budget and ahead of schedule at a projected stabilized cash yield in excess of 8%, and are projected to add $41 million to our NOI on a stabilized basis.\nGiven the market cap rates I previously described for high-quality office of 4% to 5%, we expect these projects in the aggregate will create approximately $380 million of value above our $460 million in cost for BXP shareholders. Also, we partially placed into service Reston -- next in Reston. And we are continuously refreshing our development pipeline by adding just this past quarter, 360 Park Avenue South and 103 City Point, a speculative ground-up lab development aggregating 113,000 square feet in our City Point development in Waltham. We have a very active pipeline of office and lab developments and redevelopments ready to announce when they commence, expected later in 2022, and Doug will describe the strong leasing success we are achieving with our lab development.\nAfter all these movements, our current development pipeline aggregates 3.4 million square feet and $2.5 billion of investment, is already 59% leased and projected to add approximately $190 million to our NOI over the next 3 years.\nSo in summary, we had another active and successful quarter with strong leasing and financial returns and are excited for our prospects for continued growth in 2022. We expect significant growth in our FFO per share this year driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity, continued recovery of variable revenue streams, delivery of a well-leased development pipeline, completion of 4 new acquisitions in 2021, a strong balance sheet combined with capital allocated from large-scale private equity partners to pursue additional new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes, a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation's hottest life science markets and well-timed refinancing activity in 2021 and lower capital costs.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Doug.\n\nDouglas T. Linde\n\nPresident & Director, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nThanks, Owen. Good morning, everybody. Hope you all had a good new year. I'm going to focus my remarks this morning on our leasing activity. As was evident in the second press release we sent out last night, our leasing activity press release. So we had a pretty strong fourth quarter with activities spread around Boston, New York, San Francisco and the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. region. We ended the year with an occupancy pickup of about 40 basis points.\nAs we sit here today, at the end of January, we have signed leases for our in-service portfolio that have yet to commence, so they're not in our occupancy figures of more than 925,000 square feet. That 925,000 square feet represents an additional 180 basis points of potential occupancy increase and includes about 115,000 square feet of 2023 commencement, so the majority of it is 2022. We began 2022 with over 1.4 million square feet of leases in negotiation on space in the in-service portfolio. More than 425,000 covers currently vacant space and about 450,000 covers 2022 expirations.\nDuring '22, we have about 2.8 million square feet of expirations in the in-service portfolio. Over the last decade, total leasing for this company has ranged between 3.7 million square feet in 2020. So that's in the midst of the early pandemic and the economic shutdown, and over 7.7 million square feet in those years where we've signed some pretty large build-to-suit leases. Now it's true, some of the leasing we do each year encompasses early renewals, and we'll talk about some of that today, and leases on new developments, but a significant portion of the leasing we do each year is on near-term renewals and available space in the portfolio.\nSo with 2.8 million square feet of exposure 925,000 square feet of signed leases, 1.4 million in January of deals in the works, so over 2.35 million square feet, and with an annual expected leasing probably somewhere between 3.7 million and 7.7 million, we believe our occupancy is on an upward trajectory as we enter '22. The second-generation statistics this quarter married a little granular explanation. San Francisco is flat due to a 50,000 square foot lease down at our North First project, where we are doing short-term deals with kick-outs to allow us the flexibility to commence construction on the station project. The EC leases, so our CBD portfolio had a roll-up of 13% if you take out that 50,000 square footage.\nIn New York City, we terminated a lease with Citibank and went direct with their subtenant, which is operating a conference center. The new rent for that floor is discounted, but Citi made us whole through a cash termination payment. Excluding that, New York City had a 5% roll up. Now there's no question that Omicron, and the wave that hit us in November, slowed some return to office states. However, none of the leases that we have in negotiation have been delayed or impacted by a change in our customers' need for space. With the -- while the month of December and the first 2 weeks of January were slow, our leasing teams have had a very busy few weeks with more signed LOIs and more active discussions.\nI would note that the vast majority of those conversations in our CBD locations have continued to be from the financial services and professional services sectors, and that variable may be due to the function of the space that we actually have available in our portfolio. The only area of our business where we've seen a slight Omicron blip is on parking revenue. Transient collections are down modestly from our forecast for the month of January, and we haven't quite achieved the same anticipated pickup that we thought we would in monthly permits. But we believe that this will be short-lived, and we'll start to see our projections turn in February.\nI want to provide a few observations about our regional activities, and let's start with suburban Boston Life Sciences. We broke ground on our 880 Winter Street 243,000 square foot lab conversion in July of 2021, 7 months ago. We've signed leases for 165,000 square feet, and we are in negotiation for all of the remaining lab space. The first tenant is expected to occupy during the back half of 2022. Net rents are up 20% from our initial underwriting in March of 2021.\nAt 180 CityPoint, we're negotiating a lease for about 50% of the new 329,000 square foot building. [Steel Orexin] hasn't started yet and it's hoped -- we're expecting it's going to start next month, and we're hopeful to deliver the space in the fourth quarter of '23. And -- but the leasing set that demonstrates what's going on in the market. We are eagerly awaiting the November expiration of our leases in the second avenue buildings we purchased last June where we can offer 140,000 square feet of lab space, and expect a significant roll-up in rents.\nWith demand continuing to outpace supply, we will commence construction, as Owen said, on another 113,000 square feet at City Point which is in our supplemental, we're calling a 103 CityPoint, very clever. Construction drawings are complete, and we expect to break ground this quarter with a late 2024 delivery there.\nNow our traditional Route 128 office leasing is also extremely busy. There is office demand out there. This quarter, we agreed to recapture and re-lease 1265 Main Street, a 120,000 square foot office building at CityPoint in Waltham. We completed a 10-year lease as is with a 21% increase in the net rent. At 140 Kendrick Street in Needham, we've announced Wellington's commitment to lease 105,000 square feet, and we found a way to reposition the building as a net-zero installation, which was extremely important to both BXP and Wellington.\nIn addition, we have commitments for 2 other tenants for the remaining 80,000 square feet of this project, which is currently under lease, and expires in November of '22. And finally, we're working on another 73,000 square foot early recapture and backfill at our CityPoint complex. This totals 378,000 square feet of traditional suburban office leases. These transactions will have rent roll-ups between 7% and 40% on a cash basis.\nOur CBD Boston activity this quarter was primarily small transactions. We completed 12 deals for 80,000 square feet. The average markup was 17% on a cash basis. At the moment, there are a few large office requirements in the Boston CBD, and there is going to be new construction deliveries in 2023. Our largest block of CBD space and exposure is at 100 Federal Street where we'll be getting back 150,000 square feet in early '23. In New York City during the quarter, we had activity across the portfolio. We executed a full floor lease at Dock 72. We completed 108,000 square foot lease at Times Square Tower. We completed more than 180,000 square feet of leases at 601 Lex; 42,000 square feet at 250 West 55th; 89,000 at the General Motors Building; and over 120,000 square feet in Princeton. The individual mark-to-market in New York vary greatly.\nYou'll recall the single floor I called out last quarter, which really retarded our statistics where the rent went down by 50%. Well, we signed that 15-year lease extension for that floor, and the rent is now up 71% on a cash basis. The leases we completed at the Journal Motors building were flat, while the leases at 250 West 55th Street range from up 2% to down 19% on a cash basis. Our current activity in New York continues to be strong. We have multi-floor lease negotiations underway at GM, 601 Lex and 510 Madison along with a number of smaller transactions in those buildings. Total activity is in excess of 525,000 square feet.\nAs Owen discussed, we completed the purchase of 360 Park Avenue South. We are working to complete our base building system modification plans as well as our amenities program. And even though we haven't formally begun to market the asset, we have been responding to inquiries and tours. Physical construction work will commence during the month of February, so in a couple of weeks. In the San Francisco CBD, large tech demand has largely been absent from the market, other than companies upgrading their space throughout opportunistic sublet space at buildings like our 680 Folsom, the Macy's and the Riverbend subleases and at 350 Mission, the sales force sublet. The bulk of the activity on a direct basis has been in the financial district, and it has been confined to the better buildings with professional services and financial firms.\nWe went out on a [limb] this quarter, and we asked John Chicony and his team from CBRE, who does work for us, to segment the premier buildings in the city. People can debate whether it's the perfect list or not, but it totaled 20 million square feet or about 23% of the market and includes our entire CBD portfolio. The current vacancy in this portfolio of 20 million square feet is 5.3%. And if you add sublet space, it grows to about 8%. Now I've made the point before, but you can't simply look at the overall market availability statistics and make assumptions about where rents and concessions might be in this market. We completed 112,000 square feet of CBD deals this quarter. And our cash rents increased by 7% with an average starting rent of $103 a square foot. Similar to our lab success in Boston, our venture with ARE successfully executed a full building lab lease 751 Gateway in South San Francisco. The venture intends to commence the conversion of 651 Gateway to a life science building over the next few months. The advantage for this project is time to delivery relative to a new building where we can achieve 6 months off versus ground-up construction.\nLast quarter, I described our efforts to gauge pricing as we consider the restart of Platform 16 in San Jose. Our total base building construction costs increased just over 13% relative to the pricing we had 24 months ago. We continue to see meaningful cost increases and material availability issues across all trades in all of our markets. As an example, the lead time on base building mechanical systems, once you have approved drawings, has doubled from 20 weeks to 40 weeks, which means you have to make decisions much earlier in a construction schedule or risk delays. We're doing that. The Class A Silicon Valley leasing markets had a particularly strong 2021 with a very healthy net absorption. And just last week, we got into another 500,000 square foot office tenant expansion, not one of what we refer to as the tech titans in the Northern Peninsula. And Platform 16, if we start, won't deliver until early 2025.\nI'm going to finish my remarks this morning on Greater Washington. During the fourth quarter, we completed 11 office leases in Reston, totaling over 140,000 square feet. Every deal was on previously vacant space. Rents have held firm in the low 50s with 2.5% annual bumps to the low 60s with similar bumps for our new project at RTC Next. The first phase of RTC (inaudible) has been delivered to Fannie Mae, as Owen described, and we completed our first nonanchor lease during the quarter. This project is 85% leased. It is transformative to the Reston Skyline, and it's a 5-minute walk to the heart of the Town Center Retail, where we completed over 60,000 square feet of retail leasing, again with new tenants on currently vacant space.\nIn the district, we continue to chip away at our current availability with our JV assets with about 100,000 square feet of leasing. We've delivered 2,100 pen to our anchor tenant for their tenant improvements, and we're working on filling the remainder of that building. In Boston, in the New York and in the metropolitan D.C. area, we have seen a swift reduction in COVID-related cases. Our daily tenant activity is starting to rise again. Employers continue to search for new employees.\nTo circle back to Owen's comments about quality, employers are going to want to use their physical space to encourage their teams to be together. Our mantra has been to create great places and great spaces to allow our customers to use space as a way to attract and retain their talent. If you believe that employees may be spending less time in their office, it's even more important to have the right space and place when they are here.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael E. LaBelle\n\nExecutive VP, Treasurer & CFO, Boston Properties, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. So this morning, I plan to cover the details of our fourth quarter performance and the changes to our 2022 earnings guidance. For the fourth quarter, we announced funds from operations of $1.55 per share, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.05 per share, and was $0.03 per share above consensus estimates. The performance of our portfolio drove $0.04 of the improvement and higher-than-projected management and development fees added Ascent.\nI would place the portfolio outperformance in 4 buckets. First, income from earlier-than-anticipated leasing, particularly in San Francisco and Reston. In San Francisco, we executed 2 10-year renewals, aggregating 65,000 square feet at a significant pickup in rent, and several smaller new leases with immediate delivery. And in Reston, we signed a 90,000 square foot new lease with a technology company with space delivery on lease signing. We also collected payments from several tenants on receivables that we had written off in 2020.\nSecond, we achieved higher service income due to an increase in utilization from better physical occupancy in New York City during the quarter. Just prior to the impact of the Omicron variant, our New York City portfolio census was running close to 70%, which represented a big pickup from the third quarter. Third, we experienced stronger parking revenue and hotel performance. Parking revenue totaled $23 million for the quarter, up 8% from the third quarter. It's now running at 82% of its pre-pandemic rate. So that means there's an incremental $20 million or $0.11 per share on an annual basis. We should be able to recapture to reach prior levels. Our hotel operated at 50% occupancy during the quarter. For the full year 2021, it operated just above breakeven, only contributing $600,000 to our FFO. This compares to its contribution in 2019 of $15 million, a difference of $0.08 per share that we should recover in the next couple of years.\nAnd fourth, we recognized income from the delivery of the 733,000 square foot Marriott World headquarters development, a month earlier than we anticipated. In addition to delivering it early, our costs came in well below budget, so its investment return profile is exceeding our expectations as well. The last item I would like to mention about the quarter is a reminder that as we guided last quarter, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.25 per share for the redemption of our $1 billion of 3.85% senior notes that were due to expire in early 2023.\nWe funded the redemption with an $850 million, 2.45% senior notes issuance in the third quarter. This was an opportunistic trade due to our view that interest rates were likely climbing. We feel good about our decision as rates have increased by about 50 basis points since we locked in at a 1.3% 10-year treasury rate. We made a similar decision with our $1 billion mortgage refinancing on 601 Lexington Avenue that we closed this quarter at a 2.79% coupon for 10 years. The underlying loan carried an interest rate of 4.75% and was not expiring until April of 2022, but we had the opportunity to pay it off with no penalty, starting in December of '21. We closed it on the first day available, and priced off a 1.48% 10-year treasury rate, again, significantly lower than current rates. Despite increasing the mortgage by approximately $400 million, we will see lower interest expense due to the 200 basis point reduction in the overall coupon. And as Owen mentioned, we now have limited debt expirations over the next couple of years.\nNow I'd like to turn to 2022. Doug described the leasing activity we are seeing heading into the year, which adds to the confidence we have in our growth profile. As a result, we're increasing our FFO guidance range to $7.30 to $7.45 per share for 2022. Our new midpoint is $7.38 per share, and it's $0.03 higher than last quarter. The increase is coming from higher projected contribution from the in-service portfolio as well as higher anticipated development fee income. You will notice that we brought down our same-property NOI growth by 25 basis points this quarter, which might appear inconsistent with an increase in our guidance. The reduction is primarily due to the stronger performance we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2021, which increased our starting point. This includes the earlier-than-projected leasing in Q4 that is reflected in our higher occupancy, onetime cash receipts from our collections and higher-than-expected service income, where our future projections are more conservative.\nIn addition, Doug described 2 lease recaptures in our suburban Boston portfolio, where we have new tenants coming in at higher rents, but we will have some downtime between leases. The rent during the downtime is being covered by the exiting tenants, but that's recognized as termination income, which is excluded from our same property income. All of these are positive results.\nWe only brought down the top end of the range. So in effect, the bottom end is actually higher. Our new assumption for 2022 same-property NOI growth is 2% to 3% from 2021. We also reduced our assumption for 2022 cash same-property NOI growth, and our new range is 5% to 6%, which represents strong growth year-over-year. The only other meaningful change to our guidance is an increase in our assumption for development fee revenue to $24 million to $30 million, an increase of $2 million. The improvement relates to additions to our development pipeline at 651 Gateway and 360 Park Avenue South. Overall, we continue to project strong FFO growth of more than 12% in 2022 from 2021 at the midpoint of our range.\nWe expect our near-term growth to come primarily from delivering new office and life science developments and our 2021 acquisition program. These are expected to add an incremental $0.43 per share or 6.5% to our 2022 FFO at the midpoint. Our guidance does not assume any new acquisitions in 2022. We also project a benefit from our well-timed refinancing activity last year, resulting in $0.35 per share of lower interest expense and debt extinguishment costs in 2022 at the midpoint of our range.\nFor the first quarter of 2022, we're providing guidance for funds from operations of $1.72 to $1.74 per share. As a reminder, our first quarter results are always lower due to the timing associated with stock vesting and payroll taxes plus the seasonality of our hotel. In summary, we remain confident in the growth trajectory of our business. We're seeing strong leasing activity in our portfolio that we expect to result in occupancy and income gains in 2022 and 2023. And in addition to the $2.5 billion of existing development we have underway, that we will deliver over the next 2 years, we have numerous sites under ownership where we're working towards new starts in the coming months.\nThat completes our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the lines to questions?"
